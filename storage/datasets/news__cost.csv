3796,225311,COST,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Roche  Royal Dutch Shell  Citigroup  UnitedHealth And Costco Wholesale,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 22  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Roche Holding   OTC RHHBY    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa    Citigroup   NYSE C    UnitedHealth   NYSE UNH   and Costco Wholesale   NYSE C   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Top Stock Research Reports for Roche  Royal Dutch Shell and CitigroupThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Roche Holding  Royal Dutch Shell and Citigroup  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see all of today s research reports here    Roche s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year   31 7  vs   15 1    primarily reflecting solid sales of new drugs  Strong growth of Ocrevus  Perjeta  Tecentriq and Hemlibra countered biosimilar competition in Europe for Herceptin and MabThera  Particularly  MS drug Ocrevus witnessed strong growth on increased demand Roche s dominant position in the breast cancer space continues to boost performance further  Also  label expansion of Tecentriq into additional indications is a positive  The recent Spark acquisition will boost Roche s presence in the gene therapy space However  most of the legacy drugs are facing competition  Pipeline setbacks and biosimilar competition are concerns as well  Additionally  the persistent delay in the Spark acquisition is disappointing  Shares of Royal Dutch Shell have lost  9 6  in the past six months against the Zacks Integrated Oil industry s decline of  7 1   primarily reflecting the tough commodity price backdrop  These are undoubtedly difficult times for the oil industry  but Shell is doing as good a job as any  It reported better than expected September quarter results and we will likely see similar outperformance as the company reports Q4 results towards the end of this month  The Anglo Dutch company s position as a key supplier of liquefied natural gas should further benefit its long term cash flow growth on the back of attractive growth opportunities  Moreover  its dividend is safe and secure  However  there are worries over drop in its cash flow excluding working capital while the company s poor reserve replacement ratio raises concerns about future production Moreover  Shell s  1 7  2 3 billion impairment charge is expected to increase gearing  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point Citigroup sshares have gained  11 8  over the past three months against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s rise of  7 4   The Zacks analyst believes that net interest revenues will likely be supported by loan growth and mix  despite low rates in the days ahead  Also  the company s steady capital deployment activities are also commendable The company has an impressive earnings surprise history  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters  The company s fourth quarter 2019 results reflected higher revenues and loans  partly offset by rise in expenses and cost of credit Citigroup s streamlining efforts  along with strategic investments in core business  bode well for the long term  However  pending litigation issues might keep legal expenses elevated  Additionally  decline in equity market revenues and volatile underwriting business are concerns for the company Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UnitedHealth and Costco Wholesale More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all

3797,225312,COST,JD com  American Eagle Outfitters  Dick s Sporting Goods  Dollar General And Ross Stores Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 6  2020    Shares of JD com   NASDAQ JD   as the Bull of the Day  American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS    Dollar General   NYSE DG   and Ross Stores   NASDAQ ROST   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  In case nobody has said anything to you about it  chill out  We are not on the brink of World War III  It makes for a great headline and fantastic click bait  But emotionally driven headlines and articles never made any investor a dime  It s usually the ones that manage their emotions the best which end up finding their way to profits  While the weekend brough its share of gloom and doom  I m here to bring a little bit of sunshine to your Monday morning It may seem like a bold statement to come out and give you a Bull of the Day ahead of Monday s open  but on the contrary  it could be the perfect time to load into a stock like this  I m talking about a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   JD com  For the uninitiated  JD com operates as an e commerce company and retail infrastructure service provider in the People s Republic of China  It operates in two segments  JD Retail and New Businesses  If Alibaba  NYSE BABA  is the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  of China  then consider JD as the eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   JD is also arguably Alibaba s largest competitor The most obvious reason to investigate a stock like JD com is the easing of tensions between the US and China  The trade war has raged on for many months but the last few weeks have seen vast improvement  Phase One is done and now the superpowers are looking forward to the next round of talks and the next agreement  This obviously bodes well for oversold Chinese stocks The other big reason for taking a closer look here is the recent earnings estimate revisions coming in to the upside  Over the last thirty days  analysts have really been pushing up their earnings estimates for the stock  Current year estimates have risen from 95 cents to  1 06 for the current year  while next year s number has popped up from  1 22 to  1 47 Those bullish earnings estimate revisions  along with easing of tensions between the US and China  have helped move the stock along nicely  JD com traded under  28 in early October  Since then  the stock has staged a dramatic rally  closing a penny shy of  38 into the closing bell last Friday  That s a move of over 35  in about three months  I am not going to sit up here and preach Armageddon like the talking heads did all weekend  The US economy is still rocking and rolling  the trade war with China is easing  and we ve got a big round of earnings ahead of us  In short  there are plenty of reasons to be bullish  Like most news events nowadays  this US Iran story is getting blown way out of proportion  The 24 hour news cycle would have it no other way  To kickoff the week  investors should be out there looking for bargains  That doesn t mean we should fall into value traps  In fact  I have a name to be careful of heading into That name is today s Bear of the Day  American Eagle Outfitters  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc  operates as a specialty retailer that provides clothing  accessories  and personal care products under the American Eagle and Aerie brands  The company also provides jeans  and other apparel and accessories for men and women  and intimates  activewear  and swim collections  as well as personal care products for women  In addition  it offers sports apparel under the Tailgate brand  and menswear products under the Todd Snyder New York brand name  As of March 6  2019  it operated approximately 934 American Eagle stores  262 Aerie stores  5 Tailgate stand alone stores  and 1 Todd Snyder stand alone store in the United States  Canada  Mexico  China  and Hong KongCurrently  American Eagle Outfitters is a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The reason for the negative Zacks Rank lies in the estimate revisions coming from analysts all over Wall Street  Despite the Retail Industry being in the Top 22  of our Zacks Industry Rank  American Eagle Outfitters has seen nine analysts drop their estimates for the current year  while eight have done so for next year  The move has dropped our current year Zacks Consensus Estimate from  1 59 to  1 47 while next year s number has come down from  1 65 to  1 48  That sort of contraction means there s only a very small margin of growth from this year to next year Additional content 3 Retail Stocks to Buy in JanuaryLast year  retail stocks like Target  NYSE TGT   Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Costco  NASDAQ COST  all put together strong performances that bolstered the health of the broader sector  Let s take a look at a few retail stocks that can follow in these footsteps in the upcoming year Dick s Sporting Goodsis a retailer that put together a strong performance in 2019 as it revamped its business  The company is coming off a third quarter where it saw its net revenue grow 5 6  to  1 96 billion on a 6  surge in comparable store sales  The firm is trying to remake itself into an all seasons retailer that can resonate with consumers no matter the weather In addition  the company has brought in a variety of merchandise to displace its hunting category  which it has vowed to wean itself off of  As the popularity of its private label merchandise picks up  this could bring extended success to the firm in the new year Our Q4 consensus estimates forecast earnings to increase 13  to  1 21 per share and for sales to grow 2 8  to  2 56 billion  Dick s has had its earnings estimates revised higher  helping earn DKS stock a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Dollar Generalis a discount retailer coming off a strong 2019 where its shares rose over 44   The company has big plans for 2020  it plans to get on the CBD bandwagon  Dollar General announced that it intends to start selling products infused with cannabidiol in 1 100 stores across seven states by spring 2020  The retail market is expected to be the biggest contributor to CBD s forecasted  20 billion in sales by 2024  which could make this decision a lucrative one In the firm s latest earnings release  it announced its plans for fiscal 2020  which includes 1 000 new store openings  1 500 mature store remodels  and 80 store relocations  Dollar General is looking to capitalize on its strong performance in 2019  which could lead to another breakout performance in the new year  Our Q4 estimates project a bottom line hike of 9 78  to  2 02 per share and a top line rally of 7 46  to  7 15 billion  DG currently sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Ross Storesis another retailer that is looking to keep its momentum going in the new year  Ross shares rose over 40  in 2019  which was capped off by the firm s third quarter performance  The firm saw its net revenue rise 8   which was driven by a 5  jump in comparable store sales  The company also lifted guidance for full year earnings per share to the range of  4 52 to  4 57 from  4 41 to  4 50 While many other retailers have struggled to survive in the new digitally driven landscape  Ross has actually expanded its brick and mortar footprint  Our Q4 consensus estimates call for earnings to rise over 4  to  1 25 per share and for net revenue to reach  4 37 billion for a 6 42  gain  Ross has surpassed our earnings estimates the past four quarters with an average EPS surprise of 3 77   The company s estimate revisions have trended higher  earning its stock a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released

143658,365173,COST,Costco Stock  Next Stop   335 ,news,"Costco  NASDAQ COST  investors are sitting pretty with shares of the warehouse club operator kicking off the abridged trading week less than 1  away from taking out its all time highs  but one Wall Street pro is aiming even higher  Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer is upgrading the stock from perform to outperform  singling Costco out again as a top pick 
Parikh is also boosting his price target on Costco stock from  300 to  335  The upside of the new goal might not seem like much at current levels    it s only 10  of near term upside off of Friday s close    but it s actually the Street high among his fellow analysts  Wall Street has historically seen Costco as a slow yet steady performer  so it s not a surprise that the highest of the market s price targets is relatively low  High floors often result in low ceilings 

It all checks out
The rub with the surprisingly low Street high is that Costco was driving in the passing lane through most of last year  The stock soared 44  in 2019  handily beating the market  An upgrade is still an upgrade  but either Wall Street is slow in catching up to the buoyant share price or the market s being cautious after a year in which the stock gains overshot the improving fundamentals 
Costco is in great shape these days  Revenue rose 8  in fiscal 2019  fueled by a 5  uptick in comps  Store traffic growth is accelerating  a welcome sight for folks worried about e commerce eating into bricks and mortar sales at many traditional retail chains  Costco isn t necessarily asleep at the wheel when it comes to e tail  though  Online sales growth is slightly outpacing in store gains  but it remains a small part of the overall business 
The 785 warehouse chain reported reasonable financial results for its fiscal first quarter last month  Net sales and comps slowed slightly from the pace it established in fiscal 2019  but Costco is still growing in popularity as a concept  Renewal rates continue to clock in above 90   and the investment remains a market darling among food stocks with its all weather appeal  Costco has landed ahead of Wall Street s profit estimates in each of the past four quarters 
Oppenheimer s Parikh realizes that his new  335 price target on Costco stock isn t going to get temperatures rising in the growth investing camp  He sees limited upside for the food retailing universe  However  he does feel that Costco will deliver better returns than its peers 
Costco regained some of its racing stripes earlier this month when it posted accelerating comps and double digit net sales and e commerce gains for the month of December  The stock is unlikely to match the 44  pop it came through with last year  but it won t be a surprise of other Wall Street pros bump their price targets even higher than where Parikh is now as the shares approach the  335 mark ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkwmv,2064007

143689,365204,COST,Costco in Caracas  how Florida goods flood Venezuelan stores,news,"By Shaylim Valderrama and Sarah Kinosian CARACAS MIAMI  Reuters    While U S  President Donald Trump wants to drive Venezuela s socialist ruler out of power with economic sanctions  there has in fact been a burgeoning influx of American bought goods from Nutella spread to Oreo cookies   Many toiletries  food items and other imports became impossible to find during Venezuela s economic implosion under President Nicolas Maduro  Yet now they line the shelves in scores of new U S  dollar only shops known as  bodegones   providing an unlikely safety valve for Maduro  The reason  Venezuelan businessmen have taken advantage of his government s quiet abandonment of price  currency and import controls to buy direct from U S  wholesalers including Costco  O COST  and Walmart  N WMT   The goods are delivered to Florida based door to door services run by Venezuelans  according to 11 interviews with customs agents  operators and businessmen  The products move in bulk via shipping companies with bases in south Florida who have this year enjoyed a 100  exemption of import duties and waiver of some paperwork at the Venezuelan end  the sources added   Everything our customers want from the United Sates  we ve managed to offer here   enthused Hector Mambel  who runs a  bodegon  in Puerto Cabello port with a  Mini Walmart  sign outside using the same design as the U S  giant he buys from  The shift shows how Venezuela s economy is evolving to survive sanctions that have hit oil exports   The trade from Florida does not violate Trump s sanctions because they target business with Maduro s government not with private entrepreneurs  It has  however  bemused some Venezuelans used to constant  anti imperialist  rhetoric   I don t understand this government that speaks ill of the  gringos  and yet we now see U S  products abound in stores and everything is in dollars   said teacher Ligia Martinez  38  holding a bag with purchases of cereal  tuna and cake mix  She bought the goods at a  bodegon  in the city of Valencia with dollar remittances sent from family abroad  It was only last year  as the local bolivar currency depreciated precipitously amid hyperinflation  that Maduro lifted a longstanding prohibition on dollar transactions  Though the goods in the corner shops are out of reach for most bolivar earning Venezuelans  a well heeled elite with dollars makes for a viable business in indulgence products   I SELL EVERYTHING  The  bodegones  are reminiscent of the dollar only stores communist Cuba ran for foreigners in the 1990s  Reuters found 120 new such stores in Caracas alone  primarily in middle class areas  outnumbering the 27 bolivar supermarkets in those areas  Competition has brought down the price of niche market items such as boutique hair products  The abundance on shelves contrasts with years of scarcity of basics from shampoo to milk borne out of socialist regulations that often forced merchants to sell below cost   Bodegon  owners often buy online or partner with door to door services who scour chains for knock down prices    Our customers ask us to buy at Costco or  Walmart affiliate  Sam s Club in the United States and we import what they ask for them   said an operator of a shipping company that brings supplies from Miami to Caracas   At least half of the stores Reuters visited sold products from Members Mark  which is Sam s Club s private brand  and Costco s Kirkland brand  Popular items include pancake mix  Pringles  ketchup and cereal  often selling for double or more their U S  price  Some of the  bodegones  buy from wholesale importers  meaning they have to hike prices further for margins  so pancake mix for  6 50 or thereabouts in Costco goes for  14 to  20 in Venezuela depending on how many hands it has been through  Some Venezuelans offer imports direct via Instagram    Everything I bring from Miami  I sell   said one small online merchant  noting his compatriots  love of foreign goods   There s more competition these days  but it s still good business because Venezuelans are snobbish   Costco declined to comment  while Walmart did not respond to a request  Venezuela s Information Ministry  tax authority and state port agency also did not respond to requests for comment  Asked for its view of the trade  given the underlying aim of sanctions  the U S  Treasury Department did not respond  This year s waiver of import duties and some documentation has been a boon to businessmen  used to crippling bureaucracy and regulations for years   These imports move with ease  everything is exempted   said one trader  who brings in products at La Guaira port outside Caracas  The exemptions expire this month but may be extended  Felipe Capozzolo  head of Consecomercio chamber of commerce  said the  bodegones  had become an unofficial part of  state policy  to enable Venezuela to stay supplied under sanctions and thus ease pressure on the government  Maduro himself acknowledged the help from dollar transactions  saying last month they were an  escape valve  for the suffering economy   I don t view it badly     this process they call  dollarization    he said   Though data has for years been scarce in Venezuela  local think tank Econalitica estimated that in October a remarkable 54  of

143692,365207,COST,Costco Keeps Rolling Through the Holidays,news,"Costco  NASDAQ COST  is a consumer staples retailer  with most of its sales occurring in routine shopping categories like groceries and fresh foods  That differentiates it from Amazon  which gets the majority of its revenue from discretionary items like consumer electronics  The warehouse giant also gets most of its earnings from membership sales rather than product markups  which makes it operate more like a club than a traditional retailer 
Those two factors mean that the holiday shopping period isn t as much of a make or break moment for Costco as it is for many retailers  Yet that season is still important to Costco s annual results  so investors look forward to the retailer s December sales update each year 
That report came on Wednesday  and it points to continued positive momentum for the warehouse retailing leader 

Growing strong
Sales for the five weeks that ended on Jan  5 jumped 10 5  to  17 04 billion  management revealed  After adjusting for new store openings and volatile price changes on gasoline  that growth figure landed at 7 8   That s well above the 5  that Costco reported for its most recent full quarter and far higher than the 3  comps that peers like Walmart have been posting 
Investors can t conclude that Costco is running away with all the holiday sales growth  though  A quirk of the calendar pushed the high volume shopping period around Black Friday a week later this year  and executives estimate that this move had a significant positive impact on reported sales in December  In fact  20 percentage points of Costco s blistering 43  e commerce growth likely came from the calendar shift  Likewise  the timing move pushed total sales and comparable store sales higher by a full percentage point 
Zooming out reveals a less eye popping growth figure that still translates into market share gains  Costco s adjusted comps are up 6 5  over the past 18 weeks in the U S  market  That figure stood at 5  for the fiscal first quarter  which ended right before Black Friday  In other words  it s a good bet that Costco improved on the impressive 3 4  customer traffic increase it logged in Q1 
What we don t know
The December sales update left some open questions around the latest business trends  including whether Costco had to sacrifice much profitability to achieve its impressive growth  Considering its gross profit margin is already well below peers  it s not likely that investors will be surprised to see a decline in that metric when the company reports its full quarterly earnings results 
The more important numbers to follow in subsequent releases will be around membership trends like renewal rates  the penetration of executive subscriptions  and new sign ups  Those official figures won t be revealed until Costco s second quarter report in early March 
Before then  investors will get to hear from management during the company s annual shareholder meeting in late January  That presentation will likely include management commentary about industry trends  as well as how fiscal 2020 is shaping up nearly halfway through the year  If this week s sales report is any indication  then shareholders can expect to hear mostly positive news from CEO Craig Jelinek and his team as Costco looks ahead to the second half of fiscal 2020 ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgtz4,2057442
143693,365208,COST,Why Costco Stock Rose 44  in 2019,news,"What happened
Costco  NASDAQ COST  shareholders outperformed a booming market last year as the stock jumped 44  compared to a 29  spike in the S P 500  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence 
Shares tracked ahead of the market for most of the year  but that gap widened through the final quarter of 2019 

So what
Costco benefited from ideal selling conditions in the wider retailing industry that lifted peers such as Walmart and Target to new highs  But  as usual  the warehouse giant outperformed nearly all of its competitors  Customer traffic jumped 4  in the fiscal fourth quarter to push comparable store sales up 5   which stacked up well against the 3  boosts that both Walmart and Target posted 
Now what
The consumer staples giant s first sales report of 2020 showed that its momentum has continued into the new year  Comparable store sales jumped 9  in December  in fact  although a significant portion of that surge came from a calendar shift that pushed Black Friday a week later this year  Still  the report raised expectations that Costco might announce more good news when it reports its fiscal second quarter results on March 5 ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phcyh,2057964
143694,365209,COST,Is Costco Stock a Buy ,news,"Retail giant Costco  NASDAQ COST  operates under the mission to  continually provide our members with quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices  
That simple strategy has rewarded Costco s shareholders handsomely  both recently and over the long run  The stock has delivered a 43  return over the past year  compared with a 26  gain for the S P 500 market index  The 186  gain of the S P 500 over the past 10 years works out to an average annual increase of 11   but Costco s stock quintupled over the same period for an average gain of 17 5  per year 
Has Costco burned all of its rocket fuel or is the warehouse club still a great investment 
Sky high valuation
Costco s stock is not trading at  the lowest possible prices  nowadays  These shares fetch a princely valuation of 36 times trailing earnings or 40 times free cash flows  That s expensive compared to industry peers such as Walmart  NYSE WMT  or BJ s Wholesale Club Holdings  NYSE BJ   and also among the pricier ratios Costco has seen in recent years 

COST Normalized PE Ratio data by YCharts
Strong results
Those big gains were built on a rock solid financial foundation  Costco grew its top line sales faster than other major retailers in 2019  including a stellar 9  increase in same store revenues in December  Membership fees    which typically account for the vast majority of Costco s bottom line profits    increased by 6  to  804 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 
And this company won t get caught flat footed by the e commerce trend  Costco s own online sales are pulling their weight  and then some 
 Total online grocery continues to grow at a faster rate than the core e commerce comps  although again it s a still relatively small piece of the business   CFO Richard Galanti said in the first quarter earnings call   We also during the quarter launched as a test  in a few locations  same day prescription Rx delivery with Instacart  and we launched in the quarter same day alcohol delivery also through Instacart in California such that as of today  it s being offered in 12 states  
That doesn t mean Costco is ready to copy the online strategies of every other retailer without vetting each idea with thorough research 
 As it relates to buying online then pick up in store  we continue to look at what others do and continue to scratch our head   Galanti said   We look at it  but we re not at a point that we re planning to do anything with it  

The upshot  Costco is worth every penny in the long run
You know that time tested Warren Buffett adage    it s better to buy great companies at fair prices than betting on fair companies at great prices 
Costco is a great company and its stock deserves to trade at a premium to the broader market  There might be times when Costco s shares fly a bit closer to the ground  triggering an obvious buy in window during some random dip  but that s far from a sure thing  If you thought the stock looked expensive in the spring of 2015  after tripling the S P 500 s returns over the previous 52 weeks  you should consider that the stock has doubled in five years from the highest price recorded in that seemingly overheated spring 
Costco is a no brainer buy at nearly any price  including right now  Market timing is a guessing game at best  anyway ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pib4v,2059892
143696,365211,COST,Should You Pay for Amazon Prime and a Costco Membership ,news,"Both Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Costco  NASDAQ COST  market themselves as low cost shopping options for consumers  That s certainly true  but those deals come with a cost 
Joining Amazon Prime  which gets you unlimited free shipping  usually one day  sometimes two day   costs  119 per year  or  12 99 per month  Becoming a Costco member costs either  60 for a basic membership or  120 for an Executive membership that gets you 2  cash back  up to  1 000 per year  on most purchases 
Both companies have strong offers  but does it make sense for consumers to pay for both  The answer is somewhat complicated  and it s not the same for everyone 

Which is best for you 
A warehouse club  Costco offers bulk purchases  That means you generally have to buy fairly large quantities  and that requires having the space to store those items  Yes  you save money  Costco is generally cheaper than Amazon  according to a study by The Krazy Koupon Lady  but to get those savings  you have to make fairly large purchases 
Buying in bulk puts you at the risk of wasting some of your purchase  So  before you consider joining Costco  think about how you use the items you d buy  and look at expiration dates  It s great to save on batteries  cereal  or shampoo  but those savings are lost if you don t use what you buy before it goes bad 
Costco does  however  have a few edges over Amazon  The first    and one the online retailer can t easily equal    is that it has gas stations at many of its locations  In some cases  joining Costco can be justified just by how much you will save filling up at the chain s gas stations 
The warehouse club also has an edge in that its brick and mortar locations offer immediate gratification  If you want orange juice  you don t have to wait overnight  or even two hours for delivery  You can walk in  buy it  and drink it as you leave the store 
You could argue that this is a dwindling advantage  Amazon has stepped up its delivery game  It now offers one day shipping on plenty of items  and it delivers groceries through Whole Foods  which is more expensive than Costco  and its Amazon Fresh brand on a same day basis in much of the country 
Delivery and selection are generally edges for Amazon  You will pay a little more on comparable items compared to Costco  but the selection is tremendous  and next day delivery  even on Sundays  is very convenient 
Should you join both Amazon and Costco 
If simply saving money is your goal  then Costco makes the most sense  Shopping there requires planning  organization  and sometimes being willing to accept not getting exactly what you want 
Amazon offers a broader shopping experience at prices that are still a very good value  You can buy one roll of paper towels or a month s supply of Tide pods from the online retailer instead of being required to buy in bulk  You can also get the brand you want in a variety of sizes from Amazon 
Paying for Prime makes sense for people who shop reflexively  If you like to order things as you notice you need them  without having to think about quantities or expiration dates  then Amazon is likely for you  You will  of course  have to wait about a day to get your item  but that s not an issue for most purchases 
Many people might be a mix of the two types of shoppers described above  Perhaps you want to pay the lowest prices  but only when you can get exactly what you want  You may also simply not have the space to store lots of bulky items for use six months from now 
Avid shoppers who lack discipline would likely benefit from joining both Costco and Amazon  If you have to pick one  Amazon s selection probably makes it the best choice  but shopping smartly at either retailer likely saves the average family enough money to justify joining both ",2020-01-17,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pj9ke,2061864
143697,365212,COST,11 Reasons to Buy Costco Stock and Never Sell,news,"Costco  NASDAQ COST  has been a steady growth story  Even as the retail market has driven other chains out of business and forced major players to make huge investments in omnichannel  the warehouse club keeps moving steadily forward 
The company has shown that it s a force to be reckoned with and that it s more or less immune to what its rivals do  That makes Costco a stock you should put into your long term retirement portfolio  Here are 11 reasons to buy and hold its shares 

1  Costco sales keep rising
 Net sales for the quarter came in at  36 24 billion  a 5 6  increase over the  34 31 billion sold during the first quarter of last year   said CFO Richard Galanti during the chain s fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings call   Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in the U S  on a reported basis was 4 7   ex gas deflation  that was 5   
Costco keeps growing its business  with these numbers being fairly typical  Sales are not the chain s most important measure of success  but having them rise is a strong positive 
2  Costco membership keeps rising
Costco makes about 75  of its profit from selling memberships  Signing up more people drives the business  and those numbers have steadily increased 
 In terms of number of members at Q1 end  member households and total cardholders at Q4 end    back  I think  on Sept  1    we had 53 9 million member households at Q1 and 12 weeks later     54 7 million  And total cardholders increased from fiscal year end of 98 5 million to 99 9 million at Q1 end   Galanti said 
3  The chain keeps growing
While many retailers have been closing struggling locations  Costco has been steadily adding new warehouses  including in other countries  The numbers aren t huge    usually just a few new locations each quarter    but it s a steady pattern of growth 
4  Costco Executive memberships keep increasing
Costco sells two classes of membership  The higher end one  Executive  costs  120 a year and comes with 2  cashback on most purchases up to  1 000 per year 
 At Q1 end  paid executive memberships were     21 4 million  an increase of 579 000  or 48 000 per week since Q4 end   the CFO said 
5  The company can raise membership prices
The warehouse club has raised its membership price roughly every five years  The most recent increase in 2017 was modest     5 for basic membership and  10 for Executive members  Consumers shrugged off the higher prices  and the company steadily added members and maintained its renewal rates in the year after the increase 
6  Costco pays a dividend
It s always nice when an otherwise sound investment also pays you to own the stock  Costco has paid a growing quarterly dividend for nearly 20 years now  The company has been committed to returning capital to shareholders  and that should continue 
7  Costco has paid special dividends
The chain has paid three special dividends since 2012  Galanti has dropped some hints that Costco may do so again  which is an added bonus for shareholders 
8  Costco digital sales are growing
While Costco has not been a digital pioneer  it has added online options and expanded delivery  Galanti gave some color on that part of the company in his remarks 
 Total online grocery continues to grow at a faster rate than the core e commerce comps  although again it s a still relatively small piece of the business   he said   We also  during the quarter  launched as a test in a few locations  same day prescription delivery with Instacart  And we launched in the quarter same day alcohol delivery  also through Instacart in California     as of today  it s being offered in 12 states  
9  Costco has huge pricing power
Costco stocks a limited assortment of items and has a huge customer base  That gives it the power to squeeze vendors on the orders it makes in order to keep prices low 
10  Costco can own its supply chain
The warehouse club has traditionally sold its rotisserie chickens for  4 99  That s a very low price that has driven sales and traffic to its stores  To be able to hit that price point  the company actually cut out intermediaries by opening its own poultry farm 
11  Costco shopping is entertainment
Costco has the treasure hunt aspect that many consumers like  You never know what you ll find when you visit the chain  so people often stop by just to see what the deals are  which can lead to impulse purchases 
Even if customers choose not to buy anything  they still come into the store  That makes a membership feel even more valuable and encourages renewals 
A very solid brand
Costco has shown that its business model allows it to adapt as the market changes  It does not need to innovate  The chain can look at what customers want and slowly add services and or products as needed 
Having a loyal membership base fuels the entire business  and it gives Costco the freedom to put its money mostly into keeping prices low and rewarding shareholders  That s a recipe for long term success that seems stable and sustainable ",2020-01-17,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjaix,2061931
143714,365229,COST,William Ruckelshaus  who resigned in Watergate s  Saturday Night Massacre   dies at 87  U S  media,news," Reuters    William Ruckelshaus  picked by Richard Nixon as the first head of the U S  Environmental Protection Agency and as deputy attorney general before being fired for defying the president in the Watergate scandal  died on Wednesday at the age of 87  U S  media reported 
Ruckelshaus  a moderate Republican highly regarded for his integrity and seen as a white knight by the environmental community  died at his home in Seattle  according to the New York Times  citing his daughter Mary Ruckelshaus 
In what was known as the  Saturday Night Massacre  in October 1973  Ruckelshaus  then deputy attorney general  and his boss  Attorney General Elliot Richardson  resigned rather than carry out Nixon s order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox  who was pursuing recordings of conversations that eventually brought down Nixon s presidency 
Cox was fired by the solicitor general  Robert Bork  igniting an outcry over the Watergate scandal that eventually forced Nixon to resign in August 1974 rather than face removal from office by Congress 
 When you accept a presidential appointment  you must remind yourself there are lines over which you will not step   lines impossible to define in advance but nevertheless always present   Ruckelshaus said in a 2012 speech in Seattle   In this case  the line was bright and the decision was simple  
Ruckelshaus was the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency  created in 1970  He later noted that 16 major pieces of environmental legislation were enacted during Nixon s years in office  when visibly filthy air and water forced action 
 Citizens were demanding something be done and government was responding   he said 
The White House shifted Ruckelshaus in 1973 to acting director of the FBI and then deputy attorney general  plugging gaps as the Watergate scandal engulfed the Nixon administration 
Ruckelshaus returned to private law practice after leaving the Justice Department but in 1983 the Reagan administration brought him back to run the embattled EPA after the then administrator Anne Gorsuch and a number of her top aides resigned amid allegations of mismanagement and conflicts of interest 
Ruckelshaus was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom  the nation s highest civilian honor  by President Barack Obama in 2015  Obama said Ruckelshaus  spent his life putting country before party or politics  He reminds us how noble public service can be  And our air and water is cleaner and our lives are brighter because of him  
DOWNTRODDEN AGENCY
President Ronald Reagan   whose pro business  anti regulation administration was a bane of environmentalists   praised Ruckelshaus as  Mr  Clean  and said he would  mark a new beginning  at the downtrodden agency 
But the White House cut Ruckelshaus  requests for more money for the agency  and sided with industry against his efforts for stronger enforcement of the Superfund law to clean up toxic waste dumps  tighter controls on pollution causing acid rain and other regulations business and industry opposed 
He resigned from the agency in 1985 
In an essay in 1995 on the EPA s 25th anniversary  Ruckelshaus talked about the periodic beating the agency takes  with repeated attacks on its very existence 
 The anti environmental push of the  90s is prompted by the pro environmental excess of the late  80s  which was prompted by the anti environmental excess of the early eighties  which was prompted by the pro environmental excess of the  70s   he wrote 
Ruckelshaus  who lived in Seattle  stayed active on a number of boards and commissions  including the William D  Ruckelshaus Center at the University of Washington 
He served as chairman of the board of the World Resources Institute  special envoy to the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada and on the President s Council for Sustainable Development 
William Doyle Ruckelshaus was born July 24  1932 in Indianapolis  Indiana  and earned his undergraduate degree at Princeton University and his law degree at Harvard 
He practiced law in Indianapolis with the firm his family founded in 1895  then became Indiana s deputy attorney general  He was elected to the state s House of Representatives  where he was majority leader from 1967 to 1969  In 1968 he was the Republican nominee for the U S  Senate but lost to Democrat Birch Bayh 
Nixon tapped him in 1969 as assistant attorney general in charge of the U S  Justice Department s Civil Division  before putting him in charge of the EPA

Ambriola Co Inc s mammoth warehouse in West Caldwell  New Jersey  is crammed full of boxes and wheels of harder cheeses such as Parmigiano Reggiano  Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano   and more is coming  lots more  Phil Marfuggi  president and chief executive officer of Ambriola  a unit of Auricchio SpA  one of Italy s largest cheese producers  is among the many importers and shop owners across the country who are scrambling to stockpile European cheeses before new U S  tariffs kick in on Oct  18 in efforts to shield consumers from price hikes  The Trump administration on Wednesday slapped 25  tariffs on cheese and other European Union products ranging from whisky to woolens  in retaliation for EU subsidies on large aircraft  Both sides say they are open to negotiations  but trade experts see little chance of averting the duties   at least in the short run  Importers began ordering millions of dollars of extra wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano and other harder cheeses after the U S  Trade Representative s office in July added cheese to its list of EU products potentially facing tariffs due to the dispute over aircraft subsidies   When that list came out  that s when I     started bringing in many more containers of cheese of Reggiano  Provolone   said Marfuggi  who has another 21 shipping containers full of cheese en route to be added to the stockpile in the company s warehouse in Caldwell  which sits about 15 miles west of Manhattan  Marfuggi said he ordered an extra  15 million of cheeses that could be stored for over a year to ensure adequate supplies for existing customers and protect pricing through the end of the year    I ve been building up inventory     because we have a target on our backs   he said  The new duties could slash U S  imports of EU cheeses valued at  1 5 billion a year by 30  and jack up prices across the country  said Marfuggi  who also serves as president of the Cheese Importers Association of America  Some higher priced items will simply disappear from stores  he predicted  like Moliterno al Tartufo  an aged Italian cheese with an intense truffle flavor  Even Parmigiano Reggiano could be at risk if prices rose to  30 a pound  he said   There are going to be some items     that the supermarkets are just not going to handle anymore  It ll be price prohibitive for that   he said  The tariffs will hit consumer prices and eventually jobs across the United States  said Ralph Hoffman  executive vice president of Schuman Cheese  one of the largest importers of hard Italian cheeses   Over 20 000 U S  retail stores ranging from Costco Wholesale Corp  O COST  to Wegmans Food Markets sell EU cheeses  These cheeses generate some  3 5 billion of revenue for U S  companies  supporting some 20 000 jobs  including buyers  deli clerks  truck drivers and warehouse workers  Hoffman said  He noted that the new tariffs come on top of existing duties of around 15   Specialty grocer The Fresh Market expects the tariffs to affect about 35  of the 200 cheeses it carries at its 160 stores   We re waiting to see how the importers are going to pass the cost along   said Andrew Harvell  who heads the company s cheese department   Everything s still up in the air   he said  adding that Fresh Market had pre ordered enough cheese to last through the holiday season  but may need to raise prices soon thereafter  Mike Bowers  the third generation owner of a specialty cheese shop at Washington s storied Eastern Market  said he began hoarding extra wheels of hard cheeses   some weighing as much as 80 pounds   in July when USTR first announced it could impose tariffs on cheese and other agricultural goods  His glass cheese counters  coolers and large walk in refrigerator are filled to overflowing  but Bowers said his supplies will not last through the holiday season  He said he will have to pass on the cost of the tariffs   I m a small guy  I can t buy a  100 cheese and sell it for  50 and expect to stay in business too long   he said   I have a stockpile of cheese to make sure that I m able to maintain inventory and maintain sales at my counter   Bowers said   And then as time goes on  we ll have to see   He said the quality of U S  cheeses was improving  providing good alternatives for some popular European cheeses  but he would have to find ways to be more  innovative  in the future  He also has a solid selection on hand of Swiss cheeses that are not subject to EU tariffs  including a Gruyere style L Etivaz  made in copper pots according to ancient tradition  Marfuggi said it was a relief that USTR opted for 25  tariffs instead of the 100  rate initially proposed  but he worries that buyers would switch to domestic or other foreign supplies if the tariffs stayed in place a long time   If that happens  you re going to lose a considerable amount of consumer base  and it s hard to win that back   he said  And cheese hoarding cannot solve all the expected shortages  he warned  Many

143752,365267,COST,Don t Discount Costco s Chances in China,news," Bloomberg Opinion     China has been a graveyard for many foreign retailers  which frequently arrived with grand hopes only to pull back after years of debilitating struggle   Carrefour   PA CARR  SA  sold 80  of its operations in June after more than two decades in the country   Tesco   LON TSCO  Plc  folded its business into a joint venture in 2013  and Metro AG is  seeking a buyer for its Chinese unit  Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST   has more reason than most to believe it can buck the trend 
It s an inauspicious time to enter the world s second largest economy  Growth has slowed  and the trade war has made the environment less hospitable for overseas companies  China s plan to set up a corporate social credit system will raise compliance costs and could  put some firms out of business  the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said Wednesday  At the same time  online shopping is increasingly taking market share from bricks and mortar retailers  None of that stopped Costco s first Chinese outlet  in Shanghai  from being  mobbed on its opening Tuesday 
It s probably not a flash in the pan  opening day discounts notwithstanding  China s consumer markets are fickle and retail is viciously competitive  with razor thin margins  Still  Costco looks to have picked its niche carefully  The Shanghai outlet is in a suburban district  aiming to cater to car driving shoppers willing to load up with bulk items such as 30 pack boxes of cookies or 200 fluid ounce  6 liter  bottles of detergent  Selling in quantity helps enable the discounts that underpin Costco s appeal 
Such a model wouldn t work in the more built up central areas of Shanghai  where most people live in cramped apartments and take public transport  That needn t matter to Costco  though  as long as the U S  retailer can find enough suitable suburban markets  Costco s outlet in Shanghai s Minhang district has parking space for 1 200 cars  more than any other of its locations 
Membership is a key element of Costco s pitch to consumers  Being part of a fee paying club adds an aura of exclusivity that may play well with Chinese shoppers  particularly when the Shanghai store offers high end products such as Maine lobsters  bluefin tuna and Birkin bags  Costco was charging an introductory membership fee of 199 yuan   28  at Tuesday s opening  which will rise to 299 yuan 
Costco has already shown that it can export its warehouse model  building successful operations in Japan  Taiwan and South Korea  Revenue from international operations more than tripled in the past 10 years 
Sam s Club  a warehouse membership chain owned by Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  that s been in China for more than 20 years  gives cause for optimism on Costco s entry  Sam s Club has pushed upmarket by adding services such private dental clinics  for a higher membership fee  and aims to increase outlets in the country to 40 in 2020  from 23 at the start of this year  company executives told the China Daily in January  Chinese consumers have become increasingly willing to pay for better services in the past one to two years  Chen Zhiyu  senior vice president of Sam s Club China  was cited as saying 
Costco positions itself as a higher end shopping destination than Sam s Club  and has built a reputation for quality fresh food  That may be the company s best bulwark against the encroachment of internet operators  Venture capital money has been pouring into online grocers  as my colleague Shuli Ren  observed last month  Even so  most shoppers in China still like to touch or at least see their vegetables with their own eyes  Sam s Club drove a 4 7  surge in Walmart s China sales in its most recent quarter  thanks largely to fresh food sales 
Costco has had a five year online partnership with  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd  in China to market its flagship private label Kirkland  That s helped to build the company s name in China ahead of its entry to physical retail  A strategy that integrates the two may be critical to flourish in China s demanding retail landscape   In many parts of China  same day delivery really means same hour delivery   as Walmart observed in its 2019 annual report  The Sam s Club owner has a partnership with Chinese e commerce giant JD com Inc 
Shares of Costco rose 5  on Tuesday  the most since March  That may overstate the potential from a Chinese expansion that s likely to be modest and incremental  at least at first  But if Costco can thrive in China s current conditions  it should be there to stay ",2019-08-28,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dont-discount-costcos-chances-in-china-1965293,1965293
143753,365268,COST,Carrefour to open two Supeco discount stores in France,news,"By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS  Reuters     Carrefour   PA CARR  is launching two Supeco stores in northern France this month  Europe s largest food retailer said on Wednesday 
Supeco was launched by Carrefour in Spain in 2012 when Pascal Clouzard headed the Spanish business  Clouzard became Carrefour France boss in 2017 
Carrefour currently operates 23 Supeco stores in Spain  15 in Romania  two in Poland  and one in Italy 
The first French store will open in Valenciennes on Wednesday and a second will open on Sept  25 in Onnaing  it said 
 Carrefour is adapting Supeco to the French market to propose a model based on soft discount   the company said  referring to marketing that is less stripped down than full fledged cash and carry outlets 
The stores will offer bakery and butcher corners and more fresh products than a typical cash and carry store 
The French stores will offer about 2 000 products instead of 15 000 in a traditional Carrefour supermarket  at what the group says will be attractive prices 
Carrefour branded goods will make up the bulk of the food products to be offered 
Carrefour  which operates over 12 000 stores worldwide  including 5 200 in France  is in the midst of a five year restructuring plan to cut costs and boost performance 
It faces pressure in France from traditional rivals such Leclerc and from Amazon  O AMZN   as well as in the discount sector from Lidl  which has successfully changed its business model to expand its market share to nearly 6  
U S  warehouse club operator Costco  O COST  also opened its first warehouse in 2017 in Villebon Sur Yvette  near Paris  and plans more stores

143770,365285,COST,Unilever  Tesco  Nestle ranked top on meat alternatives  report,news,"By Siddharth Cavale
LONDON  Reuters     Unilever   L ULVR    Tesco   L TSCO  and Nestl   S NESN  are among the best prepared to capitalize on the trend for plant based meat substitutes  according to a report from an investor group managing  5 trillion in assets    
    The report by the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return  FAIRR  coalition showed 25 major retailers and manufacturers were developing strategies for sustainable protein products  recognizing the risk of a strategy reliant on animal protein 
     Many have now begun a journey to diversify the protein products away from being predominantly animal based  and towards low carbon and less resource intensive sources that are plant based   said Jeremy Coller  founder of FAIRR  which includes institutions such as UBS  S UBSG  and  Schroders   L SDR  
Unilever  Tesco and Nestle were awarded top rankings for their work in understanding the impact and reducing risks associated with intensive animal agriculture  such as the emission of greenhouse gas 
They were also among the firms that had strong sustainable sourcing programs and had targets to reduce emissions  said Aarti Ramachandran  FAIRR s head of research and engagement 
The report  titled  Appetite for Disruption   found 87  of retailers were increasing their own brand plant based products  while 64  of the 25 firms that FAIRR engaged with had referred to  vegan  and  plant based  in their annual reports 
The alternative protein market has taken off in part due to the inclusion of such products at global restaurant chains such as Burger King  TO QSR  and McDonalds Corp  N MCD   as well as the blockbuster listing of  Beyond Meat Inc   O BYND  
The alternative protein market is now valued at  19 5 billion and is expected to capture 10  of global meat market  the report said  citing research from  Barclays   LON BARC  and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   The market is expected to reach  100 billion in value in 15 years 
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Costco  NASDAQ COST  fared lower in the rankings and were described as  reactive  in part because of their limited work in sustainable sourcing of animal protein 
While manufacturers were expanding alternative protein portfolios  56  of those companies were responding to consumer demand rather than taking a more proactive approach 
 We can t tackle climate change     unless food companies more rapidly diversify their protein portfolios away from animal agriculture   Coller said 
Only four companies had undertaken a risk assessment to stress test the resilience of their protein supply chain  FAIRR s report said ",2019-07-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unilever-tesco-nestle-ranked-top-on-meat-alternatives-report-1933069,1933069
143771,365286,COST,U S  surfboard makers not so stoked about China tariffs,news,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    President Donald Trump s decision to slap 10  tariffs on imported surfboards convinced surf executive Sue Bowers to move factory jobs out of China   but not back to the United States  which was one goal of Trump s tariffs 
Strict environmental rules and steep labor costs have sent scores of Southern  NYSE SO  California surfboard manufacturers to China  Now  the tariffs have Bowers and other executives searching for factories in places such as Thailand and Vietnam 
 This was Surf City   said Bowers  general manager of Southern California Sports Industries in Orange County 
 I would like to have our production back here   said Bowers  whose office warehouse is decorated with surf legend Mike Doyle s artwork and filled with surfboards bearing his name 
Instead  Bowers   not a surfer herself but who learned the ins and outs of surfboard construction from Doyle   is joining the growing list of U S  manufacturers and retailers reconfiguring supply chains in the wake of the Trump s bitter trade war with China 
She was among a half dozen U S  surf company executives who told Reuters they support using trade policy to shelter their homegrown industry from a daunting wave of international competition 
They are skeptical  however  about the President s latest round of tariffs  which on Sept  1 will levy the first U S  import taxes on surfboards 
 There are way too many things that need to change before we can bring jobs back   said Bowers  referring to U S  labor costs and anti pollution rules governing the use of materials to make surfboards 
Trump delayed putting the 10  duty on cellphones  laptops and other consumer goods in hopes of blunting their impact on U S  holiday sales  But surfboards and many other products did not win a reprieve 
FORCES OF GLOBALIZATION
Southern California was surfing s epicenter in the late 1950s and early 1960s  spawning a billion dollar international business around surfing s relaxed  sun soaked lifestyle 
The forces of globalization that have eroded the industry were well underway by the turn of the century and the continuing manufacturing exodus threatens to wipe out domestic production 
 If something doesn t happen over the next 10 years  the industry  could cease to be here   said Shea Weber  chief executive of Dewey Weber International  a surfboard company started by his father   a famous long board  hot dogger  who appeared in the classic surf documentary  Endless Summer   Dewey Weber still has a factory in San Clemente  California s  surfboard alley  
2018 surfboard imports hit 916 246  up from 102 850 in 2004  when the U S  Census Bureau started collecting that trade data  Those imported surfboards now account for upwards of 90  of sales in the small and slow growing domestic market  experts said 
China accounted for 67 percent of the surfboards that hit U S  shores last year  Critics of Trump s tariffs say that focusing on just one country encourages manufacturers to move jobs to other Asian countries 
Countries like Thailand and Vietnam were already carving out niches on the high and low ends of the market with hourly factory wages that  according to Euromonitor International data  are roughly half that of China and as much as 19 times lower than in the United States 
California based Firewire  backed by surf superstar Kelly Slater  moved production of its  500 to  1 000 plus surfboards to Thailand after shuttering U S  manufacturing in 2008 
Taiwan has also edged into the market  building a cult following for its own Wavestorm surfboards that sell at Costco Warehouse Inc  O COST  and other mass market stores for as little as  99   a price far below what U S  producers can match 
Nicole Adams  who was testing a borrowed  200 Wavestorm on a recent Sunday in Venice Beach  is part of a new generation of surfers learning on those wide  soft boards

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on December 12  2019  Costco reported EPS of  1 73 versus consensus estimate of  1 7 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 78  
For the current fiscal year  Costco is expected to post earnings of  8 61 per share on  162 96 billion in revenues  This represents a 5 13  change in EPS on a 6 72  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  9 22 per share on  173 79 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 16  and 6 64   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Costco may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Costco has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 36 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 26 9X versus its peer group s average of 17 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 4 49  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Costco currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Costco fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Costco shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2020-01-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/costco-cost-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200500565,200500565

143821,365336,COST,Costco Is a Strong Company  but Stock Looks Overbought,news,"By Charley Blaine
Investing com   Numbers suggest Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST  stock is overbought 
Even with Tuesday s 0 8  dip  the stock is selling at 32x trailing 12 month earnings 
The technical indicators on Investing com rate the stock a sell  The consensus one year target price for the stock is  241 35 and that s lower than the current price 
Of 30 analysts tracked by Investing com  18 rate the stock a buy and the rest are neutral 
And it has had a terrific run up since the Christmas slump  rising 30  from its Dec  26 low to a 52 week high of  247 09 on Monday 
All that said  Costco has a long record of growing its business   142 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018   growing it profitably and growing it with a well paid workforce who buy the stock and tend to stay at the company for a long time 
Costco  with its big warehouses filled with a somewhat limited selection  is nonetheless the world s largest seller of choice and prime beef  organic foods  rotisserie chickens and wine 
Its auto buying program  where it matches buyers with local dealers who agree to limit their markups  resulted in 650 000 sales in 2018  up 25  from a year earlier  If Costco were an auto dealer  it would be one of the largest 
Prices are low in part because Costco has a built in profit center in the annual membership fees it charges customers  who typically renew every year 
As of March  the Issaquah  Wash  based company operated 770 warehouses in the United States  Canada  the United Kingdom  Australia  Mexico  Spain  France  Japan and South Korea 
And shareholders have done well  with a return of more than 14  a year   plus dividends   since the end of 2014 
When to get into Costco requires good timing because when Costco falls  it falls heavily  It dropped 42  in the turmoil in the year or so after the Sept  11  2001 terror attacks  49  in 2008 2009  the heart of the financial crisis  and nearly 23  from its top in September to the post Christmas bottom 
The last pullback was triggered in part because its first quarter earnings and revenue missed Wall Street estimates  But the shares recovered nicely in March after its second quarter earnings beat estimates  Some of the volatility may be due to the share ownership  Institutions own more than 73  of the stock 
Analysts polled by Investing com expect  1 82 in earnings for the third quarter on revenue of  34 6 billion  compared with  1 70 a share and sales of  32 4 billion a year ago  Earnings are due May 31 ",2019-04-09,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/costco-is-a-great-stock-but-buy-on-the-dips-1831669,1831669

Investing com   Yes  Amazon com apparently wants to start a supermarket chain  No  it isn t going to put  Kroger Co    one of the largest supermarket chains  out of business 
A Wall Street Journal report that Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  was looking to start a new brand of supermarkets in some of the largest markets sent Kroger  NYSE KR  shares down nearly 4 5  on Friday  The shares still haven t recovered 
Kroger is set to report earnings before U S  markets open Thursday  Analysts polled by Investing com expect the company to report earnings of 52 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter  down from 63 cents a year ago with revenue of  28 5 billion  down 8 3   The stock is up slightly in 2019 and was flat in 2018 after a 5  hit in the fourth quarter 
But Amazon isn t Kroger s biggest problem    yet  A huge problem  which has contributed to Kroger s 35  stock price decline since 2015  is that big chains are stepping all over one another  And there are other competitors like Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST  
Kroger is still big  It operates 2 765 stores nationally  plus a network of food processing plants  including 17 dairies and 10 deli bakery operations  Store brands generate more than a third of sales with higher profit margins  About 90  of grocery shopping is still done in stores  which are located to attract customers within a few miles 
But the art of surviving is painful  even for a company founded in 1883  Kroger abandoned 14 Kroger branded stores in the Raleigh Durham region in North Carolina last year 
And online and Amazon pose big challenges  Last year  the Food Marketing Institute projected online sales will account for 20  of grocery sales by 2025  with Amazon among the leaders 
Kroger isn t sitting still  Last year it bought a 5  stake in the UK s  Ocado Group   LON OCDO   a pioneer in online grocery delivery logistics  The companies will partner to build 20 warehouses focused purely on online delivery by 2020  The first are projected for Cincinnati  Houston  Louisville and Nashville 
Amazon is looking to start its chain  featuring everyday products  in major markets  the Journal said  with stores sized at about 35 000 square feet  That s about half the size of a typical Kroger store  but bigger than the typical store operated by the more upscale Amazon owned Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM

Here are the  average  annual  returns for the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   MDY  MidCap 400  and the RUT  Russell 2000  from January 1  1990 
What surprised me is that the  average  annual  return for each is still well below the  average  return for the S P 500  which I calculate at closer to 11  since the early 1970s 
In addition  the SPY is just now catching up to the Mid Cap 400  MDY   in terms of return  I would have thought the SPY would have outpaced the MDY by now 
This is simply one opinion  but I don t think investors will ever see 2008 again in our lifetime  It was the  Boomer  version of the Great Depression  with housing  credit markets  and the economy  and ultimately the stock market  all collapsing at once  Americans had never seen a national housing depression and an annual decline in home prices nationally   outside of local geographies from the late 1980 s S L Crisis   ever in the post WW II period

143853,365368,COST,Warren Buffett says Berkshire overpaid for Kraft Heinz,news,"By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan  Reuters    Warren Buffett said on Monday his Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc overpaid in the 2015 merger that created Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  Co  but he had no plans to flee the struggling packaged foods company  Buffett spoke four days after Kraft Heinz took a  15 4 billion writedown for its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and other assets  slashed its dividend  and said the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its accounting  Kraft Heinz s share price sank 27 5 percent on Friday  wiping out more than  16 billion of market value  and causing Berkshire to lose  4 3 billion on its stake  Berkshire owns 26 7 percent of Kraft Heinz   I was wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz   Buffett said on CNBC television   We overpaid for Kraft   Buffett did not say by how much Berkshire overpaid  but said the market reacted  probably quite properly  to the news  He also said he has  absolutely no intention  of adding to or subtracting from Berkshire s stake in Kraft Heinz  saying the company had  very  very strong  brands and that he would be happy to own it a decade from now  The comments were a rare admission of error by the 88 year old billionaire on a major investment at his Omaha  Nebraska based conglomerate  Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H J  Heinz  which they bought in 2013  and own about half of the merged company  Buffett said he may have learned about the SEC probe seven to 10 days before it was announced  Greg Abel  a Berkshire vice chairman widely considered a candidate to succeed Buffett as Berkshire s chief executive officer  is a Kraft Heinz director  Buffett also said he would continue to do business with 3G and its co founder Jorge Paulo Lemann  calling him  an absolutely outstanding human being    TOE TO TOE  Kraft Heinz s disclosure raised questions about 3G s financial strategy for the company  whose brands include Jell O  Kool Aid and Philadelphia cream cheese  and whether it is out of step with consumers seeking healthier  fresher alternatives to processed food  Buffett acknowledged the changes  but said greater pressure is coming from retailers such as Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST   saying the latter s Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products  Stronger brands can  go toe to toe with Walmart or Costco  but weaker brands  tend to lose out   Buffett said   The ability to price has changed  and that s huge   Still  Buffett added   If I had to bet one way or another  I think people will eat more of our products this year than last year   Berkshire s own  3 billion writedown related to Kraft Heinz contributed to a  25 39 billion fourth quarter net loss for Berkshire   He monumentally overpaid for Kraft   said Doug Kass  founder of the hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc   Increasingly  the moats he initially saw in his investments have been damaged   The bad news also called into question 3G s signature business model of zero based budgeting  which requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch  rather than use last year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis  Kraft Heinz s belt tightening resulted in more than  1 7 billion in annual savings  including the loss of thousands of jobs  mirroring 3G s similar efforts at such companies as Anheuser Busch InBev and Tim Hortons  The strategy has resulted in leaner companies  but could backfire if the companies lacked products that people wanted  or failed to spend enough to develop and market those products

Costco shares have added about 45  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 25 3  
What s Next for Costco 
While Costco has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

143870,365385,COST,Walgreens Is The Worst Dow Stock Now  Will 2020 Be Different ,opinion,"The healthcare space has not been among the best Dow Jones performers this year  thanks to the lingering U S  China trade dispute and fears of regulatory hindrances  among other factors  Among Dow stocks  drug retailor Walgreens Boots Alliance   NASDAQ WBA   has been the worst performer Year to date  the stock has lost 15 3   compared with the Dow Jones Index s 20 61  rise 2019 Hasn t Been KindWalgreens has had a dismal stretch this year owing to a number of factors including rising drug costs and the threat of the entry of non MedTech stalwarts like Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    JP Morgan   NYSE JPM   and Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  into the healthcare space Let us delve deeper Drug Cost Inflation Going by an article in   more than 3 400 prescription drugs  prices have been hiked in the first six months of 2019  showing an increase of 17  from a year earlier  This is inducing patients to replace prescription medicines with low cost generic drugs  This has largely affected the business of the likes of Walgreens Healthcare Foray of Market Stalwarts  Shares of Walgreens have also been declining since non healthcare leaders started floating major healthcare ventures  The price competition for Walgreens Boots has escalated with the emerging online peers eating into its pharmacy customers  Apart from Amazon  Walgreens has been facing immense competitive pressure from the likes of Walmart   NYSE WMT    which has been capturing market share in the profitable household and beauty categories  The presence of companies like Costco   NASDAQ COST   and dollar store chains like Dollar General   NYSE DG    which are currently offering the same products as Walgreens across both online and physical stores at much cheaper rates  is also a bother Other Adverse Factors  Walgreens has also been hit by a FDA crackdown with regard to its sale of tobacco and e cigarettes  especially to teenagers  this year  Brexit has been posing tough challenge to Walgreens as sales at its Boots UK stores declined due to the worsening of the consumer scenario in the U K Sell off NewsWalgreens  dismal performance has probably compelled it to consider a sell off  A Nov 11 Bloomberg news stated about a potential deal citing some undisclosed source  which claimed that private equity firm KKR   Co  has formally forwarded a takeover offer to Walgreens Boots for  70 billion Investors had taken this news positively  as was evident from the 6  share price hike over the next two days  However  after the initial surge  the stock retraced after analysts raised doubt over the feasibility of such a massive deal Is There a Rebound in the Cards Walgreens  with a massive market cap of  51 51 billion  has been leaving no stones unturned  The company recently inked a number of agreements to diversify its product offerings and strengthen its retail pharmacy business While the company s major peer CVS Health   NYSE CVS   has adopted the growth by acquisition policy to defy all odds  through vertical integration by acquiring health insurance giant Aetna  NYSE AET    Walgreens is currently focusing on its front end stores expansion and has announced partnerships with the likes of Kroger  NYSE KR   and FedEx  NYSE FDX   The FedEx alliance is aimed at offering convenient access to FedEx drop off and pickup services at several of Walgreens locations across the nation  The Kroger alliance  in the meanwhile  is expected to boost the company s supply chain efficiency Further  the intensifying competition in the U S  retail drugstore market has compelled Walgreens to diversify its product offerings  In line with this  investors are currently looking forward to its tie up with Alphabet s life sciences and healthcare segment Verily on multiple projects pertaining to chronic ailment Walgreens is also progressing well with its collaboration with LabCorp  The company is planning to open at least 600 LabCorp patient centers across the United States  thereby offering diagnostic lab testing services in the community  During the fourth quarter  the company had opened 21 centers  taking the total to 58 In a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs  Walgreens tied up with Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  and plans to expand their existing group purchasing efforts  Since biosimilars have the potential to lower production costs  the move is considered a prudent and timely one We believe such measures will help straighten things out for the company in 2020  to a certain extent Further  according to a Dec 12 news  the House Democrats passed a crucial bill to cut down prescription drug price in the United States  The bill  titled the Elijah E  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act  would allow the Health   Human Services secretary to set  through an annual negotiation  the best prices for at least 50 costly branded prescription drugs and up to 250 medications  including insulin  Prices would be limited at 1 2 times their cost in certain other first world nations  If this drug price cap bill finally gets implemented  Walgreens is sure to gain This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  currently has a favorable price to earnings ratio  forward 12 months  of 9 69 as compared with the S P 500 market s 18 28 and the broader  s 10 16  The company also has favorable price to sales  forward 12 months  ratio of 0 36 compared with the S P 500 market s 3 33 Bottom LineIn a market  where legal regulatory challenges and reimbursement pressure are historically altering the trend  it will be interesting to see how Walgreens deals with the odds and delivers the promised long term earnings growth of 6 8

143871,365386,COST,New Trade Deal  New Records For S P And NASDAQ,opinion,"The market apparently exhausted most of its excitement over the Phase 1 trade deal on Thursday  as stocks couldn t sustain a morning rally today and finished with only a slight improvement in the session 
	Nevertheless  all of the major indices still managed to report gains for the week  The NASDAQ advanced 0 9  and the Dow was up 0 4  
	The S P now has a three week winning streak after rising 0 7  over the past 5 days 
	We don t have to worry about those additional tariffs that were scheduled for Sunday  because the recent Phase 1 agreement does away with them  That deadline was looming over stocks all through December  which made the market especially susceptible to daily trade headlines 
	The deal also rolls back some of the China tariffs and includes purchases of U S  agricultural products 
	The lead up to this deal sent stocks soaring on Thursday and led to more solid gains this morning  But the market gave almost all of it back 
	In the end  the NASDAQ advanced 0 20  to 8734 88  while the S P and Dow each improved 0 01  to 3168 80 and 28 135 38  respectively 
	That s it  After years of nail biting and flop sweat  that s all we get on the first day of Phase 1  A measly 0 01  
	Well  we all know how demanding this market can be  It wanted all of the tariffs to be rolled back  not just some them 
	It was hoping to be pleasantly surprised with a deal that came closer to ending the whole conflict with China  but instead it only got what was expected and nothing more 
	Yesterday was the day to celebrate an agreement  today was the day to look at the details  It also didn t help that U S  retail sales rose less than expected in November 
	But we shouldn t be frustrated as we head into the weekend  Just the opposite  The indices hung onto all of yesterday s impressive gains  while the NASDAQ and S P finished with record closing highs

143905,365420,COST,Costco  COST  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Costco  COST  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This warehouse club operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 2  
Revenues are expected to be  37 43 billion  up 6 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 29  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Costco 
For Costco  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Costco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Costco would post earnings of  2 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 69  delivering a surprise of  5 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Costco appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/costco-cost-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200490447,200490447

143931,365446,COST,China s Top Diplomat Mocks U S  s  Perplexing  Trade Complaints,news," Bloomberg     Wang Yi may be China s top diplomat  but on Monday he sounded more like the country s chief lecturer of economics 
The Chinese foreign minister took advantage of a visit by his U K  counterpart to give the U S  a mocking economics lesson  saying American policies were to blame for the country s trade deficit and the collapse of talks  Wang began in response to a reporter s trade question  saying  let me share with you some basic facts and I believe you will make an objective and sensible assessment  
 The U S  often says that it is taken advantage of  but this is perplexing  It s like someone who buys a  100 product in a supermarket  has the product in hand  and then complains that he is  100 short   Wang said   Does that logic stand up  
Wang s defiant remarks underscored deep divisions between the two sides with just a month before the public comment ends on Donald Trump s proposal to levy tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese goods  While American and Chinese officials have hinted at the possibility of restarting talks  it s been almost two months they last held high level negotiations 
 China and the U S  have had several rounds of consultations and reached important consensus  but regrettably the U S  did not fulfill its obligations   Wang said   Nor did it make concerted efforts with China  
Wang was adopting a common argument against Trump s trade policies  in particular his focus on the U S  trade deficits  A June 18 essay by  JP Morgan Chase   NYSE JPM    Co s Chief Global Strategist David Kelly titled  My Trade Deficit with Costco  NASDAQ COST   is one example 
 In fact  the U S  has gained a lot from its trade deficit with China   Wang said   It gains massive  inexpensive resources and goods  which increase the welfare of consumers and increase the strength of the dollar

Wang said that he and Hunt had agreed to work together to uphold free trade  multilateral agreements and World Trade Organization rules  Still  he said that China was willing to resume talks with the U S  if the conditions were right 
 China s door of dialogue and negotiation remains open  but any dialogue must be based on equality and mutual respect   Wang said   Any threats or pressure by one side will only be counterproductive  ",2018-07-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chinastop-diplomat-mocks-ussperplexing-trade-complaints-1551671,1551671

143980,365495,COST,Whole Foods calls supplier summit amid Amazon angst,news,"By Lisa Baertlein and Chris Prentice
LOS ANGELES NEW YORK  Reuters    Whole Foods will host a summit on Tuesday for up to 200 of its suppliers  amid anxiety about how its ongoing business revamp will play out under new owner Amazon com  O AMZN  
Amazon s  13 7 billion purchase of Whole Foods last summer shook the grocery industry  spawning worries that the ecommerce giant would disrupt groceries the way it upended books  toys and electronics 
In a restructuring effort underway before the acquisition  Whole Foods earlier this year began requiring suppliers to use a firm of its choosing to restock shelves and run promotions  As first reported in the Washington Post  Whole Foods is charging some suppliers the equivalent of 3 percent to 5 percent of sales to cover the cost of those broker services 
In addition  Whole Foods adopted a Costco Wholesale Corp  O COST  style model for in store sampling  asking companies to pay fees when Whole Foods offers shoppers free samples of their products 
Those changes caused heartburn for some small upstart brands   There s been a lot of brands at Whole Foods that probably shouldn t have been there to begin with   said food industry consultant Phil Lempert  who added that it should not be a surprise that the formerly freewheeling retailer is beginning to act like a more mainstream business 
Several mid sized suppliers told Reuters they supported Whole Foods  efforts to date 
 We have a chance to move faster   said Califia Farms Chief Executive Greg Steltenpohl  among those who said he planned to attend the summit 
Califia sells almond milk and bottled coffee drinks at Whole Foods and on Amazon com  which recently invited the Los Angeles based company to be one of 52 brands to be featured on Amazon Launchpad  a new marketing service that aims to connect brands with Amazon shoppers 
 The changes we ve been making across the company directly address the feedback our supplier partners have shared over the years about the challenges of our decentralized purchasing structure and inconsistent practices across regions and stores   Whole Foods spokeswoman Robin Rehfield Kelly said in a statement 
Kelly said Whole Foods has worked for the last two years to streamline its processes across global and regional purchasing teams to ensure all its suppliers are supported under a consistent company wide set of protocols 
Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackey and members of the chain s marketing and merchandising team will host the summit 
PIONEER 2 0
Whole Foods explosive growth faltered after  Kroger Co   N KR   Walmart  N WMT  and other retailers started charging less for the many of the natural  organic and niche products that once set Whole Foods apart  giving it the ability to charge premium prices 
Since the restructuring  Whole Foods has replaced or stripped the power of its regional  foragers   who identified and nurtured small brands  Without those champions  some of those products are being eliminated to make space for bigger  faster moving brands 
 It was kind of disorganized before  More organization and clear communications is definitely better   said Steve Savage  chief executive of Boulder  Colorado s 1908 Brands  which sells Boulder Clean laundry detergent and other products at the chain 
 Amazon has encouraged Whole Foods to be more aggressive   said Jeff  Trip  Tripician  general manager of Niman Ranch  It saw a robust rise in sales of its hams  sausage and bacon at the 473 store chain since the Amazon purchase  he said 
Average monthly foot traffic at Whole Foods has increased by 1 3 percent since the Amazon acquisition news broke in June  according to Venice Beach  California based InMarket  which uses location data from 50 million smartphones to analyze visitation trends

The company last month shut 63 stores  or about 1 10th of its total  and laid off nearly 10 000 workers after a review of profitability  The layoffs were the largest since the first Sam s Club opened in 1983 
The moves are a part of a strategic shift by Sam s new chief executive  John Furner  as he attempts to turn around a business that has underperformed its parent Walmart and rivals like Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST  
 We are creating a new Sam s Club for our members   Furner said on a media conference call 
 We are adding more value to our membership  we re making strategic choices and changing how we work to drive visible growth   he said 
Sam s Club will now offer two membership options  down from three earlier  They will be offered as Sam s Club for  45 a year and Sam s Plus for  100 a year 
The company will offer free shipping on 95 percent of the items it sells online  with no minimum order size for Sam s Plus members  Jamie Iannone  chief executive of SamsClub com  said on the conference call

NEW DELHI  Reuters    Potential buyers have expressed strong early interest in a bankrupt U S  firm of Indian jeweler Nirav Modi  who has been accused of involvement in a  2 billion bank fraud in India  court filings show 
Firestar Diamond Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Feb  26 in the United States  following accusations that other firms led by Modi and his uncle colluded with officials of state run  Punjab National Bank   NS PNBK  to secure unauthorized loans between 2011 and 2017 
Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi  owner of  Gitanjali Gems  Ltd  NS GTGM   left India in January before the fraud came to light  but have said in letters and statements they are innocent 
Indian investigators have  however  attached or seized assets belonging to Modi and his companies  Firestar is not named in the police complaint 
 Early expressions of interest in purchasing some or all of the debtors  business operations have been strong   Firestar Diamond said in a court filing on Wednesday 
It has also told secured lenders it was in discussions with lenders for debtor in possession financing as it weighed options 
Firestar Diamond and its affiliates had annual sales of around  90 million  with clients such as Costco Wholesale  O COST   Macy s  N M  and JC Penney Co Inc  N JCP   it said 
India s Central Bureau of Investigation has so far arrested at least 13 people   seven from the bank and six more from Modi and Choksi s companies  Investigators have also seized a number of properties from the two  including jewelry and luxury vehicles 
 Among the properties seized and businesses closed were factories in India which produced most of the fine jewelry merchandise sold by the debtors to their customers   Firestar said in its filing 
The Indian units had provided some back office and support functions  it said  adding   The sudden loss of its supply chain and back office support has dramatically impacted the operations of the debtors in the short term 
Firestar Diamond was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2004 under the name Jewelry Solutions International  Its name was changed to Next Diamond Inc in 2005 and again in 2007 to Firestone Inc  before taking its current name in 2011 
The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Firestar Group  which in turn is wholly owned by Synergies Corp  Both are Delaware incorporated 
Synergies is then wholly owned by Firestar Holdings Ltd  a Hong Kong corporation  which is then wholly owned by Modi s Indian company Firestar International Ltd  according to the filing made in the United States Bankruptcy Court Southern District of New York 
Separately  an Indian agency that targets offences involving foreign exchange and money laundering said on Thursday it had seized 41 properties  worth about 12 billion rupees   184 16 million   belonging to Choksi and companies he controls

144039,365554,COST,Bull Of The Day  Costco  COST ,opinion,"As we celebrate an historic 11 year bull market  much of the strong economic expansion we ve seen has been attributed to consumer spending  With record low unemployment and rising wages  the American consumer has been providing strong support for lending services  durable goods and of course  retail 
Last week we saw the first big negative surprise in Retail Sales numbers  a decline of 0 3  versus and expected gain of 0 3   It remains to be seen whether the shortfall is a temporary aberration or an indication that consumers are reeling in their spending out of fear of a possible recession looming 
One thing is clear however  in good times and in bad  consumers love to shop at Costco  In good times  Costco customers load up on TVs and electronics  jewelry  durable goods like washing machines and even automobiles through Costco s partnerships with manufacturers 
In leaner times  those same customers still rely on Costco for their daily needs  They re attracted to the great deals on high volume purchases of food staples  household supplies  pet food and all the other things everyone buys every day 
This duality is the reason Costco performs so well in a variety of economic environments As you can see from the Price  Consensus and Surprise chart below  Costco has been very close to analyst estimates every quarter for over five years  Though the red and green arrows show a series of  beats  and  misses   the magnitude of each individual result in relation to forecasts is miniscule  The estimates have been quite accurate  with Costco basically matching a series of steadily increasing earnings forecasts 
That type of consistency should appeal to investors  especially as the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate continues to rise  Costco may not be a good candidate for a huge positive surprise  but history shows that they aren t likely to disappoint  either 
Take a look at the previous four quarters  We ve seen three modest beats and one miniscule miss of consensus estimates 
Looking forward  revenue and earnings estimates are rising steadily  Sales in 2019 are expected to rise 6 6  to  163B and another 6 6  in 2020 to  173 5B  Earnings estimates follow a similar trajectory  gaining 5  in 2019 to  8 60 share and then another 6 6  to  9 17 share in 2020 Though the increases have been modest  we ve seen 10 upward revisions in the last 60 days and zero downward revisions  earning Costco a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Single digit growth may not seem all that exciting  but as economic conditions become somewhat less certain  steady performance will become an increasingly important part of any diversified portfolio  Tech stocks provide the explosive speculative potential  but rock solid retailers like Costco make up the foundation

144059,365574,COST,Costco  COST  Is Up 2  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Costco  COST   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Costco currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for COST that show why this warehouse club operator shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For COST  shares are up 2  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry is up 0 24  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 2 66  compares favorably with the industry s 2 66  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Costco have increased 5 19  over the past quarter  and have gained 34 16  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  0 52  and 10 95   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to COST s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  COST is currently averaging 2 387 929 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with COST 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost COST s consensus estimate  increasing from  8 51 to  8 60 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that COST is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Costco on your short list ",2019-10-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/costco-cost-is-up-2-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200473128,200473128

144106,365621,COST,Costco  COST  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Costco  COST  reports results for the quarter ended August 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 3  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This warehouse club operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 54 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 6  
Revenues are expected to be  47 26 billion  up 6 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 48  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Costco 
For Costco  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Costco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Costco would post earnings of  1 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 89  delivering a surprise of  3 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Costco appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-09-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/costco-cost-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200468294,200468294
144107,365622,COST,3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week  PepsiCo  Costco  Alibaba,opinion,"Markets remain hostage to the U S  China trade uncertainty  with little hope of a resolution anytime soon  The S P 500 fell 1 1  over the last five trading days as the benchmark pared its third quarter gains to about half a percent 
Stocks were also pressured by the start of the U S  House of Representative s newly opened impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump  a political development that will add a new layer of uncertainty to volatile trading conditions 
Beyond these macroeconomic events  we re watching three largecap stocks which could see some action this week  the result of company specific developments in the days ahead 
1  PepsiCo
Snack and beverage giant PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  will report third quarter earnings on Thursday  Oct  3 before the market opens  Analysts expect EPS of  1 5 a share on revenue of  16 93 billion 

The upcoming quarterly report could provide additional evidence that Pepsi s earnings momentum is backed by a strong demand revival and the success of the company s product mix which includes such popular brands as Frito Lay  Tostitos and Ruffles brand chips and Mountain Dew s energy fuel carbonated beverage line  a favorite among gamers  In the previous quarter  the demand for the soft dring giant s caffeine boosted drink  aimed at video gamers  was so strong that the company  
A positive earnings surprise would help Pepsi shares outperform rivals as the stock continues its strong upward move  which began during the past year  Shares closed on Friday at  135 60  having gained more than 20  this year so far 
2  Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST The retail sector will come under scrutiny once again when Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST  reports its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter results on Thursday  Oct  3  after the close  Analysts are expecting  2 54 a share in profit on sales of  47 48 billion 




Unlike the weak showing by some top retailers during their recently concluded quarters  chances are that Costco  NASDAQ COST  will provide a strong report  The company said last month that its August same store sales were strong  exceeding analyst estimates 
The company s future guidance will be more important for investors  at a time when cost pressures are rising because of the U S  China tariff hikes that have started to pinch retailers who import products from China 
As well  there is growing evidence from recent economic reports that the U S  economy is losing some steam  If that slowdown persists  it could hurt consumer sentiment as the year progresses 
So far  however  shares of Costco  NASDAQ COST  have remained an investor favorite  The stock closed at  285 95 on Friday  up around 40  thus far this year 
3   Alibaba   NYSE BABA It looks as though the U S  China trade spat will continue to weigh on Chinese tech stocks listed on the NASDAQ  in the wake of reports that the White House  is considering ways to limit U S  investments in China 
According to a CNBC report  the White House could include a block on all U S  financial investments in China with the goal to protect American investors  No decisions have been made at this time  however  and it s nowhere near complete  sources told the network 




But the report was enough to trigger a sell off in Chinese stocks led by  Alibaba  Group Holdings  NYSE BABA  which dropped more than 5  on Friday  That weakness  in our view  could extend in the coming weeks unless we there s a positive outcome to trade negotiations 
The report appears to be a pressure tactic by U S  officials before October s crucial trade talks with China  The resulting equity weakness could offer a buying opportunity in some of our favorite stocks  including  Alibaba   NYSE BABA   After closing at  165 98 on Friday  shares are up 19  for the year ",2019-09-29,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week-pepsico-costco-alibaba-200468947,200468947

144171,365686,COST,RH To Report Higher Q2 Earnings On Strong Business Model,opinion,RH s   NYSE RH   earnings and revenues are expected to increase on a year over year basis when it reports second quarter fiscal 2019  ended Aug 3  results In the last reported quarter  this leading luxury home furnishing retailer s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20 1   Markedly  the company beat expectations in each of the last four quarters  with the average being 20 1  Meanwhile  it topped    revenue expectation by 2 7  in the fiscal first quarter  Also  its adjusted earnings and revenues  including recall accrual  grew 53  and 7 4   respectively  from the year ago level How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from RH prior to the earnings release For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share  EPS  has increased 13 9  over the past 60 days to  2 70  This indicates an increase of 31 7  from the year ago reported earnings of  2 05 per share  Revenues are expected to increase 8 6  year over year to  698 million Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayRH has been reporting strong bottom line growth  buoyed by focus on improving profit margins rather than chasing for sales  The trend is likely to be reflected in the to be reported quarter as well  backed by strength of its RH brand and business model  The company has been benefiting from higher margins and initiatives to create a new and different shopping experience with the addition of hospitality  restaurants and cafes  in new Full Line Design Galleries  These positives are expected to boost its results in the quarter to be reported That said  some macroeconomic geopolitical concerns   which comprise high end housing slowdown in the United States and U S  China trade spat   persist  Luxury home sales slowed down in recent times as homes in high tax areas of the state are facing a decreasing number of potential buyers  given the material loss of deductions under Trump s new tax plan  This is likely to serve as a headwind in the quarter to be reported  Weakness in the core business due to market volatility  although it is likely to be less in the second quarter   continued softness in the housing market over the last few quarters  and the ongoing exit from unprofitable and non strategic businesses will likely impact RH s revenues in the to be reported quarter Nonetheless  despite a soft sales environment  RH s promotional activity  increased pricing activities  spring sale and a modest uptick in discounts at limited outlet stores are expected to offset the aforementioned headwinds to some extent  Consequently  the company recently increased its guidance for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2019 Overall  the company expects revenues for the quarter in the range of  696  699 million  indicating 8 9  year over year increase Meanwhile  RH has been working on cost saving initiatives such as redesigning the supply chain  reducing inventory  improving product margins and so on  These factors are expected to buoy the upcoming results  However  increased shipping and labor costs may partially restrict its margin improvement  Meanwhile  increased pricing activities are likely to offset higher product costs from Chinese tariffs For the to be reported quarter  the company expects adjusted EPS in the band of  2 65  2 72  suggesting 40 44  year over year growth  versus the previous expectation of  2 33  2 47  Free cash flow for the quarter is projected at approximately  95 million  implying a rise from  25 million reported last year  What the Zacks Model UnveilsRH does not have the right combination of

Costco Wholesale Corporation   NASDAQ COST   witnessed a gala opening of its first brick and mortar store in China  As soon as the gates were opened to the public  the Shanghai store was swamped by huge pool of bargain hunters  The overwhelming customer response took management by surprise and nearly led to a law and order problem  forcing the company to untimely pull down its shutters in the afternoon Notably  U S  store closures have surged to 7 922 so far this year  per data from Coresight Research   In this backdrop  such a grand debut on overseas terrain has surely caught the fancy of investors as reflected by a 13 9  rise in share price yesterday  The stock also hit a 52 week high of  293 44 during intra day trading  before eventually closing at  292 38  Whether Costco can sustain this healthy growth momentum and capitalize on the huge market traction remains to be seen What Worked in Costco s Favor Through its partnership with Chinese e commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Costco Hits Big on China Debut  Can It Sustain Momentum Defying the tense undercurrents between two of the largest economic powerhouses of the world  U S  discount store Costco Wholesale Corp  witnessed a gala opening of its first brick and mortar store in China  As soon as the gates were opened to the public  the Shanghai store was swamped by huge pool of bargain hunters  The overwhelming customer response took management by surprise and nearly led to a law and order problem  forcing the company to untimely pull down its shutters in the afternoon Notably  U S  store closures have surged to 7 922 so far this year  per data from Coresight Research   In this backdrop  such a grand debut on overseas terrain has surely caught the fancy of investors as reflected by a 13 9  rise in share price yesterday  The stock also hit a 52 week high of  293 44 during intra day trading  before eventually closing at  292 38  Whether Costco can sustain

144186,365701,COST,Will Tariffs   Margin Woes Hurt Michaels   MIK  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,The Michaels Companies  Inc    NASDAQ MIK   is slated to report second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Sep 4  before the opening bell Notably  the company delivered in line earnings in the fiscal first quarter and recorded a beat in the preceding three quarters  It has an average positive earnings surprise of 6 3  in the trailing four quarters Which Way Are Estimates Moving The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings is pegged at 14 cents  indicating a decline of 6 7  from the figure reported in the year ago quarter  Notably  the consensus mark has remained stable over the past 30 days For quarterly sales  the consensus estimate stands at  1 billion  implying a 3 8  decrease from the prior year quarter s reported number  The Michaels Companies  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Factors at PlayMichaels has been witnessing strained margins for the past few quarters due to higher expenses  which remains a concern in the to be reported quarter  In first quarter fiscal 2019  the company reported the fifth straight quarter of gross margin decline  with the sixth consecutive quarter of operating margin contraction Rise in distribution related costs and deleverage in occupancy expense along with adverse sales mix are hurting the company s gross margin  Moreover  the company has been enduring the impact of tariffs on the cost of goods sold  Lower gross margin coupled with increase in SG A expenses  as a percentage of sales  is weighing on the operating margin Quite apparent  second quarter gross margin is likely to reflect higher distribution related costs  occupancy deleverage and the impact of tariffs  offset by sourcing benefits and discount management  Adjusted operating income is estimated to be  65  75 million driven by expectations of flat gross margin  For the to be reported quarter  comparable store sales  comps  are projected to be flat to down 1 5   Moreover  adjusted earnings per share are envisioned to be 13 16 cents For fiscal 2019  management lowered its margin and earnings per share guidance to reflect the increase in tariffs and expectations of additional tariffs on List 4 goods  It is concerned about the recent increase in tariff on List 3 goods from 10  to 25   Further  the potential imposition of List 4 China tariffs is likely to put significant cost pressure on the company Michaels expects about  400 million of product costs to be subject to higher duties in fiscal 2019  This  in turn  may hurt its performance in the to be reported quarter Nevertheless  Michaels  efforts to enhance omni channel experience and in store operations might aid the top line in second quarter fiscal 2019  Notably  its e commerce platform is a significant growth driver  The company also continues to gain from omni channel capabilities like  Buy Online Pick Up in Store   which is a cost effective way of fulfilling online orders as it eliminates shipping costs Furthermore  Michaels completed a major step in the evolution of its e commerce business by exiting third party fulfillment providers for online orders  All orders from Michaels com are now fulfilled by its stores or owned distribution center  Elimination of third party providers positions the company for improved e commerce sales growth By improving in store customer experience and incorporating customers  requirements in its decisions at the store support centers  Michaels expects to become a more customer centric company  Also  it is on track to fix issues with the pricing strategy and coupon distributions to enhance customer value perception and combat declining sales  Backed by the initial success of these actions  the company expects to improve value perception and sales trends going forward Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Michaels is likely to beat earnings estimates in second quarter fiscal 2019  A stock needs

144192,365707,COST,Improvements to South Korea U S  trade deal may not shrink America s deficit,news,"By David Lawder WASHINGTON  Reuters    A five year old U S  South Korean trade deal could be improved to increase access for American vehicles and deter currency manipulation  but changes will not necessarily shrink the U S  trade deficit with the Asian export powerhouse  The U S  Korean Free Trade Agreement  whose anniversary falls next week  had promised to boost U S  exports by  10 billion a year but in fact delivered an overall decline of  3 billion by the end of 2016  in part due to a slowdown in global trade  But the record of the accord  once dubbed the  highest standard deal  for America  is now in President Donald Trump s firing line  He told Reuters on Thursday the deal was  horrible  and he would renegotiate or terminate it  KORUS  as the deal is known  has been a boon for South Korea and its U S  goods trade surplus has surged to  28 billion    The standards in KORUS are good  The problem is that the South Korean economy is very weak   said Derek Scissors  resident scholar and Asian trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute   Even if we renegotiate it  we re not going to get a surge in exports because they re just not growing that fast   Meanwhile  the U S  economy is strengthening  supporting consumer demand for imported goods  including cars and electronics from South Korea  One sector for which the trade deal has not gone horribly is U S  beef  where exports have risen steadily to overtake Australia as the top foreign supplier to South Korea in February  American beef had been shunned by South Korean consumers after a 2003 incident of  mad cow  disease and was often sold cheaper than Australian beef in Korean hypermarkets like Costco  NASDAQ COST   Trade experts  including a KORUS negotiator  said potential demands from the Trump administration for renegotiation are likely to include provisions to knock down remaining non tariff barriers to Korean imports of U S  autos  an area where KORUS benefits have fallen far short of expectations  Even though the South Korean car market is among the world s top 10  the United States only exported about 60 000 vehicles to Korea last year  compared to nearly 1 million vehicles shipped the other way   Their market remains essentially closed  There needs to be a plan to open it up   said Representative Sander Levin of Michigan  the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee  Barriers  from South Korea s failure to recognize U S  vehicle identification number standards to a penalty fee for high emission vehicles including sport utility vehicles and  muscle  cars  have raised costs for U S  vehicles in the market  Wendy Cutler  a former deputy U S  Trade Representative who was the chief negotiator on KORUS during the George W  Bush and Barack Obama administrations  said the Trump administration s recent draft notification letter to Congress for North American Free Trade Agreement talks sets out some guideposts for a KORUS negotiation  The letter seeks to equalize tax treatment of exports  safeguard  Buy American  public procurement rules  tighten rules of origin to keep more Chinese parts and products from entering the United States tariff free and include  snap back  provisions that allow tariffs to be reimposed to guard against a surge of damaging imports  Cutler also said that while KORUS is the highest standard trade deal that the United States currently has in force  it could still be upgraded to the now defunct Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal s higher standards on environment  labor  intellectual property rights and digital trade  South Korea was not a party to the TPP  but it  might be able to go further on digital data flows because they re a very wired society   said Cutler  now with the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington  CURRENCY QUESTION A provision to deter currency manipulation  enforceable with punitive tariffs  has long been a goal for labor unions and Democrats for U S  trade deals and also could become part of the talks  The U S  Treasury keeps South Korea on a currency manipulation  monitoring list  because of its trade surplus with the United States and its high global current account surplus of 7 percent of gross domestic product  It also criticized Seoul s lack of transparency in its currency market interventions   Ford Motor Co   N F  spokeswoman Christin Baker said the automaker has  consistently supported  currency manipulation rules in U S  trade agreements   We have expressed concern about the implementation of KORUS for some time  including its lack of currency provisions   Baker said in an emailed statement  Jeffrey Schott  a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics  said that KORUS provisions could be crafted for foreign exchange transparency and interventions that could help enforce South Korea s G20 and International Monetary Fund

FOMO
With these exclusive deals being available to Amazon Prime members for a limited time only  consumers often don t want to miss out on the annual event  Consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow commented on consumers  thoughts about Prime Day  saying  the psychology is really just fear of missing out and timing   Like Black Friday  which is right before the biggest retail shopping season  Prime Day is right before back to school shopping season  retail s second busiest season  Amazon utilizes the proximity to the season to entice its Prime members into doing their back to school shopping on Amazon with the vast amount of deals they have going on 
Yarrow went on to say that by investing their money into becoming Prime members  consumers may be more motivated to participate in Prime Day in order to get their money s worth  Prime Day almost feels like a reward for Prime members for shelling out money that is not necessary to shop on the website regularly  Prime Day s annual occurrence also gives consumers a sense of urgency  there won t be an opportunity like this again anytime soon  and people fear passing up on the day of deals only to hear about friends or family that scored big with savings  The potential increase in revenue from Prime Day could help the e commerce giant post a solid results next quarter  which would add to an already stellar year 
Moving Forward 
When people think about Prime Day  they will likely think about saving on electronics or appliances and don t typically imagine saving on designer apparel  AMZN is currently attempting to use Prime Day to endorse its fashion deals  The company has recently been dabbling in initiatives to collaborate with fashion influencers in an attempt to establish the site as a place to shop for more than just socks and underwear  Amazon s initiatives come at a time when apparel retailers have been struggling  encouraging the company to try its hand in the over  1 trillion market 
Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    AMZN generated roughly  35 billion in sales in 2018 related to apparel and footwear  out of its  232 9 billion in overall revenue  The commerce giant was able to outpace some established competitors such as athletic apparel giant Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU    which brought in  3 3 billion in sales last year  Gap   NYSE GPS    who generated  16 6 billion  and Costco   NASDAQ COST    who reeled in  7 billion  Amazon attributes this towering revenue to its  commoditized  clothing like white t shirts  jeans  and underwear  AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos frequently mentioned to colleagues in the past that in order to become a  200 billion company  We ve got to learn how to sell clothes and food   The company was able to exceed  200 billion in full year sales for the first time in 2018 
Amazon has been enlisting a mass of fashion influencers to spread taglines such as  I  FoundItOnAmazon   Influencers such as Paola Alberdi  Sierra Furtado  Emi Suzuki  and Leonie Hanne all boast at least one million followers and are working with Amazon to help establish it as a true fashion platform  Data from eMarketer shows that Amazon is on track to obtain nearly 30  of the market share for apparel e commerce this year  which is up from 22 7  in 2016  U S  e commerce sales still represent less than 15  of total retail sales  meaning that the majority of purchases are still focused in physical stores  Amazon is looking to continue its fashion campaign with its army of influencers that can help the company grab a significant share of the lucrative market 
Bottom Line 
Amazon is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and is coming off a solid quarter  crushing our Consensus Estimate of  4 61 by reporting an EPS of  7 09 for an EPS surprise of 53 80   The company has made a habit of beating our Consensus Estimates  as it has an average EPS surprise of a whopping 60 25  over the previous four reported quarters  In addition  full year estimates look sound for the company as Consensus Estimates are calling for revenue to increase 18 19  to  275 24 billion and earnings to surge 31 83   Double digit earnings and revenue growth are projected for 2020 as well  further cementing the stock as a solid growth pick  Amazon has had a spectacular year  with shares up 72 5   the stock has substantially outperformed the broader e commerce market year to date too

offer specialty rental services such as modular and portable storage solutions The industry players cater to different sectors namely  construction  energy  healthcare  security  government  retail  commercial  education and transportation Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is highly sensitive to the strength of the economy  Although a slowing housing market in the United States poses a threat to the industry players  the companies are expected to benefit from a robust job market and the consequent rise in disposable income as well as increasing consumer spending  Millennials represents the largest consumer cohort in the furniture market  More money in the hands of this largest and most active generation of homebuyers should keep demand high  Meanwhile  industry players are making investments in new products to improve product mix in a competitive landscape and drive top line growth  However  the furniture industry is highly competitive with home furnishing retailers  department stores and antique dealers giving a hard time  Again  companies need to continuously address a deteriorating omni channel environment as shoppers tend to

industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of bleak earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since February 2019  the industry s earnings estimates for 2019 and 2020 have been revised 9 7  and 4 5   respectively  downward Despite the discouraging scenario  we will present a few stocks that can be bought or retained  considering their robust growth endeavors  Prior to that  let s take a look at the industry s shareholder returns

144271,365786,COST,Is Costco  COST  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Costco  COST  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this warehouse club operator is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Costco is 9 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 1  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Costco is 13 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 3 6  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Costco have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Costco a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Costco well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-06-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-costco-cost-a-solid-growth-stock-3-reasons-to-think--yes--200435203,200435203

144305,365820,COST,Here s Why Costco  COST  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Costco  COST   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Costco currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if COST is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this warehouse club operator holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For COST  shares are up 1 62  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry is up 1 87  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 67  compares favorably with the industry s 5 18  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Costco have increased 10 13  over the past quarter  and have gained 26 77  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 3 71  and 7 94   respectively 
Investors should also take note of COST s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  COST is averaging 1 874 728 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with COST 
Over the past two months  12 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost COST s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 89 to  8 04 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that COST is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Costco on your short list ",2019-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-costco-cost-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200433267,200433267

144312,365827,COST,Warren Buffett says more likely to buy IBM shares than sell  CNBC,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Warren Buffett  chairman and chief executive of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   said Monday he would be more likely to buy than sell  IBM   NYSE IBM  shares over the next two years  and that he did not seek to profit from global central bank actions 
Buffett  who presided over Berkshire s 51st annual shareholder meeting in Omaha  Nebraska over the weekend  told cable television network CNBC   We would be much more likely to buy more in the next 12 or 24 months than we would be to sell shares  but we will make that call as time goes along  
Buffett  whose Berkshire held an 8 59 percent stake in IBM as of the end of last year and who has caught some flak for his stake  said his cost basis in IBM was around  170 a share and that he had still never sold a share 
IBM shares fell 0 4 percent to  145 34 late Monday afternoon 
Buffett also said he did not seek to profit from global central bank monetary policies  but that low and negative interest rates could produce an unanticipated reaction 
 It s a fascinating movie to watch  I don t try to make money off the movie   Buffett said 
 If currency in a bank is worth less than currency in your hands or in a mattress  that could produce something in the way of behavior that nobody has ever anticipated  
Buffett  whose Berkshire is an  American Express   NYSE AXP  shareholder  said the company s loss of its contract with retailer Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST  was  significant  but he agreed with American Express Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault s decision to split from Costco 
He said American Express would remain  under attack  from alternative payment methods  but he was confident in his stake 
 Costco was a very  very  very valuable co brand to have for American Express  but that value wasn t limitless   he said 
Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told CNBC  however  that he would have made the opposite decision with regard to American Express s contract with Costco 
Buffett also criticized companies that repurchase their own shares at too high a price   They have in mind a limit as to what they pay for any business they buy except their own  and it has become fashionable to repurchase shares  
Buffett  who has ordered that most of the money he is not giving away at his death should be placed in an index fund  also said active investing as a whole was  certain  to produce worse than average results 
Buffett and Munger added to previous criticisms they have made of embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  International Inc s drug price hikes 
Buffett said there  really wasn t any defense  for Valeant s price hikes  while Munger said Valeant was  leading the pack  of certain industry players who were raising prices dramatically 
 I don t think you d want your son to grow up and run a company in the manner that Valeant was run   Buffett said 

Munger said he suspected it was  massively stupid  for the U S  government to rely heavily on printing money and lightly on fiscal stimulus for infrastructure  and that the United States would have been better off with more fiscal stimulus ",2016-05-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/warren-buffett-says-more-likely-to-buy-ibm-shares-than-sell:-cnbc-399250,399250
144313,365828,COST,The True Cost Of Tariffs For The U S ,opinion,"Trump strikes again  In a surprise tweet last Thursday  President Donald Trump announced that  beginning June 10  the U S  would impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U S  from Mexico  until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico  and into our Country  STOP   The tariff is scheduled to rise incrementally to a hefty 25 percent through October 
Tariffs are essentially taxes that are paid by U S  based importing companies  which then pass the extra expenses along to the end consumer  If Trump s Mexico tariff goes into effect  in fact  it will be the largest tax hike on Americans in approximately 30 years  As such  tariffs are inflationary  Historically  faster inflation has boosted investor demand for Gold  and indeed  the price of the yellow metal crossed above  1 320 an ounce on Monday for the first time since late March 
Gold miners have also increased sharply  The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index jumped nearly 4 percent in intraday trading on Friday  the group s biggest one day gain in two years  The S P 500 Index  meanwhile  lost some  1 5 trillion in market cap in the month of May 
Investors also sought protection in U S  Treasuries  whose yields fell to a fresh 2019 low  This pushed the already invented yield curve between the 10 Year and 3 Month Treasuries deeper into negative territory  On Friday the yield curve sunk to 17 basis points  bps   its lowest level since well before the financial crisis  An inverted yield curve has preceded every U S  recession over the last 60 years 
Tariffs Against Mexico Will Hit Middle Class Americans
In 2018  the total value of imports from Mexico stood at  346 billion  A 5 percent tariff on this volume amounts to a  17 billion hit on the U S  economy  At 25 percent  this cost surges to a whopping  87 billion To be sure  this will have a much more direct inflationary impact on middle class Americans than tariffs on Chinese goods have had so far  That s because Mexico besides being the number one exporter of car parts and vehicles to the U S  is also America s top supplier of agricultural goods  with exports totaling  26 billion in 2018 alone  Fresh fruits and vegetables  valued at a combined  11 7 billion   beer and wine   3 6 billion   snack foods   2 2 billion  and more are all set to rise in price at your local grocery store if the 5 percent tariff takes effect as planned 
Think I m exaggerating  On an investor conference call last week  Costco  NASDAQ COST  Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said   At the end of the day  prices will go up on things  due to tariffs on Chinese and now Mexican made goods 
For some idea of what might happen with food prices  take a look at what corn has done in the past month alone  Granted  this price jump is due to inclement weather  which put U S  famers behind in their planting schedule  But imagine all of your tomatoes  avocados  cucumbers  onions  strawberries and other produce from Mexico making similar moves  This would have a serious multiplying effect on the U S  economy Vehicle prices are also likely to climb  In a press release dated May 31  Matt Blunt  president of the American Automotive Policy Council  AAPC   wrote that tariffs against Mexico will undermine the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  the not yet ratified replacement for NAFTA and  would impose significant cost on the U S  auto industry  
Speaking specifically of General Motors  NYSE GM   Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said that the 5 percent tax could result in a significant  several hundred million dollar  impact to the carmaker s annual earnings  Shares of GM  Ford and Fiat Chrysler were all down significantly in Friday trading 
Widespread Negative Impact Of Tariffs 
Taken as a whole  the Mexican tariffs could very well end up being the one policy that costs Trump many die hard supporters who have stuck with him up until now 
On Thursday  the U S  Chamber of Commerce the staunchly Republican business lobbyist group condemned the president s plan  writing that  tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move  These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border  
High ranking Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa  who has also safely been in Trump s corner on most policies  came close to suggesting the imposition of tariffs was an abuse of power   Trade policy and border security are separate issues   Grassley said   This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent  
Further  Grassley commented that the tariffs could risk the ratification of the USMCA  one of the president s greatest achievements in his two and a half year old administration 
Further still  the tariffs could sabotage any chance of a trade resolution with China  In a note to investors  Raymond James public policy analyst Ed Mills wrote that he views the president s actions as  further deteriorating the U S  China trade fight  Chinese officials have stated their concern about the reliability of President Trump as a trading partner  These tariffs were announced the same day as significant advancement of the USMCA  If China does not believe a deal will stick  why negotiate  
While I m on the subject of China  the number of Chinese tourists to the U S  fell 5 7 percent in 2018 from the previous year  the first time that s happened since 2003  Trade tensions between the two economic superpowers appear to be a huge contributing factor  Hopefully  this isn t the start of a trend  as Chinese tourists top the list of the world s biggest spenders 
Is Gold The Solution 
All of this is ample reason to ensure that you have some gold in your portfolio  I always advocate the 10 percent  Golden Rule  That means I think you should have half of that 10 percent in gold coins  bars and 24 karat jewelry  The other half should be in high quality gold mining stocks and funds  Make sure you rebalance at least once a year 
One of the biggest proponents of gold is the Austrian school of economics  which emphasizes self reliance and individualism  Because fiat currencies are solely based on the faith and credit of the economy  they have no intrinsic value and are prone to huge swings  according to Austrian economic thought 
Gold  on the other hand  is nobody s liability  As destructive as socialist policies can be to business and capital  they can t reduce the value of your gold  In fact  the inverse is true  Historically  the more debt that the government accrues  and the higher the inflation gets  the more valuable the yellow metal has become

144314,365829,COST,Perfect Storm Brewing for Price Inflation,opinion,"A  perfect storm  is brewing for midwestern farmers  Unending rains have led to the flooding of tens of millions of acres of farmland  The deluge comes on the heels of years of low crop prices 
It has the makings of an agriculture disaster on a scale never seen before 
The nation may see a  perfect storm  in terms of food inflation  Prices for some farm commodities figure to be a lot higher in the months ahead as markets adjust to dramatically lower crop yields  This will be coupled with price hikes associated with tariffs on all manner of goods from China and elsewhere 
To top it off  the Fed is signaling a reversal  The next move in interest rates now figures to be lower 
Grain and soybean prices are already on the move  Corn prices began climbing rapidly in early May  Today the price per bushel is 20  higher than a month ago  Wheat prices are 7  above the lows of a month ago  and soybeans are 11  higher 
Chinese tariffs on U S  agricultural products pushed prices lower earlier in the year  However  the longer term effect of those particular tariffs may wind up being less than many think  The market for food commodities is global and demand is somewhat inelastic 
More than a billion Chinese need to be fed  What they don t purchase directly from the U S  will need to be purchased elsewhere  We can expect to see an increase in American exports to other places 
President Trump increased the tariffs on Chinese imports from 10  to 25   Americans can look forward to paying higher costs for many consumer goods in the months ahead  The chart below shows recent CPI data through April 
Costco  NASDAQ COST  told investors to watch for higher prices on the merchandise they sell in the most recent earnings call  The retail giant recently declared  prices will go up on things  
Fed Chair Powell is using the tariffs and the prospect of price inflation as justification for changing course  He said last week the central bank  will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   He and his cohorts stand ready to combat a weakening jobs market and dwindling international trade by lowering interest rates 
Bond yields are deeply inverted  Historically inversions of this sort have been a dark omen  They often signal a recession and falling stock prices 
Given the central bankers  obsession with stock prices and ongoing pressure from the Trump administration to avoid any major correction  the Fed moving preemptively to cut interest rates isn t surprising 
However  it isn t at all certain that lowering rates now can forestall what is coming  Individuals and corporations have already binged on debt  The growing mountain of borrowed money is weakening the nation s economic prospects  not making them stronger 
The adjacent chart is telling 
Stock prices are riding upon the  Fed Put   There is no great earnings strength anymore  Stock investors simply won t sell stocks because they anticipate the Fed will step in with stimulus 
That expectation is 100  logical given the central bank s track record  But logic also dictates something else  stock prices will one day reflect earnings reality 
If lowering rates doesn t work to prop up stock prices  we can count on the Fed to double down by dropping rates again or by finding even more exotic and aggressive ways to stimulate 
This all amounts to bad news for the U S  dollar and for consumers who will have to contend with higher prices 
But there is a silver lining for precious metals investors 
Concerns over price inflation have been absent from the markets for nearly a decade  Gold and silver markets are heavily reliant upon safe haven demand as a key driver  With powerful inflationary forces now building  that demand looks like it s about to surge 
Clint Siegner is a Director at Money Metals Exchange  the national precious metals company named 2015  Dealer of the Year  in the United States by an independent global ratings group  A graduate of Linfield College in Oregon  Siegner puts his experience in business management along with his passion for personal liberty  limited government  and honest money into the development of Money Metals  brand and reach  This includes writing extensively on the bullion markets and their intersection with policy and world affairs ",2019-06-10,Stefan Gleason,https://www.investing.com/analysis/perfect-storm-brewing-for-price-inflation-200430183,200430183
144317,365832,COST,7 Eleven announces plans to transition to cage free eggs by 2025,news,"Investing com    Following the lead of a growing list of prominent restaurant chains and grocery stores in recent months  7 Eleven announced on Tuesday that it will move to exclusively serve cage free eggs in the U S  and Canada by 2025 
7 Eleven  which operates more than 17 000 stores in North America  took steps in February to improve its breakfast menu when it unveiled two new sandwiches  including the Bacon  Egg and Cheese Breakfast melt  Prior to the launch  the convenience store already sold more than 1 million of its protein rich Melt sandwiches per day  The company did not announce plans on Tuesday to curtail usage of cage produced eggs in its Melt sandwiches immediately 
 7 Eleven cares about the treatment of animals and switching to cage free eggs demonstrates our concern   said Jesus Delgado Jenkins  executive vice president and chief merchandising officer for 7 Eleven   We believe that it is becoming important to our customers for us to serve more humanely sourced eggs  
The announcement comes several months after McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  launched an initiative to transition entirely to cage free eggs over the next 10 years  By the end of 2017  Burger King plans to eschew cage produced eggs  while SBUX plans on doing the same by 2020  Meanwhile  Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT   Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  and Trader Joe s sell exclusively cage free eggs from their private labels and Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM  does not sell any eggs from caged hens 
Cage free eggs are produced by free roaming hens which typically have unlimited access to fresh food and water without being constrained to a narrow living area  Some free range hens with access to outdoor environments subsist on diets consisting of grain feed  wild plants and insects  By comparison  as recently as 2010 nearly 95  of egg laying hens in the U S  lived in tight caged quarters in packs of five to 10 with little room to spread their wings  according to the United Egg Producers 
At the same time  cage free eggs do have their drawbacks  Hens from non cage systems are reputed to have higher mortality rates  lower rates of egg production and require more feed to produce a dozen eggs  resulting in poor feed conversion 
In March  Bloomberg reported that cage free eggs at  3 42 per dozen  can cost a U S  consumer nearly twice as much as conventional eggs  A month earlier  SAFE  an animal welfare group in New Zealand estimated that a ban on caged eggs could families nationwide an additional  164 per month ",2016-05-03,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/7-eleven-announces-plans-to-transition-to-cage-free-eggs-by-2025-399667,399667
144318,365833,COST,Put Your Trust In Gold,opinion,"Americans  trust in institutions  from the federal government to banks to the news media  has been deteriorating for decades  Sixty years ago  three quarters of Americans expressed faith in the government to do the right thing  most of the time  or  just about always   Today  only one in five people  a near record low  believes our leaders make decisions in the country s best interest 
The news media fares just as poorly  A new survey finds that Americans believe  fake news  is a bigger problem right now than violent crime  illegal immigration and terrorism 
Just take a look at the chart below  based on Gallup polling data going back to 1973  Whether it s newspapers  television news or  more recently  online news  Americans  faith is steadily eroding  Last year  the percent of Americans who said they have a  great deal  or  quite a lot  of confidence in newspapers stood at a near record low of 23 percent  Trust in television and online news was even lower 
So where can you still put your trust in today s often cynical world  Friends and family  Our churches and other religious organizations  Our jobs 
As an investor  I continue to have great faith in gold as a store of value during times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty  It s behaved precisely as I expect it to  In response to heightened global trade concerns and weakening economic indicators  investors have piled into the yellow metal  pushing its price up for a remarkable eight straight days as of last Friday  We haven t seen such a winning streak since June 2014  when gold traded up for 10 straight days 
Late last week  it was within striking distance of its 2019 high of about  1 356 an ounce  which should spur even more investors to get off the sidelines and participate Indeed  there are a number of warning signs that suggest investors should proceed with caution as the U S  economic expansion turns 10 years old  Global manufacturing growth reversed for the first time since 2012  with the purchasing manager s index  PMI  falling for a record 13 months in May 
This weakness turned up in the monthly jobs reports from the federal government and payroll services provider Automatic Data Processing  ADP  NASDAQ ADP    The Labor Department reported Friday that U S  employment edged up only 75 000 in May  far below expectations of 175 000 
According to ADP  the U S  added 27 000 jobs  making May the weakest month for job gains in more than nine years  I don t know about you  but I can t help reading this as a direct negative consequence of the White House s escalating trade war with China and earlier threat to impose a tariff on all imports from Mexico  The U S  goods producing sector was hit hardest  with construction losing 36 000 positions  natural resources and mining losing 4 000 and manufacturing losing 3 000  The 5 percent Mexican tariff was  indefinitely suspended   according to Trump Friday evening  in exchange for Mexico doing more to stem the flow of illegal immigration into the U S 
As I ve explained elsewhere  tariffs are essentially taxes and  as such  they re inflationary  This has historically supported the price of gold 
Besides Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Costco  NASDAQ COST   a number of other retailers have been telling customers and investors that prices will be going up thanks to the Chinese tariff  Discount retailer Five Below said it will likely need to raise prices on certain items above  5 for the first time  Dollar General  NYSE DG  and Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  both alerted shoppers that they will be  facing higher prices as 2019 progresses  
Discussing the trade war  JPMorgan s Michael Cembalest  who hosts the  Eye on the Market  podcast  reminded listeners last week of an article written back in August 2015 by Trump s National Economic Council director  Larry Kudlow  and former Trump pick for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Stephen Moore  In the article  titled  Why Trump s protectionist ways will hurt the economy   Kudlow and Moore compared then candidate Trump unfavorably to Herbert Hoover  the last Republican  trade protectionist  
 Does Trump aspire to be a 21st century Hoover with a modernized platform of the 1930 Smoot Hawley tariff that helped send the U S  and world economy into a decade long depression and a collapse of the banking system   the two asked 
For better or worse  we may end up getting an answer to this question in the coming weeks and months 
What the Gold Silver Ratio Is Telling Us
Another sign of slowing economic growth is the gold  ratio  This ratio tells you how many ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of gold  Last week it crossed above 90 for the first time in 26 years  meaning silver has not been this undervalued relative to gold since the first year of Bill Clinton s first term  silverThe reason this is important is that half of silver demand comes from industrial applications  When the demand cools  the price of silver falls  One of the metal s primary uses is in semiconductors  sales of which have been slipping  According to the Semiconductor Industry Association  SIA   global sales were  32 1 billion in April  a 14 6 percent decrease from the same month last year  This is the deepest plunge since the financial crisis 
Buying silver  then  could be a contrarian play  but I recommend also that you maintain a 10 percent weighting in gold  Although the yellow metal s price surged last week  it s still not quite in overbought territory when you look at the 14 day relative strength index  RSI   There could be further upside potential  especially if Trump revisits the Mexican tariff

144323,365838,COST,Costco  COST  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Costco  COST  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this warehouse club operator is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Costco is 9 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 8  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Costco is 13 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 3 6  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Costco  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Costco has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

144338,365853,COST,Wall Street indecisive amidst positive data and volatile swings in oil ,news,"Investing com   After opening the session with losses  Wall Street followed oil s turnaround into positive territory but was unable to hold gains amidst worries that recent economic data gives the Federal Reserve more reason to begin gradual rate hikes this year 
Oil prices spent most of Wednesday s trading in the red after the American Petroleum Institute  an industry group  said that U S  oil inventories rose by 9 9 million barrels in the week ended February 26  surprising market players who were expecting a gain of 2 5 million barrels 
Crude plunged even further after the U S  Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories soared by a whopping 10 4 million barrels in the week ended February 26  almost triple the consensus estimate 
Nevertheless  black gold staged a quick recovery taking it to session highs above  35  Amidst severe volatility  at 16 33GMT or 11 33AM ET  gains moved off Wednesday s high and crude oil futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange advanced  0 21  or 0 61   to trade at  34 61 a barrel  while Brent oil rose  0 18 or 0 49  to  37 01 
The recovery in oil pushed U S  stocks briefly into positive territory  but they were unable to maintain their enthusiasm  At 16 37GMT or 11 37AM ET  the Dow 30 shed 7 points or 0 04   while the S P 500 slipped 2 points or 0 10  and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite lossed 13 points or 0 27  
On the data front  a report from payroll processing firm ADP showed that non farm private employment rose by a seasonally adjusted 214 000 last month  surpassing expectations for an increase of 190 000  There was a caveat in the fact that 208 000 of those contracts were creating in the services sector  but the number still adds another positive read to recent data that could force the Federal Reserve to start tightening monetary policy this year 
San Francisco Fed president John Williams showed a more hawkish stance in an interview with Financial Times  He told the British financial paper that he doesn t understand warnings about an imminent U S  recession as there are no signs of weakening domestic demand which is more than compensating for economic slack abroad  In line with the U S  central bank s current rhetoric  Williams repeated that Fed rate hikes would be gradual 
After the recent flow of positive economic indicators  traders raised bets for the Fed to hike rates this year  They now see a 38  chance for a June boost in borrowing costs  up from about 26  a week ago  according to Bloomberg data  The probability for a December hike increased to 64  from 42  last Wednesday

Friday s U S  jobs report will be the week s major event stateside with current consensus expecting the creation of 190 000 non farm payrolls during February with the unemployment rate forecast to remain unchanged at 4 9  
Mohamed El Erian  chief economic adviser at Allianz  DE ALVG   was making the rounds at major financial media in the U S  on Thursday and pointed out that any number above 150 000 would be a consolidation of an  impressive two and a half year run in employment creation  that left the jobless rate at level more than 50  below the post crisis high 
El Erian reflected on the market concern of a strong report pushing the Federal Reserve to continue tightening its monetary policy  with the U S  central bank looking for  every opportunity  to make another rate hike  but insisted that an improved U S  labor market is  what we all need  
 No matter what some say about short term potential inconsistencies between a strong jobs report and a stock market that is highly dependent on central banks  there is in fact an important long term alignment   El Erian stressed in an op ed article in Bloomberg 
 A three pronged improvement in the labor market is a necessary condition for anchoring higher inclusive growth  lower inequality and genuine financial stability   he explained 
Meanwhile  investors were still waiting for several data points to be published stateside on Thursday  The U S  was to release the weekly report on initial jobless claims along with non farm productivity and unit labor costs for the fourth quarter at 15 30GMT  or 8 30AM ET  followed by the U S  Institute of Supply Management s report on service sector growth for February and January factory orders at 15 00GMT  or 10 00AM ET

On the economic front  service sector activity in the U S  grew at the slowest pace in almost two years in February  dampening optimism over the health of the economy and dimming the case for higher interest rates later this year  according to the non manufacturing PMI from the Institute of Supply Management  while the final reading of services PMI from Markit showed the first contraction since October 2013 
Additionally  the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U S  last week rose to a four week high  worse than the consensus forecast  Nevertheless  the U S  Department of Labor data has been below the 300 000 mark usually associated with a firming labor market for near on a year  Furthermore  the four week moving average  considered a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week to week data  fell to its lowest level since late November 
In other data points released on Thursday  non farm productivity  fell less sharply in the fourth quarter than originally thought  although unit labor costs rose less than expected 
Meanwhile  factory orders  for January rose by a less than expected 1 6   However  the first increase since October fueled hopes that the U S  has seen the end of the factory slump 
With regard to monetary policy  Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan warned on Thursday that the Fed should be patient with further rate hikes 
Kaplan also commented that he did not expect a balancing in the oil market until well in to 2017  In that light  black gold showed choppy trade throughout the session but managed to recover from losses and post gains  Crude oil futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange advanced  0 18  or 0 52   to trade at  34 84 a barrel by 16 39GMT  or 11 39AM ET  while Brent oil rose  0 01 or 0 03  to  36 94

first U S  businessmen to manufacture in Cuba with a plan to build low cost tractors designed for Cuban farms  largely run by private cooperatives  Their project has U S  approval and Cuba s Communist

more than half a century of antagonism between the two countries  Obama has redefined relations with Cuba in the last 15 months  and Cuba is changing  But its leaders are wary of moving too quickly   What is perceived on the outside as slow progress is really the way of Cubans assuring themselves of the trust that is necessary to be built   Berenthal said  Obama arrives in Havana on Sunday for a historic visit that seals a rapprochement he and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed in December 2014 after 18 months of secret negotiations  Since then  Havana has changed noticeably  The number of U

Cuba  It was the fifth time he has used executive powers to boost ties with Cuba  sidestepping the Republican controlled Congress which has refused to lift a 54 year old economic embargo against the island  Cuba s government has yet to fully reciprocate  Cuba did agree to roaming deals with U S  telecommunications operators and restoring scheduled commercial airline service  two deals that bring more revenue to the government  When it comes to Obama s overtures to the Cuba s small but growing private sector  however  the government has been more deliberate  It has yet to accept U S  sales of farming equipment and construction materials to private businesses  which were authorized by Obama   Market style reforms  introduced by Raul Castro in 2011 to  update  Cuba s socialist model  have been implemented haltingly  even reversed in some areas  The government recently attempted restoring price controls on fresh food markets in Havana  Many traits of communism remain  Political dissent is repressed  commercial property cannot be bought and sold and the government still controls imports and exports   There is no wholesale market for most private enterprises  forcing shopkeepers to buy inventory at state retail prices or resort to trickery or the black market    Cuba has already changed  but needs more   said Niuris Higueras  owner of the Atelier restaurant  one of the trendiest spots in Havana s dining scene  She said business grew 50 percent over the past year   We need to link up with the U S  market   Higueras said   There needs to be more access to U S  products here in Cuba  We need  Home Depot   NYSE HD   a Walmart  NYSE WMT   a Costco  NASDAQ COST   A Restaurant Depot would be fabulous   OBAMA  TRADE NOW  POLITICS LATER While the ice has been broken on commerce  Castro insists there will be no change to one party rule   U S  backed dissidents are still detained for attempting unauthorized political demonstrations and opponents of Obama s opening to Cuba say he has rewarded Castro without receiving concessions in return  The White House counters that helping stimulate a vibrant private sector is good for ordinary Cubans and offers a more promising path toward political change than the decades old policy of isolation  While the date of Dec  17  2014  marks the most significant turning point in U S  Cuban relations  the Obama policy that has so far had most impact on the lives of ordinary Cubans was implemented in 2009  just three months into his presidency  It was then he ordered the lifting of travel restrictions on Cuban Americans visiting relatives in Cuba and the removal of limits on remittances to relatives on the island  Cuban Americans can now come and go freely and send as much money as they want to their families  That has financed a boom in small businesses and home repairs and jolted the nascent real estate market  Castro s own reforms have also helped grow the private sector  Today some 500 000 Cubans  or 10 percent of the workforce  are registered to work in private businesses  including restaurants  car repair workshops  homes rented out to tourists  beauty parlors and English language schools  Some 70 percent of the 1 million strong agricultural workforce is private with many Cubans working on state farms that have converted into cooperatives and owning equal stakes in the business   John Kavulich  president of the U S  Cuba Trade and Economic Council  which has been tracking Cuba for more than 20 years  says the changes have lifted expectations  especially inside the budding middle class    There is now additional pressure from within for structural changes to the ideological foundation of the country  Cuba must do more than reform the commercial and economic sectors of the country  It must aggressively redefine the revolution   Kavulich said  While Cuban dissidents and Obama s critics at home prioritize the issue of human rights  others are more concerned about economic growth and better living conditions   No one is talking about the visit in terms of democracy  human rights or the opposition  There is still no culture around freedom of expression   Anaida Gonzalez  a retired nurse in central Camaguey province  said in a telephone interview   People have too many problems in their daily lives  What they want is for their lives to improve and they associate that with the embargo   she said   Most Cubans live on state salaries that average  25 a month plus a monthly ration card that provides about a week s worth of food and household supplies  
 It would be a mistake to assume most Cubans prioritize political questions and are scared to express themselves   said Carlos Alzugaray  a retired Cuban diplomat and professor specializing in U S  Cuban relations   They hope to live better  Change  political and economic  is coming to Cuba anyway  but on our own terms  ",2016-03-17,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/cuba-changing,-but-only-slowly,-since-obama's-policy-shift-390477",390477

144373,365888,COST,American Express looks to grow small business loan revenue,news,"By Olivia Oran
 Reuters     American Express  Co  N AXP  wants to grow small business lending to make up for revenue it expects to lose after its credit card partnership with Costco Wholesale Corp  O COST  ends this year  Last week  American Express said it will pay an undisclosed amount to feature its charge cards on Fundera  an online marketplace  AmEx hopes small business owners will compare loan terms and rates and choose its cards over traditional loans  The company is bracing for the end of co branded cards with Costco that accounted for 8 percent of worldwide annual spending on AmEx cards in 2014  and 20 percent of the company s outstanding loans 
The planned end of the partnership in March has been delayed a few months because it has taken more time to move customers to a new card  the Seattle Times reported last week 
To make up for that lost revenue  American Express has focused on small business loans  where it already has a foothold  It views small business cards as an area with room to grow in the near term  unlike consumer spending 
In 2014  American Express cards for small businesses funded  190 billion in purchases  up from  122 billion in 2010  The company considers cards an untapped form of small business funding  because small businesses tend to rely more heavily on cash and traditional loans  Only 10 percent of small business spending takes place on cards 
At AmEx s investor day last year  management highlighted its small business loan operation as an area of focus 
 One of the very most important things we re doing as a company is lending and funding   David Rabkin  AmEx s senior vice president of small business customer acquisition  said in an interview   Putting our cards on Fundera marketplace is part of that   The charge cards American Express offers on Fundera  called Open  are designed for companies that need to fund large spot purchases of inventory or raw materials  and can pay off the balance in full each month  The Open cards do not charge interest  but carry an annual fee  Spending limits adjust with usage and payment history 

There may be pain ahead as American Express works to grow small business lending  The credit card business has gotten more competitive because banks and card issuers view the loans and transaction fees as a relatively stable source of revenue  Also  consumer spending has slowed despite cheaper gasoline  American Express shares have fallen 25 percent so far this year  The company plans to cut  1 billion in costs by the end of 2017 ",2016-02-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/american-express-looks-to-grow-small-business-loan-revenue-383979,383979

144416,365931,COST,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Costco  COST ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Costco  COST  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this warehouse club operator is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Costco is 9 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 15 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 4  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Costco is 13 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 3 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Costco have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Costco a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Costco is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-costco-cost-200407659,200407659

The company s U S  Card Services business reported a 6 percent rise in revenue to  4 7 billion  net of interest expense 
Costs at this business rose 4 percent to  3 billion  partly driven by expenses from previously renewed co brand partnerships  the company said 
There is stiff competition in the industry to bag prominent  co brand  deals  in which card issuers team up with prominent corporate partners   often supermarkets or airlines   to sell cards 
AmEx  whose brand image relies on catering mainly to wealthy corporate clients  has lost a couple of lucrative co brand contracts this year because it charges higher prices than rival card issuers

customers and getting  Visa Inc   NYSE V  to shoulder at least some of the burden of the lost revenue  underscoring how the largest U S  bank s size can help it hang onto business in fiercely competitive markets  At stake are the billions of dollars that banks receive annually from consumer use of a credit card to pay a retailer  Chase  which generated roughly  3 6 billion of revenue last year from those fees  is increasingly occupied with fending off banking rivals like  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   as well as Silicon Valley companies such as Paypal Inc and Square Inc   Chase s revenue from those fees is showing signs of eroding  In the first half of 2015  fee income in the bank s credit and debit card business fell 2 percent from the same period a year earlier  even as the bank processed a higher volume of transactions  A person familiar with the matter said lower processing fees were a critical part of that decline    JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon pledged in an April letter to shareholders  to be very aggressive in growing this business   At a conference with securities analysts in February  he cited the credit card operation as an example of how JPMorgan has to cut prices and upgrade products to keep from falling behind competitors   In a capitalist world   Dimon said   you ve got to be giving the client more  better  faster  quicker  or you lose   Credit card fees generated about 4 percent of the bank s revenue in 2014  but analysts said that much of that money has historically fallen to the bottom line  making it a critical support for the bank s  22 billion of annual profits   To stem the decline  Chase is assembling a vast array of parts into what will become either a brilliant machine or a makeshift disappointment  A key part of the strategy came in 2013  when Chase inked a deal with Visa that allowed the bank to essentially lease Visa s network for 10 years at what industry sources said is a fixed rate  There are some signs that the Visa deal is starting to pay off for Chase  This year  the bank won the right to process credit card transactions for customers of Marriott International at some 3 700 hotels in the U S  and Canada and for  Chevron   NYSE CVX  USA at nearly 8 000 gas stations   Steve Mott  an independent payments consultant said   Fizzle was the watchword until they got the Chevron deal    Some wonder if the bank is wasting its time   So far  there is no evidence that it has mattered in a way that changes market share   said veteran card company analyst Craig Maurer of Autonomous Research  BRAINCHILD Chase s efforts are the brainchild of Gordon Smith  the head of JPMorgan s consumer business  who joined Chase in 2007 after 26 years at  American Express   NYSE AXP   He is trying to recreate large parts of American Express inside of JPMorgan Chase  the largest U S  bank by assets  An American Express spokeswoman declined to comment  To imitate American Express  Smith needed a few components  When a consumer pays for a sweater at a department store with a credit card  three parties usually get involved  money moves from the bank that issues the consumer s credit card through a network like Visa or MasterCard to the bank that processes transactions for the retailer  Each of those three  the two banks and the network  collects a fee for its role   American Express usually occupies all three links of the chain  But Chase  without borrowing Visa s network  was only able to be two of the three  the bank for retailers and the bank that issued the credit card to the consumer  The deal that Chase signed with Visa allows the bank to essentially serve as all three links  which in the near term gives it more leeway to cut costs   Longer term  the deal with Visa will allow Chase to corral more information about what its customers are up to  said Mike Passilla  the Chase executive running this effort  in an interview  When a retailer uses Chase to process its credit card transactions  it can now sign up for a service known as ChaseNet  which means that when a consumer buys something with a credit card issued by Chase  the bank will process the transaction from start to finish  essentially serving as all three links in the chain   When that happens  Chase can charge the retailers lower fees for processing partly because of terms it negotiated with Visa  although the details of how much lower the charges can be have not been disclosed  Consumers may never know that ChaseNet exists  Their cards feature a Visa brand  and they can use them wherever Visa cards are accepted  ChaseNet works only when Chase is both the consumer s bank and the retailer s bank  That could happen fairly often  because Chase is second only to American Express among U S  issuers in spending on cards  with market share of 19 4 percent last year  according to the Nilson Report  Chase is the biggest U S  card issuer by outstanding balances  according to Nilson  Having the chance to cut fees for retailers is important now because many merchants are pressing on every front for lower processing costs  Retailers have won court cases against card companies over pricing in recent years  Mark Horwedel  CEO of the Merchants Advisory Group  said merchants expect more concessions because they have seen regulators in Europe move to cap fees on credit cards at about 15 percent of U S  levels  Costco Wholesale Corp is widely believed to have chiseled lower fees out of Citigroup and Visa when it decided to stop using American Express as its transaction processing bank  and to stop putting its brand on American Express cards  Costco  NASDAQ COST  declined to comment on the specific terms of its agreement with Citi and Visa  Neither Visa  nor Chase  which is the biggest issuer of its cards  have disclosed the terms of their deal  but payments experts believe both sides had reasons to sign on the dotted line  For Visa  it was the chance to lock in 10 years of business from the biggest issuer on their network  without the fear of their fleeing for rival MasterCard Inc  For Chase  the deal gives it the chance to run as much additional volume over the network as it can gather for no extra cost  which gives it more leeway to cut rates to retailers  two people in the industry said   The bank s sales pitch has worked on at least some companies  Michael Cullen  a finance executive for Marriott International  said that Chase s deal with his hotel company will yield  significant  cost savings  He added that the bank s history of investments in its credit card business gives him confidence that Chase will keep up with technology and customer demand for advanced payment devices and spending information   Payment processing is such an important part of the business   Cullen said   You re going to go with the provider that has the technology and the customer base and is investing

commercial  education and transportation Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is highly sensitive to the strength of the economy  Although a slowing housing market in

spending  Millennials represents the largest consumer cohort in the furniture market  More money in the hands of this largest and most active generation of homebuyers should keep demand high  Meanwhile  industry players are making investments in new products to improve product mix in a competitive landscape and drive top line growth  However  the furniture industry is highly competitive

144510,366025,COST,Is Costco Wholesale  COST  Outperforming Other Retail Wholesale Stocks This Year ,opinion,"For those looking to find strong Retail Wholesale stocks  it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers  Costco Wholesale  COST  is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors  but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole  A quick glance at the company s year to date performance in comparison to the rest of the Retail Wholesale sector should help us answer this question 
Costco Wholesale is one of 218 companies in the Retail Wholesale group  The Retail Wholesale group currently sits at  9 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months  COST is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for COST s full year earnings has moved 3 45  higher within the past quarter  This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock s earnings outlook is improving 
Based on the latest available data  COST has gained about 18 86  so far this year  Meanwhile  the Retail Wholesale sector has returned an average of 15 86  on a year to date basis  This shows that Costco Wholesale is outperforming its peers so far this year 
Breaking things down more  COST is a member of the Retail   Discount Stores industry  which includes 10 individual companies and currently sits at  99 in the Zacks Industry Rank  On average  stocks in this group have gained 16 73  this year  meaning that COST is performing better in terms of year to date returns

144511,366026,COST,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Costco  COST  Now,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Costco  COST  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this warehouse club operator a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Costco is 9 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 15 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 4  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Costco is 13 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 3 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Costco  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Costco has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

144512,366027,COST,Japan s Ezaki Glico aims to conquer world with Pocky stick snacks,news,"By Chang Ran Kim and Ritsuko Shimizu OSAKA  Reuters    For the first time in its 92 year history  Japanese snacks maker Ezaki Glico  T 2206  is getting serious about growing overseas  aiming to fatten its Pocky biscuit into a  1 billion brand to rival global giants such as Hershey s and Oreo 
The company s Glico brand and its 48 year old stick shaped  chocolate coated Pocky pretzels are household names in Japan but elsewhere the marque has stalled  capping the firm s overseas business at just a tenth of its  3 billion revenue 
Now  the company is rewriting its branding and marketing strategies for Pocky  targeting a more than doubling in sales to  1 billion by 2020  Only 21 snack brands in the world belong to the billion dollar club  none of them Asian 
The plan involves the adoption of the Pocky name everywhere except Europe  where a joint venture is complicating matters  plus uniform new packaging and a universal tagline   Share Happiness  
 The hurdles are high  but if they succeed it would mean a huge boost to profits   said Tomonobu Tsunoyama  senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center  the research arm of Tokai Tokyo Securities 
The task has fallen on Tsuyoshi Matsuki  appointed as global brand manager for Pocky  a post created in Thailand in 2012 
To strengthen the product s brand identity  Matsuki standardised the package design to a red box for regular chocolate flavoured Pocky  and came up with the new marketing slogan  This year in Malaysia  he re branded the snack from  Rocky   its name there for the past four decades 
 Sales were left mostly up to local distributors in Malaysia   Matsuki told Reuters at Ezaki Glico s office in Osaka   Now  we re going to the stores directly for marketing and maybe next year we ll start running TV commercials to give brand recognition and sales a boost  
That tactic has worked in Indonesia  where sales quintupled in 2013 as Glico enlisted popular girl band JKT48 to plug Pocky on TV  Sales staff also regularly visit Jakarta s schools to hand out free samples from red Pocky vans 
Such efforts boosted Pocky s worldwide sales across 30 markets by a third to around  400 million in 2013 
BLAZING THE TRAIL
Still  challenges abound 
While rivals such as Hershey s  Oreo and KitKat are big in the West  Pocky s global push is starting in Southeast Asia  where Pocky is priced out of reach for many 
 One major difficulty is penetrating the low income groups  We lose on price against simple snacks like Oreo   Matsuki said  noting that lowering the price was one option 
 But then  Pocky has the advantage of being unique  
Indeed  the snack requires an elaborate production process 
At a factory near Tokyo  noodle shaped lines of dough disappear into a 45 metre long oven whose temperature varies from start to end  Cuts are made in the dough just deep enough to ensure the biscuit breaks off after   not before   it s baked to form a straight edge  The chocolate coating process is tightly guarded as a company secret 
But that hasn t prevented the inevitable copycat products  whose quality Matsuki concedes is improving 
 They re also cheaper than ours  so it s a bit of a headache  
Another challenge is the brand name itself 
In Europe  Pocky is sold as Mikado in a joint venture with Mondelez International  O MDLZ    the maker of Oreo  Nabisco and other billion dollar snacks   and Ezaki Glico would need its partner s agreement if it wanted to re brand 
 For now  we ll stay with Mikado   Matsuki said 
In the United States  meanwhile  Pocky is still a niche  sold mainly at Asian stores or the Asian section of supermarkets  Big retailers like Wal Mart Stores  N WMT  and Costco  O COST  mainly carry generic brands  leaving room for just a few non generic products 
By 2020  Matsuki expects Pocky to have only a limited foothold in the U S  west coast   perhaps establishing a stick snack section with its non chocolate cousin Pretz   but not enough sales to pay for TV advertising 
 It s incredibly difficult to enter the United States as a newcomer   Matsuki said   But if we succeed in North America  we re talking about billions of dollars in sales  
Whether Matsuki succeeds could determine how Ezaki Glico as a whole does on the global stage 
 I look at my job as paving the path overseas for our other brands   he said

144517,366032,COST,Alibaba in major initiative to court China consumer for U S  retailers,news,"By Edwin Chan  Paul Carsten and John Ruwitch SAN FRANCISCO BEIJING SHANGHAI  Reuters    China s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  N BABA  plans a major move to win U S  business this year  by offering American retailers new ways to sell to China s vast and growing middle class  Anchored by Alipay  the dominant Chinese electronic payments system that works closely with Alibaba and is controlled by its executives  the world s largest Internet retailer is using the calling card of China s consumers to attract U S  partners  two sources close to the company told Reuters  Long seen as the most potent threat to Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  with  300 billion in global sales  the moves add up to a conservative approach to expanding in the United States  contrary to industry speculation that the company may be plotting a direct assault on U S  soil  That considered strategy  outlined to Reuters for the first time by the sources and executives who work directly with the Chinese company  is intended to heighten awareness in the United States of what Alibaba does  gain goodwill in an important Western market  and lay the groundwork for a longer term play  At the heart of its push are Alibaba s and Alipay s trial deals to handle Chinese sales  payment and shipping for some of the biggest names in U S  retail from Neiman Marcus Group  NMRCUS UL  to Saks Inc  Both confirmed the agreement but would not talk about how the pilots are faring  The Chinese companies will also work with U S  startup Shoprunner  an online mall for U S  retailers in which it owns a stake  and retail services provider Borderfree Inc  O BRDR  to court Chinese consumers  And Alibaba is preparing a marketing campaign to raise awareness among U S  businesses of its global business to business wholesale platform  Alibaba com  so they can buy and sell to and from global suppliers   They own the toll road into China   said Michael DeSimone  Chief Executive Officer of Borderfree   What really puts the jetpack on things when you deal with an Alipay is  they re on the ground and they know the Chinese consumer so well   Industry insiders point to just  15 billion in annual U S  to China  cross border consumer sales now  But Daiwa estimates cross border purchases  which exclude sales of American products within the country  can grow to 1 8 trillion yuan   291 billion  by 2020   It s not a big thing right now  but within the next 12 to 18 months what you ll see more of is bringing 300 million Chinese consumers to retailers in the U S    Alibaba Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai said in an interview with Reuters last year  He laid out the broad plan  and sources have now described details  Still  there s no guarantee of success   China s middle class is over 250 million strong and growing  spurred by government policy to create a more consumer driven economy  Apple iPhones and General Motors cars have become big selling status symbols  but the market remains a challenge for Western companies  especially those lacking a global footprint  Home Depot Inc decided in 2012 to shut all seven of its big box China stores  while in December  Best Buy said it will sell its struggling China business   And Alibaba s 10 month old effort to help foreign retailers set up shop in China  Tmall Global   its business to consumer website  has had muted success  Of 5 000 plus brands and 650 merchants that now sell on that site  just 30 have accumulated more than 10 million yuan in sales  according to the company  But there are signs of traction  Costco Wholesale Corp  O COST   which began selling on Tmall Global in November  saw sales of more than 40 million yuan in its first month of operations  according to data Alibaba provided to Reuters  And the site has attracted some 90 million unique visitors since launch  buying from 90 percent of listed merchants  KNOWING THE NAME Part of Alibaba s aim is to counter official concerns about Chinese mega corporations  In 2014  Alibaba hired former Treasury chief of staff James Wilkinson to help tailor its international strategy  and it has enlisted Korn Ferry to search for a Washington based international government affairs chief  Alipay and a logistics partner network that took years to assemble are central to Alibaba s U S  effort  Major brands  such as Nike  that have a large physical presence in China already sell directly on Tmall  But Alipay s effort directly connects American merchants with China  without the need for investment in a physical presence  It also allows U S  retailers and Chinese consumers to avoid difficulties associated with foreign exchange  Chinese consumers pay in yuan  U S  companies get paid in dollars  Alibaba s and Alipay s program for U S  companies is called ePass  It includes a customs pre approval process  a sort of  fast lane  that shaves days off delivery  Daiwa analysts John Choi and Alex Liu call that capability Alibaba s biggest advantage over rivals such as JD com  O JD   Alibaba and Alipay have made pilot agreements to handle payments and shipping to China for department stores Neiman  Saks  Macy s Inc  N M   Macy s Bloomingdale s chain  Ann Taylor  luxury fashion site Gilt  and apparel label Aeropostale  N ARO   according to Borderfree  The companies declined to comment  although Neiman  Saks and Ann Taylor confirmed the deal  If a Chinese consumer bought a pair of shoes from Saks  for instance  Alipay would handle the financial transaction  The shoes go to a U S  based Alipay facility that handles the transfer to China  After clearing customs  a local partner typically would handle final delivery  Alibaba has even taken on a role akin to a cultural liaison for U S  retailers  Tracey Weber  chief operating officer of online retailer Gilt  said that as their Alipay trial progressed  the Chinese company began increasingly to help with marketing and even product selection  advising them to use more red for instance  or to more prominently display cross body handbags popular in China   It is such a different environment   she said  Shoprunner  meanwhile  hired an ex Amazon executive to head up a new Shanghai office last year  and Chief Executive Scott Thompson said the startup is preparing a major marketing campaign in China in 2015       TARGETING COUNTERFEIT Alibaba also aims to draw in more U S  businesses to its Alibaba com portal  as buyers and sellers  One strategy is to reduce the number of counterfeit goods  a major problem in China and a concern for companies considering sharing intellectual property such as technology and designs  To that end  Alibaba has enlisted data company Dun   Bradstreet Credibility Corp  among others  to beef up a supplier certification program it hopes will help draw in many of the estimated 27 million small time American businesses and manufacturers that now operate mostly offline  Validation could allow both sides to assure themselves that they are working with legitimate partners  Jeff Stibel  who is heading up Dun   Bradstreet Credibility Corp s effort with Alibaba  said integration was starting  and it will launch its certification program early this year      Alibaba also has some plans to sell to Americans  Alibaba has a small U S  based portal  11Main com  a collection of Internet storefronts for smaller businesses and products from yoga mats to scented candles  While it focuses on U S  consumers  a quarter of its 1 4 million listed products can already be shipped to Asia  It hopes eventually to help sellers gain access to Alibaba s U S  Chinese corridor  11Main President Mike Effle told Reuters  Alibaba com itself is an avenue to sell to Americans  as businessman Michael Sorrentino found at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this year  The chief executive of smartphone case maker Eyepatch estimates about 20 percent of U S  retailers he spoke with asked if they could buy his gear through Alibaba com   That quickly taught me  whether I m familiar or not with that platform  that I need to be on it   he said

144534,366049,COST,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Costco  COST ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Costco  COST  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this warehouse club operator a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Costco is 9 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 15 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 2  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Costco is 13 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 0 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Costco  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Costco a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

144542,366057,COST,When Eating Shrimp  There s No Free Lunch ,news,"By    Shrimp is Americans  seafood of choice  but the facts of the modern shrimping industry validate the old maxim that there s no such thing as a free lunch  Producing the world s shrimp supply destroys the environment  kills other sea creatures  and even supports human slavery 
Shrimp  which like lobster was once seen as a sort of  cockroach of the seas  unfit for people s plates  is now big business  one that the U S  shrimp fishing industry is not able to keep pace with  more than 90 percent of all shrimp eaten in the country today is farmed overseas  according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Foundation  In fact  the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization  FAO  reports that the world faces a so called aquaculture gap     the 80 million metric ton difference between our global wild harvest and the world s demand for healthy seafood   according to John Connelly  president of the National Fisheries Institute 
In the race to fill that gap  many shrimp companies take steps that do great damage to the environment  from trawling the ocean floor to farming shrimp in fetid conditions  One particularly alarming statistic comes from the FAO  which estimates that 85 percent of the marine animals caught by shrimp trawlers around the world is classified  bycatch     aka  a species other than edible shrimp    that is simply dumped back into the ocean  often after being maimed or killed by nets and machinery 
On Tuesday the story of shrimp grew even grimmer  as the Guardian released a report alleging that the world s largest shrimp farmer  Thailand s Charoen Pokphand Foods  BK CPF   relies on slave labor for the production of some of the fishmeal that it feeds to its farmed shrimp 
The food giant  which provides prawns to many companies including the four largest international retailers    Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT   Tesco  LONDON TSCO   Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST   and Carrefour  PARIS CARR      feeds its farmed shrimp fishmeal from suppliers that subject enslaved ship workers to beatings  torture and death  according to the Guardian s investigation 
The article alleges that forces laborers are subjected to 20 hour workdays and brutal execution style killings at sea  and slavery is endemic in Thailand s fishing industry 
 Slaves forced to work for no pay for years at a time under threat of extreme violence are being used in Asia in the production of seafood sold by major U S   British and other European retailers   the Guardian said 

The Guardian s report comes just months after an investigative report by the Environmental Justice Foundation  titled  Slavery at Sea   asserted that Thailand s billion dollar seafood industry is a breeding ground for human trafficking and exploitation 
For Beth Lowell  campaign director for seafood fraud at the ocean advocacy organization Oceana  the issues of slavery and worker exploitation are two of many reasons governments  consumers and companies need to take steps to ensure that shrimp and other seafood is coming from sustainable  reliable  above board sources  The goal is  boat to plate traceability in all seafood   she said 
 This is a perfect example of why you need traceability in your supply chain  so you can verify the sourcing of the fish you re purchasing   Lowell said   Especially large companies that have big chunks of the market share should make sure they reduce risk in the market chain and ensure they re not buying from fisheries or fishing vessels that are engaged in illegal activity  
But shrimp is a dirty business  with a literally dirty product often caught and farmed in ways that degrade the environment and kill marine life  As the world looks to feed a population of 7 billion and rising that increasingly demands shrimp and other seafood for dinner  many activists  experts and environmentalists are sounding the alarm on the downsides of our obsession with the crustacean 
Shrimp wasn t even on the menu for most Americans until the 1980s  when it started to gain broader popularity as aquaculture boomed and distribution expanded  Before then  less than one percent of the global shrimp catch came from farms  as the technology to farm shrimp simply wasn t developed enough yet  and catching shrimp at sea was very expensive  according to Slate 
In 2001  shrimp surpassed tuna as the most popular seafood in the U S  for the first time  according to the Vermont Law Review  and demand for the shellfish today accounts for about 25 percent of the country s seafood consumption 
As millions of tons of shrimp and fish continue to be imported by the United States each year  much of which comes from countries like Thailand that do not have reliable traceability and anti slavery regimes in place  it is important for consumers to learn how to navigate both a Red Lobster menu and seafood counter  Lowell recommends 
One invaluable resource  she said  is Seafood Watch  an industry leading program run by the Monterey Bay Aquarium that offers ratings of various fish and shellfish based on their sustainability  environmental impact and healthfulness 
 Use things like the Seafood Watch program to guide choices in the right direction  then go to the store  ask your fishmonger for information  and if they don t know the answer  maybe go with something else   she said   Be as informed as you can as a consumer to make the right decision  ",2014-06-10,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/when-eating-shrimp,-there’s-no-free-lunch-288974",288974

to come Despite strong start to fiscal 2019  the company believes intensified competition in the developed economies alongside rising concerns related to the recently enacted retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey is likely to hurt near term results  Tariffs presented challenges across many of the company s operations  including production and supply chain operations  with major impacts on markets across Europe  Mexico and Canada  Notably  underlying net sales growth for the fiscal second quarter was negatively impacted by nearly two percentage points due to tariff related inventory reductions  giveback  linked to tariff driven buy ins in the fiscal first quarter  The company began realizing net tariff related costs in the fiscal second quarter This combined with higher input costs and impacts of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard led to declines of nearly 200 bps and 100 bps in the fiscal second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2019  respectively  Further  operating margin for the first half included impacts of nearly 2 percentage points from incremental costs associated with tariffs The company estimates effects of tariffs in Europe  Mexico

144593,366108,COST,DG Vs  COST  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Retail   Discount Stores sector have probably already heard of Dollar General  DG  and Costco  COST   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Dollar General and Costco are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that DG has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
DG currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 87  while COST has a forward P E of 28 50  We also note that DG has a PEG ratio of 1 25  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  COST currently has a PEG ratio of 2 85 
Another notable valuation metric for DG is its P B ratio of 4 98  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  COST has a P B of 7 13 
These metrics  and several others  help DG earn a Value grade of B  while COST has been given a Value grade of C 
DG stands above COST thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that DG is the superior value option right now ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dg-vs-cost-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200390094,200390094

144608,366123,COST,Factors You Must Note Ahead Of Fossil s  FOSL  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Fossil Group  Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   is slated to come up with fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 13  This renowned manufacturer of watches and other accessories has a robust earnings surprise history  as its bottom line has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate considerably over the trailing four quarters  Let s see how the company is positioned ahead of the upcoming quarterly results Fossil Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days at  1 27  which reflects significant growth from the year ago quarter figure  However  the consensus mark for revenues is  810 million  depicting a drop of 12 1  from revenues recorded in the year ago quarter Will Soft Traditional Watch Sales Linger Fossil has been witnessing soft sales in traditional watches for a long time now due to increased competition and rising demand for technologically advanced watches  Further  sales of leather and jewelry have persistently been weak on account of soft demand  Well  these trends persisted in second quarter 2018  wherein jewelry and leather business sales fell 11 5  and 11 9   on constant currency basis  respectively  with declines across most geographical regions  Also  the company s watch sales dropped 10 7   on constant currency basis   mainly due to sluggishness in the traditional category and shutting down of underperforming stores  Management earlier projected traditional watch category to remain challenged in 2018  particularly the wholesale business  In fact  Fossil s sales have been declining year over year for more than two years now  owing to continued softness in the traditional watch category  and exit of Burberry and Adidas  DE ADSGN  licensed brands  Evidently  Fossil s sales dropped 11 6  year over year to  608 8 million in the third quarter To keep up with changing consumer trends  Fossil has been well focused on expanding in the growing wearables space  Well  the wearables market provides Fossil the opportunity to combine fashion and technology  and come up with exciting products to cater to consumers  evolving needs of tech enabled advanced connected gears  Fossil recently launched approximately 14 new hybrid and smartwatches across several brands  Driven by such efforts  the company s connected watch sales jumped almost 30  year over year in the third quarter of 2018  Also  wearables represented roughly 18  of the company s total watch sales in the quarter  marking a steady improvement from 13  in the year ago period  As the wearables business is expected to grow  32 billion by 2020  Fossil s efforts to expand bode well  Fossil is also well on track to expand its digital platform and meet consumers  growing demand for online purchasing  To this end  the company has been making several investments to improve digital marketing and drive online sales  both for the company s website and other online wholesale partners  The e commerce platform has also served as an important sales channel for wearables Though these upsides and Fossil s various licensing deals bode well  we believe it may take time for these efforts to completely offset the softness in the aforementioned categories  The company earlier projected net sales to decrease 7 9  in 2018  Now  Fossil expects net sales to decline 10 16  during the fourth quarter  Clearly  these factors make us apprehensive about Fossil s top line in the quarter to be reported New World Fossil Plan to Provide Cushion Fossil is on track with its New World Fossil Plan  which aims at fuel efficiency  improving margins and enhancing the overall operating structure  The company intends to achieve these targets while simultaneously enriching customers  experience amid a difficult retail landscape  The company has initiated the second phase of the transformation plan  It now focuses on prioritizing consumer market and channel opportunities  revenue optimization  delivering gross margin and productivity savings  On the back of this initiative and other strategic plans  the company expects to achieve gross profit improvement of  200 million by the end of 2019  For 2018  the company anticipates  60 million improvement in profit backed by expansion in gross margin and reduced SG A expenses  These factors should aid Fossil s bottom line in the impending quarter What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t show a beat for Fossil this earnings season  For this to happen  a stock needs to have

Costco has successfully adapted to the Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   driven retail age  The company currently offers free two day delivery for non perishable food and household supplies to customers nationwide on orders of  75 or more  with a fee charged to smaller orders  Costco also expanded its same day delivery service to  most metropolitan  areas through an updated partnership with Instacart 
Outlook 
Costco  like some other retailers  reports its monthly sales throughout the year  The company s net sales jumped 10 3  to reach  34 31 billion for the first 12 weeks of its current fiscal year  Plus  the firm s e commerce sales soared 32 3   Investors should also note that our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Costco s quarterly revenues to climb roughly 8 9  to touch  34 63 billion  which includes the firm s membership fees

A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Costco is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports an Earnings ESP of  0 09   Therefore  investors can regard Costco as a company that could top our quarterly earnings estimate

144674,366189,COST,Costco  COST  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Costco  COST  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 13  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This warehouse club operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 1  
Revenues are expected to be  34 53 billion  up 8 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 33  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Costco 
For Costco  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Costco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Costco would post earnings of  2 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 36  delivering a surprise of  0 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Costco appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/costco-cost-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200365735,200365735

144683,366198,COST,Kirkland s  KIRK  Q3 Earnings  Escalated Costs Remain A Worry,opinion,Kirkland s  Inc    NASDAQ KIRK   is slated to release third quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 29  This home products retailer has posted negative earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters  Let s see what s in store for the company this time around Kirkland s  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days at a loss of 14 cents  which is wider than a loss of 10 cents per share reported in the year ago quarter  Nonetheless  the consensus mark for revenues is  153 million  reflecting 5 5  growth from the year ago quarter Elevated Costs a WorryKirkland s has been incurring higher store occupancy costs for a while now  This was also witnessed in second quarter fiscal 2018  Also  the company witnessed a 65 basis point  bp  increase in outbound freight costs  including e commerce shipping  as a percentage of sales  thanks to greater e commerce penetration  The quarter also saw a rise in inbound freight costs and central distribution expenses  Also  Kirkland s gross margin has been declining for a while now  essentially due to higher cost of sales  Well  gross margin plummeted 140 bps during the second quarter of fiscal 2018  This was preceded by a decline of 50 bps in the first quarter  Moreover  gross margin declined of 130 bps and 160 bps during the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively The persistent drop in gross margins combined with high operating expenses remains a considerable threat to the company s profitability  These factors also caused Kirkland s to post an adjusted loss of 40 cents per share in the second quarter  which was wider than the prior year quarter s loss of 34 cents Will Sales Drivers Offer Adequate Respite Nevertheless  Kirkland s sales have been improving year over year for eleven straight quarters now  The company has been gaining from its efforts to develop e commerce business and constant store additions  discussed below   These factors fueled Kirkland s sales in second quarter fiscal 2018  wherein net sales increased 1 7  year over year  Well  management is committed toward making efforts to attract more customers   both online and in stores Notably  Kirkland s has been taking various strides to resonate with the changing consumer trends  Incidentally  the company redesigned and leveraged the rollout of new information systems to improve online purchase and planning execution  These efforts have been yielding significant results  evident from the strong e commerce momentum witnessed of late  Notably  e commerce sales grew 15  to  17 1 million year over year and represented about 12 8  of Kirkland s total sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2018  This was backed by robust improvements in website traffic and average ticket  Further  sales from third party drop ship strategy provided an impetus to e commerce revenues during the quarter  The company is expected to continue expanding its third party partnerships  improving its  buy online and pick up in store  initiative and further refining its fulfillment processes  Management has been progressing strongly with augmenting efficiency across the e commerce fulfillment center With regard to store expansions  Kirkland s is closing the smaller underperforming stores in malls and expects to open bigger off mall stores at popular locations  which are likely to boost sales  During the second quarter  Kirkland s introduced six stores  while shutting five  For third quarter fiscal 2018  management intends to open nine new stores  While these factors bode well  sluggish traffic remains a concern  Evidently  comparable store sales declined 3 9  in the second quarter  due to low store traffic resulting in lower transactions  which were somewhat compensated by improved average ticket  Further  comps were negatively impacted by lack of relevance and newness in product assortments What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t show that Kirkland s is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter   For this to happen  the

COST will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  which is expected to be December 13  2018  On that day  COST is projected to report earnings of  1 61 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 18 38   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  34 28 billion  up 7 76  from the year ago period 
COST s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  7 70 per share and revenue of  152 08 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  12 74  and  7 42   respectively 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for COST  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system

144716,366231,COST,Will Costco  COST  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Costco  COST   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 02  
For the most recent quarter  Costco was expected to post earnings of  2 34 per share  but it reported  2 36 per share instead  representing a surprise of 0 85   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 68 per share  while it actually produced  1 70 per share  a surprise of 1 19  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Costco  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Costco currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 09   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on December 13  2018 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200358795,200358795

144755,366270,COST,SP 500 Earnings Update And One Reflection On September  2008,opinion,"With next weekend being the anniversary of the Lehman bankruptcy  this coming week the financial media will likely be flooded with stories  recollections   the wisdom of hindsight  type of reflection  and it s starting already   that is helpful in not repeating past mistakes  but may not help very much in the current market 
Think about this   the two sectors that led the 1982 to 2000 bull market in US stocks  were the Technology sector and the Financial sector 
The decade of 2000 through 2009 saw two brutal bear markets in guess which two sectors   Technology and Financials 
Throw housing  primary catalyst to Financial crisis of 2008  and then Energy into the bear market mix  and readers that have been around a while have now seen a significant chunk of the S P 500 s market cap suffer substantial bear markets in the last 18 years  In fact if you think of 2008 and the fact that it impacted the consumer in the way it did  the 2008 Crisis was a far more broad and encompassing bear market  and recession  than anything seen since the 1930 s 
Does that mean it can t happen again  Absolutely not 
A recession will occur again   I tell clients to count on it   but it will   in all probability   be very different than 2008 
Having read just about every book I could get my hands on regarding 2008 and the series of events that led up to it  the one stunning admission that most American s and most retail investors don t realize  came from President Obama s Treasury Secretary  Tim Geithner  and his post Financial Crisis tome   Stress Test   Tim noted in the book   and it was a good read in my opinion   that when a US recession starts   the Fed starts checking boxes  
Basically  the Fed  FOMC  starts with monetary policy and then sees how the capital markets react and goes from there 
In the late 1990 s  early 2000 s I had some very minor surgery done but it needed to be done by a surgeon at a local hospital  and while chatting during the procedure  he got around to asking me what I did for a living  etc  etc  and I told him 
The surgeon s question to me was  When Greenspan dies are they going to prop him up in the corner and not tell the American public  
Me   laughing   Doubtful  why  
Dr   Well doesn t Greenspan run the US economy  
Me   silently  Uh oh  Like the man behind the green curtain in  The Wizard of Oz  many American s probably think there is some FedHead  politician  magician  pressing buttons and turning wheels to keep the US economy humming  
The Fed and the FOMC don t predict  they respond  The US economy is its own  20 trillion animal  and every American waking up every day making decisions in their own best interest is the US economy 
Ben Bernanke will probably go down in the annals of Fed history as one of the best Fed Chairman ever  and he and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson were late to recognize the severity of what was happening in 2008 but once they grasped the full weight of the problem  the further full weight of the US Treasury  Federal Reserve and US government were brought to bear on the issue 
As Mr  Buffett noted in his interview with the Wall Street Journal recently  reflecting on 2008  fear is a contagion  and he noted  US companies were lined up next to each other like dominos  and presumably he meant banks and financial institutions 
Basically  the Fed  the Treasury and the US Government backstopped the US economy  And it wasn t easy  or maybe even necessary 
It s very hard to think that re occurs again  certainly in my lifetime   I ll be long dead before that is seen again  and I tell my client s kids   you probably won t see anything that bad again either  
But there will be recessions and bear markets  that s for sure 
In hindsight  I d say that 2008 was the Baby Boomer s condensed version of the Great Depression  but with a wiser Fed and Treasury  and unlike the Fed of the 1930 s  the Bernanke Fed didn t repeat the errors of the 1930 s

The S P 500 earnings data still looks OK  but remember as has been written on this blog plenty of times before today  the  forward 4 quarter estimate  didn t peak in 2008 until July 23rd or so  Because the 2008 recession and Financial Crisis was a rotting from within  I do think Street analyst s were slow to recognize the severity of what was happening in 2008  as did the Fed

144756,366271,COST,13 Reckonings Hanging In The Balance ,opinion,"A Fake Money World
The NASDAQ slipped below 8 000 this week  But you can table your reservations  The record bull market in U S  stocks is still on  With a little imagination  and the assistance of crude chart projections  Dow 40 000 could be eclipsed by the end of the decade  Remember  anything and everything s possible with enough fake money 
Driven by a handful of big cap tech companies  the Nasdaq Composite has made new highs   but the broad market  here shown in the form of the NYSE Index  has not even made it back to the January blow off peak  It is a good bet the return of the average investor s portfolio mirrors that of the latter  Such divergences are typically a sign of steadily weakening market internals which are seen near major trend changes  When such a glaring divergence in performance persistently fails to be invalidated and keeps dragging on for many months  it tends to be particularly concerning for the longer term outlook  Note that even more glaring divergences exist now between US stocks vs  European and EM stocks  Despite the fact that US economic indicators remain strong and no obvious recession warnings are evident  we have yet to see such large divergences resolve without a hiccup  Usually the hiccup turns out to be quite a doozy   PT 
Still  we consider DOW 40 000 to be about as probable as having a dinosaur step on our car as we drive to work today  More than likely  a return to DOW 10 000 will first grace the front page of the Wall Street Journal 
In the interim  while still in the delight of this  permanently high plateau   we ll turn our attention to another equally suspect record that s presently unfolding with imperfect precision  If you haven t noticed  the current economic expansion is approaching its own record in terms of duration  At 111 months and counting  this it is closing in on the post World War II record of 120 consecutive months of growth that occurred between March 1991 and March 2001 
One thing economist Irving Fisher will inter alia always be remembered for is that he called for the stock market to have reached a  permanently high plateau  shortly before the crash of 1929   not exactly an example of fortuitous timing as it turned out  It is actually a valuable illustration of a general principle  the herding effect that drives stock market bubbles to previously unimaginable heights and extremes of valuation eventually ensnares almost everybody  from the shoe shine boy to the academic economist  A handful of skeptics will of course always remain  but most will have uttered warnings for quite some time already   by the time the catastrophe is close at hand  almost no one will listen to them anymore  This is a pity  but then again  the class of investors as a whole cannot escape the losses that follow the bursting of a bubble anyway   PT 
If all goes according to plan  the economic expansion will enter its 121st month by July of 2019  Amazing  Certainly  this should equate with a marvelous  MAGA episode of economic betterment for all  How could a decade of economic growth result in anything less 
Alas  the world of fake money is a world of strange and seemingly impossible things  It challenges the mind and twists all aspects of the human world with the rigorous duplicity of a Supreme Court confirmation hearing  What to make of it 
Real Trouble
Without question  this long run of economic growth is unmatched in the disparities it has produced  The upper crust has been served quite well by it  Paper wealth  in the form of rising stock and property prices  has concentrated upward in the hands of the noblesse  The balance sheets of the wealthy have never looked so good 
But down in the valley  where the pavement is worn thin and the residential dwelling units are densely packed  a different reality presents itself  Here is the reality that the 2008 09 recession never really came to an end  Where incomes have stagnated and well paying jobs  the kind that can support a family  are sparse  On top of that  large segments of the population have become hooked on government sponsored opioids 
The effects of all that unbridled money printing are apparently not as bad as feared   now you know why it says on the ECB s web site that money is  long term neutral    PT 
Yet this disparity between upper and lower class  including a diminishing middle class  has occurred during a near record economic expansion  Somehow  the fat years didn t leave much meat on the bone for wage earners to gnaw on 
Of course  the real challenge  the one that s just around the corner  is the turmoil that always appears at the worst possible time  When the boom ends  and the bust begins  chaos reigns down with exacting rigor  That is when the real trouble arrives 
Moreover  the real trouble arrives at the precise moment when the liquidity of credit withers to a bone dry wishing well  That is when stock and real estate prices  which are now priced with no connection to the underlying economy  collapse  when paper wealth vaporizes faster than you can say Jack Robinson 
It is said that credit is suspicion asleep  you know it has woken up when loan officers suddenly ask all sorts of strange questions   PT 

Corporate and consumer debt  which has accumulated over the last decade far beyond its capacity to be repaid  will go bad all at once  Then  as layoffs rise  consumer confidence   the last fortification against a recession   will roll over in short order 
At the same time  a certain clarity will be dispensed with efficient precision 

Thirteen Reckonings Hanging in the Balance
One of the notable facets of the political climate of the USA is the lack of agreement on what the facts are  and how the economy should function  Should it be a hands off laissez faire economy  Should there be more regulatory intervention 
Then there are the questions of direct transfer payments and policies of currency debasement  On these questions  Republicans and Democrats appear to be equally inconsistent  Any remaining semblance of a philosophical operative has been watered down like cheap 3 2 beer 
The populace  for that matter  also cannot get its story straight  Their demands and desires of government always change with the direction of the wind  Still  we suspect these conflicting demands will be reckoned with during the next credit crisis and economic collapse  What follows is a partial list of prospective reckonings   thirteen of them   that are hanging in the balance 

Everyone calls for smaller government  as long as their entitlement payments are not restricted 
Everyone distrusts the government  until the economy contracts and they need a federal bailout via a cheap interest refi 
Everyone says they re for free trade  before  not after  their job is off shored to China or Vietnam 
Everyone disparages Made in China products  except when they can buy them at Walmart  NYSE WMT  or Costco  NASDAQ COST  at everyday low prices 
Everyone wants safe and state of the art infrastructure  as long their taxes aren t raised to pay for it 
Everyone despises inflation  except when it s inflating their stock portfolio or the price of their home 
Everyone derides the ills of government deficits  until they are faced with the prospect of fiscal austerity 
Everyone favors a trade war  as long as it doesn t jack up the price of flat screen televisions and iPhones 
Everyone loves green energy  but only at the expense of their neighbor 
Everyone believes in universal healthcare  before  not after  they have to go see a doctor 
Everyone loves cheap credit  but only up to the point where it provokes a mass debt default 
Everyone relishes government sponsored pharmaceuticals  until their family  friends  and neighbors start dying from them 
Everyone wants this  but they also want that  though only if it s on someone else s dime  and on  and on 

The point is  when everyone goes broke and the economy slows to a standstill  the people and the politicians will squawk and shriek in unison  They will demand for the government to  do something   up until the moment the fake money system finally dies ",2018-09-09,MN Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thirteen-reckonings-hanging-in-the-balance-200342948,200342948
144757,366272,COST,Pre Earnings Options Trades  09 18 18,opinion,"First up is Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   earnings 9 26 after close   This has been a relatively dismal stock in last few years  as retail decay continues  We can see that earnings reports have likewise started to languish in the last few years 

So  a bearish play may be of use  Here I use my  Super Bear  option spread  All 14 days to expiry  I put in a 35 delta long put with a 70 35 delta call credit spread  SELL the 70 delta  BUY the 35 delta   Slopecharts show again  a downward bias to the prices as they approach earnings 

If we proceed with a Super Bear spread  starting 4 days before earnings and close 1 days after we get the following backtest results

For our second trade we again return to a neutral disposition  to the 45 delta double calendar  This consists of shorting the 45 delta put AND the 45 delta call  with 9 day expiration and going long the 45 delta put and 45 delta call with 23 days to expiry 
Let s look at Costco  NASDAQ COST   Earnings 10 4  post close  

Let s look at the double calendar between 13 days prior to and 2 days prior to expiry from last 2 yrs 

Next  let s look at Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL  Earnings date 10 11 18 before open 

Relatively flat between day 8 and earnings  with some increase near the actual earnings date  The amplitude of earnings reactions is muted 

What does a double calendar look like between day 8 and 0  through earnings  

Now let s look at JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM    earnings 10 12  before open 

Here we apply a double calendar between days 10 and the earnings date 

The amplitude of movement is small 

Now let s look at PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP   earnings 10 2 before open 

Here we use the  Full Mullet  trade  short in the front  long in the back  Meaning  a straddle buying the 50 delta call and 50 delta put 45 days out  and selling the 20 delta call and put 20 days out 
If we look at the Full Mullet starting 14 days before  and ending 2 days after

Last we ll look at Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   WBA  earnings on 10 11 before market open 

Let s again turn to the double calendar  Again we will open the trade at day 6 before earnings  and take the trade through earnings 

A little riskier because the last earnings change was very negative  However overall  low amplitude which is borne out by backtesting

144758,366273,COST,Slow And Steady Gains  Costco Hits The Right Notes,opinion,"Costco  NASDAQ COST  stock doesn t usually generate a lot of buzz  It s not volatile like some tech and energy stocks  But in its quiet way  Costco has been a slow yet steady climber for the past few years 

That certainly makes Costco a relatively safe bet  But with shares now trading at  234  just 4  off its 52 week high of  245  is it a worthwhile investment for the long run 
Growing Revenue  Loyal Members  Increased Sales
Since the rise of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   brick and mortar retailers have seen their sales suffer  Indeed  according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail and Technology  store closings have tripled to 7 000 and are now at record highs  Despite this  Costco s members only  bulk business model has proven it can hold its own against even the most powerful e tailers and still grow 
According to its most recent 10 Q  Costco s total revenue year over year continues to expand  And it keeps attracting new members many of whom are extraordinarily loyal  Costco s membership renewal rate is 90  in the U S  and Canada  with an 87  renewal rate worldwide 
Perhaps more important  same store sales have continued to increase  During its third quarter  Costco said same store sales grew by 10   This is a particularly important metric for investors  it shows that Costco s sales are stable and generated by established stores 
Also  while Costco s trailing price to earnings ratio of 34 17 is higher than the Multiline Retail Industry average of 28 31  it s not nearly as high as Walmart s  NYSE WMT  P E of 54 30 
Even its exposure to geopolitical risk looks minimal  In general  trade wars increase product costs which hurts retailers  forcing them either raise prices  which hurts sales  or absorb additional costs  hurting profitability   But Costco has a global supply chain  so it doesn t rely on China as its major source of goods 
This means  of course  that though the ongoing trade war between the U S  and China continues to roil  Costco is fairly well insulated from the fallout  As a result  analysts at Bernstein rated the company  best prepared for a trade war  
Steady Financials  Surging Consumer Confidence
Since this time last year  Costco s share price has increased almost 44   But if you ve been on the sidelines till now  is this a good time to get in 
Currently  most analysts rate Costco a buy  giving it a one year price target of  241 48  To date  Costco s stock has steadily pushed higher  now up over 300  since 2009  While that doesn t guarantee a similar future return  it does indicate a healthy past  Still  current price targets are hardly expansive 
If Costco meets this analyst target over the next year  that s only a 3  increase over its current price  making it a poor short term growth bet  Additionally  Costco is trading near its high  meaning if you buy now  you re paying a premium for where you think the stock will go over the next five to 10 years  Simply put  buying Costco s stock at its current price only makes sense if you plan to hold it for a long time 
But if slow and steady seems like a good proposition as this aging bull market continues its nosebleed level trajectory higher  Costco might just hit all the right notes  One of the most important metrics to watch when evaluating retail stocks is the Consumer Confidence Index  which is currently at an 18 year high  The index refers to business conditions  and if favorable  signals probable consumer spending in the short  to medium term something that directly impacts retailers  including Costco  Additionally  this confidence is projected to continue  positively impacting consumer spending in the future 
If the above isn t enough  Costco s healthy dividend is the proverbial cherry on top  At  2 28 annually it isn t sizable  but since 2004  Costco has regularly increased its payout  Plus  with a payout ratio of just 30 31   Costco s dividend is sustainable and has plenty of room to grow  As well  since 2012 Costco has rewarded investors with three significant special dividends   7 in 2012   5 in 2015 and  7 in 2017 
Even better  There s speculation that the next special dividend could happen sooner rather than later  something that would positively impact Costco s share price  according to CNBC  Of course  it s impossible to know exactly when Costco will next offer its special dividend  so these rumors should be taken with a grain of salt 
Finally  if you feel the economy s current tear isn t sustainable  and think we re headed for an economic downturn  big box retailers like Costco are fairly  recession resistant   according to Forbes  During an economic downturn  history has shown that consumers turn from higher end retailers and gravitate to discounters like Costco  Makes sense of course  discounters such as Costco offer cheaper prices and bulk buying  allowing consumers to purchase more for less 
Bottom Line
Clearly  Costco shares aren t going to catapult higher overnight  If you can live with that there are a number of factors that will likely positively impact the stock going forward  as described above 
Consequently  we believe Costco could be a great asset for any investor looking to protect their portfolio with  safe stocks  that can be bought and held forever  to paraphrase Warren Buffet  Costco shares are now down about 4  since its September 11th high of  245 a share  making for a good entry point for interested investors ",2018-09-28,Katie Spence/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-costco-is-a-great-longterm-investment-200345618,200345618
144779,366294,COST,Pre IPO Coverage  BJ s Wholesale Club  BJ ,opinion,"BJ s Wholesale Club  BJ   a regional warehouse retailer  will IPO on Thursday  June 28  At a price range of  15 to  17 per share  the company plans to raise up to  637 million and has an expected market cap of  2 billion  At the midpoint of its price range  BJ currently earns our Neutral rating 
BJ s operates under a similar model as Costco  NASDAQ COST   The company sells its products at cost and earns substantially all of its profits from membership fees  The company  which operates primarily in New York and New England  was taken private in a leveraged buyout in 2011 and has paid out nearly  2 billion in dividends to its private owners since then 
Is this IPO an opportunity for investors to get back in on a great business  or is it an attempt by the private equity owners to cash out and leave the public holding the bag  We dig into its filings to help investors find the answers 
GAAP Earnings Understate Profitability
Reported earnings make BJ appear less profitable than it was prior to being taken private  The company reported GAAP net income of  89 million in fiscal year 2018  which ended on February 2   7  below its  95 million GAAP net income in 2011 
However  the company s economic earnings   the real cash flows of the business   are up 84  over the same timeframe  Figure 1 has details 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
BJ s  73 million in economic earnings in 2018 were the highest we ve recorded in our model going back to 1998  The disconnect between GAAP net income and economic earnings comes from two primary sources 
First  GAAP earnings in 2018 were artificially diminished due to  46 million  1  of revenue  in hidden non operating expenses 
Second  the company s capital structure has shifted to a much more debt heavy model  In 2011  BJ s market cap accounted for 55  of its enterprise value while debt accounted for 45   At the midpoint of its proposed IPO range  BJ s market cap will account for just 27  of its enterprise value while debt  including  2 5 billion in off balance sheet debt  will account for 63  
This change in the capital structure is important because GAAP earnings account for the cost of debt  interest  but not the cost of equity  while economic earnings account for both  The additional debt the company has taken on since 2011 hasn t decreased the profitability of its operations  but it does decrease accounting earnings 
Debt Decreases Value to Shareholders
While increased debt doesn t decrease the cash flows of the operations  it does increase the amount of preference that other stakeholders have over shareholders  Figure 2 compares BJ s debt over time to its economic book value  EBV   the value of the company to shareholders assuming zero growth in cash flows 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
By taking on debt to acquire the company and pay themselves dividends  BJ s private equity investors have made the company significantly less valuable to shareholders 
Public Shareholders Have Few Rights
BJ doesn t have a dual class share structure like we ve seen with many other recent IPOs  but public shareholders will still have very little power  Even after the IPO  its private equity owners will retain a 69  stake that gives them a majority on all shareholder votes 
Even though the private equity owners have paid themselves nearly  2 billion in dividends since 2011  public shareholders won t be eligible to receive any cash payments  The debt BJ took on to pay those dividends carried covenants that restricted any further dividend payments in the future 
Middle of the Road in Profits and Valuation
Aside from its high level of debt  BJ looks similar to other supermarkets in terms of both profitability and valuation  Figure 3 shows that return on invested capital  ROIC  drives 88  of the difference in valuation for the 11 supermarket chains we cover  At the midpoint of its proposed offering range  BJ ranks right at the average for both ROIC and enterprise value invested capital  a cleaner version of price to book  

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Based on its position on the trendline  BJ s enterprise value invested capital of 1 6 is exactly what we d expected for its ROIC of 6 5  
Our Discounted Cash Flow Model Reveals BJ Is Fairly Valued
The growth expectations implied by BJ s proposed IPO valuation are reasonable  To justify a valuation of  16 share  BJ must grow after tax operating profit  NOPAT  by 6  compounded annually for five years  With tax cuts providing a significant portion of that profit growth  BJ only needs to maintain pre tax margins and grow revenue by 3  compounded annually in this scenario  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here 
One consequence of BJ s high leverage is that small changes in growth projections can have a major impact on valuation  If we use the same margin assumptions as above but project revenue to decline by 1  a year for five years  BJ is worth just  3 50 share today  78  below the midpoint of the IPO range  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here 
Overall  BJ is a fine business  but the high level of debt creates risk for investors that is not worth taking  Investors that want exposure to this sector should look at companies below the trendline in Figure 3  such as Walmart  NYSE WMT   which is in our Focus List   Long Model Portfolio 
Critical Details Found in Financial Filings By Our Robo Analyst Technology
As investors focus more on fundamental research  research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings  Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo Analyst 1  findings in BJ s S 1 
Income Statement  we made  415 million of adjustments  with a net effect of removing  213 million in non operating expense  2  of revenue   You can see all the adjustments made to BJ s income statement here 
Balance Sheet  we made  2 8 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  2 8 billion  The largest adjustments was  2 5 billion in operating leases  This adjustment represented 139  of reported net assets  You can see all the adjustments made to BJ s balance sheet here 
Valuation  we made  5 5 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  5 5 billion  Outside of the debt mentioned above  the largest adjustment to shareholder value was  78 million in outstanding employee stock options  This option adjustment represents 4  of BJ s proposed market cap

144780,366295,COST,BJ s IPO Faces Multiple Challenges  Little Upside,opinion,"On Thursday  BJ s Wholesale Club goes public after being removed from the market in 2011  USA Today reported that the discount retail company aims to sell 37 5 million shares at a price range of  15 to  17 per share  This would raise up to  637 5 million and give BJ s a market cap of over  2 billion 
BJ s could perform well out of the gate as the IPO market has been successful in 2018  but investors have every reason to be skeptical of BJ s long term prospects  Retailers are in a tight spot with thin margins  economic uncertainty  and competition from ecommerce fronts looming on the horizon  and BJ s does not offer a compelling reason to persuade investors to overlook these problems  In fact  it carries additional problems such as a high debt load which should keep investors away 
Retail Challenges
BJ s is a warehouse club company comparable to Sam s Club or Costco  NASDAQ COST   and is most concentrated on the east coast and New England  BJ s states in its SEC filing that it has over 200 stores  which are  consistently offering 25  or more savings on a representative basket of manufacturer branded groceries compared to traditional supermarket competitors  
The obvious question for investors to ask is why BJ s is a superior investment compared to Costco  whose stock has risen by 32 percent compared to 12 months ago  Costco is a much larger business with three times as many stores  and MarketWatch points out that both Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  and Sam s Club are significantly more profitable than BJ s  The fact that BJ s is profitable at all can be viewed as good sign when investors consider how many IPOs are not  Furthermore  a look at BJ s SEC report shows that its net income has consistently risen from a loss of  14 9 million to a profit of  50 3 million from 2014 to 2018 
BJ s can claim that its heavy presence in the northeast United States will help it stand up to other warehouse club retailers  but they also have to worry about the even larger threat of Amazon  NASDAQ NASDAQ AMZN  and ecommerce  Amazon s acquisition of Whole Foods last year  along with the arrival of the convenience store Amazon Go which sells signal boosters  is a threat to supermarkets and wholesale retailers alike  Other ecommerce bulk outlets like Boxed also threaten to cut into the market  While BJ s has made some efforts to improve its ecommerce outlets such as highlighting its private labels with dedicated websites  it faces significant competition from other retailers who are likely a better investment 
Financial Numbers
In addition to the aforementioned problems  the rest of BJ s financial numbers are not impressive  BJ s is profitable  but we already discussed how its net income pales in comparison to its competitors  And despite its increase in profitability  BJ s growth has been nonexistent  BJ s total revenue in 2018 was  12 8 billion  compared to a  12 6 billion in 2014  Total revenue declined from 2015 to 2017 before rising in 2018  If BJ s is struggling to grow now  how will it thrive as Costco continues to expand and ecommerce becomes more popular 
Furthermore  BJ s states in its SEC report that as of May 5  the company  had total outstanding debt of  2 183 9 million   BJ s plans to use the raised proceeds  to repay approximately  623 2 million principal amount of indebtedness plus  10 2 million of accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment premium   But that means BJ s will not be using the money to fund future growth and limit its ability to compete 
There are other reasons to stay away from BJ s  such as the fact that even after the IPO  it will be controlled by private equity firms CVC and Leonard Green which have not hesitated to take dividend payments from BJ s in the past even while their company struggles with debt  But the fundamental problem is that there is nothing to indicate that this company will massively grow and compete in the way which we expect most IPOs to do  There is all of the risk of a normal IPO with none of the potential reward 
Look Elsewhere
BJ s may be offering products at a discount with its consumers  but it is selling its stock at a premium to investors  If it can expand outside the east coast  if it can improve its ecommerce outlets  and if it can compete against larger and more successful firms  it may be a decent investment  But those are a lot of ifs  and there are many ways which this company can fail  This is all the more so if the country debuts with a strong IPO as has often happened in the IPO market over the past year  Retailers are tricky investments today even under the best circumstances  and BJ s is far from the best  Investors who have some interest in BJ s are almost certainly better off looking at the more established and profitable Costco or Amazon ",2018-06-28,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bjs-ipo-faces-multiple-challenges-without-major-upsides-200328284,200328284

144782,366297,COST,A Cheap Cash Cow With 51  Upside,opinion,"The credit card business naturally lends itself to good investor returns over most time periods  But we can bank 50  to 100  gains per year by purchasing when dividend growth is high but a stock is cheap due to headline worries 
And today  we have the perfect news story to set us up for 51  profits over the next twelve months  After a decade of runaway gains  there is actually but one cheap credit card stock to buy for income and upside  And it s not one of these popular horses 
Plastic Always Pays  Investors   223  to 770  Returns 
The  Big 5  enjoyed total returns up to 770  over the last decade thanks to incredible dividend growth in recent years 
Nothing Plastic About These Payout Curves 
Investors have caught on to the fact that Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA    which returned 770  and 758  over the last decade  and increased their dividends more than ten fold   are excellent businesses  Both trade for more than 35 times their yearly earnings today  and yield only 0 5  
But they haven t yet uncovered Synchrony Financial  NYSE SYF   It s one of the cheapest card stocks in the deck  And it might also be the best 
Synchrony was founded in 2003  but operated as a subsidiary of GE Capital until its 2014 spinoff and subsequent IPO  initial public offering   Its offerings help its business customers connect directly with their own customers   an absolute must in an age where purchase preferences change by the hour 
This  new kid  is still on sale today thanks to its limited track record as a standalone entity  It was further discounted last week when a longtime customer told Synchrony it d have to keep singing for its supper 
We should take advantage of the overreaction and  buy the dip   Don t be fooled by the stock s modest 1 9  yield  With a dividend rolling 40  higher year over year  this stock is setup for 51  potential gains  which I ll break down for you in step three of our  how to make 51  next year  tutorial  
Step 1  Buy A Great Business For Cheap
This is usually easier said than done  but we can buy Synchrony today for just 12 times earnings   Again  Visa has a price to earnings ratio of 35 and Mastercard fetches 50  
Investors are not quite sure what to make of the  new kid    plus they worry about rumors that Walmart  NYSE WMT  is weighing a bid from Capital One 
Even if Walmart walks away from its 17 year relationship with Synchrony  recent history shows us that these breakup bargains should be bought rather than sold  Three years ago  Costco  NASDAQ COST  told American Express  NYSE AXP  that they were done  AXP shares eventually got up off the mat and rallied 37  higher post divorce 
American Express Eventually Shrugged Off The Costco Split 
I expect Synchrony will bounce back sooner and swifter  You see  the company provides an important  loyalty lifeline  service for retailers who  as you probably know  need all the help they can muster these days 
Step 2  Buy a  Must Have  Service for Starving Businesses
Retail used to be a competitive enough business when stores  only  competed with other physical stores within driving distance  Consumers had to hop in their cars and drive somewhere else in order to shop around 
Today  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and the broader Internet have made shopping around much easier  Two day  one day and even same day shipping make it less appealing to drive somewhere and wait in line  Which means the retailers who want to survive and thrive today must  step up their games  and connect directly with their customers  instead of sitting back and waiting for them to walk into their store  
Loyalty programs and one stop shop financing plans are  must haves  for retailers today  And Synchrony provides the cards that power these platforms 
Synchrony s 3 Solutions
Its Retail Cards provide customers with cash back  discounts and rewards when they pay with their card  Retailers like Lowe s  LOW  and even Amazon com partner with Synchrony to provide these cards  For example  Amazon s Prime Store Card gives its cardholders 5  back on Amazon com purchases 
5  Cash Back On Amazon  Powered by Synchrony 
Meanwhile Synchrony s newer Payment Solutions and CareCredit programs focus on  big ticket  items that can be more easily purchased in monthly installments  These cards help customers buy a new couch  television or set of eyeglasses now and pay for it over time without penalties and higher interest or dents in their credit ratings

Nissan  Jiffy Lube and Rite Aid have recently signed up with Synchrony  These new partners help create more active accounts  which in turn generate more interest and fees for the loans that Synchrony extends their customers  Year over year the firm has boosted its active accounts by 5  while collecting an additional 12  in interest and fees versus the same quarter a year earlier 
Today the company is already a cash cow  capable of returning a generous portion of its profits to shareholders  But it s the growth potential that makes this play particularly exciting   especially since it seems to be flying under the radar for now 
Step 3  2  Yield   9  Buybacks   40  Div Growth   51  Upside
Remember there are three   and only three   ways a stock can pay us directly 

Dividends issued today 
Share repurchases that happen today and tomorrow  and
Dividend increases tomorrow 

Today s dividends are cash in our pocket  Meanwhile share repurchases often kick off a  virtuous cycle  that makes our shares more and more valuable  with less shares available  everything looks better   including profits and dividends   on a per share basis  
And tomorrow s dividend hikes are also underappreciated  Stock prices tend to rise along with their payouts  which is why your favorite dividend aristocrat always seems to  only  pay 3  even though it hikes its dividend every year  its price is likely rising just as fast  
Since its spinoff in 2014  Synchrony has paid a regular dividend and repurchased shares  But it s now beginning to turn up the volume on its own  shareholder rewards  program   which makes right now the ideal time to buy shares of our own 
In fact  at the Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Financials Conference last month  Synchrony s Chief Financial Officer  CFO  Brian Doubles admitted the company had a  problem    it has too much capital  Here s how he s  fixing  this issue by dishing cash to investors 
As discussed  the stock pays 1 9  today  Its recent 40  dividend hike is a whiff of dividend grapeshot that should be taken seriously  With a modest 22  payout ratio  the dividend s percentage of profits  there is plenty of room for double digit dividend growth into the foreseeable future 
Buybacks are ramping up  too  Synchrony started buying back its stock in the second half of 2016  Recently the company announced a buyback plan for  2 2 billion over the next twelve months   about 9  of its current float 
When we add up Synchrony s forward yield  1 8    its buybacks  9  yearly  and its dividend growth  40    we have formula for 51  total returns over the next twelve months 
Our cover won t last forever  so let s buy our stake now before the market wakes up to Synchrony s sweet business model and economics  After all  these 40  dividend hikes don t usually go unnoticed for long 
This Friday  7 Fast Dividend Growers With Bright Futures And 100   Upside
Life is too short to waste our time with middling dividends  Since share prices move higher with their payouts  there s a simple way to maximize our stock market returns  Buy the dividends that are growing the fastest 
Don t be fooled by modest current yields  They often don t capture the growth potential  and it s the dividend s velocity that really makes us big money   not its starting point  
How to we buy high velocity dividends  the aristocrats of tomorrow  It s a simple three step process 
Step 1  You invest a set amount of money into one of these  hidden yield  stocks and immediately start getting regular returns on the order of 3   4   or maybe more 
That alone is better than you can get from just about any other conservative investment right now 
Step 2  Over time  your dividend payments go up so you re eventually earning 8   9   or 10  a year on your original investment 
That should not only keep pace with inflation or rising interest rates  it should stay ahead of them 
Step 3  As your income is rising  other investors are also bidding up the price of your shares to keep pace with the increasing yields 
This combination of rising dividends and capital appreciation is what gives you the potential to earn 12  or more on average with almost no effort or active investing at all 
Which future aristocrats should you buy today  Well you know me   I ve got three best buys   plus four more bonus dividend growth stocks   that should safely double your money every three to five years 
It s a simple formula   their dividends are doubling every three to five years  which means their prices will rise in tandem  At the same time  we ll collect their dividend payments today and enjoy an even higher income stream tomorrow 
This dividend growth strategy has produced amazing 23 7  annualized returns for my Hidden Yields subscribers since inception  In three years  we ve crushed the broader market  the S P 500 returned 16  over the same time period  
If you achieve returns of 23 7   you ll double your money every three years  So if you haven t been following this strategy  why not  The best time to get started is right now   before the seven dividend growers I mentioned begin to move

144805,366320,COST,Millennials  Your Avocados Are In Good Hands Thanks To This Startup ,opinion,"It s no surprise that amongst millennials  avocados and anything to do with them has become a trend   A California based startup  Apeel Sciences  creates products from plant derived materials  which help to eliminate waste and provide high quality fresh products 
When Apeel Sciences was first launched in 2012  the company was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  Since then  it received  33 million in funding back in 2016 from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz 
Apeel recently created a product made from leftover plant skins and stems that can be used to slow down the process of decay on different foods and in return  increase the shelf life of these products  The product Apeel created is an invisible and edible coating spray that they say will double the shelf life of avocados 
Since Apeel partners with Costco   NASDAQ COST   and Harps Food  they distributed their longer lasting avocados  with the invisible coating  to every Costco and Harps Food store in the nation yesterday  According to   Harps Food has 87 locations in the Midwest and Costco  which is a much larger grocery chain  has 500 locations across the country and Puerto Rico  With the debut of this new product at Harps Food and especially Costco  seeing as a lot of people shop there  it could potentially mean a surge of profit for the company 
Since this is the first time any of Apeel s produce is sold at any store  consumers will likely be intrigued to learn more about the company s avocados when they see them  This could potentially raise brand awareness and get the company name out there  According to Bloomberg  Apeel made the decision to start off with avocados  because it is a high profile fruit favored by millennials  and in today s world  millennials are essentially the ones bringing in business for these startups 
Looking at Costco  the stock is currently a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank  with a VGM score of  A   The company made a comeback in Q3  surpassing analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line  Costco reported quarterly earnings of  1 70 per share  which was a 21 4  increase from  1 40 in the previous reported quarter  while revenues rose just over 12  year over year 
Over the past year  its forward P E has continued to increase  Currently  it is 30 2X  which is fairly high and above the industry average  Costco has also traded higher than the S P 500 during the same time period  COST is no doubt expensive  but it s also one of the few major retailers reporting strong earnings on top of even stronger comparable store sales  Investors may be willing to pay a bit more for a popular retailer who is currently raking in the profits 
With Apeel s product  grocers will be able to save money and preserve produce instead of throwing it away more often  If Apeel s avocados really do stay fresh for much longer  then this product could really mean big things for the company and the food industry  For Costco  for instance  it could mean more foot traffic and potentially higher revenues  According to   James Rogers  the CEO of Apeel  plans to expand the types of produce that is sold  This means that if the invisible coating spray used on the avocados works  Apeel s future is looking fresh and successful

144837,366352,COST,Why Costco  COST  Stock Hit A New High Thursday,opinion,"Costco   NASDAQ COST   saw its stock price close up 2 48  on Thursday  touching a new all time high of  202 88 per share after the company released strong May sales numbers  Let s dive into some of the details that impressed investors as Costco counties to prove its strength against the likes of Walmart   NYSE WMT   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   
Costco s May sales surged 14 1  to  11 02 billion  up from  9 66 billion in the same month last year  The big box discount retail powerhouse s comparable store sales climbed 11 7   up 2  from the year ago period s 9 7  expansion  Maybe more impressively  the company s e commerce sales soared 34 4   down slightly from its 35 9  surge in May 2017 
This growth clearly impressed investors and comes on the back of the strong third quarter fiscal 2018 results Costco reported last week  Costco posted adjusted earnings of  1 70 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 51 per share         
Meanwhile  the company s revenue figures grew by 12  to  32 36 billion  topping our consensus estimate of  31 74 billion  Furthermore  the wholesale retail giant s quarterly e commerce sales surged 36 8   with comps up 10 2  overall  which looks very impressive compared to Walmart s quarterly U S  same store sales expansion of just 2 1  
Now let s take a quick look at Costco s recent price performance that helped it reach this new all time high 
Price Performance 
Shares of Costco have surged nearly 84  over the last five years  which tops the S P 500 s roughly 73  climb  Investors should also note that Costco crushed Walmart s 11  gains over this stretch  Over the last three years  COST stock has climbed approximately 47   which once again outpaces the S P 500 s roughly 33  growth and WMT s 17  
 
Clearly  shares of Costco have also performed well since the start of the year  helping it hit its brand new all time high   
Valuation 
With that said  investors have clearly been willing to pay a premium for Costco stock over the last five years  Coming into Thursday  COST was trading at 26 5X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  marking a premium compared the S P 500 s 17 1X  as well as Walmart s which is currently trading at the same forward P E as the index  
Over the last year  Costco has traded as high as 28 9X and as low as 23 6X  with a year long median of 26 1X  Therefore  although Costco stock is not the cheapest out there  its valuation is hardly stretched at the moment 
Looking ahead  Costco s full year revenues are projected to climb over 8  to  139 68 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Moving onto the other end of the income statement  COST is projected to see its adjusted fiscal 2018 earnings hit  6 85 per share  which would mark a nearly 18  surge

144874,366389,COST,MRC  Sonic  Salesforce com  Costco And Ulta As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate Release         Chicago  IL   May 29  2018    highlights MRC Global   NYSE MRC   as the Bull of the Day and Sonic   NASDAQ SONC   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Salesforce com Inc    NYSE CRM    Costco Wholesale Corp    NASDAQ COST   and Ulta Beauty Inc    NASDAQ ULTA   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks                                                 The inflation talk has grown from non existent to a murmur recently  Spearheading things over the last few weeks has been the move in crude  Oil has been strong since bottoming out under  28 in February 2016  Prices peaked over  72 earlier this month  That s creating all sorts of opportunities for stocks to buy within that industry  You can profit from oil infrastructure plays that stand to benefit the most from the rising prices Today s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  MRC Global  MRC Global Inc   through its subsidiaries  distributes pipes  valves  fittings  and related products and services to the energy industry in the United States  Canada

products  Technically this is a steel stock  a company which makes pipes and tubes  The Steel Pipe and Tube industry ranks in the Top 7  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank lies in the recent earnings estimate revisions  Eight analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year while nine have done so for next year  The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from 72 cents to 87 cents  Next year s number has gone from  1 09 to  1 20  Today s Bear of the Day is in the Restaurant Industry  A fast food chain that s seen earnings estimates tumble recently  You may have seen the commercials and like them  but when you look at what analysts have done to their estimates  you may not want to add this

properties to franchisees and other parties The company is a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  right now in an industry that ranks in the Bottom 40  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The reason for the unfavorable rank is the dip in analysts  earnings estimates over the last sixty days  Analysts have dropped their numbers for both the current year and next year  The bearish activity has cut our Zacks Consensus Estimate from  1 53 to  1 47 for the current year  Next year s number has dropped from  1 72 to  1 63 Upcoming Earnings Reports to Watch  CRM  COST  ULTAIt was another interesting week on Wall Street

144905,366420,COST,Book Review  Go Long,opinion,"Go Long  Why Long term Thinking Is Your Best Short term Strategy  Wharton Digital Press  2018  by Dennis Carey  Brian Dumaine  Michael Useem  and Rodney Zemmel is a short book packed with managerial  and investing  insight  In the first part it profiles leaders who went long  Alan Mulally at Ford  Larry Merlo at CVS  Paul Polman at Unilever  LON ULVR   Ivan Seidenberg at Verizon  Sir George Buckley at 3M  and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Costco  NASDAQ COST  director Maggie Wilderotter  Part two offers principles for leaders who want to start thinking long term 
Some CEOs use long term metrics as organizing principles  Alan Mulally invoked PGA  profitable growth for all   which is revenue times margins  His goal at Ford  even as he faced a  17 billion shortfall in a single year when he joined the company  was to use that measure to achieve a 10  to 15  compounded annual growth rate  How would Ford achieve this kind of growth   The only way to raise revenue is to make products and provide services people want and value  and good companies improve their margins every year by improving quality and productivity  Mulally says the trick is to work both of those levers   At each of his business review meetings  Mulally asked his 16 top executives to apply PGA to a five year horizon   imagine five bars representing profits going out five years  and each one going up 15   That simple exercise got the executives to look five years out every week  every quarter  every year even while they were dealing with short term crises  
The title of the chapter dealing with Sir George Buckley is  R D Is the Last Place to Cut   In the four years before Buckley became chairman and CEO of 3M in 2005 capital spending had been slashed by 65  and R D by 25   Buckley believed that the company s sluggish growth was the result of shortchanging innovation  He  reached back into 3M s history and reinstated a key metric known as the New Product Vitality Index   He calculated that to grow at a 4  compounded annual growth rate above market growth would require that more than 30  of the company s revenues come from products introduced in the last five years   By the time he took mandatory retirement at age 65 in 2012  Buckley had grown the share of new products launched over the previous five years from 8  of sales to 34  of sales  
Traditionally Wall Street hasn t rewarded companies that plow earnings back into R D and other capital expenditures  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  found that between 1991 and 2016 the stock returns of companies offering the highest combined dividend and share buyback yields outpaced those of companies that spent more on R D  Is the trend starting to shift  It s too early to say  but last year  those companies in the Goldman study that spent more on capital expenditures and R D outperformed those offering high dividends and buybacks by 11 percentage points  
Go Long is a wonderful mini manual for corporate executives and members of boards of public companies  But it is also meant to educate investors  to get them to think beyond the next quarter and to reward companies that focus on longer term goals ",2018-05-09,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review-carey-et-al-go-long-200314562,200314562

Costco  NASDAQ COST    COST  started to move higher out of consolidation in September  The initial move failed and it gapped back into the consolidation channel but almost immediately started higher again  It slowed and started to consolidate over support in December before a push to a all time high at the end of January  It pulled back had and fast to the 100 day SMA from there and bounced  The bounce stalled at a lower higher and moved back lower in a channel for the next two months  Last week it broke that channel to the upside 
On a Measured Move it gives a target to 201  The RSI is turning back higher toward the bullish zone with the MACD crossing into positive territory  The Bollinger Bands  are also opening higher to allow for a move up  There is resistance at 193 and 195 75 before 200  Support lower comes at 178 and 185 50 then 181 and 178 50 before 176  Short interest is low at 1 7  and the company is expected to report earnings next on May 31st 
The April options chain shows open interest the biggest at the 190 strike on both sides  with the puts tailing lower and calls to the upside  The May chain also shows the biggest open interest at the 190 strike on the call side  But it is biggest at the 175 strike on the put side  The June 1 Expiry chain  the first after the next earnings report  is just starting to build  so looking at the June monthly shows the put side with open interest spread from 158 to 185  while it is more focused at 185 and then from 190 to 195 on the call side  Options traders are predicting a move of about  13 between now and expiration

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which as we head into April options expiration saw the equity markets poke above consolidation in a signal of strength but had trouble holding it Friday 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with a bias higher while Crude Oil continues its run higher  The US Dollar Index continues to move sideways while US Treasuries consolidate with a bias higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets look to continue to consolidate  with the Chinese market near lows and Emerging Markets at highs 
Volatility looks to continue to drift lower easing the pressure on the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts had pressed higher in the shorter timeframe but printed an ugly Friday  On the longer timeframe they look to be reversing higher though  a time divergence  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Sporting goods retailer Dick s is scheduled to release its latest quarterly financial results before the market opens on March 13  Dick s recently grabbed headlines for its decision to change its own gun sales rules in the wake of several mass shootings  but now investors will want to see how the company has actually been performing lately 
DKS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate  we expect the company to report adjusted earnings of  1 20 per share  down about 9  year over year  However  total quarterly revenues are expect to improve nearly 10  to touch  2 73 billion

Discount retail giant Dollar General is slated to post its most recent quarterly earnings report before the opening bell on March 15  The pressure will be on the company after fellow  dollar store  retailer Dollar Tree failed to impress this week  DG is currently holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

I can recall working at a basketball camp as a counselor in college and a head coach saying to young attendees during the morning stretch session   It s great to be alive   As one gets older  you know the joy of getting up each day to see what the world has to offer  We learn each day is not going to go perfect  and one of the special things about maturing is realizing how a good night sleep and a fresh start can give you a whole new perspective  Equally as fascinating is how this applies to markets  One of the wonderful things about investing is the anticipation of waking up each day to see what it has in store  On many occasions  you wake up and nothing is going on  There are also times when you are just removing the sleep from your eyelids when a down 300 point opening hits you smack in the face  like Wednesday   Conversely  you may be in the middle of a deep yawn when you discover something really wonderful has happened  like maybe a holding is merging or being acquired at a nice high premium  it happened this week so good for us   Anyway  the unpredictability of life and investing makes it a pleasure to wake up to the world  good or bad  but we will certainly take the former over the latter 
In the markets this week  a couple of big deals set the tone as Cigna  NYSE CI  announced it will be buying pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripps for  52 billion  Also in the health care area  CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  sold  40 billion of bonds to help get read for its acquisition of Aetna  NYSE AET   Do you think the health care industry is getting ready for Mr  Bezos  Speaking of the death star  apparently Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is thinking about taking on the big banks by offering bank accounts connected with Amazon Prime  On the macroeconomic front  the February jobs report came in well above the 200K estimate  as the economy created 313 thousand new positions and wages came in at a steady  2 6   which was down from 2 9  from the prior month  Investors ate it up  although it is pretty much priced in that interest rates will be headed higher three more times for the rest of the year  Tariffs were a big topic as the market breathed a heavy sigh of relief when the Trumpers announced there will be exemptions for Canada and Mexico on the steel and aluminum levy s  More on that in a second  On the earnings front  Costco  NASDAQ COST  reported a big number but guidance was a touch soft  and it was pretty much the same thing with Target  Still  the large retailers are showing improved performance and the economy looks good  both globally and domestically  Estimates on global oil demand were raised to an increase of 1 8 million barrels per day as well  also supporting markets  Next week  all eyes will be on the inflation numbers mid week  both for the consumer and producer  If they come in stronger than expected  investors will get nervous  but if it wasn t inflation  it would be something else  deficits  money supply  earnings  so that is just part of investing

144971,366486,COST,United States Cellular  Cincinnati Bell  Dick s Sporting Goods  Dollar General And Ulta Beauty Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 12  2018    highlights United States Cellular Corp   NYSE USM   as the Bull of the Day  Cincinnati Bell   NYSE CBB  as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Dick s Sporting Goods  Inc    NYSE DKS    Dollar General Corporation   NYSE DG   and Ulta Beauty Inc    NASDAQ ULTA   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   United States Cellular Corp  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   is the eighth largest wireless company in the United States  based on the aggregate number of customers in its consolidated markets  The company s development strategy is to operate controlling interests in cellular market licensees in areas adjacent to or in proximity to its other markets  thereby building clusters in operating markets Recent Earnings UptickOn February 23rd  USM reported earnings where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates   The company posted significant gains in EPS  reporting  0 05 compared to   0 07 in the year ago quarter  and revenues improved by  13   The Q4 results marked the first time the company posted year over year gains in revenues in 2017 as the company saw price increases in one of its entry level plans  and its unlimited data plans  Further  USM realized an improvement in its device protection plans  and an increase of its customer base on installment plans  Also  management s cost cutting initiatives along with positive subscriber results aided the top line Looking forward  the company is expanding its Voice over LTE  VoLTE  coverage outside its current presence in Iowa and Wisconsin over the next couple of years  This is expected to help its high margin roaming revenues  Further  the upcoming rollout of FirstNet is anticipated to improve revenues for the tower segment above the  5  growth seen in 2017 Management s TakeAccording to Kenneth R  Meyers  President and CEO   We made significant progress on the strategic imperatives we set for 2017  With the success of our Total Plans  which include an unlimited data option and no hidden fees  we were able to grow our customer base through the powerful combination of new customer additions and increased loyalty and customer engagement   Through a company wide initiative to better align costs with our strategic imperatives  we were able to reduce expenses by some  100 million in 2017 and  importantly  identify and implement programs to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond   This extensive attention on costs allowed us to offset a decline in revenues caused by competitive pricing pressures and generate a modest increase in profitability   Cincinnati Bell  a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   provides integrated communications solutions    including local and long distance voice  data  high speed Internet and video    that keep residential and business customers in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton connected with each other and with the world  In addition  enterprise customers across the United States rely on CBTS  a wholly owned subsidiary  for efficient  scalable office communications systems and end to end IT solutions Recent Earnings DataIn the company s most recent earnings report  they missed both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates  EPS fell from  0 01 in December of 2016 to   0 18 in December of 2017  But revenues grew by  49 8  on a year over year basis The drag on the results was twofold  first  Q4 IT hardware sales fell by  12 8  YoY  excluding the recent OnX acquisition  as one of its largest customers scaled back spending   Second  increased competition from Spectrum  who has been increasing its marketing in the Cincinnati area  and has offered very competitive pricing Looking forward  CBB is in the process of acquiring Hawaiian Telcom which is expected to keep capex elevated  and debt financing at levels that will negatively impact organic free cash flows over the near term   While the Hawaiian acquisition is expected to be beneficial in the long term  it will put pressure on the company over the next quarter or two Management s TakeAccording to Leigh Fox  President and CEO   Our strong full year performance demonstrates the solid progress we have made in executing our growth strategy  This was an important year for Cincinnati Bell as we focused on building two distinct  complementary lines of business with expanded geographic reach  customer diversification and increased runway for growth  Central to this strategy has been the previously announced mergers with OnX and Hawaiian Telcom   These combinations bring meaningful scale to their respective businesses and position us to capitalize on the fast growing demand for strategic fiber and cloud services offerings  We have successfully completed the acquisition of OnX and integration efforts continue to progress well  I am also pleased to report that we received overwhelming support from Hawaiian Telcom shareholders and the pending merger has made significant headway in gaining the necessary regulatory approvals  Additional content Upcoming Retail Earnings Reports to Watch  DKS  DG  ULTAStocks opened higher on Friday after the February jobs report came in ahead of expectations and cooled concerns about rising inflation  But as the latest employment numbers seemingly confirm the overall health of the U S  economy  recent earnings results in the retail sector have started to raise questions about the state of consumer spending For the most part  fourth quarter earnings season was relatively strong  However  results in the retail space were somewhat mixed  Total earnings growth from the sector s S P 500 members broke 9  on the back of 9 6  higher revenues  which is an impressive trend But of the 195 companies in our  Retail and Wholesale  that have reported so far  only 56  have managed to surpass earnings estimates and over the past few days  we have seen disappointing reports from Kroger  NYSE KR   Costco  NASDAQ COST   Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  and more  also read    The traditional earnings season is effectively over  but a few marquee reports especially in the retail sector remain to be released  Investors should remember that they

market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio Today  we ve made that task even easier for you  Using the Earnings Calendar  we looked ahead to next week and selected most important retail reports to watch  Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of March 12 1  Dick s Sporting Goods  Inc  Sporting goods retailer Dick s is scheduled to release its latest quarterly financial results before the market opens on March 13  Dick s recently grabbed headlines for its decision to change its own gun sales rules in the wake of several mass shootings  but now investors will want to see how the company has actually been performing lately DKS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate  we expect the company to report adjusted earnings of  1 20 per share  down about 9  year over year  However  total quarterly revenues are expect to improve nearly 10  to touch  2 73 billion 2  Dollar General CorporationDiscount retail giant Dollar General is slated to post its most recent quarterly earnings report before the opening bell on March 15  The pressure will be on the company after fellow  dollar store  retailer Dollar Tree failed to impress this week  DG is currently holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for adjusted earnings of  1 48 per share and revenues of  6 22 billion  This earnings results would be basically flat year over year  while the revenue projection would mark a 3 5  improvement  The key for Dollar General will be whether or not its core customer base lower income families have started to feel a noticeable tax break and have been spending the extra money for shopping purposes 3  Ulta Beauty Inc Beauty retailer Ulta is expected to report its latest quarterly financial results after the market closes on March 15  Ulta was a Wall Street darling for most of 2016 thanks to strong comps and EPS growth  but the stock struggled last year as growth rates began to slow a bit  However  the company still has plenty of attractive growth opportunities Ulta is holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  the company is expected to report adjusted earnings of  2 77 per share and revenues of  1 94 billion  These results would both represent year over year growth of about 23

144972,366487,COST, What Does Dodd Frank Amendment Mean For American Express ,opinion,"The American Express Co    NYSE AXP   is likely to get a breather from the senate s recent decision to bring in a few amendment to the Dodd Frank Act  Regulations and policies extensively control the company  TRS and its U S  bank subsidiaries  American Express Centurion Bank  Centurion Bank  and American Express Bank  FSB  American Express Bank  
The Dodd Frank Reform was put in place by President Obama in 2010 to prevent the reccurence of the 2008 financial crisis Amendment to the Act
One of the main tenet of the senate s banking bill is to raise the minimium threshold bar for institutions that are deemed too big to fail to  250 billion  from  50 billion  This change would bring a relive to the small institutions and will result in a reduction in the number of banking institutions considered  too big to fail   Further  it frees banks with less than  10 billion total assets from the Volcker rule  This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money 
Some of the beneficiaries of change are BB T Corporation   NYSE BBT    Fifth Third Bancorp   NASDAQ FITB    SunTrust Banks  Inc    NYSE STI   among others 
American Express to Gain from the Move
If the proposed changes see the light of the day  American Express will no longer have to undergo the annual stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve  These tests are designed to evaluate whether the company in question has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to recuperate losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions 
The company is now required to maintain capital ratios appreciably above the applicable minimum requirements and buffers  It is also restricted in its ability to make any capital distributions  including dividend and share buy backs   A relaxation of this rule will provide the company increased financial flexibility and greater autonomy in capital allocation 
We believe the company will be able to divert buffer capital for business expansion and enhance products 
Strong Economy Another Boon
Low unemployment  strong consumer confidence and reduction in tax rates bodes well for the company s business which is directly dependent on consumer spending  The company has witnessed an increase in top line  thanks to increased spending 
Lower Tax Rate to Benefit American Express
A lower tax rate from the tax reform has enabled the company to plan to invest up to  200 million in 2018  for growth  For shareholders  the company expects to use the anticipated benefits to build capital and drive earnings in 2018 
The operating environment looks favorable for American Express which in the recent past suffered from loss of one of its biggest client Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST   The company thereafter undertook massive growth initiatives which included increased marketing and advertising  higher customer rewards  and investment in customer facing activities increased frills on cards etc  to woo and retain customers 
The tearing away of the stiff capital regulations will further provide an impetus to its business 
Shares of the company have gained around 21  in a year s time  outperforming the  s 5  rally 

American Express carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

144998,366513,COST,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Amazon  L Brands  Zumiez  Costco Wholesale And Buckle,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 2  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Retail  Part 1  including Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    L Brands Inc    NYSE LB    Zumiez Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ    Costco Wholesale Corp    NASDAQ COST   and The Buckle Inc    NYSE BKE   Industry  Retail  Part 1Link  The health of the retail industry is an important economic indicator  as it is linked directly to consumers and their propensity to spend  Consumer spending holds the key to the well being of the U S  market as it accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity The link between consumer spending and the retail industry becomes more relevant as retail sales attract approximately 30  of total consumer spending in the United States  Also  the retail industry ranks among the top U S  industries and employs an enormous workforce  thereby deciding the health of the job market Before jumping on to the trends in retail  here s a sneak peek into the key economic indicators  which suggest where the market is heading On the whole  the U S  economy is picking up pace  The economic backdrop remains positive with the stock markets surging for most of the past year  wages improving gradually  the unemployment rate at a 17 year low  home prices rising and inflation remaining modest  These factors have changed consumers  outlook  resulting in more spending as they have more money in their pockets This is well reflected in the 0 4  or  54 2 billion increase in consumer spending recorded in December  following a gain of 0 8  in November  Further  recent reports indicate that the optimism that built up during the holiday season has carried into January as consumers are no longer wary of shopping and the economy is taking the road uphill These positives led to a further rise in consumer confidence  which gauges consumers  optimism on the economy expressed through savings and spending patterns  Per the Conference Board  Consumer Confidence Index showed a marked improvement in January  after witnessing a setback in December  Consumer Confidence rose 2 3 points to 125 4 in January  following a decline to 122 1 in December  Notably  the index rose to 129 5 in November   the highest mark since the increase to 132 6 recorded in November 2000 The primary reason for the surge in the index is consumers  belief that the pace of growth witnessed in the latter half of 2017 will continue in 2018  This has led consumers to use their savings to make purchases  Notably  U S  personal savings were 351 6 billion in December  reflecting a decline from  365 1 billion in November  The savings rate dipped to 2 4  of disposable income from 2 5  in November Moreover  savings for 2017 declined to  485 8 billion  from  680 6 billion in 2016   with the savings rate declining to the decade lowest of 3 4  The low savings rate led to a rise in imports  bringing about a slowdown in economic growth for the fourth quarter  Per the  Advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Jan 26  2018  the U S  economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 6  in the fourth quarter compared with the 3 2  growth in the third quarter of 2017  However  the economy grew 2 3  in 2017  speeding up from 1 5  in 2016 Looking at the broader picture  retailers have been the primary beneficiaries of the recent surge in consumer spending and the uplift of consumer confidence  This was evident from the splendid sales results of retailers in the holiday season  This has turned the tide of the sector  which had been struggling due to soft store traffic and the rise of e commerce  Moreover  trends witnessed in the holiday season have continued into 2018  making us optimistic about the performance of retailers in 2018 National Retail Federation   NRF   recently revealed that retail sales for January remained as strong as the holiday season  Retail sales in January rose 5 4  year over year following a 5 1  unadjusted year over year growth in holiday sales during November and December With consumers feeling good about their financial health and consumer spending reflecting steady growth  NRF predicts retail sales for 2018 to improve between 3 8  and 4 4  from the 2017 level  Notably  retail sales were up 3 9  in 2017 from 2016  Further  online and other non store sales are likely to witness growth of 10 12  as the definition of retailing continues to evolve Retail Sector Poised for GrowthThe Retail sector has been witness to some grave changes in 2017  The sector has evolved as a segment where buying and selling is now not restricted to stores alone  The sector now fully lives up to the mantra  Everything Everywhere   in the real sense On the face of it  the sector may seem to be an Amazon  dominated space  as the company continues to enter every retail category  Moreover  the retail sector has seen some big surprises in 2017  whether store closures  bankruptcies or acquisitions  In fact  it has seen the highest level of consolidation in recent times  However  the trends following the holiday season have been encouraging  with sales picking up and new trends emerging The recent trends in retail reveal that the sector has become a hub of innovative ideas to create fabulous consumer experiences  To be successful in the current scenario  retailers have to be ready to deliver on consumers  shopping preferences and behaviors  which are not static Retailers are scrambling for ways to convert a prospective consumer into a buyer  To do this  brick and mortar retailers are increasingly investing in emerging technologies  including social commerce  e commerce point of sale  face recognition techniques and virtual reality  all of which are likely to change consumers  retail experience Further  the companies in the space are optimizing supply chain operations to bridge the gap between demand and delivery  Consequently  retailers are investing in advanced technologies to optimize value chain and retail market share  Today  consumers are on the lookout for convenience  personalization  speed  reasonable price  choice and quality  Though this has bestowed a great challenge on retailers  it also provides opportunities to take more risks and be more innovative Key Retail MetricsThe key data in retail industry analysis is comparable store sales  comps  as it excludes sales at newly opened and closed stores  We observe that sales data for the month of January has been encouraging as the aforementioned favorable trends continue to aid top line growth  Further  most retailers have perked up their expectations following solid comps results  With many retailers having discounted the practice of reporting monthly comps  we only have five of them providing this key metric for January The list of gainers for January had specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products  L Brands Inc  on the top  The company posted comps growth of 7  while sales surged 29 2  to  1 040 million  This marked stellar growth following the 1  increase witnessed in December Right behind was Washington based retailer of sports related teen apparel Zumiez Inc   The company reported a 6 3  increase in comps  with sales improving 33 6  to  66 million from the year ago period  This was the company s 11th straight month of comps growth This was followed by warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp  that posted a 6  rise in comps for January  while total sales rose 8 4  to  12 24 billion  This reflects continued comps and sales growth since January 2017  Comparable e commerce sales for the month of January surged 34 8  At the bottom of the pile  we have The Buckle Inc   which reported a 0 2  increase in comps  following a 4 1  decline in December  Further  net sales rose 27 1  to  55 7 million for January Lagging behind  apparel and accessories retailer Cato Corp  continued with its dismal comps trend  Comps for January declined 6   while sales rose 19  to  45 5 million  We note that the company s comps have been declining for more than a year  primarily due to a tough apparel retail scenario Retail Wholesale Sector   Steady Growth  Valuation StretchedThe Retail and Wholesale is displaying steady growth as is reflected by its performance trend  The sector has outperformed the broader market in the past year  In the said time frame  the sector has surged approximately 31   while the S P 500 index has advanced 16 5  The group s Zacks Sector Rank shows further optimism  This 218 company sector has seen 110 positive and 62 negative revisions in earnings estimates in the recent past  It carries a Zacks Sector Rank of 2  out of 16   placing it at the top 13  of the Zacks Rank sectors However  a look at the sector s trailing 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is the most reliable multiple to value retail stocks  shows that it is pretty overvalued compared with the S P 500  The sector has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 30 5  which is above the median level of 27 1 This reflects an unfavorable comparison with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month P E for the S P 500 is at 21 3 and the median level is 20 1  The Retail and Wholesale sector s stretched valuation shows that there is only little upside left for the space when compared with the S P 500 market index Zacks Industry Rank   PositiveWithin the Zacks Industry classification  retailers are broadly

145000,366515,COST,Vegalab Breaking Out In 2018 By Keeping Food Safe With Environmenta,opinion,"Let s face the facts   if there is one thing Millenials can be proud of  it is the fact that they have opened the eyes of the world to the harmful effects of GMO food production and the toxic chemicals peddled by the multi billion dollar conglomerates used to grow our food crops 
For the past 20 years  consumer activists have been demanding that their food be produced with safe  sustainable  and humane inputs  This activism has been instrumental in changing the food industry and in refocusing companies that were more concerned with driving profits than they were with the damage their production methods were causing the Earth s ecosystems  its people  and its food animals  The health conscious  earth friendly impact of the millennials is extending to the next generational cohort  GenZ  There is a reason why 57 major companies  such as Costco  NASDAQ COST   McDonald s  NYSE MCD   and Applebee s  have committed to using only cage free eggs  or why leading food manufacturers like General Mills  NYSE GIS   Del Monte  Nestl   and Dannon are dropping GMO ingredients from some or all of their products  and the reason isn t altruism  The idea is that they have done the research  and the handwriting is on the wall  Research by Acosta Sales and Marketing  a  1 85B a sales and marketing company for consumer packaged goods   for example states   Gen Z shoppers show high awareness of  and desire for  healthy food  with more than one third of their grocery basket considered organic products on a typical trip     see    24 Jan 2018 By Elizabeth Crawford   However  rather than rail on the large agro giants  perhaps it would be healthier to remain positive and to focus on the emergence of at least one company that is taking advantage of a changing landscape in the agricultural business  Vegalab  Inc   OTCQB  VEGL 
Vegalab is An Emerging Millenial Favorite
Okay  perhaps it s not appropriate to credit a single generation with dragging the food industry kicking and screaming in a new direction  but  it is fair to note that the business model of VEGL aligns well with the changing attitudes and expectations of consumers worldwide Following a strategy of offering products that will not harm people or the environment  VEGL is emerging as a reliable supplier of biological pesticides  natural fertilizers  and specialty biological agents that are highly effective against targeted organisms  Unlike market leaders like Roundup   for instance  VEGL s products actually support soil health  Their products are so entirely different that it would take pages to explain  Moreover  beyond the explanation  readers would still be left with the unpleasant reality that products like Roundup   which have generated billions in revenue  are leaving a legacy of potential environmental ruin in their path  However  with new companies like VEGL entering the market  there is hope for healthier food  and believe it or not  they are starting to take noticeable market share from the billion dollar companies while at the same time helping to repair a damaged agricultural ecosystem 
Rather than using poisonous or toxic chemicals to treat and protect crops from unwanted critters  VEGL is combining proprietary micronization and nano encapsulation technologies with plant oil extracts  allowing the company to create compelling  cost competitive products that support a healthier environment and help to preserve fertile agricultural ground 
Sure  it sounds a bit fanciful  but it s true  VEGL is genuinely making a difference in the way agricultural markets are evolving  and despite the fact that the company is still relatively small  they are on the cusp of breaking out to much higher levels of market penetration VEGL Is Growing UpVEGL s primary office sits in Palm Beach  Florida  but the company has additional interests in Minden  NV  where they operate a 24 000 sq  ft  office warehouse  as well as owning a fruit packing plant in Visalia  CA  Currently  the company reported having just 23 8 million shares outstanding  but essential to that number is that insider ownership amounts to roughly 75  of all outstanding shares  leaving approximately 989K shares available for trade in the public float  Shares traded at  4 30 as of February 1st  which provides the company with a market cap of roughly  101 million 
Vegalab  Inc  emerged as the surviving business entity after David Selakovic  CEO of Vegalab  took control of the company through a series of well orchestrated  disciplined  and strategic business plan  The rewards from his foresight provided him the means to acquire and bring to market a significant number of products that directly address the changing tide of consumer sentiment  Mr  Selakovic focused on a strategic mission to serve the developing and socially conscious market and is catering to a class of consumers that are highly attuned to what they eat  how it s grown  and who pay specific attention to the short and long term impact that their decisions have on the environment  What VEGL Has DoneStarting the evolution  HPC Acquisitions  then majority owned by David Selakovic  raised funds in a private placement around March of 2016  which spearheaded the growth and marketing of Vegalab products  Since that time  and on a cumulative basis  the growth has been quite impressive and 2018 is setting up to be the year that kicks off a future of revenue growth and partnership opportunities 
A timeline from 2017 indicates that the growth trajectory from the past two years is gaining momentum in 2018  Around March of 2017  Vegalab US performed a grassroots marketing campaign in California to advertise Nematode Control  Then  in April the company started to see the fruits of its vision come together  with large farms like Dulcich and Grimmway purchasing VEGL products  The growth continued in June  when Buttonwillow Warehouse and Mid Valley Agricultural Services began distributing VEGL products 
The momentum of accretive activity continued in October  with Vegalab US purchasing a citrus packing facility in California with annual revenue of approximately  8 6 million  VEGL proceeded to make immediate improvements with the goal of doubling the capacity  Then  November saw the company s transition to Vegalab  Inc   with the company changing its name and stock ticker symbol to VEGL  Additionally  on January 7  VEGL entered into a Master Distribution Agreement with Stanislaus Farm Supply for the purchase of  13 million of agrochemical products in 2018 alone  In January  Vegalab announced its intention to acquire The Agronomy Group  which was Vegalab s Californian distributor and a manufacturer of agricultural products  The completed acquisition was announced on March 5  2018 
Vegalab Inc  Is Earth Friendly
VEGL products are nothing like conventional agrochemicals that degrade the environment  are harmful to humans  and face significant regulatory hurdles  In fact  the VEGL line of products are just the opposite   they are beneficial to the environment  completely safe to humans  proven to enhance crop values  and best of all  encounter very few regulatory hurdles 
Vegalab s agro products are developed to attack targeted organisms only  and at the same time enrich the soil by bolstering beneficial insects  bacteria  fungi  and microbes  In addition to helping the soil and enhancing crop value  VEGL s all natural biocides are food grade quality and can be applied right up until harvest  Even better for the farmer  treated fields can be re entered and worked immediately after application Perhaps the most significant advantage for VEGL  though  is that the challenges faced by billion dollar conglomerates that bring toxic chemicals to the field tend to disappear for VEGL  The Vegalab products enjoy classification as a  Minimum Risk Pesticide  and  Ingredients of Minimal Concern  which  allow VEGL s biological ingredients to get regulated at the state level  Not only does this save both time and considerable amounts of money  but it also clears a path away from the bureaucracy of the federal government  Astoundingly  data shows that on average it will take a synthetic pesticide roughly 11 years to develop  and account for an average R D investment of more than  286 million   and that s for a single product  However  those issues are not a concern for VEGL 
The VEGL Market Advantage
VEGL sits well positioned in a market that is growing exponentially on a global scale  Current growth projections in the organic food market are expected to maintain a 14  growth rate through the year 2021  In just the past nine years  organic food production increased by more than 240   in stark contrast to the non organic food production rate that dropped to an anemic 3  
The secret is out   customers want foods produced with natural  non synthetic  and sustainable inputs  However  it s not only the consumers that are bringing change  Regulatory attitudes are changing as well  and natural substances are regularly getting fast tracked for approval and marketing registration  In turn  the barriers to entry are getting lowered  and that equates to VEGL having the ability to get their products approved and into the market quickly 
And  being quick will have its advantages  The projected global market for biopesticides is expected to eclipse  3 8 billion by the year 2022  primarily driven by market pressures to reduce chemical residues in food  the regulatory restrictions curbing the use of chemical pesticides  and the active and growing demand for organic food  Another emerging advantage is that insects are building a tolerance to synthetic chemicals  and farmers are taking the opportunity to not only respond to changing market sentiment  but to use better products to protect their investments For the products VEGL sells  advanced technologies are applied to natural ingredients to increase their potency and create highly effective products  Not only are the products safe and effective  but they can also be produced and brought to market at dramatically less cost and time than synthetic products  From a competitive perspective  the VEGL products enjoy the designation of being  minimum risk pesticides  under section 25 b  of the Federal Insecticide and Rodenticide Act which  provides the company with an exemption from federal registration and may lead to expedited product registrations on the state level 
To date  VEGL has registered 35 products in the United States  including eight pesticides that are comprised of biocontrol agents  insecticides  and fungicides  In addition to those 35  VEGL is expected to bring several additional products to the registration phase  having completed R D and testing phases that demonstrated competitive results to that of synthetic products on the market 
VEGL Products Are Different
The VEGL line of products is different and designed to specifically address the multi billion dollar opportunity  Vegalab uses unique ingredients and proprietary processes that allow them to utilize specific compounds that have been long known for their beneficial effects but were used sparingly in prior products due to cost variables  Vegalab gets beyond that obstacle with processes that can maximize efficacy in concentrations unique to the VEGL commercial product line 
By using only food grade ingredients  the VEGL line of fertilizers provides plants instant access to elements necessary for optimal growth  Beyond plant health  the VEGL products are safe and promote the health of beneficial microorganisms and pollinators as well  These beneficial effects can occur because unique to VEGL products  they incorporate amino acids  organic acids  and other chelating and complexing agents such as glycine  betaine  and citric acid into their products  which then enable plants to absorb the minerals in their products more quickly 
A Race Toward Competitive Advantage
The competitive landscape is in its infancy  with no real dominant player controlling the market  This is good news for VEGL  especially with the most recent announcement of the  13 million contract in 2018  This provides them with the capital needed to separate themselves from the nearest competitor  Vegalab is looking to add even more revenue by securing distributors from other regions within the US 
One of those companies is Marrone Bio Innovations  a business founded in 2006 that has only six products in the market  Marrone reported revenue of  14 million in 2016 and accounted for a negative EPS of   1 16   Additional competitors include Certis USA  which has 34 products in the market and reported  16 6 million in 2016 revenue  and Andermatt Biocontrol  a company founded in 1988 that has 33 products for sale and an income of roughly  45 million in 2016 
The opportunity is ripe for VEGL  and they are well situated to take advantage of their product portfolio that is targeting the growing market demand  Vegalab s top selling products may undoubtedly gain a competitive edge on other market participants  with Nematode Control  Spider Mite Control  and Mosquito BioControl leading the sales  Additional contributions by Mildew Control  Pollen Boost  and Spore Control will strengthen the revenue stream in 2018 and continue the trend for what is expected to be a breakout year for VEGL 
Vegalab Sets The Table For A Strong 2018
Now that 2018 is on track to provide record revenues to VEGL  company management has set expectations to strengthen the company s market position further  First  VEGL management is looking to acquire companies that can profitably fuel its revenue growth by adding accretive earnings power  Next  the company plans to contract with new distributors outside of the United States to increase their global presence  And  finally  the company intends to hire additional sales support to grow consolidated sales revenue in 2018 
Taking the current market position into consideration  along with the fact that the organic foods market is growing faster than most farmers expected  the need for safe  effective  and alternative products to the current offering of synthetically produced products has never been higher Farmers can t serve an organic market while at the same time using synthetic pesticides  With millions of dollars to be made  along with the potential for family farms to win or lose the race to meet the changing consumer demands  a decision to use products like the ones offered by VEGL not only makes financial sense  but it can create a wealth of opportunities  Although VEGL is not yet the most significant player in the organic pesticide sector  they are well on their way to becoming one  Hence  from an investment perspective  the opportunity to invest at current levels may offer an enticing risk reward profile to the upside for investors

145026,366541,COST,Forget The Healthy Food Trend  Buy These Fast Food Stocks,opinion,"As the fresh food fad turned into a fully fledged  multibillion dollar market  many began to call for the death of the fast food industry  But while more people eat healthier than ever today  the fast food market is still thriving 
On the grocery side of things  nearly everyone knows that Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   spurred further competition in the fresh food market with its purchase of Whole Foods  Meanwhile  grocery delivery upstarts like Instacart quickly secured deals with Costco   NASDAQ COST    Kroger   NYSE KR    and other large chains  leading to talks of a  
This competition has  in many cases  led to greater access to healthy eating options  Yet  for the most part  the cost is still far too high for a large percentage of the population to make healthy food a viable option 
What s more  fast food chains remain a popular option for on the go eaters and low income families  Restaurants and grocery stores are obviously not the same thing  but it has been interesting to watch fast food giants continue to grow while access to healthier groceries became the norm 
With that said  let s take a look at three fast food stocks investors might want to consider scooping up 
1        McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD  
This historic fast food burger chain can be found throughout the world  and it even tried to offer more healthy options along the way to expand its reach  Two weeks ago  McDonald s reported that its full year and Q4 2017 comparable store sales both climbed over 5 3   which marked its best comps performance in six years  The company noted that this growth was driven  in part  by  tremendous progress  in its delivery and mobile order and pay business 
McDonald s is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and is now projected to see its Q1 earnings surge by 14 29   based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate  McDonald s is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of  9  over the next three to five years 
2        Domino s Pizza  Inc    NYSE DPZ  
This pizza chain s ability to constantly adapt to changing consumer habits  while also bolstering its online and mobile ordering  helped Domino s expand into one of the world s biggest fast food chains  now boasting 14 400 stores in over 85 international markets  Domino s is also currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports  B  grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system 
Investors should also note that Domino s is expected to see its Q4 sales pop by over 10  to hit  903 2 million when it reports next Tuesday  Feb  20  On top of that  the chain is projected to see its earnings soar 31 08  to reach  1 94 per share  based on our current estimates 
Domino s has met or topped earnings estimates in the trailing six quarters  and this streak seems poised to continue  The company s current Earnings ESP is 1 06   and paired with its high Zacks Rank  this means it is highly likely to beat Q4 estimates  as analysts seem to be more confident in Domino s recently  also read    
3        Sonic Corp    NASDAQ SONC  
Sonic hardly holds a candle to the size of either McDonald s or Domino s  but this fast food chain saw its first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings surge 25  last month  Sonic is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and is now projected to see its earnings climb by 22 40  for the full year to reach  1 53 per share 
Sonic is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 14 70  over the next three to five years  As a possible sign of further health at this growing fast food chain  Sonic recently noted that it plans to open 70 to 80 new franchise drive in locations in fiscal 2018

Estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors have come down  while the other half experienced positive estimate revisions  The Conglomerates  Consumer Discretionary and Transportation sectors have suffered the most notable negative revisions while the notable positive revisions have taken place in the Energy  Basic Materials  Industrial Products and Technology sectors  The most pronounced positive revisions have taken place in the Energy sector  reflecting developments in oil prices  On an ex Energy basis  the Q4 earnings growth rate is modestly below the  8 6  rate at the start of the quarter We haven t seen this type of revisions trend in recent years  but this trend will likely become the norm once the tax legislation gets enacted Q4 Earnings Season Gets UnderwayThe Q4 earnings season will not take the spotlight at least through the middle of January  but the reporting season will officially have gotten underway weeks before that  In fact  the Q4 earnings season will get underway this week with the Thursday earnings releases from Costco    and Oracle     Both of these companies will be releasing results for their fiscal November ending quarters  which officially get counted as part of the Q4 tally     Total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  8 8  from the same period last year on  6 8  higher revenues  which would follow the  6 9  earnings growth on  6  higher revenues in 2017 Q3 Earnings growth is expected to be positive for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with earnings growth in double digit territories for 6 sectors   Energy  up  168 7    Technology   13 1    Construction   19 5    Industrial Products   21 3    Basic Materials   27 3    and Autos   22 5   The table below shows the summary picture for Q4  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding earnings season 

The chart below shows Q4 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 6 quarters  As you can see in the chart below  the growth pace is expected to accelerate from the Q3 level in Q4 and beyond 

We have been pointing out that while the earnings growth pace decelerated in Q3  the overall level of total earnings reached an all time quarterly record  But as you can see in the chart below  the earnings tally for Q4 is expected to exceed what was achieved in the preceding period  creating a new all time quarterly record

145081,366596,COST,Costco And Oracle Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 11  2017   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes Costco   NASDAQ COST   and Oracle   NYSE ORCL   To see more earnings analysis  visit  Earnings Boost from Tax LegislationEarnings aren t the market s focus at present  the tax legislation currently moving towards a passage in Congress tops everything else  The legislation promises many substantive changes in a number of areas  but it will have a big impact on corporate profitability as well  all of it positive The exact earnings impact of the tax legislation will become clear once it is signed into law  but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost  S P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up  11 7   with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation  As meaningful as this impact on S P 500 earnings is  it is far more pronounced for small cap companies We will start seeing this in rising earnings estimates following the completion of the legislation  But we need to be mindful that the estimate revisions trend for Q4 has already been the most favorable relative to last many years  What this means is that the 2017 Q4 estimate revisions trend is unlike any other recent comparable period  with the earnings growth rate for the quarter actually inching up a bit since the quarter got underway Estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors have come down  while the other half experienced positive estimate revisions  The Conglomerates  Consumer Discretionary and Transportation sectors have suffered the most notable negative revisions while the notable positive revisions have taken place in the Energy  Basic Materials  Industrial Products and Technology sectors  The most pronounced positive revisions have taken place in the Energy sector  reflecting developments in oil prices  On an ex Energy basis  the Q4 earnings growth rate is modestly below the  8 6  rate at the start of the quarter We haven t seen this type of revisions trend in recent years  but this trend will likely become the norm once the tax legislation gets enacted Q4 Earnings Season Gets UnderwayThe Q4 earnings season will not take the spotlight at least through the middle of January  but the reporting season will officially have gotten underway weeks before that  In fact  the Q4 earnings season will get underway this week with the Thursday earnings releases from Costco and Oracle  Both of these

145105,366620,COST,Grocery Stocks Soar After Kroger s Solid Earnings Report ,opinion,"Shares of Kroger   NYSE KR   surged on Thursday after the company reported third quarter earnings that helped show investors it might be ready to compete against the likes of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Walmart   NYSE WMT    Kroger s performance helped lift almost the entire grocery industry  as shares of fellow grocers  including Costco   NASDAQ COST    surged 
Kroger posted Q3 earnings of  0 44 per share  which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 40 per share  The company s profit rose from  391 million to  397 million  On top of strong bottom line performance  revenues beat expectations and hit  27 7 billion  which marked a 4 5  year over year jump

The company reiterated its fourth quarter profit guidance and now projects its identical store sales will climb 1 1   excluding fuel 
Shares of Kroger soared over 10  premarket and flew as high as 12  in morning trading  Before today s gains  Kroger stock had plummeted nearly 30  since the start of the year  However  shares of the struggling grocer have started to climb over the last four weeks 
Today s encouraging third quarter results came even after Kroger began to lower its prices in an effort to fend off competition from online sellers  as well as Whole Foods and Walmart  Along with lowering prices  which is not necessarily sustainable long term  Kroger expanded its offerings and broke into new revenue streams 
 We continue to accelerate our digital and e commerce offerings  to grow Our Brands  to lower prices for customers  and to invest in our associates   CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement   This quarter shows that by investing for the future  our business continues to improve and gain momentum  
Kroger s moves include plans to expand its natural food offerings and grow its digital presence  with a focus on increasing online orders  The company also opened a new restaurant concept  as well as a new floral line called Bloom Haus 
Furthermore  the company announced it will launch an apparel line in 2018  These new offerings are aimed to help Kroger compete more directly against the likes of Walmart and Costco  who are viewed as more one stop shops  Barclays   NYSE BCS    recently that over 80  of Kroger s locations are within five miles of a Walmart 
Kroger s strong showing helped the company regain some investor confidence  at least for now  The chain s positive Q3 and ability to revamp its business model on the fly also lifted stocks throughout the grocery industry

Wrapping Up
We believe that Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered  The company s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track as cash strapped customers continue to reckon Costco as a viable option for low cost necessities  It is also gradually expanding e commerce capabilities in the United States  Canada  U K   Mexico  Korea and Taiwan 
We believe that the hike in annual membership fees and increased penetration of Citi Visa co brand card program will benefit the stock  We are also encouraged by Costco s expansion strategy  as it remains committed to opening new clubs and expanding e commerce capabilities 
Costco  which competes with Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT    operates 746 warehouses  comprising 518 warehouses in the United States and Puerto Rico  98 in Canada  37 in Mexico  28 in UK  26 in Japan  13 in Korea  13 in Taiwan  nine in Australia  two in Spain  one in Iceland and one in France

145125,366640,COST,Retail Industry Stock Outlook   Pre Holidays 2017,opinion,"The health of the retail industry is an important economic indicator  as it is linked directly to consumers and their propensity to spend  Consumer spending holds the key to the well being of the U S  market  it accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity 
The link between consumer spending and the retail industry becomes more relevant as retail sales attract approximately 30  of total consumer spending in the United States  Also  the retail industry ranks among the top U S  industries and employs an enormous workforce  thereby deciding the health of the job market 
Before jumping on to the trends in retail  here s a peek into the key economic indicators  which suggest where the market is heading 
On the whole  the U S  economy seems to be in good shape  Per the  third  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Sep 28  2017  the U S  economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 1  in the second quarter  This marks an increase from the  second  estimate of 3  and from 1 2  growth in the first quarter of 2017 
A favorable GDP growth rate along with rising disposable income  an improving labor market with unemployment rate to a 16 year low  a lift in economic activity post hurricanes and a low inflation rate have considerably boosted consumer sentiment  which was at a 13 year high in October  Data by the University of Michigan indicated that U S  consumer sentiment index surged to 101 1 in October from 95 1 in September 
Additionally  U S  retail sales rebound sharply in September  after a pullback in the month of August  on sturdy auto sales  rising gasoline prices and increased demand for building materials  This clearly indicates that the economy is gathering pace and setting the stage for an upbeat holiday season 
Data compiled by the Commerce Department reveals that U S  retail and food services sales rose 1 6  in September to  483 9 billion  following a revised reading of 0 1  decline in August  Moreover  retail sales increased 4 4  from September 2016 
Changing Retail Landscape
The Retail sector fully lives up to the saying   The only thing that is constant is change   This landscape has evolved from a marketplace where goods are bought and sold to a forum with multiple avenues to engage customers  With the advent of technology  the face of retail has changed from small big retail outlets to omni channel stores  where one can check products prices online and buy in stores  and vice versa  Today  the success mantra in retail hovers around finding new ways to market their products 
To put it simply  the retail sector is on transformation mode   with store based retailers now ditching their traditional stores and embracing omni channel concepts  which provide a more seamless shopping experience both online and in stores  The result is  customers can use computers  smartphones or tablets for shopping or visit a store if they want to 
Parallel to this shifting retail landscape  the industry is facing major challenges from a strong U S  dollar  volatile commodity costs and global uncertainty  The volatility in U S  dollar for quite some time now has been hurting retailers with worldwide operations  Also  the competitive situation continues to worsen as industry players vie for the top spot  focusing on speedy deliveries and enhanced customer experience  while battling margin pressure 
Key Retail Metrics
The key data in retail industry analysis is comparable store sales  comps  as it excludes sales at newly opened and closed stores  We observe that sales data for the month of September was more or less negative as the majority of retailers that report monthly comps faltered  With many retailers having discounted the practice of reporting monthly comps  we only have five of them providing this key metric for September 
The list of gainers in September had Washington based retailer of sports related teen apparel Zumiez on top  The company reported 9 3  increase in comps  with sales improving 12 6  to  84 4 million from the year ago period  This was the company s seventh straight month of comps growth  Based on the solid quarter to date performance  the company raised earnings and sales forecasts for third quarter fiscal 2017 
Right behind was warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp   COST   which posted an 8 9  rise in comps  while total sales rose 12 1  to  12 40 billion  Comparable e commerce sales for the month of September surged 30  
On the other hand  apparel and accessories retailer Cato Corporation  CATO  disappointed the most withan 11  decline in comps and an 8  fall in sales to  76 2 million  We note that the company s comps have been declining for more than a year  primarily due to a tough apparel retail scenario 
This was followed by The Buckle Inc   BKE   which continued with sluggish comps for the ninth straight time  reporting a 5 7  decline in comps and a 6 1  fall in net sales to  77 9 million for September 
Going down the line  we have specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products  L Brands Inc  NYSE LB    LB   The company posted a comps decline of 2  while sales increased 1  to  981 6 million  This marked the company s 10th straight month of comps decline  Further  the company expects comps to decline in low single digits in October 
Retail Wholesale Sector   A Mixed Bag
The  is more of a mixed bag when it comes to its performance trend  The sector has outperformed the broader market year to date  In this time frame  the sector has surged approximately 18 8   while the S P 500 index has advanced 14 5  
Looking at the sector s trailing 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is the most reliable multiple to value retail stocks  it looks pretty overvalued when compared with the S P 500  The sector has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 27 9  which is above the median level of 25 9 
However  this space compares unfavorably with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month P E for the S P 500 is at 20 8 and the median level is 19 8  The Retail and Wholesale sector s stretched valuation shows that there is only little upside left for the space when compared with the S P 500 market index 
The group s  confirms this view  This 222 company sector has seen 110 positive and 62 negative revisions in earnings estimates in the recent past  It carries a Zacks Sector Rank of  15  out of 16   placing it at the bottom 6  of the Zacks Rank sectors

145137,366652,COST,3 Credit Card Stocks To Pay Attention To  DFS  AXP  COF,opinion,"More and more people are turning away from paper cash and using their credit cards for purchases  As a result  credit card companies are always issuing new cards and tying rewards to these cards to sweeten consumer interest  Of course  the more credit card users a company has  the more potential income the company can make  But not all credit card companies nor credit card stocks are created equal 
In this post  I am going to highlight 3 credit card stocks that I feel are worth keeping an eye on and potentially investing your money in  Each has a different strategy when it comes to their credit cards  so various factors will be at play for each 
Let s get started 
3 Credit Card Stocks To Pay Attention To
 1  Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS 
Of the major credit card companies out there  Discover Financial Services  NYSE  DFS  is not only the smallest but the one who is most traditional  Even before the credit meltdown in 2008  Discover only offered credit to superprime borrowers  In other words  those customers who reduced the risk of defaulting on credit card debt to the lowest possible percent 
But Discover doesn t just do credit cards  They offer more lending services than they do credit cards  As a result  revenues have been healthy for the company 
During their recent earnings report  earnings per share came in at  1 40  missing estimates by  0 05 but revenues were up 9  at  2 42 billion 
As the Federal Reserve slowly increases interest rates  Discover should see profit margin increase on both its primary lending business and its credit card business 
The only downside for Discover is that their credit card isn t as widely accepted as the others in the space  But with lending offering a healthy stream of revenue  this isn t an issue 
 2  American Express  NYSE AXP 
The next credit card stock to look into is American Express  NYSE  AXP   After Costco  NASDAQ COST  left American Express out to dry a few years ago  the stock struggled to return to glory  But it finally has 
The reasons why investors love this stock is because of the client base American Express caters to  They have affluent customers  who are extremely loyal to the brand  In addition  their credit card users typically spend 2 3 times more than credit card rivals 
And that is just the consumer side  American Express has a booming corporate expense business that it has a lock on with an iron fist 
With their most recent earnings report  earnings per share came in at  1 47 which beat estimates by  0 03  Revenues were  8 31 billion  up 1  
That increase in revenues of 1  is what some investors fear  Some investors want more growth than this and many have stayed away from American Express  But the company increased their dividend and started a share buyback program recently 
If Aesop is right and the tortoise does beat the hare  then American Express is a stock to own as it s the tortoise compared to the other credit card stocks 
 3  Capital One Financial  NYSE COF 
OK  I ll admit that putting Capital One Financial  NYSE  COF  in a credit card stocks post is a stretch  After all  Capital One is one of the   has an auto finance unit as well as a global financial services business 
But the company issues credit cards branded by Visa Inc  NYSE V  and Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  and these cards are very popular with users 
Recent earnings per share came in at  1 96  beating estimates by  0 06  Revenues were up more than 7  to  6 7 billion 
Add into the mix the other business units of Capital One and this stock could be one that many investors are overlooking 
Final Thoughts
So there are 3 credit card stocks to look into  Depending on any pullbacks in the market  you can decide when the best time is to invest in these stocks  As I mentioned earlier  they each have a slightly different business model and as a result  different advantages 
One thing though is certain  If interest rates continue to rise and the US economy continues to grow  these credit card stocks could be looking at some very happy times in the coming years

145138,366653,COST,Costco  COST  Q4 Earnings Top  Stock Down On Margins Woe,opinion,Costco Wholesale Corporation   NASDAQ COST   ended fiscal 2017 on a positive note  with both the top and bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter  The company s results were driven by growth in membership fees  which it raised effective Jun 1  2017  We believe that the recent hike in annual membership fees and increased penetration of Citi Visa co brand card program will continue to benefit stock in the near term However  despite reporting better than expected in the quarter under review  the company s shares declined nearly 3  during after market trading session yesterday as contraction in margin alarmed investors This Issaquah  WA based company posted adjusted quarterly earnings of  2 08 per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 02 and increased 17 5  from the prior year period  Total revenues  which include net sales and membership fee  came in at  42 300 million that edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 739 million and jumped 15 7  year over year Major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers choose to shop online from the comfort of their homes  But Costco seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop  We noted that in the reported quarter the company s e commerce sales increased 21   this gives an indication that the company s efforts to drive online sales bode well Meanwhile  Costco which has been trying all means to push online sales launched new delivery options for its customers  Per the new delivery options  the company is not only offering two days delivery but is also providing customer same day delivery choices Costco Wholesale Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Delving DeeperFourth quarter net sales were up 15 8  to  41 357 million  while membership fee increased 13 3  to  943 million  Moreover  we noticed that the rate of increase in membership fee accelerated from 4 2  registered in the third quarter Costco s comparable store sales  comps  for the quarter improved 6 1   The company witnessed comps growth of 6 5   4 9  and 5 6  across the United States  Canadian and Other International locations  respectively Excluding the effect of gasoline prices and foreign exchange  the company witnessed comps growth of 5 7  during the quarter with the United States  Canada and Other International registering comps growth of 5 8   4 8  and 6   respectively Costco has been witnessing comps growth for quite some time now driven by improved store traffic and average transaction size  Comps for September increased 8 9   following an increase of 7 3  in August  6 2  in July  6  in June  4 1  in May  3  in April  6  in March  4  in February and 7  in January  Notably  net sales increased 12 1   10   8 8   7   7   5   9   8  and 9  in September  August  July  June  May  April  March  February and January  respectively  In a one year  the stock has advanced 11 4  and comfortably outperformed the  s growth of 4 1  Costco s operating income in the quarter increased 21 7  year over year to  1 450 million  while operating margin  as a percentage of total revenues  expanded 20 basis points to 3 5   However  gross margin as a percentage of net sales contracted 15 basis points to 11 3  Store UpdateCostco operates 741 warehouses  comprising 514 warehouses in the United States and Puerto Rico  97 in Canada  37 in Mexico  28 in the UK  26 in Japan  13 in Korea  13 in Taiwan  nine in Australia  two in Spain and one each in Iceland and France Financial AspectsCostco ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  4 546 million and long term debt  including current portion  of  6 659 million  The company s shareholders  equity was  10 778 million  excluding non controlling interests of  301 million Let s ConcludeThe Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on breadth and quality of merchandise offered  A differentiated product range enables the company to ensure an upscale shopping experience for its members  resulting in market share gains  Moreover  Costco continues to maintain a healthy membership renewal rate  It is also gradually expanding eCommerce capabilities in the United States  Canada  UK  Mexico  Korea and Taiwan However  Costco faces stiff competition from Sam s Club  a division of Wal Mart Stores Inc    NYSE WMT    which follows a similar business model  pushing through high volumes of merchandise at low prices in membership only warehouse clubs  Consequently  aggressive pricing to gain market share and drive traffic amid competitive pressure may dampen sales and margins Other Key PicksOther top ranked stocks which warrant a look in the retail space include PVH Corp    NYSE PVH   and Burlington Stores  Inc    NYSE BURL   both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  PVH Corp  delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3 6  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 13 1  Burlington Stores delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 17 7  in the trailing three quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 16 2  5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into

145141,366656,COST,Costco Down On Solid Earnings,opinion,"Even though Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  reported stellar earnings that beat both the top and bottom line  shares found it difficult to hold a bid in the after market trading session on Thursday October 5  2017 
Even though shares initially popped on the earnings report  actually hitting a high of  170 50  after the details were read and absorbed by traders and investors it was clear that Costco had one factor that would weigh heavy on the future share price 
The stock wound up closing at  162 20  which was down   4 88 or down 2 92  in the aftermarket session  The shares have traded in a 52 week range from a low of  142 11 to a high of  183 18  Costco pays a hefty dividend of 1 21  or  2 per share per year 
The factor outshining the stellar earnings was the gross margin of profits on a year over year basis  The fiscal quarter saw a decrease of about 15 basis points in their gross margins 
It seems Costco has been spending heavily to drive new sales and to keep existing members through their loyalty sales program  Clearly the drive to increase memberships had a positive effect because membership fees accounted for 72  of the actual operating income that Costco earned in the quarter  The quarter also saw an increase in these fees by  5 for their Gold star and Business members and by  10 for their executive membership members 
COST Numbers
When Costco reported earnings after the bell on Thursday  their fourth quarter net income came in at  919 million dollars which compares with  779 million a year ago  Earnings per share came in at  2 08 versus  1 77 in the year prior  Revenues rose to  42 3 billion dollars from  36 5 billion dollars a year ago  These numbers are huge and represent the scope of Costco s influence on the American Consumer 
The Chart

It is clear to see how shares initially rose after the earnings were reported on the right side of the chart in the shaded region  and the subsequent sell off once the numbers and details were digested 

Clearly  shares of Costco have been underperforming the overall market indices  It is easy to see that there is no clear trend going back the last 5 to 6 months on the daily chart timeframe 
Analyst Comments
In a pre earnings client note  BMO Capital Markets analysts had this to say 

We believe near term sentiment and fear of the long term impact of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  on Costco s business could continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside

My expectation that last week would focus on jobs in the pre Labor Day was pretty accurate  but also easy  There was plenty of competition from Harvey coverage  The economic news was solid leading into Friday s payroll numbers  While that report was viewed as weak  it had little market effect 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a chart of the S P 500 on a day by day basis 

Once again  we had a low volatility  gentle climb  The avalanche of data and geopolitical news is not apparent from the chart 
The Silver Bullet
As I indicated recently I am moving the Silver Bullet award to a standalone feature  rather than an item in WTWA  I hope that readers and past winners    will help me in giving special recognition to those who help to keep data honest  As always  nominations are welcome 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news generally positive  The employment report miss is the possible exception 
The Good
Q2 GDP was revised upward to 3   beating expectations and suggesting a higher base for the rest of the year 
Global profit margins are higher     

ADP employment showed a gain in private employment of 237K  up from 201K in July and beating expectations of 190K  I have frequently suggested that this report should be treated as an independent estimate of employment  not a forecast for the BLS announcement  I am working on a project to show why this is important 
Personal income increased 0 4  in July versus unchanged in June 
Bullish investor sentiment continues  David Templeton  HORAN  explains this contrarian indicator 

Core PCE Prices were 0 1  higher  This is the inflation indicator favored by the Fed  The continuing low reading suggests that the pace of interest rate increases will be modest 
The ISM manufacturing index improved to 58 5  a  sizzling  number according to   The Chicago index showed similar strength 

Consumer Confidence remains high  The Conference Board   122 9  Michigan sentiment   96 8   has a nice update of the entire picture  Here is just one of the charts 

The Bad
Consumer spending increased 0 3   up from June but trailed expectations of a 0 4  gain 
Construction spending had a surprising decline of 0 6  despite a positive expectation  Steven Hansen  GEI  reports  including his regular interesting comparison between spending and construction jobs 

Harvey effects  While everyone s main concern is the human cost   loss of life  injuries  and destruction of homes   there have already been stories about the effects on various stocks and sectors   Thanks to our friends in Texas   especially Houston   for letting us know how you are doing   I ll stick to a couple of observations about the economic effects on the indicators we track  Despite the massive losses  perhaps  150 billion  the effect on GDP may actually be positive  It measures production without regard to the purpose  The immediate effect on gasoline prices was a spike higher  up about twenty cents per gallon at  2 54  Estimates call for another 15 20 cents before a plateau is reached      Bespoke says that it may be the  for the records in initial jobless claims 
Payroll employment dropped to a net gain of 154K and missed the 180K expectation  Average hourly earnings gains were also a bit light  As usual  the small  miss  was deemed by many to be major news  I wish more folks would read  the employment report  Here are a few interesting takeaways  Please note that the results are from data collected before Hurricane Harvey 
CNBC collects a  from Wall Street economists  Goldman s Jan Hatzius thinks that wages are on the path to improvement  Some others question the effect on the underlying trend  Diane Swonk  DS Economics  noted that the manufacturing increase was the best since 2012   CF  Steven Hansen below

Harry Holzer    explains that the current environment is just right for major gains  even if there is a current skill mismatch  Read the full post for interesting policy ideas 

A tight labor market creates unusual opportunities for us to address these many challenges  Because employer demand for workers is now so strong  the usual questions about whether jobs really exist for better skilled or more motivated workers are moot  In addition  employers who experience unusual difficulty hiring or retaining workers will likely be more open to training them and perhaps will hire more marginal applicants whom they would not otherwise consider 


Indeed  tight labor markets do more to help disadvantaged workers than any policy interventions  and such policies will likely be more successful when markets are tight  After so many years of slack labor markets  with limited employer interest in such efforts  we must not let this opportunity go to waste

The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a very light economic calendar and a short week  Most important is the ISM services index  but that will not be the feature  In the aftermath of Jackson Hole and the quiet period  Fed participants are out in force  There is something every day  and the Fed Beige Book on Wednesday 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
As I prepared for this edition of WTWA  I expected a pause for assessment of recent news and data  When I read my weekly issue of Barron s this morning  the cover cried out    Wow  Is the end near 
It was further evidence of the need to find fresh worries  Expect a week of wondering 
Is it finally time to worry about what can derail the rally 
Ben Levisohn s cover story accurately linked past market declines to recessions  There is a well conceived and executed chart of this relationship  And the chance of a recession  Here is the prominently featured table 

This is a laundry list of anything that might go wrong  One cannot estimate the odds or the likely impact  It is typical of the normal list of worries  It has little to do with the likelihood of a recession 
The overall article is more balanced  especially noting that the most accurate indicators show no imminent recession  Too bad that was not the headline 
This story is not an isolated example  although it is a prominent one  Added to the recession assertions are three other factors 
The nearly universal acceptance of valuation indicators that do not reflect low inflation    
The myth that a market peak  in and of itself  is a signal of danger 
The idea that if an economic or stock cycle is lengthy  it must be near the end 
There are good counter arguments  but they seem to get less attention 
The infrastructure upside    
Interesting and meaningful indicators   entertainment spending  much higher  and food stamp use  lower     
Dr  Ed Yardeni s  Fundamental Stock Indicator

They say a picture is worth a thousand words  but in investing it is worth so much more  Having a few extreme charts on your wall can be a helpful reminder that there is no such thing as  can t    won t   or  has to  in markets  The market doesn t have to do anything  and certainly not what you think it  should  do  The market doesn t abide by any hard and fast rules  it does what it wants to do and when it wants to do it

Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich has an interesting topic every day  His own commentary adds insight and ties together key current articles  This week he had two great posts on expertise  In one   my call out to a  who is currently off the rails   No response so far   In another  he suggested that a  to manage one s portfolio  Gil s work was the source for today s  best investment advice   I am left with an uneasy feeling  There is so much emphasis on criticizing the expertise of others and so little on identifying people who actually know something useful  People spend more time finding the right plumber than they do in figuring out which sources provide the best information  Of course  confirmation bias in choosing plumbers meets a swift and wet confrontation with reality

Final Thoughts
You can find a billionaire investor saying nearly anything  If you are willing to ignore context  you can find the same billionaire appearing to offer conflicting advice    takes on the recent comparison of today with 1937  
So many are interested in advising how investors should deal with a market collapse  There is no evidence for an imminent collapse  and certainly nothing fresh  but it is apparently a tempting topic  It has succeeded in creating plenty of nervousness  There will be a time to get conservative  but some real evidence is needed first 
There is little attention to stock upside  Fast Money s Jim Lebenthal did a quick analysis of the potential tax reform effect  Like me  he does not think that current prices include much of this effect  His back of the envelope calculation is S P earnings of  140 for 2018 and a multiple of 18 5  not unusual for a low interest rate environment  That represents a gain of about 4 5    not great  but better than inflation or bonds  If a tax reform package passes  earnings could move to the 145 150 range  He notes that the top of that range represents a 12  increase 
For several years the most difficult trade has been to remain invested in stocks in the face of continuous and ever changing worries  As usual  the toughest trade has been the most profitable one 
What worries me 
The possible ETF effects  The only major stock decline not linked to a recession was in 1987  Early in my career  I studied this carefully  The key problem was over investment in stocks by many who thought that something called  portfolio insurance  would protect against their losses  Does the increased number of ETF investors create a similar situation  I am watching this carefully 
The debt ceiling game of chicken  Congressional leaders have confidence  Administration officials emphasize the importance of a  clean bill   The President seems willing to use this as a bargaining chip  The Democrats are not saying much  I expect a solution  probably starting with an extension  but the participants are making it scary   just as in 2011 
 and what doesn t
The Fed   at least in the near term  That includes both rate increases at a reasonable pace and the planned balance sheet reduction  At some point the Fed may find that inflation came faster than expected  but that type of action normally precedes a recession by at least a year

145212,366727,COST,American Express Settles Cardholders  Discrimination Claims,opinion,"Recently  American Express Co    NYSE AXP   disclosed having incurred  95 million in claims to settle cardholders  discrimination This inconsistency surfaced during the company s internal review process  which began in 2012  of its card product offerings in Puerto Rico  the U S  Virgin Islands and the Pacific Territories The findings point to the fact that the terms and conditions and other frills and facilities provided on cards issued to customers in these regions were less generous and attractive compared to the ones issued in the Continental U S The company clarified that cards issued in any region are accordingly customized to make sure that its services and benefits are locally relevant to provide superior value to its card members Management also said that the cards issued in the U S  were highly competitive and offered to the public in general without any reservation pertaining to caste or creed  The company  however  confessed the relative inferiority in cards issued in the Pacific and Atlantic territories and that this should not have been so American Express voluntary reported this to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and accepted its shortcoming by a compensation of  95 million from 2013 2013 to more than 200 000 affected customers The regulators acknowledged this remedial measure taken by the company that saved it from civil penalties  Regulators have  however  asked the company to make an additional payment of  1 million The bureau also accused American Express of discriminating between its customers on the basis of race and ethnic background  which has been rebuffed by the latter 
Year to date  the company s shares have returned 31   outpacing the 22  gain by the  it belongs to 

We believe this settlement by American Express is aimed at shielding its customer base  It should help in customer retention and stabilizing market share The payments space is intensely competitive which makes it a hard task to tap new customers and retain old ones  something which is imperative for long term growth for the players in this industry American Express has in the recent past sustained weak results from parting ways with one of its major clients Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST    last year   In order to make up for the loss from this foregone business  the company took up massive marketing expenditure and won some clients and deals though not as big as Costco The company is thus not in a position to face any unfavorable development which may further hurt its already fragile business Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider

	Also today  Jeremy decided to take some profits  He coveredProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures ETF  SVXY  since the soft market continues to fuel the VIX  The position brings a gain of 3 8   The editor also shortcovered the first half of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  for 5 6   as the company would be susceptible to a stiffer pullback  The second half could be covered any day now  Read more about all of today s moves in the full write up  TAZR Trader  Kevin is convinced that we are stuck in a short term downtrend  Therefore  the editor decided it was time to get back into ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  UVXY   one of his favorite tools for buying volatility and protecting the portfolio  Originally  the plan was to buy only a 5  position  but the market continues to stumble  So the position was doubled in the afternoon to 10   The complete commentary has more  Surprise Trader   And we saw some more news from Amazon today  as it looks as if the deal to buy Whole Foods will close next week  Amazon isn t wasting any time though  as it is saying that it will begin lowering prices on a number of best selling products on Monday  Amazon also said that eventually Prime would be integrated and would allow for specials in store  but that will be a bit further down the line   This announcement and the speed at which Amazon is moving had a negative impact on grocery store stocks again today  sending Kroger  NYSE KR  down another 7 5   but also putting pressure on names like Costco  NASDAQ COST  and Target too  The Amazon threat continues to grow for grocery stocks  and I think this may just be the tip of the iceberg for this group  unfortunately      Eric Dutram

145239,366754,COST,Here s Why Costco Owes Tiffany   Co  Over  19 Million,opinion,"On Monday  U S  District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that wholesale giant Costco   NASDAQ COST   owes luxury jewelry company Tiffany   Co    NYSE TIF   over  19 million in a case over trademark infringement 
Judge Swain ruled that Tiffany is entitled to  11 1 million in trebled profits  which is three times the loss it incurred from Costco s actions  plus interest and  8 25 million in punitive damages  Costco had been selling products  like diamond rings and other jewelry  falsely identified and marked with the  Tiffany  brand  and the company s management  displayed at best a cavalier attitude toward Costco s use of the Tiffany name in conjunction with ring sales and marketing   said Judge Swain in her opinion 
 Costco s salespeople described such rings as  Tiffany  rings in response to customer inquiries  and were not perturbed when customers who then realized that the rings were not actually manufactured by Tiffany expressed anger or upset   Swain continued 
Tiffany declared the judge s decision a victory  with its lead counsel Jeffrey Mitchell saying that  this has been a long  hard fought battle to vindicate Tiffany s rights  
The iconic jewelry maker first filed a complaint against Costco back in 2013  saying that it had actually learned from a customer that the wholesaler was selling fake Tiffany rings   There are now hundreds if not thousands of people who mistakenly believe they purchased and own a Tiffany engagement ring from Costco   the complaint said at the time  The 2013 complaint also said that Costco was not using the Tiffany trademark on its website  which made it difficult for the jeweler to track it down 
Costco said it intends to appeal Judge Swain s ruling  the company argued that it was using  Tiffany  as a generic word to describe a particular kind of ring setting  and that the rings were not marked with the Tiffany brand   This was not a case about counterfeiting in the common understanding of that word    Costco was not selling imitation Tiffany   Co  rings   the company said in a statement 
Additionally  Costco can no longer use the word  Tiffany  to sell products  said Swain 
At market close  shares of COST were down a slight 0 65   while TIF stock was down 2 89

145287,366802,COST,Mastercard Vs  Visa  Which Is The Better Card Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Major credit card processors are scheduled to report earnings over this week and the next  While  American Express Company   NYSE AXP   and Visa Inc    NYSE V   are scheduled to report earnings within a day of each other  Mastercard Inc  s   NYSE MA   earnings are due for release next week 
Visa has profited considerably from American Express  loss of its lucrative partnership with Costco Wholesale Corporation   NASDAQ COST    which it has now added to its bag of tie ups  The reunion with Visa Europe has also strengthened the card processor 
Meanwhile  Mastercard is benefiting from its inorganic growth strategy  such as its acquisitions of VocaLink and NuData Security  Its partnerships  such as its deal with PayPal Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ PYPL   have also widened its business opportunities  Meanwhile  Mastercard is making significant progress in its digital strategy and continuously investing in technology 
With Visa and Mastercard scheduled to report within a week of each other  on Jul 20 and Jul 27  respectively this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock  Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rating  You can see 
Price Performance
Shares of both Mastercard and Visa have notched up gains in the year to date period  Visa is marginally ahead with a gain of 24 1   However  Mastercard is not far behind with an increase of 23 4   ahead of both the Zacks  industry and the S P 500 which have gained 20 2  and 10   respectively during this period 

Valuation
The average one year trailing 12 month P B ratio is the best multiple for valuing the card processing business because of large variations in earnings results from one quarter to the next 

Coming to the two stocks under consideration  with a P B ratio of 24 23  Mastercard is overvalued compared to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry  On the other hand  Visa has a P B ratio of 8 10  which is why it is undervalued compared to both the broader industry as well as Mastercard  
Dividend Yield

Coming to dividend yield  while the Financial Transaction Services industry offers a dividend yield of 0 7   Mastercard offers a marginally lower return of 0 69   Visa is not far behind  with a dividend yield of 0 68   which means that this round is too close to call 
Earnings History ESP  Estimate Revisions and EPS Growth
Riding on higher revenues  Visa posted   ended Mar 31  2017  earnings of 86 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents  Also  the bottom line improved 27  year over year  Net operating revenue of  4 5 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 2 billion  Also  revenues climbed 23  year over year 
Meanwhile  Mastercard reported  earnings of  1 01 per share  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents by 7 4   Also  earnings improved 17 4  year over year  MasterCard posted revenues of  2 73 billion for the reported quarter  which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 64 billion  On a year over year basis  revenues increased 11 8  
Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  both Mastercard and Visa have delivered positive earnings surprises over the last two quarters  However  Visa holds a slight edge with an average earnings surprise of 7 2  versus Mastercard s figure of 6 4   Visa also has a higher expected earnings growth rate of 18 4  for the current year  compared to Mastercard s expected rate of 13 9  
However  when considering   there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks  with both having readings of 0  Estimate revisions for both stocks have increased by 0 1  over the last 30 days 
Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that there is nothing to choose between Mastercard and Visa when considering Earnings ESP and estimate revisions  Additionally  both stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  While Mastercard offers a marginally higher dividend yield  Visa holds a clear edge when considering earnings history  price performance  expected EPS growth and valuations  This is why it may be better to bet on Visa over Mastercard

145300,366815,COST,Blue Apron IPOs At Low End Of Price Range  Should You Invest ,opinion,"On Thursday  meal kit delivery company Blue Apron said its IPO would be priced at  10 per share  which is at the low end of the company s already   Blue Apron originally expected to price its 30 million Class A shares of common stock between  15 and  17 a piece 
This  Blue Apron at  1 9 billion  down considerably from the initial proposed valuation of  3 billion  The company expects its shares to begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol  APRN   and to raise about  300 million  a third less than it had hoped  Goldman Sachs   Co  NYSE GS    Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Citigroup  NYSE C   and Barclays  LON BARC  are the lead underwriters on the offering 
What is Blue Apron 
The buzzed about  New York based meal kit delivery service has been growing rapidly since its debut in 2012  Founded by Matt Salzberg  Matt Wadiak  and Ilia Papas  it specializes in bringing boxes of pre measured ingredients to home cooks  delivering original and seasonal recipes weekly  Recipes are never repeated in the same year  and are roughly 500 800 calories per serving 
Delivery is free  and subscribers can pick a delivery day that best fits their schedule  ingredients arrive in a refrigerated box so food stays fresh if you re not home during delivery  Blue Apron has built its brand around using ingredients that are fresh  natural its meats are raised on antibiotic  and hormone free diets and  perfectly pre measured  so that there s no waste  The company sources from  artisanal purveyors and hundreds of family run farms that support sustainable practices  
Blue Apron is not cheap  A two person plan provides three recipes per week for  59 94   9 99 per serving  and a family plan offers either two or four recipes per week for  69 92 or  139 84  respectively   8 74 per serving   Factor in any other food costs for the week  and an individual s or family s grocery bill becomes even more expensive 
Bustling Competition
Blue Apron is not alone in the meal kit delivery industry  It is quite the opposite  There are so many meal kit delivery companies on the market that it is difficult to choose which one to try  In fact  there seems to be a company that specializes in almost every food trend or dietary preference out there 
One of Blue Apron s biggest competitors is   While the two companies are nearly identical  Plated has worked to differentiate itself from Blue Apron by offering more diverse meal choices and adding dessert  Subscription costs range from  48 per week  two dinners for two people   6 shipping fee  to  168 per week  seven dinners for two people  free shipping   Its recipes feature fresh produce and specialty cuts of meat and seafood that vary based on market price 
Another big rival is   Just like Blue Apron and Plated  HelloFresh delivers a box of fresh  pre measured ingredients and recipes straight to your doorstop every week   specializes in vegan recipes  and costs between  68  74 per week  former food columnist of The New York Times Mark Bittman co founded the company

Reinventing Cooking
The advantages to meal kit delivery services like Blue Apron are well known convenience  less waste  well balanced meals  It s a kitchen innovation that s changing how some people cook and prepare food at home  Blue Apron and its many rivals have arrived at an almost perfect moment in our digital era  Our tastes and preferences have been polished by restaurants  famers  markets  and food television networks  we want freshness and organically  naturally raised products  but above all  efficiency 
Blue Apron has built its brand around these three qualities  as well as introducing its customers to rare  exotic ingredients  Its kits are perfect for those wanting to learn how to cook  and cook with confidence  and to learn how to cook and appreciate these atypical recipe components 
It also offers an instant lifestyle upgrade  Enough food for three separate meals is delivered right to your doorstep  eliminating the need to trek to the grocery store once a week  With Blue Apron  customers don t have to worry about finding all of the ingredients for a recipe  Everything you need  in the exact amount you need  is neatly packaged and ready to be turned into a basically homemade meal 
One of the biggest strengths of companies like Blue Apron is the decline in food waste  Because it sources from local farms  Blue Apron avoids much of the waste that comes with flying in produce or other products internationally to your grocery store  which requires a ton of packaging  Products typically come in crates instead of corrugated boxes when supplied locally 
Criticism
Blue Apron  however  has its downfalls  Most apparent  and perhaps a big reason to hesitate  is the price  and Blue Apron is one of the cheaper options 
Most ready to cook meal deliveries fall between  10  15 in the price per serving range  Whether or not you consider this outrageously expensive or a good deal depending on your eating and shopping habits it s fair to assume that with services like Blue Apron  you pay a premium for the convenience of having a high quality meal planned out for you and delivered right to your home   Popular food publication Eater an interesting question   Are services like Blue Apron the future of home cooked food  or are they a mindless extravagance for wealthy Americans  
While encouraging people to cook at home  Blue Apron may also be taking the joy out of cooking  There s no more trips to the grocery store or farmer s market to seek out fresh produce and meat  a journey that connects you to the ingredients you are about to consume  Customers could potentially lose sight of where their food comes from 
While Blue Apron is known for working with local farmers to source their ingredients  something they should be commended for  its customers may only know that their food arrives in pre packaged quantities in a refrigerated box on their doorstep  The company does include information about its local suppliers in its boxes  on its Facebook   NASDAQ FB   page  and throughout its website  but since their typical customer may be too busy to go grocery shopping  there s a good chance they ll be too busy to read the included brochures 
Blue Apron does a great job reducing food waste  but its environmental impact should also be considered  Each of its boxes include sometimes extraneous packaging choices like small plastic bags for two or three carrots or little plastic containers of soy sauce and since recipe ingredients are already portioned out  each ingredient arrives separately in plastic containers  Each plastic package  however  is recyclable  but Blue Apron could easily combine some ingredients and reduce the amount of plastic it uses 
Should You Invest 
Ever since Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   announced its intentions to acquire organic grocer Whole Foods Market   NASDAQ WFM    the entire food industry has been spooked  Investors grew increasingly bearish on giants like Kroger   NYSE KR    Walmart   NYSE WMT    and Costco   NASDAQ COST    companies who had for years dominated their own successful corners of the market 
This cautiousness spread  unfortunately  to Blue Apron  whose IPO has been overshadowed by what s turning out to be the deal of the century  But that s not to say the meal kit company doesn t have its own problems  Blue Apron has a history of losses  though it was actually profitable in the first quarter of 2016    however  as the year went on   The company s growth  though  is impressive  it generated  795 million in revenues last year  up from  341 million in 2015 
Blue Apron is now shipping about eight million meals to customers nationwide every month  according to   up from five million meals per month in October of 2015  The company also said it had 4 3 million orders in the first quarter of this year  up from 3 7 million orders in the fourth quarter of 2016  a number that seems to be steadily rising  Its average revenue per customer in the first quarter this year was  236  down from  265 in the first quarter last year 
While its business model  like that of all meal kit delivery services  is thriving  partly because it does not have to maintain giant refrigerated warehouses  nor does it have too much retail operating costs  it is pretty easy to copy  Whole Foods  in particular  sells ready to cook meal kits  and with Amazon s unmatched delivery and pickup logistics  potential Blue Apron investors should be wary 
But there is no doubt that Blue Apron has upended the ways in which we think about cooking  grocery shopping  and eating food  Since its not so long ago launch  the company has transformed how many people shop for food and cook in their homes  As Blue Apron finally goes public  the company has the potential to change the entire food industry

	While encouraging people to cook at home  Blue Apron may also be taking the joy out of cooking  There s no more trips to the grocery store or farmer s market to seek out fresh produce and meat  a journey that connects you to the ingredients you are about to consume  Customers could potentially lose sight of where their food comes from 

	While Blue Apron is known for working with local farmers to source their ingredients  something they should be commended for  its customers may only know that their food arrives in pre packaged quantities in a refrigerated box on their doorstep  The company does include information about its local suppliers in its boxes  on its Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page  and throughout its website  but since their typical customer may be too busy to go grocery shopping  there s a good chance they ll be too busy to read the included brochures 

	Blue Apron does a great job reducing food waste  but its environmental impact should also be considered  Each of its boxes include sometimes extraneous packaging choices like small plastic bags for two or three carrots or little plastic containers of soy sauce and since recipe ingredients are already portioned out  each ingredient arrives separately in plastic containers  Each plastic package  however  is recyclable  but Blue Apron could easily combine some ingredients and reduce the amount of plastic it uses 

Should You Invest 

	Ever since Amazon  NASDAQ          announced its intentions to acquire organic grocerWhole Foods Market  NASDAQ           the entire food industry has been spooked  Investors grew increasingly bearish on giants like Kroger  NYSE           Walmart  NYSE           and Costco  NASDAQ           companies who had for years dominated their own successful corners of the market 

	This cautiousness spread  unfortunately  to Blue Apron  whose IPO has been overshadowed by what s turning out to be the deal of the century  But that s not to say the meal kit company doesn t have its own problems  Blue Apron has a history of losses  though it was actually profitable in the first quarter of 2016      however  as the year went on   The company s growth  though  is impressive  it generated  795 million in revenues last year  up from  341 million in 2015 

	Blue Apron is now shipping about eight million meals to customers nationwide every month  according to    up from five million meals per month in October of 2015  The company also said it had 4 3 million orders in the first quarter of this year  up from 3 7 million orders in the fourth quarter of 2016  a number that seems to be steadily rising  Its average revenue per customer in the first quarter this year was  236  down from  265 in the first quarter last year 

	While its business model  like that of all meal kit delivery services  is thriving  partly because it does not have to maintain giant refrigerated warehouses  nor does it have too much retail operating costs  it is pretty easy to copy  Whole Foods  in particular  sells ready to cook meal kits  and with Amazon s unmatched delivery and pickup logistics  potential Blue Apron investors should be wary 

	But there is no doubt that Blue Apron has upended the ways in which we think about cooking  grocery shopping  and eating food  Since its not so long ago launch  the company has transformed how many people shop for food and cook in their homes  As Blue Apron finally goes public  the company has the potential to change the entire food industry

145304,366819,COST,Retail Industry Stock Outlook   July 2017,opinion,"Retailing involves buying large quantities of goods and selling them in smaller measures for a profit  The health of the retail industry is an important economic indicator as it is linked directly to consumers and their propensity to spend  Consumer spending holds the key to the well being of the U S  market as it accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity 
The link between consumer spending and the retail industry becomes more relevant as retail sales attract approximately 30  of total consumer spending in the U S  Also  the retail industry ranks among the top U S  industries and employs an enormous workforce  thereby deciding the health of the job market 
Before jumping on to the trends in retail  here s a peek into the key economic indicators  which suggest where the market is heading 
On the whole  the U S  economy seems to be in good shape  Per the  third  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Jun 29  2017  the U S  economy expanded at an annual rate of 1 4  in the first quarter  This marks an increase from the  second  estimate of 1 2  but a downside from 2 1  growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 
While GDP growth in the first quarter was on the low side  many key parts of the economy have consistently been on the growth trajectory  Steady labor and housing markets stand witness to this  Wages have been improving as well  This is propping up the household sector s buying power  which is showing up in revived consumer spending and consumer confidence data 
Evidently  consumer spending made a comeback in June  rising 1 1   While this marked the weakest reading since second quarter 2013  it nearly doubled from a 0 6  rise in May  Consumer confidence improved moderately during the month of June indicating that the economy is on a recovery path after a dismal show in May  According to the recent Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 118 9 in June from May s reading of 117 6  We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help revive sales 
Changing Retail Landscape
The Retail sector fully lives up to the saying   The only thing that is constant is change   This landscape has evolved from a marketplace where goods are bought and sold to a forum with multiple avenues to engage customers  With the advent of technology  the face of retail has changed from small big retail outlets to omni channel stores  where one can check products prices online and buy in stores  and vice versa  Today  the success mantra in retail hovers around finding new ways to market their products 
To put it simply  the retail sector is on transformation mode   with store based retailers now ditching their traditional stores and embracing omni channel concepts  which provide a more seamless shopping experience both online and in stores  The result is  customers can use computers  smartphones or tablets for shopping or visit a store if they want to 
Parallel to this shifting retail landscape  the industry is facing major challenges from a strong U S  dollar  volatile commodity costs and global uncertainty  The volatility in the U S  dollar has been hurting retailers with worldwide operations   Also  the competitive situation continues to worsen as industry players vie for the top spot  focusing on speedy deliveries and enhanced customer experience  while battling margin pressures 
Key Retail Metrics
The key data in retail industry analysis is comparable store sales  comps  as they exclude sales at newly opened and closed stores  We observe that sales data for the month of June was more or less negative  as the majority of retailers that report monthly comps faltered  With many retailers having discounted the practice of reporting monthly comps  we only have a six of them providing this key metric for June 
The list of gainers in June had warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp   COST  on the top  The company posted a 6  rise in comps  while total sales rose 7  to  12 17 billion  Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and gasoline prices  Costco s comps for the month under review rose 6 5  
Right behind was Washington based retailer of sports related teen apparel Zumiez Inc   ZUMZ  that reported a 5 3  increase in comps  with sales improving 8 4  to  72 2 million from the year ago period  Following the better than expected sales results for June  the company raised its guidance for second quarter fiscal 2017 
On the other hand  apparel and accessories retailer Cato Corporation  CATO  disappointed the most witha 16  decline in comps and a 15  fall in sales to  74 7 million  We note that the company s comps have been declining for more than a year  primarily due to a tough apparel retail scenario 
This was followed by specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products  L Brands Inc  NYSE LB    LB   The company posted a comps decline of 9  while sales dropped 6  to  1 213 billion  This marked the company s seventh straight month of comps decline  Further  the company expects comps to decline by mid single digits in the month of July 
Going down the line  The Buckle Inc   BKE  continued with sluggish comps for the sixth straight time  reporting a 5 8  decline in comps and a 5 9  fall in net sales to  73 6 million for June  Placed further down in the list is discount store operator Fred s Inc   FRED  which saw a 1 6  fall in comps for June  Fred s net sales slipped 5 3  to  197 5 million 
Retail Wholesale Sector   A Mixed Bag
The  is more of a mixed bag when it comes to its performance trend  The sector has outperformed the broader market in the past six months  In the said time frame  the sector has surged approximately 10 8   while the S P 500 index has advanced 6 8  
Looking at the sector s trailing 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is the most reliable multiple to value retail stocks  it looks pretty overvalued  when compared with the S P 500  The sector has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 26 70  which is above the median level of 25 46 and below the high of 26 97  scaled in the past year 
However  this space compares unfavorably with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month P E for the S P 500 is at 20 19 and the median level is 19 49  The Retail and Wholesale sector s stretched valuation shows that there is only little upside left for the space when compared with the S P 500 market index 
The group s  confirms this view  This 236 company sector has seen seven positive and four negative revisions in earnings estimates in the recent past  It carries a Zacks Sector Rank of  15  placing it at the bottom 6  of the Zacks Rank sectors 
Zacks Industry Rank   Negative
Within the Zacks Industry classification  retailers are broadly grouped in the retail and Wholesale sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  and are further sub divided into 18 industries at the expanded  aka  X   level                                      and  
We rank all the 250 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies  We put our X industries into two groups  the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much  To learn more visit   
The Zacks Industry Rank is  11 for Retail Consumer Electronics  top 4     41 for Internet   Commerce  top 16     62 for Retail Supermarkets  top 24     86 for Retail Discount Stores  top 34     122 for Retail Computer Hardware  top 48     122 for Retail Regional Department Stores  top 48     122 for Retail Home Furnishings  top 48     159 for Retail Restaurants  bottom 38     168 for Building Products Retail  bottom 34     177 for Retail Miscellaneous  bottom 31     195 for Retail Mail Order  bottom 24     218 for Retail Pharmacies and Drug Stores  bottom 15     225 for Food Natural Foods Products  bottom 12     230 for Automotive Retail and Wholesale  bottom 10     237 for Retail Apparel and Shoes  bottom 7     246 for Retail Jewelry  bottom 4     253 for Retail Convenience Stores  bottom 1    and  256 for Automotive Retail and Wholesale Parts  bottom 1   
On analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for the constituent industries in this space  it is apparent that the overall outlook for the Retail and Wholesale sector is Negative 
Sector Level Earnings Trends
The Q2 earnings season  meaning June end quarter results  is yet to unfold  However  quarterly reports from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May are coming up over the last few weeks and all these form part of the Q2 tally 
Looking at the second quarter  we note that estimates have come down  but the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably with other periods 
As of Jul 7  we have seen results from 23 S P 500 members  accounting for 4 6  of the index s total membership  Of these  approximately 82 6  have delivered positive earnings surprises  while 87  beat top line expectations  Total earnings for these index members were up 26 1  from the year ago quarter  while revenues increased 8 3   These early results  however  provide no basis to draw any conclusion about the quarter on the whole 
For Q2 as a whole  total earnings are expected to be up 5 8  on a 4 5  increase in revenues  This will follow 13 3  earnings growth and 7  revenue upside registered in first quarter 2017  marking the highest growth pace in almost two years 
Coming to the retail sector  14 3  of retailers in the S P 500 index that combined account for 10  of the sector s total market cap in the index have reported earnings so far  Of these  66 7  of the members posted earnings beats and about 66 7  surpassed revenue estimates 
Combing results on board and upcoming  earnings for the Retail sector are expected to decline 0 4  in Q2  with revenues anticipated to grow nearly 3 8

Retail Stocks Worth Buying Now 
The Retail sector may seem to be mature at the moment with little upside left  However  there are gainers in this space too that might be solid investment bets  Here are a few stocks that have been witnessing positive estimate revisions and sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

Alibaba  NYSE BABA  Group Holdings Ltd   BABA   The stock gained a whopping 50 4  in the last six months  Earnings estimates for the current fiscal year were revised 11 2  upward over the last 30 days  Also  the stock surpassed estimates by an average 20 5  in the trailing four quarters and has a long term EPS growth rate of 30 4

With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

145329,366844,COST,Time To Buy Costco ,opinion,"Last week  the investing world was rocked when it was announced that Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  was buying Whole Foods  NASDAQ WFM   While the market in general wasn t fazed by this news  many grocers and other retailers were  One of the companies that took a beating was Costco  NASDAQ COST  
The question is  should Costco be worried about this merger and should investors stay away from the stock  In my opinion  I think the hype is overblown 
3 Reasons Why Costco Isn t Going Away
 1  Loyalty
Costco customers are loyal  Recent reports show that 90  of members renew their annual memberships  and this is even after the warehouse giant announced it was raising membership fees 
This shows when looking at the numbers  Earnings per share recently came in at  1 40  beating estimates by  0 09  And revenues hit  28 86 billion  beating estimates by  320 million  This was an increase of close to 8  compared to the previous year 
And analysts expect the increased membership fee to add 7  to annual profits 
Finally  Costco shoppers tend to be middle and upper middle class customers  which means they are not only looking for a good price  but also a place that offers them a lot of options  The warehouse giant fits this perfectly 
 2  Groceries
While 80  of shoppers at Costco do so to buy groceries  investors need not be worried  First  even with the potential of Whole Foods lowering prices  it is going to be hard for Amazon to beat the bulk pricing that Costco offers  At best they might be able to match it  which wouldn t cause a flood of members to leave 
Also  while Amazon has a grocery delivery service it has been trying to get off the ground  Costco already has one  It is operating in 24 states already  And you can have your groceries delivered at no additional cost  It is included is your annual membership 
With Amazon  their grocery delivery service costs  15 a month  and this is on top of the annual Prime membership fee you have to pay 
 3  Add Ons
In addition to the groceries  clothing and other items you can buy at Costco  there are many other services that Costco offers that will keep its customers coming back again and again  Here are just a few of these services 

Tire installation
Vacation packages
Hearing aids
Car rental services
Prescription drugs
Car buying partnerships
Discounted gas

As customers continue to look for the best pricing in order to save money  Costco will always be an option  Simply adding a grocery store such as Whole Foods isn t going to deter most shoppers from the warehouse giant 
One Potential Issue With The Merger
Finally  I want to take a minute to put things into perspective  I feel that the selloff of Costco stock was overreaction  People heard this news  it surprised them  and they reacted emotionally  They thought that Amazon is now going to dominate the grocery industry like it does the retail industry 
But it is going to take time for Amazon to make major head way in the grocery space  For starters  Whole Foods has a lot of issues  Amazon needs to fix these issues before it can start working on a long term strategy 
Then there is synergy  The culture and mission of Amazon is very different than that of Whole Foods  Whole Foods is all about the environment and paying workers a fair wage and offering generous benefits 
Amazon on the other hand is primarily focused on driving down prices  This results in low pay for workers  the use of automation and robots to perform many tasks  and not the best company culture 
As these clash  there could be issues that many analysts have not considered 
Final Thoughts
Overall  I feel the worry over Costco and other groceries going away because Amazon is buying Whole Foods is overblown  It is more than likely that Costco and Amazon can co exist and be healthy  profitable companies for the long term 
As for the stock price for Costco  the pullback could be a nice entry point for many investors  However  some still feel the stock is overvalued  I don t see the stock dropping much further than this  so if you want to get in  now might be the best time

145330,366845,COST,Here s Why Morgan Stanley Downgraded GrubHub  GRUB  Stock ,opinion,"Shares of GrubHub   NYSE GRUB   lost 5  today in morning trading after Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  downgraded the company from Overweight to Equal Weight  lowering its price target to  43 from  47 
Morgan Stanley cited competition from Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN   as the reason for the downgrade  Analyst John Glass conducted a survey that showed 26  of Amazon Prime members tried Amazon restaurants delivery in the past 6 months  limiting the potential customers for GrubHub  Additionally  Analyst Brian Nowak noted that restaurants could subsidize one hour PrimeNow delivery 
Amazon s acquisition of Whole Foods Market   NASDAQ WFM   has also increased Amazon s potential for reaching customers  This deal has created more competition among grocery stocks as well  hurting stores like Costco   NASDAQ COST    which was  earlier this month 
Other food delivery services are gaining ground as well  such as UberEats  owned by Uber  and YelpEat24  owned by Yelp   NYSE YELP    Nowak sees competitor UberEats  gaining traction   For example  McDonald s   NYSE MCD   has been increasing the number of cities where its franchise locations offer delivery through UberEats  just adding Baltimore today 
Last week  GrubHub hit new all time highs after Wedbush Securities  analyst Aaron Turner said that GrubHub was a potential buyout target for Amazon after their Whole Foods Market acquisition  As of Friday s close  GrubHub shares are up almost 27  year to date 
GrubHub remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The company faces some heavy competition in the near future  but it still has positive year over year earnings growth for the current year and maintains some strength

145331,366846,COST,Playing The Retail Selloff,opinion,"Many traders and investors will look at a declining stock sector and become fearful  Why do they not see the opportunity in these beaten down industry groups  The reason is because they do not understand the charts  They get caught up in the emotion of hearing that the sky is falling  Hence  they all follow the crowd and run for the exit  sell  at the same time  This type of thinking has always gone on since the beginning of time 
Last week  retail stocks sold off in a very sharp manner  Popular retailers like Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  plunged lower on the charts  They sold these stocks with both hands on heavy volume  Believe it or not  but when a stock declines in this fashion  that s where the opportunity lies  On June 24  I was able to isolate major chart support for Costco just below  157  Today  COST is trading higher by  2 52 to  159 62 a share  I was able to buy call options in the stock and sell half of them today for a 28 percent gain 
Traders and investors need to learn how to read the charts in order to find these trading opportunities when they present themselves  It is important to remember that there will be bear markets in many sectors and industry groups within an overall bull market  This is the market s way of presenting us with trading opportunities if you can understand the charts ",2017-06-26,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/playing-the-retail-selloff-200197538,200197538
145332,366847,COST,American Express  AXP  Stock Up On Investor Friendly Moves,opinion,American Express Co    NYSE AXP   announced its intention to increase quarterly dividend by 9 4  to 35 cents per share  beginning with the third quarter  It also plans to repurchase up to  4 4 billion of common shares during the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  CCAR  approval period from the third quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018  The announcement came on the back of  no objection  received by the company from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to its capital plan submitted recently  The plan submission was part of the 2017 CCAR  Notably  CCAR is a regulatory framework of the Federal Reserve which assesses  regulates and supervises large banks and financial institutions   American Express is subject to this regulatory framework given its huge operations and global presence   The passage of the capital plan by American Express signifies that the company possesses adequate capital and that its capital structure is stable under various stress test scenarios  It also implies that planned capital distributions  such as dividends and share repurchases  are viable and acceptable in relation to the regulatory body s minimum capital requirements  The news helped the stock to gain 1 07  in the last trading session  American Express had been in troubled waters with the loss of one of its major client Costco Wholesale Corp    NASDAQ COST   to Visa Inc    NYSE V   last year which dented in its earnings  Also  macroeconomic woes induced pains  Currency volatility caused earnings fluctuation and a weak global economy hindered the company s growth by limiting overall spending by consumers  The price of oil and its downstream impact on airfare and gasoline prices put pressure on charge volume  which compressed the top line  Nevertheless  American Express has resorted to a number of measures to regain its profitability  These include management reshuffling  simplifying processes across businesses  a reduction in expenses  roll out of new benefits and perks on its credit cards  and increase of marketing spend to win new clients  These measures have paid off to some extent as evident by a share price increase of 38  in past one year compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 30    Another company in the same space  Capital One Financial Corporation   NYSE COF   also received no objection from the Federal Reserve Board for its 2017 capital plan pursuant to CCAR  The company will  however  have to resubmit its capital plan by Dec 28  2017 to address certain weaknesses in its capital planning process  It expects to repurchase up to  1 85 billion of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2018 and will maintain its current quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share  American Express carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see stocks here   Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-06-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-express-(axp)-stock-up-on-investor-friendly-moves-200198314,200198314
145350,366865,COST,Amazon Accelerates Grocery Push With Whole Foods Buyout,opinion,Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   on Friday announced that it has reached a deal to acquire leading natural and organic foods supermarket  Whole Foods Market  Inc    NASDAQ WFM   for  13 7 billion  The all cash transaction involves buying Whole Foods for  42 per share  at a roughly 27  premium to Whole Foods  share price on Thursday The deal is expected to conclude in the second half of this year  However  Whole Foods will continue to operate with its current brand name and John Mackey will remain the CEO of the company  The deal gives Amazon an opportunity to leverage Whole Foods  460 stores across the U S   U K  and Canada  87 000 employees and its solid reputation According to Cowen analyst John Blackledge  the acquisition will make Amazon the fifth largest U S  grocery retailer after Wal Mart   NYSE WMT    Kroger   NYSE KR    Costco  NASDAQ COST  and Albertsons Safeway Amazon com  Inc  Net Income  TTM    Amazon s Blockbuster MoveThe move is a clear indication that Amazon is thinking several years down the road Online retail sales are expected to decelerate while the overall retail market still holds a lot of potential  This might be due to the fact that a large number of customers still prefer to shop offline and will continue to do so in the future  This is particularly true when it comes to grocery  That being said  giants like Amazon have been making moves to gradually merge online and offline retail  We believe that the acquisition will open up a window of opportunities for Amazon on this front  It will not only reshape the retail landscape but also help it counter competition  if it manages to get a first mover advantage Whole Foods  Reorganization OptionsAmazon has been testing waters with innovations such as drive in grocery delivery service  AmazonFresh Pickup   order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby  and  cashier less  stores  Amazon Go   the company s first brick and mortar grocery store   It has also added online and offline features to its bookstores Amazon might add those features to Whole Foods  stores in the future  and has simply started to mindshare in the grocery space  The acquisition gives Amazon opportunities to leverage on its resources and technological prowess to enhance shopping experience by cutting time and increasing convenience  This in turn could give it an edge over competing retailers Mackey Can Take it Easy For NowMackey has been facing investors  ire because of his strategies that were thought to have resulted in Whole Foods  poor performance  Activist investor Jana Partners and money manager Neuberger Berman have been criticizing the company and pressing on a merger with another grocer  which could have forced him to step down So  the merger with Amazon has saved Mackey s face as well as position Rivals Take NoteWhole Foods has been struggling for some time mainly because of Mackey s premium pricing policy  Rivals such as Wal Mart  Costco  Kroger and Amazon have been denting Whole Foods  sales by offering lower cost options But that may not happen anymore  Though it s not yet clear whether Whole Foods will continue to operate with its current strategy but it is likely as Mackey will continue to operate as CEO  However  being under Amazon s umbrella will ensure that it doesn t lose out on sales Whole Foods could cater to the niche market that prefers to buy quality stuff at premium price  thus adding more to Amazon s sales volume Amazon s huge cash balance offers it flexibility to pursue growth in potential areas and various markets  So a few more acquisitions like this can change the retail landscape overnight and catch competitors off guard Notably  shares of dozens of supermarkets  food producers  shopping malls and payment processors collectively lost about  35 billion in the U S  market on Friday in response to the news  Acquisitions Make Sense The new move comes on the heels of Amazon acquiring Dubai based e commerce giant  Souq com  A closer look at these deals reflects that Amazon is pushing ahead with its e commerce business outside the U S  while putting more emphasis on the brick and mortar way in the U S   in the face of slow e commerce growth and mounting competition  So Amazon s increasing transition from build to buy option is a clear indication that it wants to speed up its market penetration  expansion and competitive strategies Investors Likely to Reap BenefitsOver the last one year  Amazon s share price has grown roughly 38   thanks to its solid loyalty program in Prime  Fulfillment By Amazon  Amazon Web Services  AWS  and initiatives around Internet of Things  IoT  Though brick and mortar initiatives are relatively new  investors will see far more growth if Amazon could repeat its past success in this space  Everything that Amazon touches has been transformed to gold and its brick and mortar venture could well add another feather in its cap Currently  Amazon has a Zacks Rank 3  Hold   You can see Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana   Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021

145356,366871,COST,Is Costco Wholesale A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Costco Wholesale Corporation   NASDAQ COST   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Costco has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 29 56  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares unfavorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 48  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Costco s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Retail Discount   Variety industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 04  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Costco has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 28 73  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Costco has a P S ratio of 0 58  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Costco currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes COST a good choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Costco might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives COST a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five upward estimate revision in the past thirty days compared to two downward  while the current year estimate has seen nine upward and no downward revisions in the same time frame As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has moved up by 0 5  in the past one month  while the current year estimate has inched higher by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Costco Wholesale Corporation Price and Consensus   Even though Costco has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCostco is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a good industry rank  among the Top 41   instills investor confidence  However  it is hard to get too excited about this company as over the past one year  the Zacks Retail Discount   Variety industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Again the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special

145372,366887,COST,Costco Downgraded After Amazon Whole Foods Deal,opinion,"On Friday afternoon  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Analyst Matthew Fassler downgraded Costco Wholesale Corp    NASDAQ COST   from  buy  to  neutral   Fassler also reduced the price target from  197 to  176 as  7 2  at Friday s trading close 
This downgrade comes as a direct result from Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN   will buy Whole Foods Market   NASDAQ WFM   for  13 7 billion  Fassler states that Amazon s purchase makes Whole Foods a tougher competitor for Costco  As a result  the company has been removed from Goldman Sachs  conviction buy list 
 We see potential cap on valuation associated with Amazon s ongoing expression of interest in consumables  combined with fading fundamental catalysts   Fassler said 
Amazon s buyout of Whole Foods will force Costco to invest in ecommerce in order to stay competitive 
 COST s competitive edges have related to natural and organic and its membership model  which despite significant overlap with AMZN Prime offered an option focused on consumables not easily available via AMZN   Fassler wrote in a research report  Now that Amazon owns Whole Foods   AMZN is likely capable of offering superior pricing and delivery competency vs  incumbents  
COST remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   While the company may need to rethink what services it offers to keep up with Amazon  our current year consensus estimate shows positive year over year earnings growth for the company

  We all know that if you swing for the fences  you re going to strike out a lot  but you re also going to hit some home runs  The difference between baseball and business  however  is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution  When you swing  no matter how well you connect with the ball  the most runs you can get is four  In business  every once in a while  when you step up to the plate  you can score 1 000 runs  This long tailed distribution of returns is why it s important to be bold  Big winners pay for so many experiments

145396,366911,COST,Here s Why Wal Mart s Stock Will Break  90,opinion,"Wal Mart s History  Then and Now
In 1970  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  offered 300 000 shares to the public at the price of  16 50 per shares  it started trading on NYSE in 1972  At the time  the  always low price  retailer earned a modest  78 million of revenue from its 51 stores  Today it boasts over 11 500 locations and does almost  500 billion in sales annually with a customer base of over 260 million people 
Now the company s market capitalization is well over  200 billion and it is fair to say that an investment in the company s share has not only outstripped both inflation and the stock market but has been a mega multi bagger 
The company has been a darling for investors as it has paid and increased its dividend every year since 1974  However  the company is facing new challenges brought on by e commerce in general and  NASDAQ AMZN  in particular  It recently bought Jet com for  3 3 billion to augment its online strategy and it is important to assess the company under a new light to understand its prospects 
Wal Mart s Recent Headwinds
Wal Mart s diluted EPS for the year 2016 was  4 57 and for 2017 was  4 38  Looking forward  the company is not expected to reach its 2016 level until fiscal year 2020 
The Company s EPS has taken a beating in the last few years due to stiff competition in the retailing market  As more and more consumers move to the comfort of online shopping  Wal Mart has been forced to spend heavily on technology and online development to compete with other major market retailers like Amazon  The purchase of Jet com  a startup with little revenue for nearly  3 3 billion is a sign of the quandary the company has found itself in  The discount retailer has also invested  2 7 billion in higher wages and training for workers in hoping to bring down its turnover rate 
However  this helps explain why Wal Mart s valuation multiples are generally trading at a discount to   NASDAQ DLTR    NASDAQ COST  and the average of the consumer staples sector 
Wal Mart s low price to earnings  17 8x  and Enterprise Value to EBITDA  8 6x  multiples can be attributed to the stiff competition it is facing from online retailers and dipping profit margins  However  investments made to stimulate its online sales are just beginning to show positive results  online sales grew by 63  in the first fiscal quarter of 2017   Investors should expect these multiples to expand as this new growth engine starts to take up a larger slice of the pie and becomes priced into the market 
It is important to note that Wal Mart s margins and returns are still very impressive when compared to its peers and the sector average as illustrated below These numbers are even more noteworthy and commendable as the retail sector  in general  is going through a transition phase  Management has proven it can deliver positive returns while the discount retailer transforms itself  This is a positive sign in a sector where many investors are playing the wait and watch game 
With strong fundamentals in place and consistent margins  investors can hold their position in the company and expect consistent returns 
New Highs Within Reach
In January 2015  Wal Mart s share price soared to a high of around  90 but has never been able to cross the  80 mark ever since  However  over the last year shareholders have seen the stock price jump from a low of  65 in December to trade in the  75 79 range  This impressive run has been on the back of being able to grow traffic in US stores in addition to strong growth in online sales as recently posted by the company 
If these strong growth numbers can continue  Wal Mart s stock looks highly attractive on a future cash flow basis as illustrated below  Applying Wall Street projections to the four separate discounted cash flow  DCF  analyses included in finbox io s intrinsic value estimate provides a fair value range of approximately  93 to  100 per share 
The stock s previous  90 high witnessed in January 2015 appears to be well within reach 
Earn Dividends While Waiting
In addition to the Wal Mart s stock price appreciation potential  the company s dividends offer further upside and currently yields 2 6  
In 2017  Wal Mart declared a dividend of  2 00  which was an increase of 2 0  from last year  Wall Street expects a dividend of  2 07 in fiscal year 2018 which would represent an increase of 3 5  
Wal Mart s dividend policy provides a major downside anchor to its share price and is another reason for why it s an attractive long term stock 
Wal Mart Is Well Suited To Outperform
Wal Mart is a proven stock with a consistent track record and is currently trading at a discount  With strong fundamentals  a growing dividend and a fairly clear growth and diversification road map in place  now is the right time either to buy the stock or to hold your position for the next few quarters years  Expect shares to outperform the market in the long term ",2017-06-07,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here’s-why-wal-mart’s-stock-will-break-$90-200193825,200193825

145470,366985,COST,AXP Vs  Visa  Which Is The Better Card Processor Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"A clash of the credit card titans is developing this week with American Express Company   NYSE AXP   and Visa Inc    NYSE V   scheduled to report their earnings within a day of each other  These results will be released even as American Express struggles to get affluent customers to spend more using its cards  Meanwhile  a younger generation of consumers has begun to prefer experiential rewards compared to the older stands of good living which American Express represents 
Meanwhile  some of American Express  defeats have been profitable for Visa  For instance  following the end of its association with American Express  Costco Wholesale Corp    NASDAQ COST   has now tied up with Visa  It is experiencing growth from the acquisition of Visa Europe and solid growth in payments volume as well as processed transactions 
With Visa and American Express scheduled to report on Apr 19 and Apr 20  respectively  this may be a good time to consider which of these a better stock is  While American Express has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Visa carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rating  You can see  Other major earnings scheduled at this time include Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    
Amex Poised for Growth  Visa Strong on Digital Footsteps
American Express remains well poised for growth on the back of its solid market position  strength in card business and significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments  Estimates for 2017 and 2018 have witnessed upward revisions over the last 60 days  However  an increase in provision for losses might be a headwind for the stock 
Meanwhile  Visa recently announced that it has reached a milestone by expanding Visa Checkout to more than 20 million enrolled accounts Visa Checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online transactions wherever this service is enabled   Read   
Price Performance
Shares of both American Express and Visa have notched up gains in the year to date period  But Visa is the clear winner on this count with a gain of more than 15  year to date  In contrast  American Express has only increased by 3 5   falling behind both the Dow and the S P 500 which have gained around 5  and 4   respectively during this period 

Valuation
Though American Express and Visa are classified into different Zacks categorized industries  the average one year trailing 12 month P B ratio is the best multiple for valuing the card processing business because of large variations in earnings results from one quarter to the next 

Coming to the two stocks under consideration  with a P B ratio of 3 33  American Express is overvalued compared to the Zacks  industry  On the other hand  Visa has a P B ratio of 7 24  which is why it is undervalued compared to the Zacks  industry  

Dividend Yield

In the last one year period  the dividend yield for American Express was higher than the broader industry  While the Financial Miscellaneous Services industry offers a yield of 1 53   American Express returns 1 69    Visa falls marginally short on this count  providing a dividend yield of 0 74  compared to the industry average of 0 77   But even on absolute terms  American Express is better off on this front compared to Visa 

Earnings History and ESP
Riding on higher revenues  Visa posted   ended Dec 31  2016  earnings per share of 86 cents per share  handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents  Also  the bottom line improved 7  year over year  Net operating revenue of  4 5 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 3 billion  Also  revenues climbed 25  year over year 
In contrast  American Express s  adjusted earnings per share of 91 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents per share  American Express reported revenues of  32 12 billion for full year 2016  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  32 04 billion  However  revenues declined 2  year over year 
Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  Visa has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 5 8   In comparison  American Express delivered an earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 9 5   When considering   there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks with both having readings of 0 
Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that American Express holds an edge over Visa only when considering dividend yield  However  on all other counts  Visa is clearly a better stock  Despite the fact that earnings ESP is 0 in both case  Visa carries a Zacks Rank  2  This is why it may be better to bet on Visa over American Express

Costco  NASDAQ COST   started pulling back in December 2015 and found support in February 2016  That move and the following bounce led to a bearish Bat harmonic  It completed in August 2016 and then retraced 88 6  of the pattern before finding support  Since that bottom in November though it has done nothing but move higher  It broke above resistance at 153 50 in December and gapped higher eventually finding resistance under 165  The stock pulled back to its 20 day SMA before reversing higher again  Last week it ended at resistance again  with a RSI rising in the bullish zone and a MACD about to cross up 
There is resistance at 164 50 and the 169 67 followed by a Measured Move to 173  That would be a new all time high  There is support lower at 160 50 and 159 50 followed by 156 50  Longer term there is a Positive RSI Reversal that gives a target to 173 as well  Short interest is low at 1 7   The company is expected to report next on March 2nd 
The options chains show February options with biggest open interest to the up side  at 165 and 170 on the call side  There is also open interest at 160 on the put side  Moving to the March 3 expiry  the first beyond the reporting date  shows building open interest above the current price at 170 and 172 50  April options which have had a longer life show the 160 call strike as the biggest open interest

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with the Inauguration and January Options Expiration in the rearview mirror  sees the equity markets holding up very well and remaining strong on the longer timeframe 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate its uptrend or pullback while Crude Oil moves sideways in a range  The US Dollar Index looks better to the downside in the short run while US Treasuries are resuming their move lower  The Shanghai Composite is stuck at 3100 and does not look to change that soon while Emerging Markets look tied in their move higher and ready for a pullback 
Volatility should remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show the QQQ remaining the short term leader as it creeps to new all time highs  while the SPY and IWM consolidate moving sideways in the short run  In the longer timeframe all 3 look strong  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

145536,367051,COST,Costco Wholesale Corporation Stock  How Will Year End Earnings Come In ,opinion,"Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST 
Costco Corporation  the largest membership only warehouse club in the United States and the second largest retailer in the world after Walmart  NYSE WMT   will report their quarterly earnings on December 7th  after the market closes  The company has 705 warehouses spread throughout the United States  Canada Mexico  United Kingdom  Japan  South Korea  Taiwan  Australia  Spain and Lebanon 
Costco didn t originally start out as Costco  In fact  it came from what s called  Price Club   started by a gentleman named Sol Price and his son Robert  They opened their first warehouse in 1976 in San Diego  California  The two companies merged and became Costco in 1993 
The current environment for retail has been difficult  with some retailers experiencing heavier foot traffic than normal and other retailers reporting less  The last time Costco reported  they were showing signs of improvement  especially on their bottom line profits  Costco gets most of their profits from membership fees  rather than sales of their products  Therefore  subscriber additions and subtractions are critical for their business model  Recently  Costco changed their credit card of choice from American Express to Discover Card  This quarterly earnings results will likely shed light on how that is working out for the company

Some Industry Secrets Revealed By Sector Industry Insiders
In a broad sense  warehouse clubs mark up their items less than traditional grocery stores or retailers  Michael Clayman  editor writer at Warehouse Club Focus and   account required  told The Motley Fool in an email interview 

Generally  club merchandise gross margins will range from an average of 12  to 14  with Costco and Sam s Club at the low end of the range and BJ s at the higher end of the range 

That compares to 25  50  margins for traditional stores 

Every year  we publish an item basket comparison between the three clubs  a Wal Mart Supercenter  and a grocery store in the same market   The results have been consistent and show the dramatic savings a consumer receives by shopping at a club compared to the other two 
Taken as a whole and over a span of years  the answer is that warehouse clubs almost never save money for the individual shopper     due to  membership fees  wastage from overbuying  produce and such   the necessity to buy in quantity  canned goods that sit on shelves and have to be discarded  etc 

Benjamin Glaser  an editor for DealNews  a shopping comparison website  agrees with the idea that warehouse clubs can be a trap  He told The Motley Fool in an email that chains like Costco  Sam s Club  and BJ s 

can save you money  but they can also trick you into spending more 

He noted that low priced items are actually one of the bigger reasons members end up spending more than they would have had they not joined 

Great prices are why you walk in to buy milk  and walk out with a big screen TV

145574,367089,COST,PriceSmart  The Costco Of Central America,opinion,"Looks just like Costco  NASDAQ COST  or BJ s right  It is almost the same  PriceSmart  NASDAQ PSMT  is known as the Costco of Central America and the Caribbean  So when you are vacationing at a beach house in Costa Rica that you found on Air BnB this is where you go for your 24 rolls of toilet paper and 10 lb beef tenderloin  The same drab warehouse feel inside and lots of everything 
Aside from being located in everyplace you want to go on vacation instead of in your back yard  there is one more big difference right now  PriceSmart stock looks ready to move to the upside  where Costco stock is still drifting lower  The chart below tells the story 

The stock started higher at the beginning of the year and continued until the 4th of July  But then the stock gapped down and continued until it found a low in August  That low was a higher low than the January low  And from that point the stock has made a series of higher highs and higher lows  an uptrend  The latest higher high has resulted in a consolidation under  87 
Momentum suggests it cold break to the upside  The RSI is rising and in the bullish zone while the MACD is looking to avoid a cross and is positive  The Bollinger Bands  are opening to the upside as well  A move higher sees a gap to fill to 89 30 and then the 94 50 area as the next resistance area  Should t fall under 85 though  look for possible support near 82 50

145575,367090,COST,Costco  COST  Stock  Stable Growth In A Slow Economy,opinion,"U S  warehouse giant  Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  has been earning steady profits for the last few years  It s annual stock performance has been relatively flat  as investors were nervous about the company s decision to switch the type of credit card it will accept from consumers from American Express to Visa  However  the transition seems to me smoother than most people expected  Over the next 12 to 24 months  Costco earnings and sales are expected to improve and the stock price of COST should increase as well 
Out of 29 analysts currently covering Costco stock  8 have given it a buy recommendation  12 say outperform  and the remaining 9 say it s a solid hold  Costco currently trades at  150 per share  When it comes to the price target of  over the next 12 months  analysts have reported that the stock could reach as high as  195 per share on the optimistic side while the average price target and low price target are  169 38 and  135 respectively 
Costco is engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States  U S   and Puerto Rico  Canada  United Kingdom  U K    Mexico  Japan  Australia  Spain  and through majority owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea  The Company operated 663 membership warehouses and an average warehouse is approximately 144 000 square feet  The Company s warehouses generally operate on a 7 day  69 hour week  The Company s product categories include Food  Sundries  Hardlines  Fresh Food  Softlines  Ancillary and Other 
Compared to other brick and mortar players in the same space  Costco is doing relatively well  One reason why Costco is outperforming other stores is because it s not as susceptible to the Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  factor as  say  Wal Mart is  The other reason is that at the heart of it  Costco is a membership business  It has very high margin membership fees and it tries to attract new customers all the time 
Costco plans to open up another 9 warehouse stores by the end of the year  That means they will exit 2016 with about 4  more locations than the start of the year  More locations and more members means more membership fees and customers  Sales are important as well  but membership fees for Costco account for about 75  of the chain s operating profits  That makes new memberships and member churn the most important metrics for a company built around signing people up and retaining them year after year 
Costco and Amazon are essentially for different segments of consumers  For Amazon customers  it s about convenience  It s about getting things shipped to their homes instead of going to the store  Many people don t have cars  so making a trip to a brick and mortar store isn t very practical  Meanwhile  Costco customers are looking to buy things in bulk and stretch their dollar  Costco is drawing customers with fresh and organic foods instead of the packaged foods that Amazon is offering  Many people shop at both Costco and Amazon  but they look for different products relative to where they re shopping 
Many retailers that have physical locations had negative comparisons to same store sales in the past  Overall holiday sales expectation for this year is expected to be 3  lower for traditional retail stores  But online shopping is expected to increase by 17  year over year  The economy overall has also been slowing down so investors have to be more selective about where to put money  The IMF recently lowered growth expectation for the U S 
Furthermore  the Federal Reserve has taken its outlook for GDP from 2 2  back in March  to 2  in July  to the most recent number which is 1 8  coming out of its September meeting  So it s looking like a sub 2  year for the United States  The consensus is that in 2017  the economy will grow faster because a new president will be in place  removing a lot of political uncertainty and allowing companies to make more plans to expand  Costco seems to be a safe place to park some long term money  regardless of which political party gets the White House ",2016-10-21,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/costco-(cost)-stock:-stable-growth-in-a-slow-economy-200159936,200159936

145580,367095,COST,Retail Industry Stock Outlook   Holiday Season 2016,opinion,"Economic Rebound Helping Retailers 
Retailing involves buying large quantities of goods and selling them in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit  The health of the retail industry is an important economic indicator as it is linked directly to consumers and their propensity to spend  Consumer spending is the key to the well being of the U S  economy as it accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity 
The link between consumer spending and the retail industry becomes more relevant as retail sales attract approximately 30  of total consumer spending in the U S  Also  the retail industry ranks among the top U S  industries and employs an enormous workforce  contributing to the health of the job market 
Before jumping on to the trends in retail  here s a peek into the key economic indicators  which suggest where the market is heading 
On the whole  the U S  economy looks in good shape  with many hoping that the incoming administration of Mr  Trump will help improve the economy s growth trajectory even further  Growth had improved ahead of the election already  the Q3 GDP report confirmed  The U S  economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 9  in the third quarter of 2016  much better than the 1 4  and 0 8  increase recorded in the second and first quarters  respectively  The rebound in inventory and strong gains in exports provided the much needed boost to the economy 
While GDP growth in the first half of the year was on the low side  many key parts of the economy have consistently been on a growth trajectory  The improving labor and housing markets are notable examples in this regard  Wages have started growing lately as well after remaining underwhelming in the earlier part of the recovery  This is helping prop up the household sector s buying power  which is showing up in the GDP report s consumer spending numbers and the monthly retail sales data  All of this is raising hopes about spending trends this coming holiday season 
Key Retail Metrics
The key data in the retail industry analysis is comparable store sales  comps  as it excludes sales at newly opened and closed stores  We observe that sales data for the month of October had a positive tone as most retailers posted better than expected comps  Further  most retailers either raised or reiterated their earnings per share guidance for the third quarter following the October sales performance 
The list of gainers in October was led by Washington based retailer of sports related teen apparel Zumiez Inc   ZUMZ  that reported a 10 2  increase in comps  with sales climbing 14 4  to  55 9 million from the year ago period  This marked the company s second consecutive month of comps growth after negative comps and dismal sales results for 17 straight quarters  Further  the company raised its third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings outlook backed by greater than expected sales in the quarter to date period 
This was followed by warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST    COST  that posted a 2  rise in comps  while total sales rose 3  to  20 17 billion  Going down the line  the clothing retail chain L Brands Inc  NYSE LB    LB  posted a comps gain of 1  and sales improvement of 3  to  756 7 million  However  comps results for the month were lower than expected  The company reiterated its third quarter earnings guidance 
On the other hand  The Buckle Inc   BKE  disappointed the most with a 15 5  decline in comps and a 15 1  fall in net sales to  69 1 million for October  It was followed by apparel and accessories retailer Cato Corporation  CATO  that reported a 6  decline in both comps and sales  Net sales were down to  68 9 million  Nonetheless  the company raised its earnings forecast for the third quarter due to lower markdown sales 
This was followed by discount store operator Fred s Inc   FRED  which saw a 3 4  fall in comps for October Fred s net sales slipped 4 2  to  157 3 million 
At the bottom of the list was the long distressed teen retailer The Gap Inc  NYSE GPS    GPS  that reported a 1  decline in comps along with flat sales of  1 20 billion  Though the company s comps gained from the positive customer response for its Old Navy product assortments and strong merchandise margins  results were impacted by the campus fire that hit its distribution center in Fishkill  NY in August

Sector Level Earnings Trends
The Q3 earnings season has almost reached its end  with only a considerable number of retailers left to come up with their results  With the focus now shifted to the retail sector  investors remain pleased with the results of department stores that are gaining from tight expense controls and leaner inventories  The low inventory levels also make investors optimistic about the fourth quarter  which mainly encompasses the holiday selling period  However  problems like shift of focus from store sales traffic to online sales pose a concern 
As of Nov 11  we have seen results from 455 S P 500 members  accounting for 91  of the index s total membership  Of these  approximately 72 7  posted positive earnings surprises  while 55 4  beat top line expectations  Total earnings for these index members were up 3 9  from the year ago quarter  while revenues increased 2 7  
For  Q3  as  a  whole   combining  the  actual  results  from  the 455 S P 500 members with estimates from the yet to report 45 companies  total earnings are expected to be up 3 4  on 1 5  increase in revenues  That said  the third quarter is on track to be the first quarter of earnings growth for the index after five quarters of back to back declines 
Coming to the retail sector  24 retailers in the S P 500 index  out of the 43 total  that combined account for 59 3  of the sector s total market cap in the index have reported earnings so far  Total Q3 earnings for these 24 members are up 12 7  from the same period last year  on an 8 6  rise in revenues  However  only 54 2  of the members posted earnings beat and about 37 5  surpassed revenue estimates  The proportion of retailers that have beaten Q3 EPS and revenue estimates is the second lowest of all 16 Zacks sectors  behind only Construction 
Combing results on board and upcoming  earnings for the Retail sector are expected to rise 5 9  in Q3  with revenues anticipated to grow nearly 5 2

145603,367118,COST,Visa  V  Well Poised To Beat On Q4 Earnings  Here s Why ,opinion,"Visa Inc    NYSE V   is set to report fiscal fourth quarter 2016 results on Oct 24  2016 after market close  Last quarter  the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 99   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement
Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Visa is likely to beat on earnings as it has the right combination of the two key components  Note that a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  or at least  3  Hold  to have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Visa is  1 37   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 74 cents per share is a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate Zacks Rank  Visa s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  The combination of Visa s positive ESP and favorable Zacks Rank makes us fairly confident of an earnings beat this quarter 
Stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors Driving a Likely Earnings BeatU  S  credit card volume during the fiscal fourth quarter was likely driven by the positive impact of Costco  NASDAQ COST  where Visa credit cards are being accepted since June 
Also deals renewed with TD in the United States and Canada  Regions Bank  Chevron  NYSE CVX   Homeplus in South Korea  Taichung Bank in Taiwan  and Mandiri Bank in Indonesia will also lead to an increase in the volume of card usage Neverthless  a higher tax rate of approximately 30  compared with 29 3  in fiscal 2015 will be a headwind to earnings  Foreign exchange is also expected to present a 4  headwind to adjusted earnings per share Moreover  the bottom line will likely suffer from expenses related to the Visa Europe integration  Management earlier indicated that the company will likely take a restructuring charge to align its cost structure following the Visa Europe acquisition which was completed in June Higher incentives will also drain earnings to some extent  Incentives as a percentage of gross revenues was 19  in fiscal third quarter and the company guided that it will increase further in fiscal fourth quarter as Costco incentives kick in  This will bring full year client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to around 18 5   which is at the high end of the 17 5  to 18 5  previously guided Nevertheless  the company s continued commitment to return excess capital to shareholders by way of share buyback will also add to its bottom line VISA INC A Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

145641,367156,COST,American Express Stock Continues To Decline  Here s Why,opinion,"The stock of American Express Co    NYSE AXP   has declined by nearly 5  year to date  This credit payment card products provider also slogged in 2015 and lost 25  of its stock value in that year  Though the decline in share price is lesser this year than the last one  the stock could not gain sufficiently from the growth initiatives taken to improve profitability 
Fundamental Problems at American Express
The company s earnings and consequently its share price have been dragged down by bearish sentiments owing to the loss of its contract with retail prime  Costco Wholesale Corp  NASDAQ COST   The contract termination  which was disclosed last year  prompted the company to spend heavily on growth initiatives to counter the loss  Increased expenditure on growth initiatives hurt the company s bottom line  The company expects marketing and promotion expenses during 2016 will be at least  200 million above the 2015 level of  3 1 billion 
Restructuring charges related to the company s ongoing cost reduction efforts have also dented its earnings  The insurer is aggressively moving ahead with plans to take  1 billion out of its cost base by the end of 2017 
Also  the company remains exposed to challenges associated with continued modifications in the payments  industry  Alternative payment methods like mobile technologies also threaten growth  Moreover  players like MasterCard Inc    NYSE MA   and Visa Inc    NYSE V   pose stiff competition  AMER EXPRESS CO Price   Regulatory Issues
American Express faces stringent regulatory control due to its status as a bank holding company  The Department of Justice ruled against American Express in a suit that challenged the company s rules that allow merchants to promote other cards as anticompetitive  Although American Express has appealed against the decision  the process could take considerable time  If the company loses the appeal  its payment market share and transaction fees might be severely affected 
Macroeconomic Headwinds
American Express has been bearing the burnt of an appreciating dollar since 2015  The stronger dollar had an adverse impact on the company s cross border revenues and reduced earnings per share by about 3 4  in 2015  This year too  the insurer continued to see the impact of a lower merchant discount rate and a strong U S  dollar on its international operations  Apart from currency woes  the price of oil and its impact on airfare and gasoline prices created a drag oncharge volume  which compressed the top line 
Its U K  business  which constitutes 3 4  of global billings and has been growing in excess of 10  in recent quarters  saw noticeable slowdown in growth for several days immediately after Brexit 
Growth Initiatives
At the start of the year  the company announced certain steps to boost profitability  These included management reshuffling  simplifying processes across businesses and reduction in expenses  The company also passed the Federal Reserve s annual stress test in June  which indicates that it possesses adequate capital and that its capital structure is stable under various stress test scenarios 
Though the company has making efforts to bounce back  we believe the prevailing headwinds will the stock under pressure

145660,367175,COST,A Short Term Buying Opportunity In A Long Term Trend,opinion,"America s growing obsession with organic foods is one of the richest trends in the country  There s immense investment opportunity   much of it in places most folks would never look 
Organics have grown from a mom and pop niche at the local farm market to a billion dollar cash grab for the  big food  industry 
Most folks don t know it   because the industrial food giants don t want you to   but many of the most popular organic brands are now owned by large  multinational conglomerates 
Contrary to the idealistic image in the heads of many shoppers  these homegrown brands are no longer owned by the independent mom working out of her garage  Far from it 
Organics are big business 
As the trend has grown  the big food companies have opened their checkbooks  Nearly every popular organics brand is owned by  dare I say it  an unpopular food giant 
Take a brand as innocent sounding as The Organic Cow of Vermont 
It started small  but eventually was bought by Horizon Organic    which was bought by White Wave  which spun off of Dean Foods     which was recently bought by the Swiss dairy giant Danone 

And when I told a colleague this week that his wife s favorite organic snack food brand was actually owned by Pepsi  he was stunned 
So much for that warm and fuzzy feeling we get when we pay more for an organic brand 
Again  this is big business 
The organics industry is quickly turning into the industrial machine so many consumers are looking to avoid  But it has to  The industry is flat out exploding 
Last year  for example  the traditional food industry grew by a mere 3  
its pockets 
That s the chief reason General Mills  NYSE  NYSE GIS    which is  against most conceptions  the third largest organics company in the world   recently announced it will double the amount of organic acreage it works with by 2019 
That s where the money is at  Land 
Investors who want to get rich from this organics trend will skip the big name firms and their diversified lineups and go straight to the source    the farmland 
The truth is  we ve recently entered a serious farmland crisis when it comes to organics 
After years of surging growth  organics comprise 5  of the food sector s total sales  And yet  just 1  of American farmland is devoted to certifiable farming practices 
It s great news for landowners 
For instance  my family owns roughly 400 acres of crop and grazing land  It hasn t seen a chemical in nearly a generation  It s now worth a premium to organic farmers because chemical free land is increasingly hard to find 
It s a similar situation all across the country 
You see  farmers can t grow organic crops on just any land  No  the ground must meet strict organic standards for three years before it can be certified to grow organic crops  That s how long the USDA says it takes for non organic herbicides  pesticides and fertilizers to be cleansed from the fields 
It means there s a three year window in which farmers who want to get in the organics game are seeing the smaller yields and higher costs associated with organic farming    and can t slap that critical margin boosting label on their product 
It s a massive three year hardship  Again  it s why organic land is selling for a premium 
And it s why food giants are opening their wallets and giving money to organic farmers 
It s about to spark the next land boom 
For example  Costco  NASDAQ COST   which many say is now the leading retailer of organic foods   ousting Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM  from the position   recently got into the lending business  It lent an undisclosed amount of money to a mid sized supplier looking to buy organic land in California 
Costco made the loan and now has the first right to the strawberries grown on it 
As more farmers look to turn traditional farmland into organic land  the huge food retailer is ready for more loans  It believes it s a critical move as farmers deal with that expensive three year window 
Of course  the competition is getting into the game as well  Whole Foods has lent at least  18 million  And  while I don t have confirmation of this  it s safe to say Wal Mart  NYSE  NYSE WMT  has cut some checks as well 
These companies have to do it  There simply isn t enough organic farmland to meet the raging demand from customers 
For investors  the most direct way to profit is to buy some farmland  But the more realistic way to invest is through a farmland REIT like Farmland Partners Inc  NYSE FPI  or Gladstone Land Corporation  NASDAQ LAND  
Your timing is good  After rising steadily for the first six months of the year  farm prices have leveled off as crop prices have fallen  This is thanks to rumors of an upcoming record shattering corn and soybean harvest 
It s a short term buying opportunity in a tremendous long term trend 
As the organic market goes from a nascent subsector to a booming  dominant industry  the folks who own farmland will reap the biggest rewards 
That three year window acts as a stiff barrier to entry  It ensures money will be flowing for many more years 
Take advantage of it ",2016-08-29,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-short-term-buying-opportunity-in-a-long-term-trend-200150511,200150511

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 92 on  8 23 billion in revenue   25 million higher than Wall Street on the top line
The recent breakup with Costco is estimated to cost Amex  80 billion in billed business and 20  of its interest bearing credit portfolio
American Express is the worst performing credit card company this year with shares down nearly 8  
American Express  or Amex for short  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings Wednesday after the market closes  Amex is coming off a fourth quarter in which it beat on the bottom line but missed its sales target  Revenue has been a recurrent problem and has fallen short in the last 8 consecutive quarters  or 2 fiscal years  Unfortunately  early indications look bleak heading into its first quarter earnings 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 92 on  8 23 billion in revenue   25 million higher than Wall Street on the top line  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 28  increase in earnings while sales are expected in relatively flat  Investor s looking for a quick pop will be disheartened to learn that the stock typically trends sideways during earnings season  
American Express has prone to many swings in the financial services sector  most notably higher global macroeconomic risks  The fallout from Brexit has many experts believing worldwide consumer spending is in for a rude awakening  Consumer confidence has already taken a hit immediately following the vote  which poses a problem for the entire payments industry 
Meanwhile  Amex is still coping with the loss of the Costco  NASDAQ COST  account to Visa  NYSE V   The third quarter will provide the first meaningful signs on how earnings will be impacted after the divorce  It hasn t helped that the payments industry is very competitive and rapidly evolving  Within the space  Visa  Mastercard  NYSE MA   American Express and Discover  NYSE DFS  all compete for new partnerships  Shares of American express are down 8  since the start of the year  the most among its peers

145680,367195,COST,Retail Stock Outlook  Is The Sector Reflecting Growth ,opinion,"Retailing involves buying large quantities of goods and selling them in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit  The health of the retail industry is an important economic indicator as it is linked directly to consumers and their propensity to spend  Consumer spending is the key to the well being of any economy as it accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity 
The link between consumer spending and the retail industry becomes more relevant as retail sales attract approximately 30  of total consumer spending in the U S  Also  the retail industry ranks among the top U S  industries and employs an enormous workforce  contributing to the health of the job market 
Before jumping onto trends in retail  here s a peek into key economic indicators  which suggest where the market is heading 
Recent data revealed that U S  consumer spending rose for the second straight month in May  climbing 0 4  after a 1 1  gain in Apr 2016 that marked the strongest rise in seven years  This indicates that the U S  economy picked up in these two months after a slow start in the first quarter of 2016  The report further suggested that income rose 0 2  in May  following a 0 5  increase in April 
However  there is a wave of fear pertaining to how American shoppers will react to Britain s decision to leave the European Union  the  Brexit  vote   Analysts believe that there is a likeliness of consumer spending dropping further ahead as the outcome of Brexit becomes clear  Brexit has not only made global financial markets volatile  it has also created uncertainty over the prospects of the world economy 
Concurrently  a report by the Commerce Department suggests that the third estimate of real gross domestic product  GDP  expanded at an annual rate of 1 1  in the first quarter of 2016  above the second estimate of 0 8   These reports collectively advocate that the U S  economy is definitely showing resilience 
We note that the U S  labor market looks quite stable  with unemployment rate for June making a comeback at 4 9  after falling to 4 7  in May  The report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that a total of 287 000 nonfarm payroll was added in June  of which retail employment increased 30 000 
Given a rebounding U S  economy  the retail space is bubbling with optimism  This is evident from June s 0 8  rise in retail sales  excluding automobiles  gasoline stations and restaurants  from May 2016 and a solid 5 1  increase over Jun 2015  as reported by the nation s largest retail trade group   National Retail Federation  NRF   The federation pointed out that solid growth in June was a follow up of the sales momentum in April and May 
Overall  retail sales is benefitting from a solid rebound in consumer spending as well as job gains and rising income levels  Further  the federation is of the view that this strength provides visibility into the future and expects this momentum to last in the second half of 2016

145720,367235,COST,Can Wal Mart s Online Business Provide A Boost ,opinion,"Wal Mart Stores Inc   NYSE WMT     is eyeing further stock growth in 2017 with its recent investments in the innovation of its digital services   
Wal Mart is in the midst of investing  2 billion over a two year period into its digital operations allowing for a foundation of future growth  Money is also being poured into better employee wages  improved stock  and the creation of a cleaner and better experience in Wal Mart stores  The grocery section has especially improved in Wal Mart stores with higher quality goods and fully stocked shelves  Wal Mart is mainly doing a better job in digital grocery shopping with pickup online orders soaring 
Wal Mart is aggressively infiltrating the online market  as they recently announced its e commerce shipping subscription will offer instant two day delivery and cut the price down to  49 per year  half the price of Amazon s    similar service  This subscription service provides free delivery for millions of Wal Mart products which it hopes will lock in its customers into using its platform and driving sales growth  Wal Mart is investing in 5 new e commerce distribution centers expected to be opened within the year to handle increasing online orders  This  coupled with the retailer s existing network of locations  is expected to give the retailer a credible shot at better competing with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   
Retail consumers are no longer attracted to simple discounts  Amazon and other e commerce businesses have made cheap and fast shipping an expected standard to be demanded in the modern market  Wal Mart is investing an additional  2 billion specifically into increasing its logistical and technological capabilities to fit consumers  demands  The retailer is constructing its own transportation fleet and partnering with regional delivery carriers to execute faster shipments  Wal Mart will benefit from building and owning its own logistical system as it entails lower delivery expenses 
Wal Mart is also tapping into the Chinese e commerce space  in which Amazon has not bombarded  The company is vastly increasing its product offerings into China through the use of Global E Buy  the international buying service which allows Chinese consumers to purchase American goods  Wal Mart recently purchased full interest in its Chinese e commerce retailer  Yihaodian  This online business is being utilized to directly compete with Chinese e commerce giant  Alibaba  NYSE BABA     in the rapidly growing  672 billion dollar Chinese e commerce market  Wal Mart does not stop there  they plan to open 30 new stores and greatly expand distribution centers and logistical operations in the country 
Although expenses and spending are high at the moment  2016 will be the peak year of company expenditures  Wal Mart is spending  1 5 billion on wages this year  up  300 million from 2015  The rising wage expense mainly derives from investment in improving their e commerce business  Wal Mart is hiring the world s top technological and logistical experts to revamp operations following slow online growth  Management is confident in its current state of capital expenditure   We understand that dip in profits require patience from our investors  but we want to be very clear  these are the right investments for our future  said Wal Mart CEO  Doug McMillon 
In recent customer surveys  responses have been very positive to the changes Wal Mart is making to improve the customer experience  Online sales have allowed Wal Mart to track regional trends and offer the most fitting inventory in its stores to cater to customers  needs  The online pick up order initiative has made shopping a quicker and hassle free experience  Wal Mart has also began to establish its Walmart Pay service in stores  which speeds up purchases and limits checkout lines  Time constraints in stores are a major factor in the growth of the online marketplace and Wal Mart is using these services to combat the trend  These changes have likely contributed to increased traffic in Wal Mart stores for six consecutive quarters that follow a period of decline  
Positive Earnings Momentum 
Wal Mart s first quarter earnings surprised everyone  U S  same store sales increased by 1   beating consensus estimates of 0 5  growth  Without the impact of the strong U S  dollar  the sales increase would have been 4   The company has beat the Zacks consensus EPS estimates in each of the last three quarters  with its 4 quarter EPS surprise at  4  
The positive earnings surprise and favorable management commentary has prompted analysts to raise their earnings expectations for the retail giant  with the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for this year going up  2 9  over the last thirty days to  4 27  while next year s estimates have gone up by  2 7  in the same time period  No doubt the stocks is currently rated Zacks Rank   2  Buy  
Wal Mart stands to benefit from the uncertain threat of macro economic slowdown  Discount retailing is one of few industries which thrive during downturns as they are able to lessen the quality and prices of their product line without tarnishing the brand and driving customers away  In the economic meltdown of 2008  Wal Mart s stock soared 21 6  due to increased earnings and strong demand which resulted from being one of few exceptional performers in the fiscal year  From 2007 to 2008  Wal Mart revenues increased by 7 1  and increased another 7 7  in 2009  The increased market demand for low cost goods attracted consumers to Wal Mart  driving revenue growth  This straightforward trend will continue through the risky movements in the business cycle 
Wal Mart Stock Outperforming Peers

145723,367238,COST,Shopping For Shark Cages At Costco,opinion,"We are about to embark on a family vacation to the beach  I grew up going to the beach every year  It was an extended family event  We would head to Ocean Isle Beach in North Carolina and get 4 beach houses for my Mom s mother  5 siblings  spouses and all us kids  It was great  We would rent rafts and the Dads would pull us out to the break line for a ride in  Many times we saw hammer head sharks in the water when we were out there  No one ever panicked  The Dads just gave us one more ride to shore and we got out 
Thinking of that now has my wife thinking we need to buy our own shark cage to go to the beach  I understand  She grew up in Ohio  where we live now  so trips to the  beach  meant the shores of Lake Erie  No sharks there  But it got me thinking  As we plan to gather supplies from my favorite store  Costco  NASDAQ COST   I wondered if they sell shark cages  I mean you can buy everything else there 
I also wondered how the stock of my favorite store was doing  The chart below tells the story  Since making a bottom in May it rose back to the April resistance level  Last week saw it peek above that on Friday  and continue this week  By Tuesday it had closed the gap from early April  h and there is one more thing about the chart 

It seems there are Sharks circling at Costco  A harmonic Shark pattern that is  It will confirm with a move in price over  160  From there it creates 2 potential Reversal Zones  PRZ s   The first is shown at about 166 50  The second would be further above at 173 25  There is momentum behind the current run  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising  and the MACD is moving higher  Even the Bollinger Bands  are shifting and opening higher 
You can use that resistance break line as a stop loss and ride it higher risking about  2 50  Or consider using July 155 Calls for about  3 50 to limit your risk absolutely to the premium paid and add leverage  A move in your favor and you will be the shark

145727,367242,COST,Costco s  COST  New Partnership With Citigroup  C  Not Quite Smooth Sailing,opinion,"Costco  NASDAQ COST  Wholesale   NYSE C   has experienced a decrease in sales recently  presumably due to difficulties involving transitioning customers from American Express   NYSE AXP   to Citigroup   NYSE C   cards 
Costco ended their 16 year relationship with American Express after the two firms could not agree on renewal terms  The new partnership was announced in March of 2015  and involves Citi exclusively issuing their co brand credit cards in all U S  locations along with Visa   NYSE V   replacing American Express go to Costco credit card 
Problems with New Deal 
The new cards became available for use on Monday  when Citi acquired the Costco Portfolio from American Express  However  many customers have complained  citing lengthy wait times as well as difficulty activating their new cards 
As  points out  Citi states it has issued 11M cards and already received 1 5M customer calls by late Wednesday  However  the call volume is slowly normalizing  According to   some customers have experienced delays in service while others have not yet received their cards 
Why the Switch 
The partnership is believed to serve as a way for Costco to reduce costs  Specifically  analysts believe that the deal should save Costco anywhere between  60M  150M per year moving forward 
Costco currently sits at a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   There is 100  agreement in downward estimate revisions for the current quarter  and 67  agreement in downward revisions for next quarter  That coupled with an average EPS surprise of  1 91  have negatively impacted the outlook for Costco COSTCO WHOLE CP Price and EPS Surprise   Although this deal may benefit Costco  at this point it is important to lower expectations and watch what happens over the next few months  as this could be a rocky stretch for COST shares ",2016-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/costco's-(cost)-new-partnership-with-citigroup-(c)-not-quite-smooth-sailing-200137905,200137905

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 23 on  26 99 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  13 million on the top
Costco s March and April numbers signified a slowdown  but withholding negative impacts from gas and FX headwinds  sales were relatively flat
Switching the company s official credit card from American Express  NYSE AXP  to Visa could hurt new subscribers
What are you expecting for  
Headlining this week of earnings is wholesale retailer  Costco  Costco doesn t keep very many secrets when it comes to earnings  On a monthly basis the company releases its sales numbers  taking away some of the mystery behind quarterly results  Costco has already reported slowdown in 2 of 3 months covered this quarter  but factoring out currency headwinds and gas prices  sales have been relatively flat 
Nonetheless  the Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 23 on  26 99 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  13 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 6  gain in earnings with sales expected to grow by 5  
On average  Costco is a positive mover during earnings season  Shares typically increase 2  in the 30 days prior to results and maintain those gains until the month after  This should help reconcile the 11  dip shares have taken this year 

Excluding negative impacts from gas prices and foreign exchange rates  total comp sales increased 3  last month  This was driven by 2  gains in its domestic segment and 7  increase in Canada  Since the sales numbers have already been published  investors will be most interested to see if memberships grew  The switch of the company s credit card from American Express to Visa through Citigroup  NYSE C  could hurt new subscribers 
For the discount club  membership fees make up more a greater proportion of total revenue than in store sales  Roughly 75  of sales come from fees and any reduction in price would be problematic for Costco  The company also faces stiff competition from other retailers specifically Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Walmart  NYSE WMT  
On the bright side  Costco has resisted the overall weakness in the retail sector  delivering consistent earnings and revenue growth over the last three years

145751,367266,COST,Hop On The Unstoppable Costco Train,opinion,"You know what people dread  Grocery shopping  You know what people love  Shopping at Costco  NASDAQ COST  
How could this be  Well  maybe it s the inviting array of samples throughout the store  Or  maybe it s because every Costco shopper knows they are getting the absolute best price on whatever they buy  Or  maybe it s because of the helpful  warm  and genuinely happy staff 
Whatever the reason  one thing is for sure  Costco is a winner  And don t count on that changing anytime soon  If you ve got some extra money sitting around consider a long term investment in Costco 
Management
Costco s management is among the strongest  Led by their plainspoken CEO Craig Jelinek  Costco management believes in treating employees with dignity and respect  In return  they expect loyalty and hard work  So far  the trade off has worked wonders  The average hourly salary for Costco employees is  20 89  with 88  of employees receiving company sponsored health insurance  In comparison  competitor Walmart  NYSE WMT  pays average wages of  12 67 an hour  with about only half their employees receiving health insurance  As a result  Costco employees appreciate where they work  and perform admirably 
On average  each Costco employee covers about 500 square feet  which is twice what Walmart employees cover  Notwithstanding  one rarely experiences better customer service in Walmart  This strategy of higher wages for a more productive workforce results in a sustainable win win for everyone involved 
The only person not taking a higher wage  CEO Jelinek  In 2012  he made just under  5 million per year   a bargain considering that Walmart s CEO Mike Duke made nearly 4 times more  Forward thinking has become the expectation  not exception  from the Costco management team 
Financial Strength 
During the 2009 recession  when most companies were laying off employees  one was providing raises  Costco  No matter what happens  Costco is built to roll with the punches  A raise in minimum wage  Costco already pays above it  A recession drives down demand for luxury goods  Costco s in house brand Kirkland gets a boost  Trying to stick to a budget  Buy in bulk  save your money 
Costco succeeds because of their unique business model  Unlike other retailers  Costco derives it s main revenue stream from selling annual membership  At a reasonable price of  55 a year  members have access to the deals of a lifetime  And so far  over 80 million people have entered the Costco club  In return  Costco charges an unbeatably low margin on items ranging from carrots to cars  The feeling of inclusion  plus the fantastic deals  ensures customers stick around  membership retention rates are in excess of 85  
This model is sustainable in any economic situation  Just this past year  with public trust in the economy wavering  Costco achieved over  100 billion is annual sales  and grew net income by over 14   If there is a nuclear holocaust  count on two things surviving  cockroaches and Costco 
Economic Moat 
Another great thing about Costco  it is not going anywhere  With their low prices driving a growing membership base  Costco is expanding  In each of the past 5 years Costco has swelled  growing from 592 warehouses worldwide in 2011 to 686 in 2015  In a world dominated by e commerce  Costco represents one of the few outliers expanding with their brick and mortar operations 
Of course  Costco is not oblivious to the advances of e commerce  However  Costco s focus remains on sectors that are not ready to be overrun by computers anytime soon  namely food  Whether Grocery Gateway or Webvan  the online grocery market has never caught on with shoppers  From the enticing smells of freshly baked goods to the rows of rainbow coloured beverages  people enjoy shopping for food  It is an inherently personal thing  People would rather pick their items themselves than trust an online delivery service  Costco knows and relies on this  with almost 55  of sales revenue coming from food purchases  And there appears no end in sight  in 2015  it experienced an 11  growth of food revenues  Even fine food stores are no longer safe  Costco is working on becoming the top choice for Americans looking to buy organic food  By continuing to offer high quality  low cost food  Costco has established itself as the premier grocery option in America for years to come 
Dividends and Buybacks 
Now some of the nitty gritty stuff  Costco has been providing investors with a high dividend return for years  reaching a 4  yield in 2015  This dividend provides shareholders a reliable return  and is a great fail safe  When looking at a long term investment  having some return practically guaranteed is comforting 
Costco has also been open to share buybacks  albeit relatively little over the past 7 years  Lately  Costco has been reinvesting it s earnings  a signal from management that it believes in it s continuing globally growth  When considering whether Costco is a long term play  both the high dividends and reinvestment rates are promising signs 
For the more number focused thinkers among us  Costco does have a P E ratio  Price to Equity  of about 29  higher than one might expect from a wholesale company  Nonetheless  over the past 13 years their median P E ratio has been around 24  and investors have seen a return on their investment of approximately 500   Walmart has a more reasonable P E ratio of just under 15  but their stock growth over the past 13 years is only 35   Sometimes there s a premium for quality 
Conclusion 
No matter how you slice it  Costco is a winner today  tomorrow  and for the foreseeable future  So do yourself a favour  buy stock in Costco now  NASDAQ COST   and reap the benefits for years to come  As Jonah Hill said in The Wolf of Wall Street   It ll be like getting in on sunlight before there was sunlight  ",2016-05-31,Vuru Inc,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hop-on-the-unstoppable-costco-train-200133078,200133078

Consumer Staples   Food   Staples Retailing   Reports March 2  After Market Close
Key Takeaways 
The Estimize community is calling Costco    to show an EPS of  1 30 and revenue of  28 774 billion  surpassing Wall Street by 2 cent on the bottom line and  110 million in sales
FX headwinds  low gas prices and slow membership growth are expected to cut into comparable store sales
Inclement weather caused warehouse sales to fall 1  and total sales to dip and total 0 75  
Beloved warehouse retailer Costco is scheduled to report FQ2 2016 earnings March 2  after the market closes  Last quarter the company missed on both the top and bottom line  largely due to weak same store sales and currency headwinds  Given the company s remarkable fiscal 2015  this most recent quarter came as a surprise to the Costco faithful  Consequently  shares have fallen 7 30  since they last reported  despite the generally high sentiment towards Costco s long term prospects 
This quarter the Estimize community is calling for EPS of  1 30 and revenue of  28 774 billion  surpassing Wall Street by 2 cent on the bottom line and  110 million in sales  However  our Select Consensus  which more heavily weights historically accurate analysts and recent estimates  is expecting a more modest beat of 1 cent  Compared to the same period last year  this predicts as a 4  increase on the bottom line while sales are expected to grow 5   Costco has been consistently unable to beat expectations  only eclipsing the Estimize consensus in 41  of quarters 
On a constant currency basis  comparable store sales are expected to rise by a 3   Meanwhile  Costco has targeted 30 new warehouse openings across the U S  and internationally during fiscal 2016  That said  a strong U S  dollar  on top of the struggling oil sector  is predicted to take its toll on quarterly earnings  Any positive sales trends overseas will almost certainly be squashed as long as weaker spending and macroeconomic headwinds persist 
Costco recently announced sales figures for January with net sales reaching  8 6 billion  up 2  the same period a year ago  While this is encouraging  management claims the winter storms that affected the Midwest and Northeast caused warehouse sales to fall 1  and total sales to fall 0 75  
Additionally  membership revenues are projected to hit a wall  Costco prides itself on its loyal member base which boasts a resounding 91  membership renewal rate  However  the switch from Amex to Visa has taken longer than expected  leaving prospective customers patiently waiting  This has caused the retailer to temporarily suspend a new private label card signup with Citibank until a fee is agreed upon for Amex s Costco credit portfolio

145783,367298,COST,Plates Are Shifting,opinion,"While the major equity indexes continue to scrape and crawl their way higher in this market bounce  many of the following markets left for dead have now entered NEW bull markets  Greece  Russia  Brazil  Crude Oil  Oil Service  Energy MLPs  Gold  Metal and Miners  and even the Transports  After years of outperformance from the FANG and Momentum stocks  the market of 2016 is seeing a shift toward underperforming  highly leveraged  worst quality companies and geographies that it can find  While low valuations were fuel for the fire  the shift still needed a catalyst and the sparks seemed to have come from the continued lift in oil prices and a new ravenous demand for High Yield bonds  Helping the low quality move has been trend following strategies who continue to be forced into covering their equity and commodity shorts on each new move higher  As the upward move continues  those Portfolio Managers concentrated in High Quality will be forced into reducing their holdings to participate in some of these new bull markets or fear looking at significant underperformance to start 2016  Hopefully these firms did not fire all of their Energy and Latin American intelligence during the last 12 months of underperformance 

Friday s jobs data was mixed and thus probably not enough to cause a Fed rate hike at the next meeting  But there has been a shift in expectations from the market toward at least one Fed rate hike before year end  Politics remain an active sideshow  If you are not enjoying the House of Cards in this election cycle  turn off the news and blogs and get back to looking at the oversold markets that you have laughed at for years  Keep an eye on the China data points as everyone expects the data to be terrible  That is your opportunity across many different market segments if they arrive in line or slightly better 

A look at the market bounce today versus the bounce in October shows some notable differences 

The October bounce had help from High Yield Bonds  This time we also have oil prices and Small Cap outperformance helping to fuel buying appetites 

Junk Bonds just became much too attractive for investors  Now the trucks are backing up 

Investors piled into US junk bond funds at the fastest pace on record as a relief rally in global equity and fixed income markets coaxed fresh money off the sidelines 
US funds invested in high yield debt counted  5bn of inflows in the week to March 2  the greatest seven day haul since record keeping began in 1992  according to fund flows tracked by Lipper 
The moves highlight an easing of investor anxiety after a string of better than expected economic reports in the US  a stabilisation in crude prices and the view that central banks in Europe  Japan and China are prepared to provide further economic stimulus if needed 

 and the world s big Bond manager is supplying many of the semi trailers 

Pacific Investment Management Co  says it s time to buy U S  junk bonds  And the money manager is not alone 
Investors have sunk record levels of cash into the largest high yield debt exchange traded fund in recent days  Prices for the bonds have been rising since mid February 
Consumer spending is still strong  and corporate profits are still solid  said Mark Kiesel  chief investment officer for global credit at Pimco in Newport Beach  California  Those factors should fuel strong returns for junk bonds  he said  adding that he thinks the economy is doing well 
 The market is as attractive as it s been in four or five years   Kiesel said   There are a lot of opportunities there   Pimco has started buying debt in the energy sector for the first time in several years  he added  after the price of oil rose in recent weeks 
  

The market s appetite for Junk Bonds can be easily seen here

You can also see the move in the Junk Bond ETFs  NYSE HYG  

A good Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  chart showing that High Yield became too cheap for even a recession scenario analysis 

And so as Junk Bonds and Commodities bounced back  so did any Equities involved either  Just look at the size of these weekly moves 

The following are this week s top 20 percentage gainers  categorized by sectors  over  300 mln market cap and 100K average daily volume  

Materials  VALE  4 38  61 62    SID  1 97  58 87   Industrials  GOL  8 52  58 69   Consumer Discretionary  FDML  8 17  64 06   Energy  CRC  1 76  259 18    SDRL  5 97  215 87    UPL  1 1  214 38  DNR  3 26  173 95    EPE  3 93  128 49    LINE  1  127 53   UNT  10 37  104 54    CHK  5 08  88 15    SM  15 6  77 47  CJES  1 73  73    BTE  3 63  63 51    NE  13 17  60 61  LPI  7 86  58 79    PBR  5 26  55 62    FMSA  3 05  54 82  

Even the weekly moves in these S P 500 stocks made for a very good year 

More surprising to the strength in Energy Equities has been the recent raise of nearly  10b in secondary offerings 

The buyers of these discounted deals have done well which will likely lead to even more capital raising among companies recently left for dead  The proceeds can then go to pay down High Yield debt which will only improve those prices which then will again help equity prices so that it becomes a circular inflation in value   Arrows show the point of secondary offering  

Some might even find it comical that the Greek ETF  NYSE GREK  has now entered a Bull Market 

But Greece is small  How about a mega broken Emerging Market tied to Energy  Metals and Corruption like Brazil 

 DDCapitalFund  Brazil weekly bar and volume speak for themselves on break out of large descending wedge iShares MSCI Brazil Capped  NYSE EWZ 

While oil gets all the attention  even commodity metal prices have recovered significantly  Look at this move in Iron Ore 

Iron ore soared the most ever after Chinese policy makers signaled their willingness to buttress economic growth  boosting the outlook for steel consumption in the top user and igniting speculation that some investors who d bet against the market had been caught out 
Iron ore has powered higher in 2016 as steel prices have strengthened  undermining forecasts for further losses driven by mounting low cost supply from Australia and Brazil and weakening demand in China  At the annual National People s Congress at the weekend  the authorities said they d allow a record high deficit and higher money supply target to support growth of 6 5 percent to 7 percent  At the same time  they also vowed to help cut overcapacity in steel  potentially curbing demand for iron ore 



Some Hedge Funds posted big profits on their Commodity driven shorts the last few years  Time to cover and run 

Hedge funds that made big profits betting against mining stocks in 2015 have seen the trade turn sour  as commodity prices have bounced off multiyear lows and triggered a huge rally in the natural resource sector 
Anglo American  LON AAL  and Glencore  LON GLEN   the two worst performing stocks on the FTSE 100 last year  have both had their share prices almost double since the beginning of January  as industrial metal prices have gone on a six week tear 
Betting against mining stocks last year became a popular way for funds to try to make money out of China s slowing growth  The world s second largest economy has become by far the world s biggest consumer of industrial metals over the past decade  accounting for about 40 per cent of all copper demand  Anglo American and Glencore were also targeted because of their high debt levels 
 This is deeply scary for the shorts   said one banker   The fear of insolvency  which was never a reality  has now receded in Anglo and Glencore and institutions aren t selling  This could be an almighty problem  

A close look at the S P 500 shows the tight link with two year Treasury yields 

As the economy and inflation datapoints strengthen  will the relationship hold  It usually does until inflation and rates get too high  We are far from that today 

 For the week  all sectors posted gains but with a large divergence between Energy and Healthcare 

A broader look shows the continued outperformance of 2015 s pariah sectors 

Most discussed chart from Friday s jobs data  It will be interesting to see if the series adjusts higher next month  Still plenty of evidence of rising wages from individual companies  Even Costco  NASDAQ COST  had to take up its starting wages last week to fill empty shoes

The Technicals
Costco s weekly chart over the last 3 years says a lot  First  notice the dips in price back to the 50 week SMA  Every time it touched it or went right through  the return back higher was very profitable  That happened 6 weeks ago and the upside separation is just starting to happen 
The RSI is also a signal  Every bounce off of the bottom of the bull range  at 40  has started a run higher in the stock until the RSI has moved over 70  And the MACD at the bottom is similar  Every bounce off of zero has continued higher to about 5 
All of these signals are showing as the stock price pushes against resistance at 154 50  A move over this would confirm another leg higher  The last two gave  45 and  40 moves

145811,367326,COST,When It Rains  It Pours,opinion,"There are three developments today  which while not driving the market  are important for many investors  The first are comments from German Finance Minister Schaeuble and EC President Juncker  The second is an important development in Poland  The third are growing problems in Greece 
Schaeuble is formally acknowledging what investors have known for some time  The Schengen Agreement  which opens the internal borders in Europe  is at risk  This agreement pre dates EMU itself  So how serious is it if there are internal border checks  Juncker  not known for mincing words  said today that without Schengen  there is no point to the euro 
This points to the risk of an existential crisis in Europe that would make last summer s anxiety over Greece seem like child s play  The poor growth  high unemployment that Europe has largely been unable to resolve  admittedly with a few exceptions like Germany  only aggravates base instincts and latent xenophobia  The escalation of terrorism contributes to the desire for more internal border checks  but the effectiveness continues to be the subject of much debate 
Recognizing the central place of political will at the very foundation of EMU allowed us to correctly anticipate that Greece would remain within the union in both 2011 12 and 2015  The same insight  however  makes the potential dissolution of the Schengen Agreement even more significant 
II
Since the election of the Law and Justice Party  the country has moved in an illiberal direction Today is the anniversary of the lifting of the Swiss franc cap  Many Polish mortgages were taken in Swiss francs  The issue is how the cost should be distributed  Today  Poland s President is proposed that the mortgages are repaid at a  fair price  which means less than market prices 
The example used is that in 2007 the franc zloty cross was around 2 27  At the end of last year  it was 3 91  A fair price  says the President  is 2 80  This would obviously forces the lenders to take the haircut  and hence  their stocks are under pressure  and the zloty itself is at new four year lows vs  the euro  There is also fear that S P will cut its outlook for Poland s credit rating 
While Poland remains wary of Russia  the magnitude of the shift in the political climate appears to have caught by surprise  Investors are marking down Polish asset prices  The shift in Poland can complicate governance issues within the EU  Not only is there the North South  creditor debtor divide  but now perhaps an eastern wing that is on an different trajectory 
III
Greece remains resolved in several important respects  First  although Greece has tried arguing that there is not need for the IMF  Germany and Eurogroup are insisting on it  Greece may find that the IMF s conditions for joining are much to its liking  It is demanding significant debt relief for Greece  Of course  the IMF excludes itself from such efforts  The other official creditors  including Germany  appear to ruled out any debt forgiveness  Instead  the creditors want to rely on extending maturities and lowering interest rates  and perhaps postponing when payments must begin 
Second  Greek pension reform continues to be negotiated  It is particularly important  Politically  this is where the Syriza government has drawn a line  In Greece  often pension may help supplement and supplant unemployment benefits  The latter expires  The former doesn t  Early retirements  adults living with parents  and other social adjustments have increased the significance of pensions  At the same time  they are also part of the important reforms 
Third  the difficult and painful decisions that the Syriza government has had to make within the straitjacket that Tsipras accepted last summer has weakened its legitimacy  The price of reduced tensions with the EC is greater domestic tensions 
Yesterday the state appointed board of the Piraeus Port Authority surprisingly defied the government is pushing forward with efforts to renegotiate a new concession contract with the government  Understandably  the Piraeus Mayor and Piraeus Chamber of Commerce and Industry who are on the board want to secure a greater price  The Greek government has asked China s Costco  the only bid for 51  of the Port  to raise its offer  Reports suggest Costco  O COST  may offer a little more  but the port s share price has fallen below the existing offer ",2016-01-15,Marc Chandler,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/when-it-rains,-it-pours-380270",380270

145834,367349,COST,D j  Vu 2011  Is The Dow Getting Ready To Soar ,opinion," The paranoiac is the exact image of the ruler  The only difference is their position in the world  One might even think the paranoiac the more impressive of the two because he is sufficient unto himself and cannot be shaken by failure  

 Elias Canetti
Flashback  Dow today looks like Dow yesteryear  The pattern it is currently tracing is jarringly similar to that of 2011  If history is going to serve as a guidepost  then the Dow could be ready to roar as opposed to being down for the count  When the markets were plunging in 2011  the same question was posed  Is the Dow going to crash  is the bull over  Turns out that the so called crash was nothing but a hiccup in what turned out to be one of the most massive Bull Runs of all time  Now we are faced with the same paradigm  and once again  the talking heads  many who actually have the audacity to call themselves experts  are marching to the same drumbeat and chanting the same song of doom  We have repeatedly stated over the years that we are living in an era of lies and deceit  where the laws of reality have been suspended and master of deception  A K A central bankers  have helped create an alternate reality  In this reality  savers are punished and speculators are rewarded  Markets have been manipulated for an extraordinary period of time by artificially holding down interest rates for a record period of time 
As we live in an era of lies and deceit  where rampant manipulation is the order of the day  worse still  no one is contesting this manipulation  The masses have embraced that this is their destiny and surrendered to this new market norm  A norm that rewards speculators and punishes savers  As the laws of reality have been suspended  courtesy of the masters of deception  otherwise known as the friendly Fed   the markets will only crash if access to easy money is eliminated  This hot money is what s fueling the markets and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future  Against this backdrop of deceit and corruption  normal market rules cease to apply 
Therefore  our contention has been that every major correction for the past several years is nothing but the market letting out a well deserved dose of steam and that a massive crash is not in the makings  at least not yet  One day the markets will crash  but as this market is being propped up a by hot money  anything and everything will be done to prevent the markets from crashing  If there was any dose of freedom left in these markets  they would have crashed long ago  There is a stark difference between thinking you know what will happen and from knowing what is going to happen  Mass psychology clearly states that markets usually run into a brick wall when the Crowd is Euphoric and chanting  Kumbaya my love   This is not the case yet and sentiment is far from the euphoric zone  This is one of the most hated bull markets in history 
It s 2011 all over again
The predictions that Dow was destined for destruction during the correction of 2011 might have appeared erudite in nature  Those predictions  now in retrospect  sound more like the ravings of a lunatic  Be wary when the masses are joyous and joyous when they are not  that in essence is the most basic tenet of mass psychology 
Dow Pattern in 2011 

  In 2011  the from high to low  the Dow shed roughly 16 2  or 2 070 points  Now  depending on your entry point  the experience could have ranged from being mild to crash like in nature  If you purchased right at the top  then the word crash was probably flashing through your mind  Just because you think it s a crash does not necessarily signify that your perceptions  which are being overwhelmed by fear  are correct 
  All media outlets were busy flooding the waves with stories that extremely pessimistic in nature  Misery loves company and stupidity simply adores it  Consumer confidence was not strong  the U S  credit rating was downgraded  manufacturing was slowing down  and the list goes on    The 3rd quarter ended and the 4th quarter began and all those bogeyman stories well proved to be just that 
  Markets climb a wall of worry and plunge down an abyss of joy  this is clearly demonstrated in the chart below

In 2011  the Dow ended the year on a positive note  defying all the predictions of disaster  Three months into the new year  2012   the Dow soared to a series of new highs  Like cockroaches  the naysayers vanished into the woodwork waiting for another day to sing the same old monotonous song  buoyant that time would make the masses forget the old proclamations and embrace the new ones  this falls dangerously close to the definition of insanity  Doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome  So far the outcome appears to be the same and if the pattern is repeated  then these chaps are going to get clobbered 
Dow outlook 2015

During the so called market crash phase that started in August  the Dow from high to low shed approximately 16 3       Strikingly close to the 16 2  that the Dow gave up during the 3rd quarter of 2011  So far  in the 4th quarter  all the major market indices are faring much better  as was the case back in 2011  In the 4th quarter  the Dow has tacked on almost 5  
Market Sentiment during the so called crash phase  
The VIX  which is an index that measures fear  blasted as it was being chased by the hounds of hell  It surged to a new 5 year high  pointedly illustrating that the masses were hysterical  Panic is the secret code name for opportunity  Mass psychology clearly indicates that when the crowds panic  the astute investor should be ready to jump in 
The bullish case for the Dow builds    A host of technical indicators are still trading in the extremely oversold ranges    Our trend indicator is dangerously close to triggering a new buy signal  The fact that it did not move into the sell zone validated that the correction was nothing but a market letting out some well deserved steam    Retailers like Costco  O COST   L Brands  N LB   Fred s  O FRED   etc   all surprised analysts by reporting stronger than projected same store sales 
The Game plan going forward
Fear has to be avoided under any circumstance when it comes to investing  It is a detestable emotion that just sucks you dry  It takes and gives nothing back in return  When the crowd panics  one should resist the urge to become one with fear and the crowd  We are not in the jungle and fear is a useless emotion when it comes to making money in the markets  Get rid of it or it will get rid of you  Fear is a parasitic emotion  the only good parasite is a dead parasite  So shoot to kill when it comes to fear
To break even for the year  the Dow only needs to trade approximately 600 points higher  If examines the entire journey  up and down  the Dow traversed from August to October  the count comes in at roughly 5000 points  Examined from this angle  600 points does not amount to that much  the Dow still has roughly three months to achieve this objective 
The ride up is expected to be volatile as our V indicator is trading well above the danger zone  1100 points higher to be precise  This means that extreme volatility is going to be the order of the day  One should not expect the ride up to be smooth  We have a fair amount of resistance in the 17300 17400 ranges  The ideal set up would be for the Dow would trade in these ranges  with a possible overshoot to 17 600 and then proceed to test 16 500 16 600 ranges  The Dow is then expected to put in a series of higher lows  ending the year on a positive note 
Bear in mind that the above targets should serve as rough guideposts  We never focus on trying to identify the exact bottom or top  a task we think is best left to fools with an inordinate appetite for pain  The game plan should be to view all strong pullback as buying opportunities 
Dow Dejavu  When one examines both the patterns  2011 and 2015   the answer appears to be  yes 

 Action cures fear  inaction creates terror

What Costco does better than most of its competitors is increase profits  With an already loyal customer base  90  member retention rate   the firm was able to raise membership rates without an issue  The bulk of profits come from membership fees and the high retention rate suggests a more stable profit structure  Last quarter  club membership grew 2  and same stores sales grew 2   Additionally  Costco plans to open one new warehouse before the calendar year end of 2015

145862,367377,COST,Ex Dividend Dates  Rules For Standard And Special Dividends,opinion,"Dividends impact option premiums  When a dividend is distributed  the cash holdings of a corporation is decreased and therefore  the company and its stock are worth less  The eligibility to receive the dividend depends on several factors including the size of the dividend  First  let s define some terms 

Types of dividends

Standard dividends  A distribution of a portion of a company s earnings  which can be issued as cash or shares of stock  Most dividends are distributed on a quarterly basis
Special dividends  A one time distribution of corporate earnings  usually in the form of cash due to an exceptional amount of profit in a given time frame


Ex dividend date standard rules

To capture a dividend  a shareholder must buy the shares prior to the ex dividend date  aka the ex date   Under normal circumstances  the ex date is two days prior to the record date  which is the official date that the stock owner is  in fact  a shareholder of that company  Since it takes three days to settle a stock purchase  shares must be purchased three days before the record date  After that  two days before the record date  the stock goes ex dividend and shares purchased from that point forward are no longer eligible to receive the dividend  The actual payment date is sometime after the record date  These standard rules apply to standard dividends and special one time cash dividends  which distribute less than 25  of the value of one share 


Ex dividend date special rules

When the special cash dividend distribution is an amount greater than 25  of the value of one share  the ex date is set the day after the payment date  Therefore  if a stock is purchased after the record date but before the ex date  the dividend is still captured  The ex date always determines who receives the dividend  the stock buyer or seller 


Impact of special dividends on share value and strike prices  COSTCO example

In February  2015 Costco  NASDAQ COST  distributed a special one time cash dividend of  5 00 per share  Since this amount was less than 25  of share value  standard ex dividend date rules applied  The record date was February 9th  after a weekend  and the ex date was February 5th  Option strike prices were reduced by  5 00 per share on the ex date and share value also declined because of this distribution  as shown in the chart below 



Costco  Special dividend reducing share value


Summary

There are two types of dividends  standard and special one time cash dividends  Special ex dividend date rules apply when special dividends are greater than 25  of share value  and it is always the ex date that determines who receives the dividend  For option sellers  share value and strike prices will decline by the dividend amount on the ex date

145863,367378,COST,Top Trade Ideas For Week July 20  2015  Costco,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST   is where I shop for almost everything  We get fruit  vegetables  meat  bread and even gasoline  It may come in large quantities but that does not seem to matter much  And it is not just me  Everyone shops there  In fact I would go so far as to lay out a theory that Costco is the reason that most suburban people have an SUV  not the children 
The stock of the company had a great run higher that started in August of 2014 after a short pause  up to a peak in March  But then it started a pullback  The price fell in a long orderly channel for nearly 4 months before breaking it to the upside a week ago 
The catalyst may have been a re connection with the 200 day SMA  It had not seen the 200 day SMA since July 2014 when that run higher started  Or it might have been the RSI hitting oversold territory for the second time in 3 weeks  Whatever the reason it is moving higher now 
And the chart looks promising for the upside to continue  The RSI is now back into the bullish range and rising  The MACD is also rising and the Bollinger Bands  have opened for the move higher  There is a consolidation going on now after that first move up  A break over the top of it would set a target of 155  a new All Time high 
There is resistance above at 145 25 and 148 25 followed by 150 75 and 152 35 before 154 25  There is also the 100 day SMA overhead  Support lower comes at 142 60 and 140 followed by 137 and 135  Short interest is low at only 1 1  and the company reports earnings next in October 
Looking at the options chains  the weekly Expiry sees large open interest at 144 Friday  Moving out to the August Expiry the 145 and 150 Strikes have big open interest on the Call side with the 140 and 135 Strikes on the Put side 
Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 145 with a stop at 142 50  A straight stock buy 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock and add an August 145 135 Put Spread September 150 Covered Call Collar  30 cents    The collar protects the downside for a month for only 30 cents 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the August 145 150 Call Spread   1 70   A defined risk method for trading the stock 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the August 145 150 Call Spread and sell the August 135 Puts   1 25   Adds leverage at the prior low 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into next week the thermometer is getting hotter and the so are the equity markets with the QQQ leading the charge 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower along with Crude Oil next week  The US Dollar Index is breaking out higher and US Treasuries may be ready to reverse higher as well  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both reversing higher and the coming week could determine if it is Dead Cat Bounces or the real deal 
Volatility looks to remain subdued and with a bias lower build a tailwind behind the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  The QQQ looks very strong as it approaches the all time highs of 2000 while the SPY is also strong and on the edge of a break out  The IWM looks the weakest as it moves sideways in a new consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

145897,367412,COST,Stock Of The Day  Analysts Weigh In On Costco Following Stellar Q2  15,opinion,"By Carly ForsterWholesale retailer Costco  NASDAQ    announced its second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results on Thursday  March 5th  posting one of its strongest quarters in recent years Highlights from the report include earnings of  1 35 per share  beating analysts  consensus estimate of  1 18 per share and up from  1 05 the same quarter a year prior  Revenue was reported at  27 45 billion  marking a 4  increase year over year Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  profited from a tax benefit of  57 million  or  0 13 a share  from its special  5 cash dividend in February  However  the company was also negatively impacted by  14 million  or  0 03 a share  due to  an ongoing income tax matter   according to Costco s CFO  Richard Galanti Many believe Costco s exceptional quarter was driven by the fall in gas prices  The company was slower to change the price of fuel it charged customers than the rate in which fuel costs were dropping  In addition  consumers were left with more money to spend In other Costco news  the company revealed on March 2nd that it will replace American Express  NYSE AXP  as its only accepted credit card with Citigroup Inc  NYSE C  and Visa Inc  NYSE V  starting in April 2016 On March 6th  Cowen and Company analyst  maintained an Outperform rating on Costco with a  165 price target following the company s stellar Q2 results  He noted 

 We believe Costco is well positioned to continue delivering double digit earnings growth over the near to medium term driven by square footage growth  steady membership revenue growth and positive same store sales comps  Costco s higher income customer base  average household income of approximately  96 000  is faring better economically than low  to middle income consumers  who continue to struggle with wage growth  We believe superb price value  luxury product and streamlined assortment helps drive a sustainable high margin membership stream  

Overall  Oliver Chen has a 51  success rate recommending stocks and a  11 8  average return per recommendation  He has rated Costco 3 times since February 2013  earning a 50  success rate recommending the company and a  6 4  average return per COST recommendation Separately on March 6th  UBS analyst  issued a Hold rating on Costco with a price target of  153  He reasoned 

 With MFI coming in slightly below UBS and the Street  COST again beat expectations by a comfortable margin on retail operations  Excluding MFI  COST s operating income was  295 mm  30 percent ahead of our estimate of  227 mm due to the gross margin beat  GM was the highest it has been since 1Q 11  We think it likely continued to benefit from lower fuel prices and the resulting impact on mix  as well as from COST s ability to keep a bit more of the margin on fuel  

Michael Lasser has an overall success rate of 72  recommending stocks and a  15 6  average return per recommendation  He has rated Costco twice with Neutral ratings since December 2014  earning no success rate nor average return On average  the top analyst consensus for Costco on is Hold Disclosure  All Costco recommendations sourced from TipRanks ",2015-03-08,Carly Forster,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts'-weigh-in-on-costco-following-stellar-q2'15-244266,244266
145898,367413,COST,Costco Stock Price  Tell For Higher Markets,opinion,"I like Costco  NASDAQ COST   Who doesn t  You go shopping there  get a complete basement full of stuff you want  packaged neatly for a family of 12  It is our primary grocery store 
And as if that was not enough  they have people around every corner serving you hors d oeuvres to enhance the shopping experience  When you go to check you don t find 15 open lanes with no cashier  Rather  every register is manned and they ring you up in about 30 seconds 
Even with such a good shopping experience you still think there must be a catch and finally you see it as you re about to leave  Someone wants to count everything in your cart to see what you have stolen  This could take forever  But it would seem that laid off NASA engineers are performing this job because this too only takes 5 seconds 

I guess the one downside is that I never get out of the store without spending at least  300  But that is the good side too  You see Costco s stock price has been a tell for the strength of the market  The chart above shows that the stock moved sideways from early December until breaking higher to start February  But since then it has pulled back into a consolidation channel  over the prior consolidation 
Sound familiar  I have had a position in this stock since it started moving higher  below 120  But the current price action suggests it may be time to add to that position  or if you missed the chance in the past to start a position 
Since the beginning of March the Bollinger Bands  have been squeezing  That started to change earlier this week as they are slowly opening to allow a move  This as the price is pushing the top band higher and testing resistance at 151 50  As it holds over the 20 day SMA  the momentum indicators are turning more bullish 
The MACD has crossed up and is rising  The RSI has maintained the bullish range but is moving higher again as well  I am looking for a solid break above 151 50  as I stroll around the store eating bites of pizza and small yogurt cups  to add to positions

145900,367415,COST,American Express  A Timeless Dividend Growth Investment,opinion,"American Express  NYSE AXP  is a financial services multinational giant  best known for its credit cards and traveler s check services  The company accounts for around 24  of all the US credit card transactions American Express has long been considered as a timeless buy and hold investment  Its stock had been in a continuous bull market since the year 2009  after the price had declined to almost  10 after the sub prime mortgage crises  Since then  it perpetually climbed to a high of  96 until the Costco  NASDAQ COST  controversy  where the Department of Justice ruled against AXP due to its discriminatory practices Now that the company s stock price has taken a hit  it s time to examine the annual reports and assess the future potential of the company AnalysisUpon an examination of AXP s financial statements  it s quite obvious why American Express is the fourth largest holding of Buffett  comprising about 11 1  of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  s portfolio  amounting to a total of 151 6 million shares The company has consistently maintained gross profit margins of over 70   In terms of costs  the company has maintained selling  general  and administrative costs along with research and development below 10  of gross profit  Whereas  net profit margins have been in the range of 15   as opposed to the 20  ideal rate  The company has always been extremely generous with its shareholders  with return on equity averages over 25  
Although  debt to equity stands at around 670   this isn t something to be alarmed about  as high levels of debt are considered as a norm within the banking and credit industry  The  44 billion of liabilities on the company s statement of financial position are mostly customer bank deposits and not actual payables A Premium BrandThe company has managed these impeccable financials primarily due to its globally recognized brand  which is one of the most admired in the world  The company has managed to build a brand associated with premium quality  which has attracted high spending customers  This is an aspect of the brand that has enabled the company to charge higher percentage rates  due to its superior competitive advantage over its competitors  Furthermore  its spending centric business model allows it to leverage higher than average spending on its AXP cards  These high spending patterns are attractive to merchants  which creates the potential for higher discount revenues  Moreover  the value added services offered to card holders and merchants create a revenue generating cycle Company ValuationAXP is currently quite cheap with a P E ratio of 14  which is half of its primary competitors  MasterCard  NYSE MA  and Visa  NYSE V   which are currently trading at P Es of 28  In that regard  AXP should be trading at around  113 instead of its current price of  79 3  a clear indication of a value stock  From a valuation perspective the company is offering a tempting opportunity for investors 
Interestingly  the company s top level insiders have acquired around 58 000 shares of the company  And Jeffery Campbell  the CFO  has spent around  2 million acquiring over 25 000 shares  All of this indicates that company s executives consider AXP to be cheap and expect its price to rebound in the coming future AXP is currently expecting to achieve revenue growth of 8   EPS of 12 to 15 percent  and ROE of more than 25   If these goals become a reality  which seems possible  the company intends to return the benefits to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks  This is an excellent situation for dividend investors  as buybacks reduce share count  which is significantly  improves EPS  creating even more demand for the company s equity VerdictThe company s financials indicate that despite the ruling against the company and loss of Costco  the bad news has already been priced in and offers an excellent opportunity to invest at a discounted rate  Its impressive dividend yield of 1 32   which amounts to  1 16 annual per share  makes it one of the best value and dividend stocks to invest in  especially for those looking for low risk investments ",2015-06-06,Bill Achola,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-express:-a-timeless-dividend-growth-investment-254141,254141
145901,367416,COST,Shareholder Distributions Appear Unsustainable,opinion,"Shareholder distributions come in two varieties  stock buybacks and dividends 
Both are important  Our purpose here is not to debate whether one form of capital management is superior to the other 
We will  however  identify a trend that should worry every investor  not just income seekers  the rising level of unsustainable distributions 
When assessing the sustainability of a company s   we usually focus on its payout ratio   the percentage of free cash flow  FCF  paid out in the form of dividends 
At Wall Street Daily  we prefer a payout ratio under 80   Anything above 100  is a dire warning 
With that in mind  I calculated my own version of the payout ratio for the S P 500  excluding financials  to assess the sustainability of today s distributions  The results aren t pretty 
Below is a chart tracking free cash flow versus shareholder distributions over the last decade 

As you can see  distributions have exceeded free cash flow for the last two years  Indeed  dividend payouts and buybacks are at their highest levels ever  In short  we re on a dangerous trajectory 
The pitfalls here should be obvious  As income investors  sustainable  and growing  dividends are the most important factor in our investments  But as buybacks and dividends exceed free cash flow  companies end up borrowing from the future to pay shareholders today  Which means that at some point down the road  cuts are coming 
Simply put  the current gap between distributions and FCF will have to be evened out  Companies can t keep increasing their net debt indefinitely 
To put today s distributions in perspective  just look at the chart below  which includes my own de facto payout ratio  As you can see  we re approaching the payout levels seen just prior to the 2009 crash 

This should scare just about every investor out there  We simply can t continue at the current pace 
If there s one takeaway here  it s that we must be more careful than ever when selecting our income investments 
Many of the stocks on the S P 500 have trailing 12 month payout ratios well over 100  and should be avoided  This includes big names such as Philip Morris International  NYSE PM   110   Costco  NASDAQ COST   148   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   212   and General Motors  NYSE GM   214  
Bottom line  At some point in the future  distributions have to slow down  meaning dividends that can t be covered by free cash flow and buybacks funded by debt are major red flags

145934,367449,COST,Energy Masking Decent Earnings Growth For Rest Of S P 500 ,opinion,"Per ThomsonReuter s  This Week in Earnings   the  forward 4 quarter  estimate for the SP 500 fell to  125 36  from last week s to  126 15 

The Data  

P E Ratio  16 5 x 

The PEG  2 31 x 

The Earnings Yield  6 04 

The year over year growth of the forward estimate fell again to 7 18  from last week s 7 46  

Analysis   commentary  The Energy sector continues to be a huge drag on q4  14 SP 500 earnings  which is also weighing on the forward estimate for the S P 500  Here is the estimated earnings growth rate for the Energy sector  using Thomson data  for q4  14 over the last five weeks   The 2nd column is the estimated SP 500 earnings growth for the 4th quarter  

12 5 14   14 7    6 2 

11 28 14   10 5    6 6 

11 21 14   8 6    6 6 

11 14 14  7 9    6 6 

11 7 14   6 9    6 6 

Since October 1  the change in the q4  14 Energy sector s growth rate has been remarkable  from  6 6 as of October 1  to today s  14 6  or a whopping 2000 basis point decline in 11 weeks 

If we look at estimate changes for full year 2015  the change in Energy s expected full year earnings growth rate has fallen from  6 9  on October 1  14 to an estimated 9 4  decline as of December 5th or a roughly 1 600 basis point decline 

The estimated earnings growth rate for the SP 500 for q4  14 has fallen from  11 2  as of October 1  to  6 2  today 

The estimated earnings growth for the SP 500 for 2015 has fallen from  12 4  as of October 1  to  9 4  today  December 5th 

What I find puzzling is that in terms of the 10 SP 500 sectors  not one sector is getting the numbers bump  as Energy prices plummet  Not for q4  14 or even for full year 2015 

The Utilities Sector  NYSE IPU is the only sector to show a higher growth rate for q4  14 today at  9 9   versus  7 7  as of October 1 

Conclusion  I do suspect the drag of Energy revisions is masking pretty good earnings growth in the rest of the SP 500  but it isn t in the numbers in terms of the other sectors yet  This coming week  the two companies we are watching in terms of earnings reports are Costco  NASDAQ COST  COST   and Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL   Costco could be a gasoline price drop beneficiary both from their gas centers at the stores which are sensitive to changes in gas prices and simply additional consumer spending power from more discretionary income on the part of the consumer  COST reported solid November comp s again  Whether the stock has fully discounted all this remains to be seen  Toll Brothers  TOL  preannounced stronger revenues in November and the stock is up 15  since  Housing probably wasn t wild about today s November payroll report  Housing in general has been mixed  TOL is a high end homebuilder so we get a look at the higher end of the market on Wednesday morning  December 10th ",2014-12-06,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-masking-decent-earnings-growth-for-rest-of-s-p-500-234842,234842
145935,367450,COST,The Color Of Oil,opinion,One of the great things about investing is the dynamic nature of the markets  which simply means the environment is always changing  Over the last few months  I have repeatedly written about my thinking with respect to how the equity market would perform  Also  we noted the price of crude would stay pretty much stagnant  Within this context  the other  interesting  part of markets is you will constantly be humbled and surprised at the way things might turn out  Now  admittedly  the last week was difficult for nearly equity owner  and especially if you were exposed to any portion of the oil complex It is no joy for myself to watch the market value of assets which I have selected for clients go down in price  especially if they trade at nowhere near levels which represent their intrinsic value  In that light  the pain was broad and deep in the Crude Oil complex  Nothing was spared  the largest integrated oil companies  big shell producers with great prospects in the best areas  or small independent producers with acreage in excellent locations as well  If you are a highly leveraged small indy  in some cases stock losses have been in the 80 90  range  Over the last three decades  if you owned oil stocks  the color of oil was black  and in your portfolio the end result was usually green  Could it be there has been a dynamic event which changes the appearance of oil so it now looks brown  with an unusually pungent odor which resembles feces  In this potentially new paradigm  long term equity owners of oil related stocks would have to get used to a new color in their portfolios  which would be red One of the slogans used for the holiday season is gift giving  In the financial markets  historically December is a time when all kinds of things happen which can affect the market price of assets  It is during this month when tax loss selling  hedge fund closings  fund liquidations  redemption  margin calls  investment bank risk managers closing losing positions  and of course  commodity funds selling underwater holdings  Clearly  there are a lot of reasons why institutions might liquidate which have nothing to do with the merit of an equity investment As support of this thesis  in the last few years the market has given some  gifts  to perceptive buyers which are not hard to forget  Two years ago  Hewlett Packard  NYSE HPQ   the largest computer company in the world  was priced to go out of business with a market price of  13 28 on December 28  2012  It currently sits at  38 01  Best Buy  NYSE BBY  was also lumped into this pile  trading at  11 51 on December 28  2012  Today  the big box retailer sells for  36 85  At the time  investors believed tablets sales would doom future PC prospects  Looks like they were wrong  Fortunately  over the years we have benefited from the gift giving season  and not those exchanged at Hanukkah and Christmas  Could it be this year the market is showing its generous side in the form of the oil complex The fundamental reasons for owning the oil complex have not changed one iota in the last few months  According to the long term outlooks of most large integrated oil companies  BP NYSE BP  Exxon  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Shell   the demand for energy will grow significantly through 2030  Oil currently accounts for nearly 75 95  of all transportation related inputs  depending on the kind of entity used  The largest growth in demand for these resources will come from Asia  specifically China and India  On a percentage basis  both countries are well below mature countries in terms of the percentage of population which owns and drives automobiles  China recently claimed the number one spot in the world for yearly car sales  The largest integrated oil companies have fields which possess thirty to fifty years worth of oil  and they take five and 10 years to fully construct and develop ways to produce the black stuff  Commodity prices are historically volatile  although to watch an asset lose 50  of its value in six months like oil is certainly  interesting   Still  the next time you want to drive somewhere and have no gas in the car  think about what the alternative could be  Electric cars  Maybe 30 years from now  maybe  and it is a big maybe  a big  big  big maybe  Good luck with that Elan  In the meantime  if you are long term investor and have more than a 1 2 year time horizon  if oil is not interesting now  when might it be  It can certainly go down into 2015 and you have to be prepared for that possibility  Still  I would imagine the color of oil is still black  and yes  green Elsewhere in the market this week  Verizon  NYSE VZ  and AT T  NYSE T  warned about higher subscriber growth because of competition from T Mobile  NYSE TMUS   McDonald s  NYSE MCD  reported its worst same store sales number in 11 years  down 4 6   In Macau  the anti corruption crackdown has continued to hurt casinos overseas with revenues down nearly 20  in both November and October  Some analysts view this as a completely different environment for the gaming operators and potentially a massive shift in the way the market may function from a long term perspective  You have to wonder if that might be another gift by a truly hospitable market On two opposite sides of the spectrum in retail  Costco  NASDAQ COST  reported a very good number and raised its estimates for 2015  Conn s got drilled after reporting weaker numbers as it seems the promise to pay is always easier than actually forking out the cashola ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  reported its capital expenditures for 2015 will be twenty percent lower than they originally forecast  Rosneft  MCX ROSN  announced a huge deal with India to supply oil and gas for the next ten years after discovering oil with Exxon in the first well they drilled in the Arctic Ocean in late September  Naturally  Warren Buffett is seeking to profit from the decline in energy complex prices  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa announced yesterday the purchase of a logistics and distribution entity which services the oil and specialty chemical industries  Maybe an early gift for Berkshire shareholders as well Turning to fantasy land  after waiting an entire year to do absolutely nothing  our hard working politicians passed a  1 1 trillion dollar budget which most of the members did not have the time to read  Along those lines  I find it interesting Vladimir Putin is being pummeled in the press for the Russian excursion in the Crimea and now Ukraine  which along with falling oil prices have crushed the value of the ruble  up to nearly 60 rubles per dollar Yet glad Vlad tries to make lemonade from lemons by signing the two most important countries in the globe

145936,367451,COST,Kraft  A Pullback Buy Stock,opinion,"The market has been bouncing around in a wide range    at least as far as the indexes go  But under the radar  many stocks have been breaking out  In this type of market you need to look at two possible entry points  Yes  there are those that will not buy strength    only those stocks that show strength holding at support and reversing  And that s fine  but they run the risk of missing a big move  Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST  was one of those stock on my list this week  My notes from Saturday say it is a buy on clearing 146  It did that Tuesday and did not give much back Wednesday  It sits up 6 3  from the buy trigger as I write this  A big missed opportunity if you were waiting for it to pullback and hold at support at 137 
Another I found and marked as a pullback buy candidate is heading down the same path  I had marked Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KRFT  as a buy on a pullback to 64  It was trending lower in a bull flag but had the RSI holding up well  But then Monday came and it moved lower  under the 20 day SMA for the first time in two weeks  But it never touched 64  so no trigger  The thing is  though  that it gives off another buy signal if it manages to break above 67 40 

This is hard for some to understand  Why would I be willing to buy it at 64 and at 67 40  but not in between  It comes down to reward versus risk  As it shows strength at 64 and reverses there is a natural stop to buy against  As it moves away from that level the downside risk that it returns  there  grows bigger to the point that it is commensurate with the upside reward to the next resistance level at 67 40  But when it gets over that 67 40 level  there is a new stop to trade against as it clears resistance  Each one risks a different amount of price  so the sizing should be different 
That s not the only way to trade this  Some would be comfortable when it reversed Monday  buying Tuesday on an upward price move  using Monday s low as a stop  That s fine  too  There are infinite methods of trading  Find one that suits your risk tolerance and stick with it ",2015-02-04,Gregory W.

145937,367452,COST,Do You Really Want To Own The Best Performing Stocks Of Every Year ,opinion,"Earlier this week  I posted on Stocktwits that boring businesses could have incredibly successful stock stories  I gave an example of Costco  NASDAQ COST   which is up 2000  in the past 20 years  One of the comments on my tweet was    So buy   hold could be a winning strategy    My reply at the time   sure  if u pick the right stocks and don t mind 50  to 80  drawdowns along the way 

Now  it is a good time to expand on my answer  Yes  buy and hold could be very lucrative  but only if you hold your winners and have an exit strategy  All stocks are price cyclical  All trend eventually end  Yes  there are stocks like Costco  which keep bouncing and hitting all time highs  but the majority of today s big winners won t recover from their deep pullbacks 

Buy and hold forever rarely works  The market graveyard is full of trends that last only a few quarters 

Yelp  NYSE YELP  went from 20 to 100 in 2013  then it declined 50   They just hit new 52wk lows last week 

GoPro Inc  NASDAQ GPRO  went from 30 to 100 in about 3 months last year  It is down 50  from its highs 

LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  reached new all time highs yesterday  It is up about 200  since its opening print in 2011  but it had a 40  pullback along the way  Not an easy stock to hold 

Pandora Media Inc  NYSE P  went from 10 to 37 in 2013   early 2014  Today  it is trading around  15 

The biggest winners tend to be very volatile and they are not for the faint of heart  It is typical for story momentum stocks to go up several hundred   in a short period of time and then give back  50  of their move 

Not every hot stock today will turn into a long term winner  Most will turn out to be short term fads  With some basic risk management skills  you could still make a lot of money in them  We don t know how long a trend will last  but we know when it starts and when it is over for the time frame we operate in  This is all we need to know

Well it appears that Costco s stock price is about to signal a new bull run  You can see in the simple chart above that after a move higher from the long consolidation in 2010 it rose to a peak around Thanksgiving last year  This started a few months after the broad market began higher in 2009  Since then it pulled back and moved sideways  Do you know anything else that ran higher from 2010 and leveled to start the first several months of the year  Maybe the S P 500  With the S P 500 moving higher again a couple of months ago it has been without Costco and lo and behold pundits  investors and traders alike have been nervous about the move higher  But with about the same lag in Costco to follow the S P 500 as before  Costco is showing signs of life  The close in detail below gives the story  Since December the price action has built a rounded bottom and is moving back higher  approaching the highs of the consolidation between 118 50 and 119  A move over 119 would confirm a reversal back higher  and for me  a healthier bull market environment  I started a bit early today at 117 55 ",2014-07-16,Gregory W.

Atwood Oceanics is consolidating the move higher off of the double bottom near 45  After a shallow pullback it turned higher Friday again  but met resistance  The Relative Strength Index  RSI  is bullish and rising and the MACD is moving up  both supporting more upward price action 
Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  Baidu  is pressing on support at 147  this time from a lower high  Some may call it a complex Head and Shoulders  but what ever it is a break lower is bearish  The RSI turning down again prior to breaking the mid line and the MACD failing to cross up and moving back lower seal the deal for the set up 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc  BRKa Berkshire Hathaway broke a symmetrical triangle lower to start February  but that failed and it moved up to consolidation between 122 50 and 125  The RSI is pulling back but bullish while the MACD is falling  Watch for a break of consolidation 
Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST Costco is continuing lower toward the prior support area at 110  The RSI is bearish and falling while the MACD is also moving lower  both supporting the continued downside case 
Unilever  ULVR LSE Unilever broke higher in a very quick move two weeks ago  It retraced 20  of that move last week as the RSI fell and the MACD topped and started to roll down  It has gaps to fill below and is extended from the Simple Moving Averages  SMA   something that it has not been able to sustain for long in the past 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Saturday which  moving into next week sees the equity markets continuing to look weak  Elsewhere look for Gold to move higher with Crude Oil in the short term  The US Dollar Index and US Treasuries are also biased to the upside with a chance that treasuries just churn their wheels sideways  The Shanghai Composite is poised to consolidate in the downtrend while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in the short run after a strong move higher  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  despite the moves lower last week  Their charts do not share the upside optimism in the short run with the SPY the strongest pulling back near support  the IWM next at support but weak and the QQQ looking lower in the short run  The longer view is similar with the SPY the strongest and consolidating while the IWM is at support and the QQQ moving lower  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week  and trad em well

146005,367520,COST,Costco  Sales And Profit Growth Expected To Increase,opinion,"Costco Wholesale Corp    NASDAQ COST  is set to report FQ3 2014 earnings before the market opens on Thursday  May 29th  Costco is the largest members only warehouse shopping club in the United States  This quarter Wall Street is expecting Costco to pick up its pace of profit growth to 5  on a year over year basis  The past 3 earnings reports have been weak from Costco with EPS growing 1  for two periods before the warehouse club posted a particularly poor quarter in March with earnings dropping 5  compared to the same period 1 year prior  Wall Street also expects a considerable sales increase of nearly 7  this quarter  Here s what investors are expecting from Costco on Thursday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Costco to report  1 09 EPS and  25 685B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 20 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 09 EPS and  25 621B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Costco to report in ine with Wall Street on EPS while missing sales estimates by  64 million 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly  it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB  Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a smaller differential than usual between expectations from the two groups 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 02 to  1 13 per share and from  25 300B to  25 906B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a moderate range of estimates for Costco s earnings and a smaller range of estimates on revenue 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrow range of estimates signals more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from  1 14 to  1 09 while the Estimize consensus declined from  1 13 to  1 09  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus dropped before rising from a low of  25 641B to  25 685B while the Estimize consensus gradually decreased across the period from  25 839B to  25 621B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a leading indicator  Here we see flat EPS expectations and a rising Wall Street consensus while the Estimize consensus has been faltering at the end of the quarter 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is BradHewitt91 who projects  1 07 EPS and  25 470B in revenue  BradHewitt91 is ranked 12th overall among over 4 500 contributing analysts  This season BradHewitt91 has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue an impressive 62  and 58  of the time respectively throughout 139 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case BradHewitt91 is making a bearish call expecting Costco to miss the Estimize consensus on both EPS and revenue 
This quarter both the Estimize community and Wall Street are expecting a relatively strong period from Costco compared to the company s other recent earnings reports  However  contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform only expect Costco to report in line with Wall Street on EPS and come up  64 million shy on sales ",2014-05-29,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/costco:-sales-and-profit-growth-expected-to-increase-214298,214298

146048,367563,COST,The Biggest Myth About Taxes,opinion,Forget Manic Mondays  In the Wall Street Daily Nation  we celebrate Myth Busting Mondays  For the newbies in the group  each week I pick a widely held belief and use the Hammer of Truth to smash it into a billion little pieces  None have survived yet  But eventually  I expect to find a topic that can withstand the onslaught  Right now  though  it s time to tackle a politically charged topic   I know  The gall   But if you think politics and finance don t mix  you re sorely mistaken  The overlap is undeniable  Policy in Washington directly impacts profits on Wall Street  I mean  did you see what happened to the markets during the whole  Fiscal Cliff  debate  And what about healthcare stocks during every jot and tittle of the healthcare reform debate  Like I said  politics and finance do mix  With that in mind  let s dive right into dispelling the stubborn little myth that taxes don t influence behavior  Here s irrefutable proof that tax rates do  indeed  influence behavior  And lest you think I m about to go on a tirade against taxing the rich  I m going to start off by addressing the impact taxes have on everyday Americans  Say  Hello  to the 2   This has nothing to do with the Occupy Wall Street Movement  the 99  versus the 1    I m talking about the end to the 2  Social Security payroll tax holiday that occurred in January  Believe it or not  that little  extra  being taken out of everyone s paycheck is having a big impact  For instance  weekly retail sales data reveals deterioration in shopping activity in the New Year  Moreover  the latest Thomson Reuters University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment revealed that 32  of people with incomes below  75 000 reported a drop in pay   There is something going on   said Chris G  Christopher Jr   senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight   The payroll tax seems to be cutting into things   You mean taxes are influencing behavior  Mr  Christopher  Say it isn t so  In all seriousness  economists estimate the payroll tax increase could reduce GDP growth by half a percentage point in the first quarter  And with an economy that s only expected to grow 1  to 2  in the first half of the year  every half a percentage point counts  Give Me Lower Taxes  or Take My Passport On the upper end of the income bracket  higher tax rates keep prompting well known individuals to flee their home states and  in some cases  countries  France s richest man  Bernard Arnault  head of luxury goods company  LVMH  applied for a Belgian passport in the wake of his home country announcing a 75  tax rate on top earners  The list of other fleeing Frenchies includes Nicolas Sarkozy  Carla Bruni and Hollywood star  Gerard Depardieu  In the sports world  Tiger Woods admitted that he fled California in 1996 because of tax rates  And his competitor  Phil Mickelson  confessed that he s considering fleeing  too  Why  Because California voters approved Proposition 30  which raises the state income tax on top earners to 13 3   That s the highest in the land  Then there s U S  pop music legend  Tina Turner  She handed over her U S  passport to become a citizen of Switzerland  Granted  she s been living abroad since 1995  But the timing is awfully suspicious  Individuals who aren t fleeing are exhibiting tax avoidance behavior  too  Consider  In New York  fourth quarter home sales surged 29  to hit the highest level since 1987  The cause   Buyers rushed to finish deals before expected tax increases this year   according to Bloomberg  Even  Mr  Green  himself  Al Gore  couldn t resist the temptation to pocket more green  Anonymous sources report he expedited a deal to sell Current TV to Al Jazeera to avoid higher tax rates  Companies Hate Taxes  Too To be fair  individuals aren t the only ones responding to tax rate changes  Corporations are  too  Consider  Smith   Nephew  SNN  fired roughly 100 employees this month  citing the new medical device tax that went into effect as part of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act San Diego based company  Fallbrook Technologies  announced that it s relocating to Texas Wall Street s elite are packing up shop  too  According to the New York Post  private equity and hedge funds are relocating to Florida because of  New York s sky high city and state tax rates  Perhaps the broadest example of taxes influencing corporate behavior involves dividend payments  You ll recall  back in   I predicted the threat of higher dividend tax rates would bring about a special dividend payment bonanza  And it did  Special dividends last year hit a record  30 4 billion  Some companies  like Costco  COST   even borrowed money to fund the early payouts  Bottom line  At some point  taxation becomes excessive and definitely influences behavior  If you don t want to accept the most recent evidence  pick up a history book and get reacquainted with the motivations behind the American Revolutionary War  In fairness  I d love to conduct a similar analysis on the impact of spending cuts on behavior  But Washington has been slow to volunteer for that experiment  As far as the investment implications of today s myth busting  they couldn t be more straightforward  We need to think twice before investing in any sectors in jeopardy of unexpected and significant increases in taxes  After all  the more the government gets  the less that s left over for investors  And less profits are never good for share prices ,2013-02-11,Louis

146076,367591,COST,What To Expect Of The Markets In December,opinion, One must have a mind of winter     Wallace Stevens  Snow Man It s going to start getting a little more difficult soon  The market has now put in two weeks of rally  amounting to five percent in all  since the 1343 low of Friday the 16th  Despite the recent tradition of the last day of November being a struggle  with an even longer tradition of some odd price action  Friday managed to finish narrowly in the green and keep indices up on the week  In some ways it was the most impressive day of the week  But while Monday should be expected to see another leg up  due to its status of being the first trading day of the month  things might start to get tricky shortly afterwards  Politicians started taking their budget battle to the media during trading hours on Thursday  a sign that the main event should be coming to Broadway soon  The jobs report is next Friday  for better or worse  and after that we start to bump up against the calendar and the annual early mid December slump  Keep an eye on the ADP payrolls report on Wednesday  One topic that has been very much in the news of late is special dividends  The pretext for these goodies is to allow shareholders to evade paying potentially higher taxes on dividends  as most assume that the current 15  taxation rate for dividends will rise  Personally I doubt that dividends will be treated as ordinary income  but it looks like a safe bet that the rate will go up  at least for taxable income  Many dividends will continue to flow into retirement and institutional accounts that will still pay no tax  However  tax avoidance seems to be the driving theme behind the payouts  Long ago and far away  when I was first studying for my NASD Series 6 exam  one of the things that was emphasized as not kosher was the practice of  selling dividends   In other words  one does not recommend purchase of a stock or mutual fund about to go ex dividend  the cut off date for being entitled to a dividend  so that the buyer might collect it  because the price of the security will usually drop by about the same amount as the dividend  All the buyer will have done is to incur a taxable event  in effect paying a tax to get back part of the purchase  The case that stands out the most to me is Costco  COST   which has decided to pay a  7 special dividend  It isn t a case of speeding up the deployment of corporate cash  because the company borrowed all of the money to pay the dividend  When the stock goes ex dividend on December 10th  be assured it will fall by about  7  Why is the company in such a hurry to impose a taxable event on shareholders  I can tell you one group that is particularly going to benefit   management  In general  senior managers do not have unfettered license to sell stock  so long as they are working for the company  It is generally done in installments  called 10b 5 1 plans that allow corporate insiders to sell stock in fixed allotments at regular intervals  Rather than bore many of you with a lengthy discussion of insider selling  I will simply say that top managers are usually expected to hold onto the bulk of their stock until they leave the company  Charlie Munger  of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett right hand man fame  likes to say that to understand management  you have to understand how they are going to get paid  In this case  CEO James Sinegal  who has about 2 million shares  is going to get a  14 million payout at a 15  tax rate   all without having to sell a single share  As CEO  his shares are locked in for the long term anyway  but at 74  it isn t clear how much longer he cares to stay on  If he were to retire a year later  for example  then  7 of the gains on the stock he owns will have been paid at a lower rate  15   than whatever it goes up to  It s the same for all of the senior managers who own lots of stock  Sinegal being the largest holder  Forgive my not coming to the conclusion that these special dividends are selfless acts to benefit the widows and orphans  their funds wouldn t pay tax on the dividends anyway  so long as it s redistributed   The irony of it all is that the very same Charlie Munger sits on the Costco board of directors  and he has over 100 000 shares as of the last filing I could find  Charlie needs money like the desert needs sand   I certainly wasn t the only one to notice  either  hardly surprising in light of the size of the dividend and its unusual funding  After I d written the above  my attention was drawn late at night to an  Friday morning that took an even snarkier tone   Another notion with a touch of the surreal is remembering to be grateful sometimes for regulatory agencies  In the summer of 2008  the economy was in a recession and oil was over  140 a barrel  The cover story was  peak oil  and the regulatory motto was that the free market handles everything on its own  Now four years later  economic output is higher than it was then and so is the stock market  U S  oil prices  though  are trapped in a narrow trading range in the  80s  What about peak oil  Why hasn t it rallied as much as the stock market  when until recently every increase in equities was accompanied by a bigger one in oil  It isn t all because of Canadian tar sands  though increased North American supply is playing a role  Brent oil  which is what the rest of the world prices off of  is at  110 by comparison  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC  and UK regulatory watchdogs have recently been conducting intense investigations of potential price rigging during those halcyon days of  140 barrel  Oddly enough  the latest bouts of risk taking in equities have left energy futures sitting on the sidelines  That lack of speculation sure is hurting the economy  isn t it  That economy continues to muddle along  as seen in The Economic Beat below  Probably the most distinguishing feature of economic releases these days is that they are rarely as good or as bad as they appear to be  As more Sandy related data arrives  it could put pressure on the stock market  a good example being next Friday s jobs report  I wouldn t think of predicting it either way  but for what it s worth  consumer sentiment measures haven t been at all pessimistic  Between the storm and seasonal adjustment factors  though  the number could be a sloppy mess  The other side of Sandy s damage  of course  is the rebuild  and we could see market favorable data begin to emerge in the latter part of December  Throughout it all  we will toil in the shadow of the cliff  It appears as if the early make nice stage is near its end  and one should expect at most another week of pretend civility before the gloves start to come off and the accusations of moral turpitude  theft  treason  spousal abuse and lying about your golf score start to fly  The Economic Beat Another week of mixed data presented evidence for everyone  Consumer confidence rose to a four and a half year high of 73 7  but contrarians pointed out   correctly   that confidence peaks tend to presage downturns in the stock market  New orders for durable goods were better than expected  but personal income and spending data was disappointing  New home sales were less than expected  but pending home sales were better  The manufacturing sector data was everywhere  The Dallas  oil based  and Kansas City  agriculture  manufacturing indices reported negative numbers  but the Richmond Fed reported a strong increase  Durable goods orders were better than expected at no change  but excluding transportation were up 1 5   More importantly  business investment orders were up 1 7   It wasn t a barn burner  certainly  but it did trip up an element that had been loudly predicting a steeper down ramp into the end of the year from the fiscal cliff  The Chicago PMI reported its first above 50 number in three months  but it had an odd piece of theatre attached to its dissemination on CNBC  Pugnacious reporter Rick Santelli gleefully said that it looked like a  10 out of 10  piece of news to him  but in what looked to my eyes like a bit of stagecraft  had along a Chicago journalist to explain that it wasn t so good  especially due to the drop in new orders  The Chicago PMI is released privately to subscribers a few minutes before its public dissemination  and Santelli s reactions seemed less than spontaneous  to say the least  In any case  the drop in new orders wasn t from respondents saying that new orders were going out the window   the percentage of respondents saying orders were smaller actually declined   but from a shift out of the  higher  category to  same   GDP for the third quarter was revised strongly upwards  from 2 0  to 2 7   consensus was for 2 8    That isn t as good as it looked  given that it got a big boost from inventory and private spending was revised downwards  Look for the combination of Sandy and inventories to cut fourth quarter GDP by a significant amount  but a Sandy recovery and post cliff atmosphere could send GDP shooting right back up again in the first quarter of 2013  The latest  of surveys from the Fed concluded that  economic activity expanded at a measured pace in recent weeks   Homebuilder stocks had a little wind taken out of their sales when the September new home sales figure was revised sizably downward  from 389 000 annualized to 369 000  October was reported at 368 000  It would seem that the big lift off that many had attributed to the Fed s  QE infinity  announcement in September didn t materialize after all  Mortgage rates certainly fell in the wake of the Fed s action  but the real problem is that banks are still in lock down mode when it comes to residential lending  There were still plenty of write offs to go around in 2012  though conditions seemed to improve in the latter half  Home prices are steadily recovering  but at a modest pace that is still quite uneven  October personal income and spending numbers were soft  Personal income was unchanged  and spending declined  Commerce declined to provide a comprehensive estimate of the impact by Sandy  but its guess of about  18 billion in lost wages looks right to me  Since the aftermath lasted well into November  it probably won t be until December data is released in January that we see the recovery effects in the data  For example  retailers were in general commenting that although November sales got off to a slow start  they were pretty happy with the pace in the latter half of the month  November auto sales  by contrast    Looking abroad  European unemployment continued to worsen and German retail sales unexpectedly fell  while business confidence unexpectedly rose  in France as well   The silver lining to a German recession is that it may begin to put the spurs to the EU confronting its debt problems in a more realistic way  This week is the first week of the month and the usual heavyweight with economic data  The ISM manufacturing survey is out on Monday  and the November jobs report comes on Friday  In between we ll see auto sales Tuesday and on Wednesday  ADP payrolls followed by the ISM non manufacturing report  Other reports include October construction spending on Monday   probably depressed by Sandy   factory orders on Wednesday  mostly known from durable goods   and another week of claims data  They fell as expected last week  so analysts will be looking clues to normalcy in next Thursday s report  The jobs report should get the full impact of Sandy

less Dow Jones index did a little better  moving up a little over one percent in the same period  All of the improvement came in the last two days  as both indices fell 2  from Monday morning  when the ISM manufacturing survey hit  see below   to Wednesday morning before turning to rally back  Absent a surprise move in cliff negotiations  it will be a lot more difficult to pull off the same calm next week  A good news  bad news development from Friday morning was that the latest fiscal cliff press conference to discredit the other side during trading hours  in this case one involving Speaker Boehner  affected the markets for about ten minutes before prices recovered  in fact just as the conference finished  it must be said as well that the Speaker did not take a lower road in his remarks  which surely helped   The downside of the market s short lived reaction to the latest proclamation that the other fella has doomed us all is that politicians may feel the need to raise the rhetorical ante in consequence as we get closer to the deadline  I ll be surprised if the rhetoric doesn t get dialed up for the Sunday morning political talk shows  and then continues that way through the rest of the week  The tight trading range of the last two weeks is ripe for testing  As the media fills up with ever stronger assertions that a deal will or will not get done  it certainly isn t a comfortable time  In some ways  it reminds me of the uncertainty heading into the last weekend of Lehman Brothers  Most market pros felt at the time that some sort of conveyance would be done to either keep the firm on life support  or dispose of the body in a controlled fashion  rather than simply pushing it off the roof to see what would happen  The surprise of the actual outcome gained strength from the belief that Lehman s fate could be decided by a small group of government officials and corporate executives who could find a pragmatic solution without needing to resort to a lot of politicking  It didn t work out that way  of course  but it should have  There are big differences  One is that in September 2008  the economy was already in recession  though many were in denial about it   unemployment was rising  housing was crashing  and a Lehman salvage job would probably not have rallied the markets much  if at all  Since Lehman s equity would surely have been wiped out  it would hardly have made investors feel better about buying into the rest of the sector  Today  any half decent cliff deal or     even one that puts off many of the most contentious issues  all that is realistically possible with three weeks left in the year   would rally the markets  possibly quite sharply if sequestration is avoided  Another difference is that there is little maneuvering room for the Fed this time  After Lehman s crash  the Fed rescued AIG and moved to cut interest rates  The Dow fell 800 points in three days  then got nearly all of it back by the end of the week in the wake of the relief efforts  clearly the repercussions weren t immediately obvious   This time around  the surprise factor will be less  we already went through this in August of 2011   but the heavily extended Fed won t be able to do much about stopping the bleeding  The effects on the market could be quite transitory anyway  but every thinking person in the business is wondering if the Dow will have to fall another 800 points first so that politicians feel they have enough protective cover to act  for the good of the country  and hope their vote won t be used against them  Many Republicans who voted for TARP in 2008 found their vote held against them two years later by the Tea Party movement  It s a tricky calculation  If there is no deal by January 1st and massive layoff notices follow  though  it will be a lot less transitory effect than everyone had wished  My unscientific impression is that sentiment is growing on the Street for the possibility of a cliff jump   allowing for a  rescue  political script instead of the  sell out  version  That leaves many wondering why the VIX  fear  index  which measures the volatility of S P 500 index options  is so low  Why aren t more managers hedging against a meltdown  There are a couple of good reasons  One is that the next options expiration period is in two weeks  Since the prospect of both sides coming out in favor of total impasse with ten days still to go in the year  and just before Christmas  is more than a little remote  there isn t much point in buying December options to hedge against the cliff  The January option decision is trickier  To begin with  options decay with time  and short dated options decay the fastest  December 26th is probably the real time to start worrying  and there s a lot of premium in the 19 days until we get there  Why buy early  Then there s performance  The indices have been nearly impossible for fund managers to keep up with this year  If you were at all prudent and kept some cash against the possibility of a Greek default  or stupidly invested based on earnings rather than surprise central bank announcements  you are lagging the index along with about 80  of your peers  Buying a boatload of options and then watching them lose 75  of their value the second a deal gets announced isn t going to help the situation  so most managers who can buy options but don t do so regularly are going to wait until the last inning to buy some  The truth about the VIX is that it always starts to rise after the bad news has hit anyway  There s also the peculiarity of this year s calendar  The last trading day of the year  December 31st  is a Monday  The notion of a last weekend deal to avoid sequestration is more than a little plausible  which would translate into a big rally on the last day of the year and the possibility of a lot of option holders trying to dump them all at once  So despite the low VIX number  investors may not be quite as complacent as it seems  Is there a first mover advantage to special dividends  Last week I criticized the Costco  COST  payment as being more of a good deal for management  I was hardly alone in this  as most of the major business media covered the story in varying tones of skepticism   and sure enough the stock fell over  7 on its ex dividend date  However  if you bought the stock in a non taxable account in the days immediately following the announcement  in the  100  103 range  even  104 for a non taxable account   you d still have come out ahead  assuming you bought in enough quantity to overcome transaction costs  Special dividends continue to proliferate  It seems to me that most companies have been unable to duplicate Costco s feat of managing to keep a gain if you bought right away  making the taxable event worthwhile  I wonder what PT Barnum would say  The Economic Beat     That was Moodys com economist Mark Zandi s initial conclusion about the November jobs report  and it looks about right  The seasonally adjusted total of 146 000 non farm payroll additions handily beat expectations for something under 100 000  and was in line with the roughly 150K average of recent months  Things to like about the report included the household survey reporting a seasonally adjusted increase of 191 000 jobs  Coupled with a 350K decline in the civilian labor force  that translated into an unemployment rate of 7 7   the lowest since the crisis  7 8  in January 2009   the last pre crisis number of 6 1  is still far off   and of course lower than most of Europe  whose rates are headed in the opposite direction  The U 6 alternative rate also fell two tenths to 14 4  seasonally adjusted  13 9  unadjusted  both numbers being the lowest since December 2008  The ADP payrolls figure two days earlier was 118 000 new jobs  a little below consensus of 125 000  But the same Mark Zandi related on Wednesday that he and ADP had worked together to provide an estimate of a loss of 86 000 jobs from Hurricane Sandy  The Labor Department  though  found that survey response rates were  within normal ranges  and that Sandy  did not substantively impact  the data  even though construction jobs fell by 20K  It s something of a guess as to who is closer to the truth  Zandi also immediately concluded that that this month s data would be revised  and indeed the previous two months were revised for a net loss of 49K jobs  ending a string of positive revisions  The loss was mostly from the government sector  which reported a surprise additional 38 000 jobs lost in October  It s unusual to see a revision that large on the government side  Given the ensemble  it seems reasonable to conclude that BLS may have overestimated the reported number and underestimated the Sandy effect  The state data two weeks from now may give a clue  but for now it still translates into no change in the trend  Temp hiring increased for a second month in a row  and the weekly payroll index increased to 108 7  suggesting that personal income might have picked up around 0 3  as well in November  That the job market isn t robust  I hardly need tell you  and there were things to complain about in the report as well  Average weekly hours were unchanged  The number of additional people not in the labor force  2 4mm  over the last year is rising much faster than the number of non farm employees  1 3mm   Presumably they are not all working on farms somewhere  The participation rate fell two tenths to 63 6   and the employment population ratio fell a tenth to 58 7   still two tenths better than a year ago  The year on year growth increase in average weekly earnings is a meager 1 7   Weekly jobs claims also support the view that the employment trend is unchanged  The number has fallen sharply in the weeks since the Sandy spike  and yesterday s seasonally adjusted rate of 370K is back below the last pre Sandy figure of 372K  Though the former figure will probably be bumped up another 2K 3K next week  that would still leave it about even  The year on year claims declines are also very nearly back to trend  If you want to put a bullish spin on the economy  you could point to the steady employment growth and the ISM non manufacturing survey result of 54 7  not only better than expectations but   as I pointed out a couple days earlier    including a business activity rate of 61 2  the highest November reading since 2004  Construction spending reportedly rose by 1 4  in October  Though it s a number prone to big revisions  it seems reasonably certain that a good sized increase occurred  November car sales rose strongly  partly as a rebound from Sandy  though apart from Ford  F   the Japanese did better than the Americans at capturing the increase   A bearish posture would note that employment is a lagging indicator  That is so  but the trend usually isn t  The unemployment rate increased sharply at the end of 2007 and steadily rose all the way into the crisis  A bearish view would also cite the ISM manufacturing survey  which turned in a surprise below 50 reading of 49 5 on Monday  earlier estimates had been over 52  50 being neutral   Manufacturing is a much smaller part of the economy  unfortunately  making up just under 9  of employees  but it is the more cyclically sensitive sector  A study of the underlying data supports the view that the manufacturing number was not a distortion  that Sandy wasn t really to blame  and that the fiscal cliff is much more the problem  That would seem to be borne out by the data for October factory orders  whose increase of 0 8  was better than the expected decline of   0 1    As we get closer to the deadline with no resolution  people who sign off on spending are simply putting down their pens  The pause thesis is further borne out by the consumer sentiment index  which revealed a steep plunge in future expectations  pulling the headline number down to 74 5 from the previous 82 7  The current conditions component  though  had a much more mild decline to a still quite elevated 89 9  The ECRI Weekly Leading Index rose to 126 8 from 126 3  Besides the expected increase in gamesmanship next week  we will also see the November retail sales report on Thursday  While car sales definitely improved  the ex auto ex gas number is tougher to handicap  both because of the effects of Sandy  and from the noticeable spreading out of retail promotions in the wake of Thanksgiving  The industrial production number on Friday will face the cross currents of production rebounding from Sandy and recoiling from the cliff  The Fed s monetary policy meeting is next week  and the FOMC will announce its latest assessment on Wednesday at 12 30  with forecasts to follow at 2 30  While these things always rattle the tape for an hour or day  I don t expect the markets to see anything shocking enough to react for long  Some additional Treasury bond buying to offset Operation Twist is more or less expected  and there isn t much reason to suppose a dramatic change is in the offing   or that the additional buying will have much effect  What we really need is first the cliff resolution  then a European resolution  The latter s central bank  the ECB  cut its economic forecasts for 2012 and 2013 on Thursday  From the wonk point of view  the most interesting data may come Tuesday in the form of the monthly trade report and wholesales sales and inventories  A trade decline may provide some further ammunition for foes of jumping off the cliff  but one must measure the reality of the numbers versus Schopenhauer s old admonition that  against stupidity  the gods themselves contend in vain   The EU has a council meeting on Thursday and Friday  Keep your fingers crossed ,2012-12-08,Kevin

146090,367605,COST,What Next For Neuralstem ,opinion,Shares of Neuralstem Inc   NYSE  CUR  have begun to retreat from their explosive September rally  which gave CUR shareholders gains exceeding 125  in less than a month  which overcompensated for the crash in share prices halfway through August  While Neuralstem s overall value has been making progress  meaning that the company has been appreciating in value this year   On Thursday  the company  has been approved to commence a clinical trial to treat motor deficits due to ischemic stroke with its spinal cord stem cells  NSI 566  at BaYi Brain Hospital  in Beijing  China  through its subsidiary  Neuralstem China  causing a bit more volume than usual  but trading activity had definitely been drying up Unfortunately  the unlucky shareholders of CUR have been pummeled by share dilution  August s  35  drop can be largely explained by a public offering of 6 million common shares  Recent retreats from the 52 week high of  1 96 share can be mostly explained by a  7 million offering by Neuralstem at  1 share   announced on the same day that the new top was made  When are we going to see tighter controls on the total pool of outstanding shares That answer can be found on Neuralstem s balance sheet  With only  2 5 million in cash  and a substantial amount    1 5 million  is short term liabilities  we can infer that Neuralstem is barely scraping by on its current budget  In its current stage  Neuralstem has no source of revenue other than share dilution and runs a quarterly deficit of   2 4 million  or about  10 million per year   The total number of shares has increased about 11  in Q2 2012 versus Q2 2011  which implies that given the current rate shareholders would have to see at least 11  appreciation in CUR to break even while providing the company it s only source of revenue  Why would anyone be buying a company with such a proportionally high cash burn rate anyway Neuralstem  like many other young biotechnology companies  is basically a lottery ticket where the odds aren t actually known  CUR  specifically  is a lottery ticket for a  small  chance of winning a slice of the future in stem cell therapies  Since the field of stem cell therapy is brand new  and even newer to the United States due to political barriers   it s really tough for anyone to guess what s coming next  Biotech stocks were difficult enough to predict already   can we even gauge how much a fledgling stem cell company like CUR could be worth at this point  The obvious answer is no   we can t confidently determine what a stem cell therapy project is worth until we see similar examples that have already hit the market Even if a stem cell therapy was targeting a well known therapeutic market  highly innovative therapies tend to bring surprises once they are set free in the healthcare industry  A great example to bring up is Dendreon  NASDAQ  DNDN   and it s immune system based prostate cancer therapy Provenge  Provenge was  and is  an extremely novel and high tech approach to tumor eradication that seemed ready to revolutionize medicine itself and make DNDN shareholders an absolute killing in the process  some early estimates placed Provenge s expected revenue ten or more times its current value  Sadly  Provenge ended up an unprofitable treatment that Dendreon is now trying to save through cost cutting measures  The takeaway lesson is that it s nearly impossible to quantify the sales potential of a truly revolutionary product without making some errors along the way  I  d argue that we can gauge Neuralstem s ballpark potential  based solely on its intentions to treat ALS with stem cells  but since the company is exploring alternative uses for  NSI 566  we have no idea where CUR is going yet As mentioned before  Neuralstem s main therapeutic target is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  ALS  also known as  Lou Gehrig s Disease    The disease comes from the unavoidable destruction of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain  which continues to compromise a patient s ability to control the body and eventually leads to death  One FDA approved compound known as riluzole can slow the progress of ALS considerably  but does not prevent the eventual degeneration of motor neurons  The French pharmaceutical giant  and creator of riluzole Sanofi Aventis  NYSE  SNY  is estimated to generate around  50 million year in US sales  according to a quote by analyst Eric Schmidt of Cowen   Co   The same Businessweek article that quoted the  50 million year estimate for Sanofi s riluzole also discussed Biogen Idec  NASDAQ  BIIB  and its phase III mitochondria stimulating ALS drug called  Dexpramipexole   Analyst Eric Schmidt made a  1 billion year estimate on Dexpramipexole s market potential upon FDA approval  which either implies a very expensive price for future ALS treatment or greater incidence of the disease  Still  we can see that Neuralstem s current total worth of about  70 million is a fraction  perhaps 1 10  or less  of its intrinsic future value given acceptance of three big conditions 1   Neuralstem s NSI 566 neural stem cells can actually cure ALS  or completely stop its progression  This means that they work well enough to give statistically significant improvements in patient outcome when it undergoes phase II III clinical trials 2   ALS incidence continues  something around 5 000 new cases each year   and the  1 billion year estimate was somewhat accurate for the ALS drug market in a few years3   NSI 566 is superior or at least highly competitive in both efficacy and cost efficiency compared to dexpramipexole and other future competitors  so that it will have acceptable market penetrationIf I bet against the overwhelming odds and say that Neuralstem is going to meet all these conditions down the road  and generate something like  700 million year in the process  CUR s future gains in the market will far exceed the erosion that the company is causing through constant share dilutions Still  it s far more likely the CUR will stagnate for many years   much like a zombie  Many biotech companies can simply survive on useless data releases that show no real signs of progress  which can still trigger a large jump in the stock price on nothing but hope   Subsequent share dilutions can essentially  harvest  the value added by these rallies overnight  giving the company revenue that can be used to continue operations I am not implying the Neuralstem dilutes its shares out of anything but necessity  but investors should keep their eyes open  If a company actively dilutes its shares on the rallies  make sure that the extra money  out of your pocket  is being actively used for progression  Until now  Neuralstem has been doing that ,2012-10-02,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-next-for-neuralstem-138422,138422
