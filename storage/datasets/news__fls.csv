Its acquisition of the technology business of M Modal is likely to strengthen the Health Information Systems business in the months ahead  Also  the company s policy of rewarding shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks works in its favor  
For 2019  the company lowered earnings projections from  10 45  10 90 to  9 25  9 75 per share  with organic sales expected to increase 1 2   down from the earlier projection of 1 4   Foreign currency translation is predicted to adversely influence sales by 1   Also  rising costs and restructuring charges might become concerns for 3M

12596,234111,FLS,Flowserve  FLS  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Flowserve  FLS   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Flowserve currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for FLS that show why this company that makes pumps  valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For FLS  shares are up 0 59  over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing   General Industrial industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 78  compares favorably with the industry s 1 97  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Flowserve have risen 6 75   and are up 27 51  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 4 14  and 9 82   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to FLS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  FLS is currently averaging 755 711 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with FLS 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost FLS s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 19 to  2 20 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that FLS is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Flowserve on your short list ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/flowserve-fls-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200439850,200439850

12670,234185,FLS,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Chart Industries  Dover  Flowserve  AZZ And Manitowoc,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 19  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Chart Industries Inc    NASDAQ GTLS    Dover Corp    NYSE DOV    Flowserve Corp    NYSE FLS    AZZ Inc    NYSE AZZ   and The Manitowoc Co Inc    NYSE MTW   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Picks on Strong Industrial ProductionU S  industrial production recorded its highest gain in May since December 2018  Most importantly  U S  manufacturing output registered its first monthly gain of 2019  A strong and broad based gain in U S  factory output provided some respite to concern that the manufacturing sector is cooling in the face of a lingering trade war with China and slowdown in the global economy Moreover  capacity utilization edged up in overall industrial production and the manufacturing sector  indicating higher industrial activities  At this stage  it will be prudent to invest in manufacturing stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential Robust Industrial Production Data in MayOn Jun 14  the Federal Reserve reported that U S  industrial production increased by 0 4  in May  highest in six months  The figure was also above the consensus estimate of growth of 0 2   In April  industrial production contracted by 0 4   Industrial Production rose 2  year over year in May Across the board  all major market groups  such as  consumer goods  business equipment  nonindustrial supplies  construction and materials rose 0 5   0 2   0 4   0 2  and 0 3   respectively  Sector wise  manufacturing  mining and utilities grew 0 2   0 1  and 2 1   respectively Overall capacity utilization was 78 1  in May compared with 77 9  in April  However  capacity utilization is still 1 7  below the average figure of 79 8  for the 1972 2018 period  This indicates that a solid ground for growth of industrial production still exists without affecting inflation  This is a key metric for the Fed to consider while taking decisions on interest rate Manufacturing Output Returns to Growth TrajectoryThe most important inference from the industrial production data of May is the rebound of U S  manufacturing sector  This sector registered growth of 0 2   marking its first monthly gain in 2019  In January and February  U S  manufacturing declined by 0 6   In March  this sector remained unchanged only to decline again in April by 0 5  In May  solid 2 4  growth of motor vehicles and parts more than offset 1 9  decline in primary metals and 0 1  drop in fabricated metals  Light truck assemblies increased to 8 43 million from 7 84 million in April  Auto assemblies grew to 2 56 million from 2 44 million in April  Capacity utilization of manufacturing sector also edged up to 75 7  from 75 6  in the previous month  However  the figure still 2 6  behind its average 78 3  for the period 1972 2018 Notably  the manufacturing sector constituted nearly 12  of U S  GDP  A weak ISM manufacturing index for May and tepid industrial production data of China in May  which fell to its 17 year low level  compelled several economists to consider that manufacturing activities are slowing globally  which is affecting U S  industrial products  However  the industrial production data for May eased the concerns to some extent Our Top Picks  Considering the above mentioned factors  we narrowed down our search to five manufacturing stocks with a strong growth potential  Each of these stocks carry either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks here The chart below shows price performance of our five picks year to date Chart Industries Inc

12678,234193,FLS,  Tech Wreck  Makes For Rough Start To June,opinion,"As if the trade conflict and economic slowdown concerns weren t enough  the market can now also worry about regulatory measures against the tech giants that led most of this bull market 
	Of course  such fears are nothing new  These names are constantly targeted by those looking to break them up or punish them for privacy issues 
	However  now we have reports that the Justice Department is looking at Google and the FTC is watching Facebook  NASDAQ FB  
	The result was one of those  tech wreck  sessions that we get from time to time 
	The NASDAQ plunged on Monday by 1 61   or about 120 points  to 7333 02  The index dropped 8  in May and has lost ground for four straight weeks 
	The news took a big bite out of the FAANGs  with Facebook leading the way lower by sliding 7 5   Also  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  dipped 6 1  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  was off 4 6  
	But it wasn t all doom and gloom on Monday  The major indices fought back against the fear of regulation as well as soft reports for manufacturing and construction spending  They came off their lows by the close  even the NASDAQ came back from a loss of 2  at one point 
	The S P slipped only 0 28  to 2744 45  But the most impressive performance came from the Dow  which recovered from another triple digit loss to come all the way back and gain 0 02   or less than 5 points  to 24 819 78 
	That s nothing to write home about  but remember that this index has dropped for six straight weeks now and was off by more than 6  in May  Every little bit is appreciated 
	We also received more tough talk on trade from China over the weekend  but the market seemed much more interested in technology  It knows that the best chance for any real news on this issue probably won t come until the G 20 meeting later this month  and that s IF the U S  and China decide to get together 
	In the meantime  investors may want to get ready for a bumpy ride  Today s Portfolio Highlights 
	Marijuana Innovators  You ve undoubtedly heard the old saying that the people who really got rich during the Gold Rush were the ones selling the shovels to the miners  Well  Dave has found a company that goes right along with that idea  Greenlane Holdings  GNLN  sells accessory products that help customers enjoy marijuana products  In other words  they don t deal in the cultivation  distribution or sale of the plant itself  Instead  the editor believes that GNLN has solved two of the bigger problems facing the industry  healthy ingestion  THC extracts  and responsible packaging  child proof containers that comply with government regulations   Dave thinks the company has both of these areas covered  which was why he added GNLN on Monday  Read the complete commentary for a lot more on this pick 
	Home Run Investor  Despite the weakness of the market  Brian Bolan wants to get the portfolio back up to around 10 to 11 names  The service was down to 8 after a bevy of recent selling to protect returns  Therefore  the editor picked up Myers Industries  MYE  on Monday  which is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  maker of plastics and rubber for consumer products  The company has a great history of meeting or beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In fact  it hasn t missed in more than a year and a half  Earnings estimates aren t moving much because analysts are cautious in the current environment  so Brian is using that hesitancy to buy MYE on the dip in preparation for a future uptrend  Read the full write up for more Black Box Trader  This week s adjustment replaced half of the portfolio  The positions that were sold include

	This was going to be the day when the U S  imposed a 5  tariff on Mexican imports  but instead it turned out to be a continuation of last week s epic rally 
	Late Friday  President Trump Tweeted that a deal had been struck with our southern neighbors and the threatened tariffs would be suspended 
	The news gave the major indices permission to add onto last week s gains  which just so happened to be the best week of 2019 so far 
	Tech rallied again and pushed the NASDAQ out front with a surge of 1 05   or about 81 points  to 7823 17  The S P briefly recaptured 2900 on Monday  but settled with a gain of 0 47  to 2886 73 
	Remember that the latter index took back 2800 from May s pullback as recently as last Tuesday  In other words  it moved approximately 1000 points into the green in about a week  which underscores the strong start to June  The Dow is back above 26 000 and has its longest winning run in more than a year after rising 0 30   or about 79 points  to 26 062 68 
	The rally ran out of considerable steam by the closing bell  perhaps because a resolution with Mexico was expected after a couple days of positive meetings 
	Nonetheless  the Dow still has 6 straight days in the green  while the S P and NASDAQ have 5 consecutive days on the plus side 
	The major indices each jumped approximately 4  or more last week   In fact  the Dow broke its 6 week losing streak by soaring more than 1 100 points  or 4 7     
	In addition to trade  the market continues to bask in Friday s soft jobs report  Investors consider it another reason for the Fed to cut rates later this year  especially after the Fed Chair stated that they would do whatever is  appropriate  to keep the good times going 
	And it was also fun and bullish to see a couple of big mergers this Monday  Raytheon  NYSE RTN  and United Technologies  NYSE UTX  agreed to an all stock merger  while salesforce com will be acquiring Tableau Software

12680,234195,FLS,Industrial Production Hits 6 Month High In May  5 Top Picks ,opinion,U S  industrial production recorded its highest gain in May since December 2018  Most importantly  U S  manufacturing output registered its first monthly gain of 2019  A strong and broad based gain in U S  factory output provided some respite to concern that the manufacturing sector is cooling in the face of a lingering trade war with China and slowdown in the global economy Moreover  capacity utilization edged up in overall industrial production and the manufacturing sector  indicating higher industrial activities  At this stage  it will be prudent to invest in manufacturing stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential Robust Industrial Production Data in MayOn Jun 14  the Federal Reserve reported that U S  industrial production increased by 0 4  in May  highest in six months  The figure was also above the consensus estimate of growth of 0 2   In April  industrial production contracted by 0 4   Industrial Production rose 2  year over year in May Across the board  all major market groups  such as  consumer goods  business equipment  nonindustrial supplies  construction and materials rose 0 5   0 2   0 4   0 2  and 0 3   respectively  Sector wise  manufacturing  mining and utilities grew 0 2   0 1  and 2 1   respectively Overall capacity utilization was 78 1  in May compared with 77 9  in April  However  capacity utilization is still 1 7  below the average figure of 79 8  for the 1972 2018 period  This indicates that a solid ground for growth of industrial production still exists without affecting inflation  This is a key metric for the Fed to consider while taking decisions on interest rate Manufacturing Output Returns to Growth TrajectoryThe most important inference from the industrial production data of May is the rebound of U S  manufacturing sector  This sector registered growth of 0 2   marking its first monthly gain in 2019  In January and February  U S  manufacturing declined by 0 6   In March  this sector remained unchanged only to decline again in April by 0 5  In May  solid 2 4  growth of motor vehicles and parts more than offset 1 9  decline in primary metals and 0 1  drop in fabricated metals  Light truck assemblies increased to 8 43 million from 7 84 million in April  Auto assemblies grew to 2 56 million from 2 44 million in April  Capacity utilization of manufacturing sector also edged up to 75 7  from 75 6  in the previous month  However  the figure still 2 6  behind its average 78 3  for the period 1972 2018 Notably  the manufacturing sector constituted nearly 12  of U S  GDP  A weak ISM manufacturing index for May and tepid industrial production data of China in May  which fell to its 17 year low level  compelled several economists to consider that manufacturing activities are slowing globally  which is affecting U S  industrial products  However  the industrial production data for May eased the concerns to some extent Our Top Picks  Considering the above mentioned factors  we narrowed down our search to five manufacturing stocks with a strong growth potential  Each of these stocks carry either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see  The chart below shows price performance of our five picks year to date Chart Industries Inc    NASDAQ GTLS   manufactures and

12696,234211,FLS,Flowserve  FLS  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Flowserve  FLS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This company that makes pumps  valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 34 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 9  
Revenues are expected to be  943 02 million  up 2 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Flowserve 
For Flowserve  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Flowserve will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Flowserve would post earnings of  0 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 58  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Flowserve doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/flowserve-fls-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200410999,200410999

12732,234247,FLS,NPO Or FLS  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Manufacturing   General Industrial sector have probably already heard of EnPro Industries  NPO  and Flowserve  FLS   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
EnPro Industries and Flowserve are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that NPO is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
NPO currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 17  while FLS has a forward P E of 26 11  We also note that NPO has a PEG ratio of 1 14  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  FLS currently has a PEG ratio of 1 51 
Another notable valuation metric for NPO is its P B ratio of 1 49  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  FLS has a P B of 3 64 
These metrics  and several others  help NPO earn a Value grade of B  while FLS has been given a Value grade of C 
NPO has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than FLS  so it seems like value investors will conclude that NPO is the superior option right now ",2018-12-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/npo-or-fls-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200366669,200366669

 What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead Other FactorsPlus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In just the past 60 days alone 11 estimates have gone higher  compared to none lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if FLS stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development  You can see Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2018-12-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/flowserve-sees-hammer-chart-pattern-time-to-buy-200371434,200371434

12767,234282,FLS,Flowserve  FLS  Is Up 3 49  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Flowserve  FLS   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Flowserve currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if FLS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company that makes pumps  valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For FLS  shares are up 3 49  over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing   General Industrial industry is up 1 03  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 05  compares favorably with the industry s 5 03  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Flowserve have increased 8 4  over the past quarter  and have gained 25 58  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 3 85  and 9 57   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to FLS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  FLS is currently averaging 797 237 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with FLS 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost FLS s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 14 to  2 19 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that FLS is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Flowserve on your short list ",2019-06-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/flowserve-fls-is-up-349-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200435233,200435233

UnitedHealth s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry over the last three months  down  2 0  vs   2 9    UnitedHealth Group yet again delivered a positive earnings surprise with first quarter bottom line beating estimates and increasing year over year on higher revenues and membership growth  
Additionally  each of the company s business delivered double digit earnings growth  The Zacks analyst likes its robust Government business and continued strong performance at Optum  which are together driving long term growth  Its international business and strong capital position driving business investment are the other positives  
The company has been witnessing an increase in membership over the past many years  It again lifted its 2018 earnings guidance  buoying optimism among investors in the stock  However  membership loss in its fee based commercial as well as Brazilian businesses will contract the overall membership growth for UnitedHealth Group  Additionally  higher medical care ratio raises concern

Shares of Buy rated Netflix have increased  140 5  over the last year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry s gain of  26 6  during the same period  Netflix s first quarter results benefited from its robust library of original content that helped in expanding international subscriber base  
The company s efforts to attract viewers through investments in regional programming resulted in better than expected net addition of subscribers  Increase in paid membership despite a rise in subscription charges shows its competitive edge  Netflix now has 125 million subscribers globally  
The Zacks analyst thinks continuing subscriber additions and expanding content portfolio are the key catalysts that will help Netflix to sustain growth going forward  However  increasing market spend and higher investments on original acquired content will continue to hurt profitability  at least in the near term  Also  saturation in the domestic market poses concern 
 You can   
Caterpillar s shares have gained  64  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Construction and Mining industry which has increased  61 5  over the same period  Backed by strong order rates  lean dealer inventories and strong backlog  Caterpillar projects EPS in  8 25  9 25 range for 2018  a 27  year over year rise at the mid point  
The Construction segment will benefit from continued demand improvement in North American residential  non residential and infrastructure markets  Rising commodity prices will drive Resource Industries and Energy   Transportation s revenues  Ongoing cost cutting efforts and additional investments in expanded offerings and services will drive growth

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16 67   A quarter ago  it was expected that this company that makes pumps  valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries would post earnings of  0 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 22  delivering a surprise of  35 29

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Flowserve shares have added about 14 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3 1  
What s Next for Flowserve 
While Flowserve has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

You can see 
Buy ranked NextEra s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry over the last year  the stock is up  23 9  vs   3 3  decline for the industry   NextEra Energy s investment to strengthen its infrastructure and ongoing capital projects  when completed  will help it serve its expanding customer base more efficiently  
The Zacks analyst likes the company s focus on clean energy  which has helped it lower emission levels and its use of new technology  which has saved on energy bills for its customers  The natural gas pipelines  which came online in first half of 2017  are expected to boost its performance  
However  the company s nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal  state and other regulations  Despite investments made to strengthen its infrastructure the unpredictable nature of natural disaster could derail normal operation and impact profitability 
 You can   
Shares of Buy ranked Danaher have gained  14 4  over the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has declined  11 9  over the same period  Danaher has an excellent earnings history over the trailing four quarters  beating estimates all through  
The Zacks analyst is optimistic about the company s core revenue and earnings growth  on the back of improving order trends and rising healthcare spending  Its recent acquisitions   Pall and Cepheid   are proving to be strong profit churners  and will boost top line growth as they become a part of the company s core revenues  
This apart  the company s continuous introduction of products enables it to penetrate new markets and gain competitive edge in existing ones  However  slowdown in the company s academic business in Europe and prolonged sluggishness in the Dental business might restrict growth  going forward  Moreover  weakness in industrial markets and stiff competition may also hurt the company s financials 
 You can   
Biogen s shares have underperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry over the last three months   21  vs   9 8    Biogen has a strong position in the MS market  The Zacks analyst also likes Biogen s efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke  among others  
Meanwhile  its newest drug Spinraza witnessed strong patient uptake in the U S  and internationally  However  weakening MS trends is a concern  Tecfidera is witnessing a slight decline in U S  patient demand due to increasing competition from oral medicines and a slowdown in the overall MS market  
The launch of Ocrevus by Roche is beginning to have a negative impact on MS franchise sales in the U S   mainly on Tysabri  Also  recently  Biogen announced the decision to withdraw Zinbryta from the markets due to growing safety concerns  However  estimates have risen ahead of Q1 earnings results  The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters

Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks  It measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below Industrial Machinery   Nation Wise DescriptionThe United States  The country s industrial production increased at an annual rate of 4 7  in the second quarter  driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities Per the U S  Census Bureau report  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 5 7  in the first half of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction  mining  industrial  material handling and other machineries  Also  the job market showed strength  with the recent data indicating 209 000 new job additions in July  In second quarter 2017  new job additions averaged 194 333 per month  Unemployment rate declined from 4 4  in June to 4 3  in July Citing improvement in economic activities  the Federal Reserve raised its interest rates in June and indicated further rate hikes ahead  This  in turn  will make capital investments more expensive and hence might weigh on businesses for industrial products makers      Per its Jul 2017 report  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  trimmed its growth projections for the U S  economy by 20 basis points  bps  to 2 1  for 2017 and 40 bps to 2 1  for 2018 primarily on account of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of governmental policies Japan  According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders  an indicator of

standard since it suffered from a 3  rise in national sales tax in Apr 2015 In addition  the country is facing weak economic conditions externally  However  efforts to improve wages and hence  demand

it remained stable at 0 6  for 2018 China  China s GDP grew 6 9  from the year earlier period in the second quarter  coming in better than expected  Improvements in infrastructure investment  retail sales and higher exports due to healthy global economy have worked in its favor  In March  the government announced its plan to spend  2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020  However  tiff with the U S  economy over trade relationships might dent its growth momentum The country s industrial production increased 7 6  year over year in June on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors  offset by weakness in the mining sector  Industrial production in both May and April grew 6 5  For 2017  the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6 5   The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6 7  in 2017 and 6 4  in 2018 India  The country s industrial production decelerated to 1 7  in May 2017  having expanded 2 8  in the previous month  Production suffered from lower rise in manufacturing output and contractions in mining and quarrying outputs Expectations of a strong demand  improved policies and better monsoon conditions are the factors that will influence the country s growth  going forward  The government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world  Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country  these strategies will improve the domestic job market as well as demand for industrial products  The recent interest rate cut by the central bank  driven by prevailing low inflation rate in the country  will allow accessibility to cheap loans According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 7 2  in 2017 and 7 7  in 2018 Brazil  Political uncertainties continue to loom large over Brazil s economy and are mainly responsible for the countries  below investment grade ratings  Private investments are low while inadequate infrastructure and still high unemployment rate are making the economy more lackluster Strong efforts are being made to revive the economy  In July this year  interest rate was trimmed 100 bps by the countries  Central Bank  this being its seventh consecutive rate cut since Oct 2016  Also  inflation has eased over the past few months  Per the data available  industrial

Kemet Corp  NYSE       was the Bull of the Day back on July 25 and at that time I noted the stock traded at a 18x forward multiple yet had some great growth potential  At the time the stock was priced at just under  17  today I see shares trading over  25 and I believe they are headed higher still You can access the last Bull of the Day at this link    DescriptionKemet Corporation  together with its subsidiaries  manufactures and sells passive electronic components under the Kemet brand worldwide  The company operates through two segments  Solid Capacitors  and Film and Electrolytic  Its

manufacturing services providers and electronics distributors  The company was founded in 1919 and is headquartered in Simpsonville  South Carolina Earnings HistorySince the previous Bull of the Day article ran  KEM posted another solid quarter  The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 18 by  0 14 for a 77  positive earnings surprise  This was the fourth consecutive beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate The stock traded lower following the report and that could have been due to the top line miss  The company reported  274M in revenues when  281M were expected The next earnings report has more lofty expectations  with analysts looking for  299M on top and a  0 43 on the bottom line Earnings EstimatesBack in July  the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for  0 54 in EPS for 2017  The next month that number nearly tripled to  1 50  In the first few days of October  the estimate has again inched higher to  1 52  This is an impressive move higher The 2018 number also saw a big move  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was at  0 76 in July and then jolted higher to  1 57 in August and has moved to  1 61 here in October   Flowserve Corp  NYSE       recently posted a big miss on the top and on bottom  The company reported  0 22 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was looking for  0 44  and that translates into a negative earnings surprise of 50    The company also missed on the top line as well  with revenues of  877M when  923M were expected   The company also lowered guidance and that has sent earnings estimates lower  and for that reason it is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell

12797,234312,FLS,Will Weak End Markets Hurt Flowserve s  FLS  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,We expect Flowserve Corporation   NYSE FLS   to beat on earnings in third quarter 2017  The company is scheduled to release its results on Nov 1  after the closing bell The company missed earnings by 50  in the last reported quarter  Overall  Flowserve has an average negative surprise of 7 3  for the trailing four quarters  marked by two earnings beats for as many misses Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Drive Better than Expected ResultsFlowserve had a difficult second quarter  as its earnings missed by half  dragged by precipitous top line decline  owing to macroeconomic volatility and foreign currency headwinds  Since the company did not anticipate any major turnaround in the adverse geopolitical environment and weak end markets  we expect these factors to cast a shadow on the upcoming quarterly results as well The company has been witnessing acute weakness across its segments  Flowserve s Flow Control Division  FCD   which witnessed 13 2  year over year decline in revenues in the prior quarter  will likely be weak in the coming results as well  owing in part to lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the FCD segment revenues in the to be reported quarter is pegged at  272 million  reflecting dismal contraction of 16  year over year Likewise  its Engineered Product Division is projected to decline 9 4  year over year to  424 million in the upcoming results  marred by soft customer original equipment sales in key end markets  Industrial Product Division sales will also likely be hurt by low original equipment sales and we expect the segment sales to go down 11 7  year over year to  188 million Flowserve Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    However  the company has been witnessing some stabilization in core aftermarket activities concerning parts  services and repairs as markets return to regular maintenance schedules We believe the company s top line in the third quarter might benefit slightly from modest natural gas investments in North America and Asia  Also  increased bidding activity in the desalination space is anticipated to bolster sales  This apart  the company s restructuring initiatives over the past few quarters are anticipated to prove conducive to third quarter results Currently  the company is pursuing a  400 million multi year investment plan  which is expected to result in  195 million of savings in 2017  These initiatives helped the company garner savings of  21 million in second quarter 2017  Further  Flowserve is planning to trim its workforce by 15 20  as compared to the 2015 levels  as well as shift manufacturing to lower cost regions  We believe savings from these restructuring activities will boost profits in the upcoming quarter Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Flowserve will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at  5 21   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 32 cents  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  Flowserve has a Zacks Rank  3  While this increases the predictive power of ESP  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX    with an Earnings ESP of  3 17  and a Zacks Rank of 2  is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 1  You can see  Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL    with an Earnings ESP of  3 92  and a Zacks Rank of 2  is slated to report results on Nov 6 Scripps Networks Interactive  Inc   NASDAQ SNI   has an Earnings

12798,234313,FLS,Industrial Machinery Stock Outlook   December 2017,opinion,"The cyclical nature of industrial machinery demand is benefiting from the synchronized global growth backdrop  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  recently raised its outlook for the global economy  with the financial institution anticipating the world economy to grow 3 6  in 2017  It expects 2 2  rise in advanced economies and 4 6  growth in emerging nations  Global output is projected to increase 3 7  in 2018  including 2  growth for advanced nations and 4 9  improvement for emerging countries 
We believe that continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery  Moreover  healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations  especially in emerging countries  are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment  Further  need for better infrastructure and residential and non residential spaces require heavy construction machineries 
Machinery stocks are broadly grouped under   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The sector has performed well  yielding a solid return of 18 3  year to date  This outpaces growth of 16 9  recorded by the S P 500 and roughly 13 2  by the NYSE Composite 
Among the S P 500 members  the top five industrial machinery gainers since the beginning of the year include Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Inc   CAT   Stanley Black   Decker  NYSE SWK   Inc   SWK   Deere   Company  NYSE DE   DE   Roper Technologies  Inc   ROP  and Rockwell Automation Inc  NYSE ROK    ROK   The poor performers include Flowserve Corp   FLS   Emerson Electric Co   EMR  and Eaton Corp   PLC  ETN  
Industrial Machinery  Description
Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks  It measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below 
The United States  The country s industrial production increased2 9  year over year in October driven by impressive growth in mining  manufacturing and utilities output  In September  industrial production increased 1 6  year over year 
In addition  a few indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry  Per the U S  Census Bureau report new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 6 4  in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction  mining  industrial  material handling and other machineries 
Also  the job market showed strength  with the recent data indicating 261 000 new job additions in October  Average of new job additions in the last three months was 162 000  accounting for hurricane affects   The unemployment rate dropped 10 basis points  bps  to 4 1   Also  the country s GDP has advanced 3  in the July September quarter 
We believe that implementation of the Trump government s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks  Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets in the country  To continue supporting the growing economy  the Federal Reserve has hiked its interest rates twice this year while another one might be expected in December 
The IMF projects the U S  economy to grow 2 2  in 2017 and 2 3  in 2018  These estimates represent increase of 10 bps from the previous projection for 2017 and 20 bps for 2018 
Japan  The country s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels  an aging population and huge public debt Also  the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3  rise in national sales tax in April 2014 
However  strengthening exports driven by rise in automobile and electronic shipments have supported the country s annualized GDP growth of 1 4  in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter  In addition  we believe that initiatives to improve wages are likely to spur domestic demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country s favor in the quarters ahead 
According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders  an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months increased 4 7  in third quarter 2017  However  the same is predicted to be quite different in the fourth quarter  with total machinery orders likely to decline 1 9   Core orders are expected to fall 3 5   orders from manufacturing clients will likely drop 9 4  and that from government clients might decline 3 3  
The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 1 5  for 2017 and by 10 bps to 0 7  for 2018 
China  China s GDP grew 6 8  from the year earlier period in the third quarter  However  this improvement was slightly below 6 9  registered in the previous quarter as a rise in retail sales and higher exports were partially offset by weak expansion in infrastructure investments 
The country s industrial production improved 6 6  year over year in September on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors  offset by weakness in the mining sector  Industrial production in October grew 6 2  
For 2017  the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6 5   We believe that implementation of the government s plan to spend more than  2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020 will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery 
The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6 8  in 2017 and 6 5  in 2018  up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates 
India  The country is currently witnessing the after effects of some major reforms  demonetization and goods and services tax   implemented in the trailing 12 months  These economic decisions along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth going forward 
A favorable domestic job market  low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans  infrastructure investments  healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination 
The country s industrial production decelerated to 3 8  in September 2017  having expanded 4 5  in the previous month  Production suffered from weakness in mining and electricity outputs  In the first half of fiscal 2017  ended September   industrial production expanded 2 5  year over year 
According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 6 7  in 2017 and 7 4  in 2018  down roughly 50 bps and 30 bps from the respective previous estimates 
Brazil  One of the major road blocks for the Brazilian economy are the political uncertainties which have gripped the nation  somewhat jeopardizing its growth opportunities  Corruption charges against its president are believed to be one of the reasons behind the country s poor investment grade ratings  Moreover  low private investments  inadequate infrastructure and still a high unemployment rate of 12 4  are other major hurdles 
Partially negating the impact of these aspects  growth in export demand and efforts to implement a new pension reform targeting the curbing of public debt are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy  Also  falling inflation have prompted the countries  Central Bank to ease interest rates  Notably  the interest rate has been lowered by 75 bps in October  this being its ninth consecutive rate cut since October 2016 
In addition  the country s industrial production has been encouraging since the beginning of the year  Per the latest data  industrial production in September grew 2 6  from the year ago comparable month 
The IMF expects the country s output to grow 0 7  in 2017  reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast  Also  growth projection for 2018 has been increased by 20 bps to 1 5  
Eurozone  The region  amidst all the political uncertainties  is showing slight improvement in export demand and labor markets  The region s GDP has improved 2 5  year over year in third quarter 2017 while industrial production has improved 3 3  year over year in September  The unemployment rate at September end was 8 9  versus 9  at the end of the previous month 
The region s GDP when compared with the previous quarter inched up 0 6  versus 0 7  recorded in the second quarter  Industrial production  on a month on month basis  fell 0 6  in September 
The IMF increased output growth estimates by 20 bps both for 2017 and 2018 to 2 1  and 1 9   respectively

12801,234316,FLS,Flowserve  FLS  Q2 Earnings Miss By Half  Guidance Falls,opinion,Flowserve Corp    NYSE FLS   reversed its recent earnings beat trend as its second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 22 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents by half On a reported basis  the company s earnings per share plunged 31 3  to 32 cents on a year over year basis  Precipitous top line decline  owing to macroeconomic volatility  as well as foreign currency headwinds  proved to be major drags for the bottom line Quarter in DetailRevenues fell 14 6  year over year to  877 1 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  926 million  Sluggish progress of the Industrial Product Division turnaround  customer delays in product pick up  and significantly high tax rate  proved to be a drag on the revenues  Also  foreign currency headwinds eroded sales by  10 million The company s bookings totaled  971 million in second quarter 2017  up 0 8  year over year at constant currency  cc   After market bookings totaled  458 million and were down 3 7  at cc  while original equipment bookings were up 5 15  at cc to  514 million  Growth in bookings came on the back of modest recovery in the oil   gas industry  and higher original equipment bookings Operating income of the company came in at  126 1 million  up 34 5  from the year ago period  Foreign currency headwinds and lower sales acted as major dampeners for operating income performance  Also  adjusted gross margin expanded 360 bps to 31 5  Segmental ResultsEngineered Product Division revenues were down 16 6  year over year to  427 7 million in the quarter  Negative currency translation effects  along with lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa  crippled the sales of this segment  However  bookings were almost flat year over year at  465 1 million Sales at the Flow Control Division declined 13 2  year over year to  275 4 million  marred by currency headwinds and soft customer original equipment sales in key end markets Bookings of this segment totaled  316 2 million  up 1 1  year over year Moreover  Industrial Product Division sales were down 10 8  year over year to  191 8 million  Foreign currency headwinds  along with low original equipment sales  resulted in the decline across all main geographies  Furthermore  bookings totaled  213 3 million  up 0 5  year over year Flowserve Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Restructuring InitiativesCurrently  the company is following its  400 million multi year investment  which is anticipated to result in savings of  195 million in 2017  In 2018  savings from the full annualized program are projected at  230 million  These investments are aimed at streamlining management structure  reducing manufacturing costs and implementing cost saving measures for the overall optimization of the cost structure The company also expects to trim its workforce by 15 20   and manufacturing footprint by 30  compared with the 2015 level  as well as shift manufacturing to lower cost regions  under this  400 million worth of restructuring initiative  Flowserve will announce all facility closures by year end 2017 In relation to the restructuring efforts  Flowserve spent about  32 million in first quarter 2017  which  in turn  led to incremental savings of  21 million  It remains optimistic about completing the  400 million program in 2017 Also  under the restructuring program  Flowserve completed the divestiture of the Gestra AG business unit to Spirax Sarco Engineering plc for  186 million   198 4 million   The sale is part of Flowserve s broader strategy to improve focus on core business  and optimize its product portfolio and manufacturing footprint Balance Sheet   Cash FlowFlowserve ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  505 2 million compared with  367 2 million as of Dec 31  2016  On Jun 30  2017  the company s long term debt totaled  1 501 million  up from  1 485 3 million as of Dec 31  2016 Flowserve s net cash flow provided by operating activities came in at  46 6 million at the end Jun 30  2017  up significantly from  10 7 million recorded in the prior year period 2017 OutlookFlowserve reduced its 2017 guidance and now expects adjusted earnings per share guidance to lie in the band of  1 30  1 50  previous guidance   1 55  1 85   It estimates revenues to decline in the range of 6 10  The company does not anticipate any major turnaround in the current geopolitical environment and end markets for 2017  Factors including currency rates  commodity prices  expected bookings and market volatility are likely to put pressure on both the top  and bottom line performances for this year  However  in light of the continued stability of the company s bookings and modest sequential improvement in operations  Flowserve anticipates its performance to improve in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter To ConcludeFlowserve had a choppy first half of the year  Its biggest challenge comes in the form of capital spending constraints and aftermarket push outs  In the recent past  the company s operations have suffered from project delays  rolling maintenance deferrals  and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance  We believe Flowserve will continue to witness challenging times in the second half of the year On the other hand  relative stability of oil at around the level of  45  50 over the past couple of quarters is a major positive for the company  It appears that Flowserve s orders are finally showing signs of bottoming out  signaling brighter days ahead  Going forward  we believe stabilization in core aftermarket activities bode well for long term growth of the company Other key strengths include strong operational model  solid productivity  and considerable aftermarket content and geographical diversity  In particular  the diligent restructuring efforts are starting to manifest themselves in substantial savings  Despite these positives  there is no denying the fact that the company s waning top line performance remains a major concern Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderFlowserve presently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc    NYSE B    Eaton Corporation  PLC   NYSE ETN   and Regal Beloit

12822,234337,FLS,Flowserve s  FLS  Woes Continue  Time To Dump The Stock ,opinion,"Shares of industrial and environmental machinery supplier  Flowserve   NYSE FLS    has yielded a negative 3 7  return for the past six months  in stark contrast to the Zacks categorized Machinery General industry s positive 12 7   In addition  the company has a dismal track record  having missed estimates each time in the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 7 7  
Also  analysts are becoming increasingly bearish on the stock over the past couple of months with estimate revisions moving south  With ten downward revisions compared with no upward revision in the past two months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2016 earnings has declined from  2 42 to  2 14 per share 
Here s discussing major factors that are marring the company s prospects 
Factors Thwarting Growth
Flowserve s dismal performance over the past few quarters is largely attributable to the macroeconomic concerns plaguing the most well managed companies  The company is vulnerable to cyclicality primarily in the oil   gas  general industrial and chemical industries  Oil   gas spending continues to decline in both upstream and midstream channels in the Middle East  Capital spending deferrals as well as reduced activity in its key markets are expected to be major challenges in the upcoming quarters as well 
Flowserve is facing a lack of mid  and large sized project opportunities  along with cost reduction and project delivery postponement pressures by customers  The company has cut guidance twice during the year  thus miffing investors more  The downcast outlook reflects the ongoing sluggishness in global macroeconomic conditions and lack of visibility in end markets 
Flowserve slashed its 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of  2 05 to  2 25 from the previous  2 40 to  2 60  Also  the company revised the lower limit of its revenue guidance downward  In addition  persistent weakness in commodity prices and reduced visibility in many of its key markets are marring the company s top line performance 
FLOWSERVE CORP Price and Consensus
   Though Flowserve has been focusing on cost control and strategic restructuring to offset some of the negatives  we believe these activities will not be able to achieve the full cost savings run rate anytime soon owing to the intensity of the short term challenges  This is because Flowserve s niche verticals are tied to the energy complex  which is witnessing prolonged weakness without any respite in sight 
In addition  the company has been facing extreme operational uncertainties in several regions like Asia Pacific  North America  Middle East and Latin America  which affected the top line  Going forward  new investments and maintenance activities continue to face headwinds in North America   Given the overall softness in broad based industrial spending  we believe the company is unlikely to stage a comeback any time soon

12849,234364,FLS,Energy And Industrials  5 Largest Revisions,opinion,"World markets were in a panic again this week due to another sell off in China on Monday  which prompted energy prices to fall further and overall market sentiment to collapse  In the Estimize coverage universe  the companies that saw the largest revisions to Q3 estimates were not so surprisingly within the energy and industrials sectors 
These are the 5 with the sharpest revisions in the past month 
Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX 
Chevron is the second largest oil company in the United States and therefore has no doubt felt the pinch from declining oil prices  with Brent Crude Oil down more than 17  in the past month and WTI falling 15   In that time  the Estimize consensus for Chevron s third quarter have fallen in lockstep  On August 11 the company was expected to earn  0 93 share  which has since fallen to  0 67  a decrease of 28   Revenues on the other hand have increased from  23 4B on August 11 to  25 2B as of Friday    still well below Wall Street s estimate for  28B 

Flowserve Corporation  NYSE FLS 
Along with energy  the industrial names have been hit hard  too  as many within that sector rely on strength from the global economy  especially China  FlowServe  which manufactures and distributes industrial flow management equipment worldwide  has recently made substantial investment in emerging market operations  including China  India and Brazil  However  last quarter the company saw sales and bookings in Asia Pacific fall by double digit percentages  reflecting slowing growth in some of their major markets  Estimize has seen Q3 EPS estimates for FLS fall 12  in the last month  On July 28  EPS was expected to come in at  1 08  which is now down to  0 95  Revenues have fallen as well  from  13 2B to  12 2B 

Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM 
The big kahuna  Exxon Mobil  is the largest US oil company and the fourth largest in the world  Despite oil prices  which began to collapse in the third quarter of 2014  the giant has been able to surpass earnings expectations every quarter  with the exception of the latest quarter  while still putting up an impressive beat on the sales front  Since July 31  expectations for earnings have dropped 11   on that date they were  1 07   dropping to  1 00 by August 6   0 96 by Aug 23 and to  0 95 on Monday    where they have since stayed  Revenues on the other hand have increased from  62 9B on July 31 to  65 4B as of Friday    still well below Wall Street s estimate for  69 2B  Overall estimates for the entire S P 500 energy sector have fallen  too  now expecting negative profits of 65  in Q3 vs  a Q2 final of  53  

FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX 
FedEx is another big industrial name that has been feeling the pain of a global slowdown  While the transports should be benefitting from lower fuel prices  decreased fuel surcharges and lower package weight    along with a decrease in international revenue per package due to currency headwinds    have been weighing on the company  FedEx is also finding its higher end services waning in popularity  with more demand for ground services  Overall the Estimize community has pulled back 6  on EPS estimates  from a consensus for  2 62 a month ago to  2 47 today  Revenue estimates have bounced around  from a peak of  12 33B at the end of June  down to a low of  12 08B in the beginning of July and inching upwards to  12 25B today 

Caterpillar Inc   NYSE CAT 
Manufacturing giant Caterpillar gets a significant amount of its total revenues from China and is often used as a barometer for the strength of China s economy  Last quarter the company saw profits fall 29  and revenues decrease almost 14  as a result of severe weakness in mining and lower construction related sales in China and Brazil  In response  Caterpillar cut its outlook for revenues by  1B and is now expecting  49B in 2015  The company has also been reducing its workforce  eliminating close to 5 000 full  and part time positions in the past year  Earnings estimates on the Estimize platform are down 5  in the past month  falling from  1 07 at the end of July to  1 02 today  Revenues  too  have decreased from an expectation for  12 6B last month to  12 1B today 

Of course we are still about six weeks out from the peak of the Q3 earnings season  so these numbers will change further  Whether they will go back up or decline further remains to be seen ",2015-08-28,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-and-industrials:-the-5-largest-revisions-263328,263328
12850,234365,FLS,Company Notes Digest 5 8 15,opinion,"Each week I read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of my investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts  

The Macro Outlook 

Fixed Income markets are getting more volatile

 As we have all witnessed  fixed income markets have exhibited significant interest rate and spread volatility over the recent past given the debate over the timing of Fed lift off amidst continued global central bank stimulus and its impact on U S  markets      Mortgage REIT 

Companies are racing to issue debt ahead of interest rate increases

 First quarter issuance in the US was quite strong across all sectors  Investment grade increased 24  a continued thirst for yield has enabled corporate issuers across the rating spectrum to tap the capital market  extending maturities at beneficial pricing and terms  High yield increased 39   public finance was up 61      Financial Data and Statistics 

There are real concerns that policy makers have generated asset bubbles

 policymakers have failed to foster the conditions for a credible sustained recovery  They have  however  been very successful in creating both debt and equity market bubbles  however reliant they may be on zero interest rates      Mortgage REIT 

Markets are priced to perfection

 I think that after all these years of low interest rates and quantitative easing  what we have is markets both fixed income and equity markets that are priced for perfection  So  my guess is that for the time being businesses look like they re priced too high for us      Diversified Holding Co 

There are a lot of companies priced at ridiculous multiples

 as you know there s a lot of very highly priced things out there there s an awful lot of companies that are priced at ridiculous multiplies these days      Publisher 

It s better to be patient than to overpay

 I d rather be patient and get a good business at an attractive price rather than lose patience and buy a business at too high a price      Diversified Holding Co 

The world is cyclical  opportunities will eventually present themselves

 Now one of the things that I always remember is that the world is cyclical  And it s easy to lose sight of that because we re now in   firmly in year six of an upcycle for equity prices  But at some point in time something will happen  people will lose all the confidence that they have and my guess is that opportunities will present itself      Diversified Holding Co 

Greenlight has taken net exposure down to just 16 

 The investment portfolio s net exposure was 16  at quarter end which is near an all time low and reflects our concern about stretched valuations and challenges we see for corporate earnings in 2015  These challenges include the strong dollar  lower oil prices and difficult year over year comparisons in the next three quarters These issues lead us to believe that earnings have peaked and may even shrink this year      Hedge Fund Reinsurance 

Cash wont burn a hole in your pocket

 As we have said before  money doesn t burn a hole in our pockets  While we acknowledge that cash can be a drag on Loews short term returns  we feel that having the flexibility to be opportunistic and not rely on financing markets has served our shareholders very well over the long term      Diversified Holding Co 

If the environment starts to sour  it will pay to make sure that liquidity is truly liquid

 we re mindful of trying to make sure the composition of the portfolio is as liquid as it can be  And one of my sayings is make sure your liquidity is liquid      Mortgage REIT 

Don t get too cute with your defensive posture

 I m sure that if we were really smart and clever we could find some alternative investment approach that would increase the yield on our short term portfolio from essentially nothing to something more than that  We re not that clever or smart  so we won t try to perform that sort of alchemy  We ve seen enough of those experiments end badly to dissuade us from going down that path      Insurance 

Meanwhile in the real economy 

This month will be the first one that we get clear comps that weren t affected by weather

 if you recall last year  there was a little bit of a cabin fever So we had good volume in March and April relative to the rest of the year last year and I think we re seeing softer volume this year  What I m trying to say to you is I think weather is impacting that  I just don t know to what degree and I think I can make a better call on that after we see May and June here because we ll be back to apples to apples      Food Distributor 

International 

Volatile currency markets are keeping companies on their toes

 While the U S  dollar strengthened further in the quarter  it has weakened significantly in the last couple of weeks  And we are updating our outlook to reflect that volatility using a range that roughly aligns with our initial 2015 guidance rate on the high side and more current prevailing rates on the low side      Apparel Accessories 

Currency moves balance out in the long run

 if you look at currency movements  over the short term they do impact multinationals but over long term things balance out      Industrial Equipment 

Even though emerging markets are out of favor  the fundamentals are still the same as they were in the BRIC years

 I like to remind people that despite the bad mood or some poor macro indicators  the fundamentals in Brazil remain the same  So demographics  the fact that LDA is growing at a healthy pace  it ll be a plus  The weather  the beer culture  the regional differences  middle class  all those things are there      Beer 

For instance  India has a lot of potential beer consumers

 we see India as an attractive  long term market  It s currently at market size of 23 million to 24 million hectoliters  It s been growing double digits steadily  And yet  per capita consumption of beer is only 2 liters per person per year  which means  in the long term  we expect this market to continue to grow      Beer 

Financials 

Solar City is seeing capital markets more receptive to financing solar installations

 Every six months I only see our credit spread shrinking as we continue to perform as the paper continues to perform  So I am very happy where things are going from that perspective and then obviously on a cost spend of it  It is really is the cost of capital and the cost that s really driving our success and where I think we will continue to outdistance and be cost efficient      Solar Panel Installation 

Consumer 

Kate Spade says that the retail environment has stayed very promotional

 I think it s fair to say that we are still seeing a promotional environment generally driven by the department stores  I think what we have continued to see is various department store groups  matching other sales from other retailers  There s been an extension of key events  So this is certainly seeming to be an ongoing issue     Apparel Accessories 

Fossil s partners have been impacted by new entrants to the watch space  i e  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  

 in our wholesale partners in the United States  we actually are seeing  as mentioned  their declining business there there s a lot of disruption  Obviously  there s a new entrant in the market  We re not sure if there s some impact on the consumers  side to see what that new entrant s products look like  et cetera  but they have yet to be seen      Apparel Accessories 

Department stores believe that the convergence of fashion and technology could present a huge growth opportunity

 We think we re in a situation where consumers are very  very interested in this convergence of fashion and technology department stores are very interested in this because the watch business is about  65 billion globally  relatively a small industry  whereas  the tech industry The spending in there is huge      Apparel Accessories 

Anheuser Busch is dealing with brand fragmentation from its craft beer portfolio

 brand fragmentation is a reality  It has to be managed  though you have to be smarter about how you split your market money and sales money in support of those brands  So we re developing better models to check return on investment on both traditional and social media  So we are sharper on how to allocate resources behind brands     Beer 

Anheuser is spending more and more on social media

 Social media continues to grow within our mix of media spend between social and traditional  We are learning every day by connecting more with consumers and making our contents relevant  Of course  it s a very fast paced type interaction with consumers  and we don t intend to get everything right all the time      Beer 

Disney is developing ways to take content directly to consumers

 we do have an ability as a company to take product  specifically filmed entertainment  television  movies  directly to consumers  And we ve got some development underway to do just that      Magic Kingdom 

Distributors add real value though

 That said  the distributors  whether it s cable or satellite or even some of the new platforms  create real value for us  too  They already are in the customer acquisition business  They ve already spent significant amount of money in capital to create their platforms  And they manage the relationship with the consumer  whether it s billing or technology or whatever fairly effectively      Magic Kingdom 

Technology opens many doors for high quality media

 I think we re entering into a pretty interesting world  where technology is for the most part the friend of high quality media  Because it s going to give us many more opportunities to reach customers  either directly or through third parties  So we re viewing this as kind of a new world order in many ways  because of I think the impact of technology on media  but one that s going to be very beneficial to this company      Magic Kingdom 

Technology 

Sprint is sounding a lot like T Mobile

 In Sprint s customer centric culture  we re passionate about listening and understanding customers  pain points and making changes to enhance their experience  One of the main complaints from customers who travel to top destinations in Latin America and Europe and Japan  is how shocked they are when they return home      Telecom 

One can gather a lot of valuable business data from Linkedin

 actually  anyone can like figure this out by just going on LinkedIn  LinkedIn can produce statistics on what the relative flow of people is from one company to another  And I think it s like   something like   if you look at like the trailing 12 months  Tesla has recruited five times as many people from Apple as Apple s recruited from Tesla      Electric Vehicles 

Elon Musk says that demand for Tesla s power pack has been  like  crazy

 The response has been overwhelming  okay  like crazy there s  like  no way that we could possibly satisfy this demand this year and we re basically like sold out through the middle of next year in the first week it s like crazy off the hook      Electric Vehicles 

It will still be more expensive to use power packs than to draw electricity from the grid  but people will buy them anyways

 If somebody wants to do a daily cycling  basically go off grid  It s going to be more expensive than being on grid  This doesn t mean that people won t buy it because there are people who want to go off grid on principle  or they just want to be independent      Electric Vehicles 

Battery chemistry still has not meaningfully improved

 we d love it if somebody could come up with a better internal chemistry for the cell  But it s worth noting that nobody has sent us anything we d love it if somebody would do that  they just haven t it s just a real hard problem      Electric Vehicles 

Healthcare 

Investors focused on public markets don t get to see a huge part of the healthcare industry

 you got to remember that the industry is five times as big as the companies that everybody pays so much attention to      Hospital Operator 

Tenet says that exchanges have been a good source of business for them

 were an early adopter of the exchanges it s growing very rapidly  But it s a great story for us with a new market that s substantial  it s profitable  and we re providing good service to people who are utilizing our hospitals within those      Hospital Operator 

Healthcare providers don t necessarily want value based reimbursement because it introduces more risk into the business model

 as a company  we re not looking to move and to take risk  We don t see that right now in the intermediate term as something that we need to do      Hospital Operator 

Materials  Industrials  Energy 

Oil companies are doing a great job of finding ways to improve productivity

 the slowdown in activity is giving us more time to focus on efficiency improvements  While much has been made of service cost reductions  we expect  we will gain the most long term benefits from efficiency gains      Oil Exploration and Production 

They have even surprised themselves at how much efficiency they have been able to generate

 We re testing some additional processes that make our drilling faster and more efficient I ve always thought we re pushing toward the later innings  of productivity gains   but these guys have continued to prove me wrong  So I m excited about how things are going      Oil Exploration and Production 

Higher prices could bring production back on the market

 I think we still have some concerns that  as we achieve higher prices  we could see activity increase and prices  unfortunately  could suffer as a result of higher production than people are anticipating     Oil Exploration and Production 

Some companies will try to call the bottom

 There probably will be some that decide to take a bet and thinks that prices are going to run up  and they re going to get ahead of it with their operations  We won t be one of those      Oil Exploration and Production 

Anadarko says to be cautious until service costs sync up with oil prices

 We re fairly cautious because we don t quite yet see service cost synced up to the environment that we re in from a hydrocarbon price perspective  Until we start to see more of that synchronization  we re going to be pretty cautious      Oil Exploration and Production 

EOG is ready to ramp production back up in 4Q though

 as we talked about  the production shape is going to be U shaped this year and the second and third quarters will be the low point  but the fourth quarter  with the current plan  is to ramp up production growth and the heading into 2016 on a very strong note      Oil Exploration and Production 

Companies should be able to ramp quickly because servicers have kept capacity in place in anticipation of a rebound

 If we were ramping up here in the next month or two  I think you can ramp up pretty rapidly  And that s why many of those operators are trying to keep as many services in place even if reduced work levels just to maintain that support that service companies      Oil Exploration and Production 

There is a lot of capital eager to rush into the energy sector

 We have an awful lot of capital sitting on the sidelines waiting to go into our industry  Whether it s private equity  the public capital markets  or other forms of capital that   sound like the mushroom is starting to get over  100 billion waiting to go into our industry  broadly defined      Oil Exploration and Production 

Conditions haven t been bad enough for long enough though

 I think right now the conditions are bad enough for rig valuations to go down  The problem is they haven t been bad enough for long enough      Diversified Holding Company 

Sellers still want more than buyers are willing to pay

 There s still a pretty good spread between the bid and ask on the acquisition front  I think we ll be very selective       Oil Exploration and Production 

Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom 

Understand how you add value

 with respect to value  and we talk a lot in our organization about healthcare and the value that we need to bring to our markets  And we see right now  our value as being turned by including  number one  patient safety  patient quality  patient experience  access points  so that it makes our system accessible  easy to get into  easy to access from a patient standpoint  from a physician standpoint     Hospital Operator 

Success breeds competition

 we ve been so  so successful that we d actually brought a lot more competition and everybody jump in kind on the national organic food band wagon and that s really  frankly due to our success      Grocery Chain 

A company s most valuable assets are its people

 at the end of the day  I certainly believe that   and I think Randall does as well   that the most valuable assets AT T  NYSE T  is buying is truly our people      Satellite Television

12859,234374,FLS,Flowserve  FLS  Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates  View Narrowed,opinion,Flowserve Corp    NYSE FLS   reported second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents by 6 6   Also  adjusted EPS declined 28 7  on a year over year basis from the year ago tally of 80 cents Lackluster top line performance owning to macroeconomic concerns and foreign currency headwinds weighed on the bottom line Quarter in DetailRevenues fell 11 7  year over year to  1 026 2 million but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  998 million  Apart from lower sales across all the three sub segments  negative currency effects caused revenues to decline by  23 million  Poor original equipment sales across all geographies were largely attributable to the top line decline in the quarter The company s bookings totaled  975 million in the second quarter of 2016  down 12 6  year over year at constant currency  cc   Aftermarket bookings totaled  480 million  up 2 3  at cc  Bookings were affected by negative currency effects of approximately  28 million  Also  prolonged softness in the oil and gas industry and general and power generation industries affected customer original equipment bookings  adding to the woes Flowserve s adjusted operating margin declined 300 basis points  bps  to 11 7  on a year over year basis  largely on account of foreign currency headwinds  Also  adjusted gross margins were down 130 bps to 32 7   Decreased sales  unfavorable impacts of short term operational inefficiencies and lower margin projects were major dampeners for gross margin Segmental ResultsEngineered Product Division revenues in the quarter decreased 10 3  year over year to  511 8 million  Negative currency translation effects along with weak original equipment sales in Latin America  North America and Asia Pacific were the factors behind the revenue decline  Also  bookings were down 19 1  year over year to  465 5 million  mainly due to currency headwinds  volatility in oil   gas markets and softness in general and chemical industries Sales at the Flow Control Division declined 11 0  year over year to  317 2 million  hit by currency headwinds and soft customer original equipment sales in Asia Pacific  North America  Latin America and Europe  Bookings fell 12  year over year to  312 9 million  owing to lower orders from chemical and oil and gas industries in North America and the Middle East Also  Industrial Product Division sales were down 17 6  year over year to  215 0 million  Foreign currency headwinds coupled with low original equipment sales resulted in the decline across all main geographies  However  bookings were up 3 4  to  212 3 million  mainly on the back of improved bookings in chemical  water management and general industries Restructuring InitiativesFlowserve had previously announced a  125 million realignment program aimed at reducing headcount and closing non profit facilities  Through this program  the company intends to streamline its managerial structure  reduce manufacturing costs and implement cost saving measures  During fourth quarter 2015  the company had expanded this realignment program to improve its operational structure  Overall  this combined  350 million program is projected to garner cost savings of  125 million in 2016 and another  185 million in 2017 The company is well on track to achieve its goals  and during second quarter 2016  it raked in  27 million of savings and expects to realize full year incremental savings of  100 million  Since the beginning of the restructuring program  Flowserve has been working on two thirds of the manufacturing facilities for closing  repurposing or selling them The company s program expenses amounted to  20 million in second quarter 2016 and it expects to incur another  160 million as realignment charges in full year 2016  Going forward  Flowserve is optimistic about the competency of this realignment

the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  266 0 million compared with  310 3 million as of Mar 31  2016  On Jun 30  2016  Flowserve s long term debt was  1 543 5 million  down from  1 573 4 million at the end of Mar 31  2016 The company s net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled  3 2 million for the 3 months ended Jun 30  2016  down significantly from the cash from operating activities of  18 1 million in the prior year period Outlook NarrowedOn account of the current challenges  Flowserve has narrowed its 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance to  2 40 to  2 60 from the previous  2 40  2 75  However  the company reiterated its revenue guidance and continues to expect a 7 14  year over year decline  including a 2  impact from foreign currency headwind Also  Flowserve expects its full year 2016 adjusted EPS to improve toward the second half of the year  reflecting benefits from normal seasonality  timing of realignment savings and backlog shipments FLOWSERVE CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Going forwardThe second quarter earnings miss marks a hat trick of misses for Flowserve  The present market scenario signals that Flowserve s near term prospects are likely to remain challenged for the remaining part of the year  Broad based capital spending decline  followed by reduced activity in oil and gas markets  are manifesting themselves into reduced revenues  orders and absence of middle and larger sized projects for the company Despite these negatives  most of the realignment programs undertaken by the company look promising but tangible gains from the same are expected in the second half of 2016  We believe that the company s strong market share  focus on cost control  strategic restructuring  high operational excellence and increased earnings leverage bode well for long term growth  Also  the transition toward a favorable mix is expected to offset some of the negatives Flowserve currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

12870,234385,FLS,Poor PMIs Shake Markets ,opinion,The market reaction to the poor manufacturing purchasing managers surveys is the main driver today  with US sequester and Italian political juggernaut seemingly to be pushed into the background  The US dollar is bid and Italian bonds extended their recovery  The odd man out today is the Japanese yen  It is counter intuitively weak today  Not only has the dollar risen to almost JPY93  a four day high  but the euro is also firmer against the yen and is trying to re establish a foothold above JPY121 in late morning turnover in Europe  The ball got rolling in Asia as China s official manufacturing PMI eased to 50 1 from 50 4 in January  The details were poor  even if not that surprising after the HSBC measure  New orders fell to 50 1 from 51 6 and new export orders fell to 47 3 from 48 5  The take away is that although the world s second largest economy has stabilized after slowing in the H2 2011  Q3 2012  the lift is not particularly impressive and appears fragile  Of note given the concern since the end of the lunar New Year celebration of a tightening bias by the PBOC  input prices fell to 55 5 from 57 2  In Europe  German and French readings edged higher than the flash readings  The surprises were in the euro area were in Spain and Italy  and in opposite direction  Spain s PMI rose to 46 8 from 46 1  and while still below the 50 boom bust level is the best since June 2011  Output and export orders rose  Italy slumped and this was before the election  The 45 8 reading in Feb compares with 47 8 in Jan  This is a three year low  Forward looking orders data  both domestic and foreign were particularly poor  as was employment  The euro  which had edged up to  1 31 in late Asia early Europe  was sold on the PMIs and returned to the week s low near  1 3020  Initial resistance is now seen near  1 3050  While the  1 30 area is thought to contain option structures  which may make it a bit sticky  the next technical objective we have suggested is in the  1 2880 area and note the 200 day moving average is near  1 2845  The UK also surprised negatively  The manufacturing PMI slumped to 47 9 and the Jan reading was revised down to 50 5 from 50 8  There had been some improvement in the Dec Jan period  but today s report dashed hopes for an expansion here in Q1  Output is the weakest since October and employment the weakest since 2009  Forward looking new orders dropped to 46 6 from 49 7  a 7 month low  Adding to the negative news stream was the drop in mortgage approvals and contraction in M4  which suggests weakness in retail sales and that the funding for lending scheme  FLS  is having little impact  Sterling dropped about 1  on the news to approach the  1 50 level  The reaction high has been about  1 5150  which is likely to provide a cap in the North American session  The US see the PMI and ISM and auto sales  While the US economy has downshifted  it does not appear to be contracting  However  efforts to tighten fiscal in Europe  which has produced protracted contractions  is being duplicated in the US  In fact  fiscal policy looks set to tighten more in the US this year than in Europe  Canada reports Q4 GDP figures today ahead of the central bank meeting next week  The consensus is for a 0 6  annualized pace  which includes a 0 2  contraction in Dec  The fundamentals in Canada are weakening  The housing market  broadly understood  is accounting for about 20  of Canada s GDP  compared with 18  in the US in 2005  As the US housing market shows gradual improvement  even if in a saw tooth fashion  the Canadian housing market and construction industry is going in the other direction  Although BOC Carney remains the toast of the town  moving over the BOE in July  he is departure from Canada will not be a moment too early  A month ago  six large Canadian banks were downgraded by Moody s due to exposure to the rising household debt  relative to disposable income greater than in the US or UK at the peak  and exposure to the housing market  Sound familiar   The dollar is moving above CAD1 03 for the first time since the middle of 2012  The next big target is in the CAD1 0450 CAD1 05 area ,2013-03-01,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/poor-pmis-shake-markets-157325,157325

12872,234387,FLS,QE News Push Sterling To Multi Months Low ,opinion,Fundamental AnalysisEconomists were not expecting such a surprise from the BoE  given the perseverance of its inflation which policy makers are trying to bring down However  most economists believed that the BOE would have used other programs such as the Funding for Lending Schemes  FLS  to boost its growth  because the economy is on a verge of triple dip recession  Investors are concerned about this split of 6 3 against further QE as when it last occurred  June 2012   it preceded an expansion of the QE program by  50   title  GBP USD  width  1441  height  753    Technical Analysis The price action has pierced the Bollinger band very sharply on a 30 minute time frame  leaving behind the moving average which is around 1 5416  This could be a good mean reversion opportunity  as price has moved away sharply from its mean  The RSI is also trading in an extreme over sold zone which usually calls for trend reversal Important LevelsSupport Zone1 5298 1 5266Resistance level1 5451 1 5427 DISCLOSURE   DISCLAIMER  The Above Is For Informational Purposes Only And Not To Be Construed As Specific Trading Advice  Responsibility For Trade Decisions Is Solely With The Reader   by Naeem Aslam,2013-02-21,AvaTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qe-news-push-sterling-to-multi-months-low-156138,156138
12878,234393,FLS,Market s Fragile Tone Continues ,opinion,The global capital markets that stabilized yesterday  still seem fragile today  The yen was sold in Asia for the second consecutive session and gold also continued to post corrective upticks  but there are signs that the animal spirits have not been rekindled  Japanese government bond yields are higher  ahead of tomorrow s 20 year bond auction  The market has been reluctant to extend yesterday s gains in the euro and Australian and Canadian dollars  Sterling s gains have actually been reversed and it has been sold to an eight day low against the dollar and a five week low against the euro  The Swedish krona is actually the weakest of the majors today  falling more than 1  in response to the dovish shift by the central bank  While the Riksbank kept rates steady as widely expected  it lowered its trajectory for interest rates to 0 9  by the end of next year from 1 2  Governor Ingves  who has resisted the pressure from the dovish board member  did soften his opposition and new recognizes that a rate cut is more likely than a rate hike  The krona weakened in response  with the euro rising to near 2 month highs near SEK8 4750  Stronger resistance is seen near SEK8 50  The fundamental source of sterling s decline may be traced to the mixed employment report and the MPC minutes  where Governor King was out voted for the third consecutive meeting  The government s  ONS  labor report moved in the opposite direction of the ILO report  According to the government the unemployment rate was revised lower in Feb to 4 6  and that is where it remained in March  The ILO its measure of unemployment rose to 7 9  from 7 8   The government said the claimant count fell by 7k  The ILO shows employment falling 2k  instead of rising by 60k as the Bloomberg consensus expected   Also weighing on sentiment was news that average earnings  reported with another month lag  slipped in February to 0 8  from 1 2   The economic models that many use would suggest that the weakness in wages should exert downward pressure on inflation  Yet  as we saw yesterday  UK CPI remains in the 2 7  2 8  area  where it has been for the past six months  Even the core rate is sticky near 2 4   The BOE minutes were not surprising  The vote to extend QE remained the same 6 3 split as has been the case since the Feb meeting  The minutes suggest that the Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS  may be extended  but with Carney s arrival in July  the window appears to be closing to expand gilt purchases in order to give the new governor a clean slate  Technically  sterling has faltered into front of the resistance we noted near  1 5425  A break now of the  1 5240 area could signal another cent decline to test the trend line drawn off the mid March low near  1 4830  the multi year low  and the early April low near  1 50  That said  the intra day momentum indicators are over stretched  warning North American traders against piling on at this juncture  The Australian dollar has been turned back after approaching the resistance we noted yesterday just above  1 04  Headline news that imports fell 1  in March may not have been the culprit  but the detail that imports of capital good fell 11  on the month was more disturbing  It underscores fears the mining boom is over  Moreover  with Australian commodity prices falling  despite the fall in imports  exports are set to soften as well  What had been a positive terms of trade shock is now moving into reverse  Part of the problem is that the Australian dollar is not unwinding its gains sufficiently  in part due perhaps to the global investor and central bank demand  This prompted one notable economist  one of the architects of the float  to warn of the need for intervention  We do not think it is likely  but it does way on nervous longs among the speculative community  Moreover  on an intra day basis  the Aussie is trying to building a base near  1 0350 and our bias is for a bit of a recovery in North America today  with the  1 0400 10 being an important hurdle  The euro is uninspiring  as it trades in a relatively narrow range at the upper end of yesterday s range  A break of  1 3130 now would sour what appears to be a flattish consolidative tone  The yen remains very much in the center of foreign exchange market  At JPY98 35  the dollar has retraced 68 2  of the losses seen since last week s multi year high  Given what we believe is the importance of Japanese leadership  we suspect the North American session will not finish with the dollar above there  At the same time  our conviction level that the G20 IMF meetings will not criticize BOJ policy continues to grow  We think the market mis understood last week s Treasury report on the foreign exchange market  The market seemed to focus on the statements that indicated it was watching developments closely instead of what we think the real signal was and that is that Japanese officials are back into compliance with the G20  The IMF Deputy MD Shinohara comments suggest the official tact  no problem with current policy aimed at domestic considerations  but monetary policy should be complimented with fiscal and structural reforms  He also played down the recent volatility  claiming that the yen s volatility was not excessive  otherwise it would beg for a response  and that JGB volatility was temporary  The US economic calendar is light  with the main feature being the Fed s Beige book  prepared for the April 30 May 1 FOMC meeting  We expect to see anecdotal reports of economic moderation after what still appears to be near 3  annualized growth in Q1  Lastly  we note that Brazil s central bank meets late today  Most expect a 25 bp hike in the Selic rate  the first since July 2011  A Bloomberg poll found 37 of 58 of those surveyed look for a 25 bp hike  The remainder have it remaining on hold  The dilemma for policy makers is that growth has slowed  while inflation has firmed  Last year s growth of less than 1   was the weakest more than a decade  while inflation last month was rising at its fastest clip in since late 2011 ,2013-04-17,Marc

12879,234394,FLS,Narrowing Spreads Fail To Lift Euro  Dollar Holds Below JPY100 ,opinion,There are two main developments today  The first is the disappointing flash PMI readings from China and the euro zone  The second is a continued rally in European bonds in both absolute terms and relative to Germany  The reduced risk premium in Europe has not coincided with gains in the euro  but to the contrary  the euro has fallen to two week lows and is threatening its 20 day average for the first time in more than three weeks  Ironically  the yen is the big winner  The dollar held below JPY100 again yesterday in the US and failed to even get above JPY99 40 in Asia  In the face of the uptick in the yen  Japanese stocks fared well  with the Nikkei slipping about 0 3   but the smaller cap JASDAQ actually posted a 1 3  gain to bring the year to date rise to over 60   In contrast  China s shares tumbled and the Shanghai Composite shed 2 7   making it the region s worst performer  The HSBC Markit flash PMI came in a 50 5  down from 51 6 in March  The consensus was for a 51 4 reading  Of note  the export component fell to 48 6 from 50 5  The employment measure fell below the 50 boom bust level  Prices also eased  It is not clear if there will be a policy response to the weakness  which the PBOC Governor Zhou seemed to play down recently  noting that it was  normal   At the same time  it seems that any ideas that the dollar yuan band was going to be widened imminently were wide of the mark  Amid uncertainty  Chinese policy makers are unlikely to unveil new foreign exchange initiatives and after grinding higher in recent weeks  the yuan is likely to stabilize  Ironically  it was Germany  not France  that offered the downside surprise in Europe  Germany s flash manufacturing PMI fell to 47 9  The consensus had looked for a 49 0 reading after 48 9 in March  The service sector PMI fell to 49 2 from 51 6  The consensus call was for 51 0  After what appears to be a stagnant Q1      01 0 2    the second quarter is off to a disappointing start  To be sure  France s PMI readings remain dismal  but stabilized in April at well below 50  The manufacturing PMI rose to 44 4 from 43 9  in line with expectations  The service PMI rose to 44 1 from 41 9  a bit above the 42 0 consensus forecast  but still deeply in contracting mode  We argued that at the ECB meeting earlier this month  Draghi had used word cues to indicate that a refi rate cut was possible in the coming period if the economic data deteriorated  Several officials have subsequently echoed this sentiment and today s flash PMI reports can only strengthen the speculation of a rate cut as early as next month  Meanwhile  the peripheral bond markets in Europe remain on fire  Italy s 2 year yield is at record lows and the 10 year yield is slipping through 4  today for the first time since late 2010  Optimism is running high that a new government could be in place in the next couple of days  Of note  the regional election held in Friuli produced a narrow PD victory  but more significant was the waning of support for Grillo s 5 Star Movement  which saw its support fall below 20   Spanish bonds are also rallying  helped by another successful bill auction and news that the EC appears ready to grant it another year to reach the 3  deficit target  Portuguese bonds also fully participating in the advance  with 10 year yields at new 2 1 2 year lows  In the past  many observers saw the premium the periphery had to pay over Germany as a key to the euro s performance  Yet Spain and Italy s premium over Germany on 10 year bonds has narrowed by 36 bp over the past month  the bulk coming in the past week  and yet the euro has found little solace  The UK reported poor CBI industrial trends  The  25 reading was well below the  14 consensus expectation and shows a sharp deterioration from the  11 reading in March  Sterling itself is is flirting with support near  1 5200 and the 5 day moving average is slipping below the 20 day average for the first time since March 19  Meanwhile  there is some speculation that Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborn will announce an extension of the Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS   which appears to have helped support mortgage lending  Separately  the sterling overnight index average  SONIA  appears to be discounting the likelihood that the BOE  perhaps under new management this summer  will announce plans to buy GBP80 bln of gilts   reported a dismal employment report and this has renewed speculation that although an outspoken dove may be leaving the Riksbank board  another rate cut cannot be ruled out  The unemployment rate spiked to 8 8  from 8 5   The krona has come under more pressure and the euro is testing the SEK8 60 level for the first time in two months  This is roughly where the downtrend line drawn off last year s highs comes in  A convincing break would give SEK8 70 as the next target  The Federal Reserve meets in a week s time  The minutes of recent meetings show that some members are still talking about a gradual exit from QE later this year  We have consistently argued that the Troika of Bernanke  Yellen and Dudley are the key and that they are clearly argue that it is too early exit  A recent Bloomberg survey of 21 primary dealers found a majority  14  do not expect the Fed to taper off its buying until Q1 14  12 do not expect purchases to cease until mid 2014 or later  and 15 do not expect the first hike in the Fed funds rate before mid 2015  Of note  one investment house does not see the first hike before the beginning of 2016  Another does not envision any tapering off for two years and four expect the purchases to continue into 2015  At the other end of the spectrum  one bank expects the tapering off to begin in Q3 and two primary dealers expect the Fed to end QE at the end of this year  We do not read any hidden agenda in news that Fed Chairman Bernanke will not attend the annual Jackson Hole confab this year  His absence will likely dovetail with speculation of his replacement  As we have argued  there seems to be an informal two term limit in the post

12881,234396,FLS,Dollar Suffers Biggest Drop In 11 Months  Will RBA Curb Aussie s Rally ,opinion,Dollar Suffers Biggest Tumble in 11 Months  Where was Risk Aversion  The dollar dropped against all of its liquid counterparts to open this week and the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index  USDollar  suffered its sharpest single day decline since June 29  2012  While a late day advance for US equities offered a pro risk theme to shore up the fundamental reasoning for the benchmark currency s slump   the move speaks to the market s other major theme  speculation on stimulus and the  taper   Through May  the dollar charged higher against the current of speculative appetite reflected in the standard bearer S P 500 s climb  The stock market s source of strength has been the latent momentum behind the stimulus build up by the Fed over the past few years   which is running more and more on familiarity rather than fresh help  From the currency  the early speculation that the open ended stimulus regime would take its first step back from constant escalation in the coming months or weeks drew the skeptics fearing the moderation of stimulus and its risk impact   Between the positive performance for the S P 500 and the US dollar   along with the assumptions for stimulus and risk trends that both carry   one side of this unbalanced equation was bound to give  Though it held out as long as it could  it was the greenback that cracked first  As dubious as the outlook for growth  income  earnings and yield are  the market is still positioning for higher yields  in other words  chasing yield    Monday  the gap was forced close by a specific piece of event risk  the ISM manufacturing report for May  The 49 0 reading was the lowest in nearly four years and reflects a contraction for the same sector that led the US economy to its recovery back in 2009 2010  That could have been interpreted as a  risk negative  outcome  but the restrained equity and futures showed investors weren t going to be shaken from their trades on the read  On the other hand  the dollar was quick to react to the data with a selloff that began immediately after the data   A distinct sign of what is most important to the market psyche now  despite the reserved reaction from equities to the factory activity report  the USDollar put in for an immediate tumble after the print  A reading that points to sputtering US growth supports the call for patience the majority of the FOMC officials called for when they said they wanted to see consistent strength in forthcoming data  It was unlikely that the QE3 taper would be announced in June before the data  but now it is likely viewed as a certainty  The dollar can ease back further should the trade report  NFPs or Fed speeches further squash such speculation  However  don t forget that general risk aversion can also drive the dollar higher   Japanese Yen  Nikkei 225 and Capital Spending Defy Abe There was little support from the markets and economic docket to support the efficacy of the Japanese government s and central bank s influence over the economy and financial system  Monday  the yen advanced a fourth consecutive day  the Nikkei 225 dropped another 3 7 percent and first quarter capital spending dropped another 3 9 percent through the first quarter  All of this contradicts the efforts policy officials are putting forward  Yet  we shouldn t take this as the definitive assessment of whether  Abenomics  will be successful or not  Particularly for the markets  moderation after the preceding run up is reasonable  Meanwhile  the BoJ reported the monetary base posted its second fastest pace  31 6 percent  in four decades   hitting an unprecedented  159 trillion  If the yen drops it won t be due to the BoJ s lack of trying   Australian Dollar  Will the RBA Curb Aussies Best Rally in Nearly a Year  The AUD USD posted an impressive 2 1 percent rally Monday   the biggest daily advance since November 30  2011  Part of this strength was owed to the US dollar s own weakness  but a market wide advance for the Aussie currency shows that there was a more complex fundamental backdrop  A slow climb since the early Asia session shows some reaction to the better than expected print for Chinese manufacturing activity on Saturday  Add to that the Australian manufacturing jump and first quarter corporate profit figures  and there was enough of a groundswell for a fundamental rebound  This morning  we have seen the current account deficit shrink further than expected  A 8 5 billion   yet that comes alongside news that foreign holdings of Aussie government debt hit a 3Q 2010 low   evidence of the diversification discussed previously  Coming up  the market is pricing in a modest 15 percent probability of an RBA 25bp rate cut  A hold would likely allow Aussie continuation   Euro Balance of Growth and Austerity Tipping Once AgainThe Euro dropped against most of its counterparts   with the notable exception of EURUSD advance  The docket held the second round reports for Euro area manufacturing activity  but the improvements hardly negated recession fears  Far more interesting were headlines like Fitch s downgrade of Cyprus  they upgraded Greece two weeks ago  and news that German Chancellor Merkel was backing away from an open ended growth support for Europe  We will learn more when the Finance Minister speaks at his CDU election platform discussion   British Pound  BoE Reports Borrowing Recedes  Rescue Effort Ineffective Are financial and economic conditions in the UK improving enough to negate Bank of England intervention  According to the central bank  financial firms in the region borrowed  300 million less from the Funds for Lending Scheme  FLS  through the first quarter  However  this is hardly evidence of improved financing and rather reflects shrinking demand  The BoE rate decision is due Thursday   Canadian Dollar  USD CAD Drops Back Below 1 0300 Before Trade Data While the Canadian dollar suffered at the hands of its higher yielding counterparts and was a mixed bag elsewhere  USD CAD s slump back below 1 3000 certain improves the loonie s bearing in the FX market  A

12891,234406,FLS,Flowserve  FLS  Q3 Earnings Surpass Estimates,opinion,"Flowserve  FLS  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 59 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 56 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 49 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 36   A quarter ago  it was expected that this company that makes pumps  valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries would post earnings of  0 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 54  delivering a surprise of 5 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Flowserve  which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing   General Industrial industry  posted revenues of  996 54 million for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 08   This compares to year ago revenues of  952 72 million  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Flowserve shares have added about 31 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 1  
What s Next for Flowserve 
While Flowserve has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Flowserve was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 66 on  1 08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 19 on  3 96 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

12894,234409,FLS,5 FX Drivers For The Week Ahead ,opinion,The US dollar s recent losses are being extended at the start of the new week  The announcement of the details of the Greek bond buy back scheme has triggered a sharp rally in peripheral bond yields  while the euro area November manufacturing PMI is reported at 8 month highs  even if still below the 50 boom  bust level at 46 2  The euro has completely recouped the knee jerk losses scored in thin activity just before the weekend when Moody s announced a cut in the ratings for the EFSF  which follows its recent downgrade of France  In addition  we note that the weekend press shows little progress in the US deficit talks  Asian equities eked out a minor gain  though of note  the rise in China s PMI did not bolster the Shanghai Composite  which lost 1  to close a new multi year lows  European bourses are higher and the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is up about 0 4   led by technology  basic materials and industrials   We see five main drivers of the foreign exchange market  and capital markets more broadly in the week ahead  Central Bank Meetings  Five central banks meeting in the coming days  They are the Reserve Bank of Australia  the Bank of Canada  the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  the European Central Bank and the Bank of England  The only central bank that appears poised to move is the RBA  A weakening of forward looking indicators  a deterioration in the terms of trade  and official discomfort with the over valued exchange rate makes a compelling case for a 25 bp rate cut that has largely been discounted in the forward market   Such a rate cut will still leave Australia with the highest real and nominal policy rate  While there has been some talk of a 50 bp cut  such a move would come as a surprise  Not only would it likely spur a sell off in the Aussie  but would have knock on effects on the New Zealand dollar as well  as the market moves to discount some chance of a rate cut there as well   The series of soft Canadian data could see the BoC adopt more neutral language as it explains keeping rates steady  The ECB is still focused on its transmission mechanism and OMT  If a rate cut is forthcoming  it seems far more likely in Q1 13 than now  The Bank of England balked last month in extending its gilt purchase program  Very little has changed since then  Like the ECB  a move from the BOE is more likely next year than now  More important are two events prior to the BOE meeting  The BOE provided little insight into its Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS   which is another unconventional way to ease credit conditions  Some 35 institutions participated  although only six have actually borrowed  total of GBP4 4 bln   Seems less than inspiring  but it is admittedly a bit early to reach any hard and fast conclusions  The day before the BOE meeting Chancellor Osborn will deliver his Autumn Statement on fiscal policy to the House of Commons  With Moody s and Fitch having a negative outlook for the UK s debt rating  its AAA status looks increasing vulnerable  US  The fiscal cliff remains a key concern of investors  The verbal jousting creates headline risk  which we suspect is diminishing as it becomes clearer that no agreement is likely until the very last minute  if even then  We continue to think the political incentives are such that a resolution is more likely after going over the cliff for a short period of time  In the meantime  the US economy is slowing markedly from the 2 7  revised pace in Q3  Growth may be halved  if not more  Part of this  like the decline in personal consumption expenditures  is picking up the impact of the east coast storm  On the other hand  November auto sales may have been buoyed by the storm and may be near their best levels of the year  Americans may not be as fortunate with the employment report at the end of the week  The employment report is notoriously difficult to forecast and the impact of the storm only compounds that difficulty  The October job growth was put at 171k  The early consensus is for about 90k  In any event  the risk appears on the downside  though the BLS will likely try to estimate the impact of the storm   Even without the storm s disruptions  the key troika at the Federal Reserve  Bernanke  Yellen and Dudley  were still unsatisfied with the pace of job growth  With Operation Twist nearly complete  and the Fed s holdings of short dated coupons minimal  we expect the FOMC to announce on December 12 that will roll into QE3  the  45 bln a month in Treasury purchases  bringing the monthly total purchases to  85 bln  Japan   The rhetoric of Shinzo Abe  who most likely will be the next Japanese prime minister in a couple of weeks  has been more successful in changing market sentiment toward the yen than the  100 bln plus intervention in Oct Nov 2011  That intervention drove the dollar up about 5 5  against the yen  The dollar has risen 7 2  against the yen since Abe began threatening to debase the currency   As the  illustrates  speculators have amassed a large net and gross short yen position  Foreign investors    are also favoring Japanese equities over bonds  unlike earlier this year  The return on Japanese equities tends to be greater than the return on fixed income in a weak yen environment  We do not see the incentives to fight the weakening trend in the yen  However  this will leave the market vulnerable to profit taking or  sell the rumor and buy the fact  type of activity after the election on December 16  China  While the world s largest economy is slowing in Q4  the second largest economy appear to be poised to snap a seven quarter slowdown  The official manufacturing PMI was reported over the weekend  It rose to 50 6 from 50 2 in October  for the third consecutive monthly gain and now stands at its highest level since April  Importantly  the headline was driven by the forward looking new orders component  which is at seven month highs  and exports  which rose above 50 for the first time in six months  Output itself also rose to its highest level in six months  The yuan has appreciated about 2 25  against the dollar in the past four months  but may now consolidate for into next year  Despite the yuan s appreciation  it has lagged behind several key Asian currencies  including the South Korean won and Taiwanese dollar  Coupled with the yen s depreciation  the South Korean and Taiwanese producers are being squeezed from both directions  This may reinforce official efforts to cap further currency appreciation  Separately  while China s territorial dispute with Japan continues to simmer  tensions with others in the South China Sea have escalated  China recently claimed the right to board and search vessels that pass through the disputed area  which is nearly the entire sea  Several countries  including the Philippines have protested  Last week  China s passport maps which depict the disputed islands as all belonging to China irked the Philippines  Taiwan  Vietnam and the Indonesia  Europe   Details of Greece s bond buy back scheme have been announced and will be conducted by December 7  in time for the next EU Summit to secure the funds that will be used to pay back the country s mostly official creditors  The voluntary nature of participation is suspect as the finance minister claimed Greek banks should participate out of patriotism  Greek pension funds will not have to participate following comments by the prime minister indicated that those obligations are regarded as  arrears  of the state   Greek banks appear willing to participate  in part  because they are carrying the bonds on their books at lower prices that will prevail in the buy back  which cannot be above the Nov 23 closing price   Some hedge funds that bought the bonds at rock bottom prices can nearly double their return  If participation is poor and Greece cannot reduce its outstanding debt by 20 bln euros  the entire deal  recently struck after protracted discussions  may fall apart  Following the recent election  coalition talks in Catalonia may be an important consideration for if and when Madrid formally requests aid  A coalition that would strengthen the drive toward a referendum and a confrontation with Madrid would be the center right nationalist CIU and the center left ERC  Mas and the CIU called for a referendum in 4 years  while the ERC wants it by September 2013  The CIU is also holding talks with the Socialists  but in either configuration  it is difficult to see much enthusiasm for the CIU s austerity agenda ,2012-12-03,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-fx-drivers-for-the-week-ahead-145929,145929

12897,234412,FLS,Bank Of England Preview  No Move From The MPC ,opinion,We expect the Bank of England to remain on hold at Thursday s Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  meeting  We think the BoE will stay in wait and see mode in the near future  As consensus is almost unanimous on unchanged policy  we expect a muted market reaction following the MPC decision   Recent indicators point to a moderate improvement in the UK economy and we expect it to take a substantial setback in leading indicators to trigger more stimuli from the MPC  Note  however  that there is still significant uncertainty relating to fiscal tightening in coming years   The recent MPC minutes as well as public statements from MPC members indicate a great trust in the Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS   boosting credit growth and ultimately overall activity  We have looked at recent developments in loan flows   Moderate improvement in leading indicators    In the latest Inflation Report  the MPC revised its forecasts on GDP and now expects a gradual rebound in UK activity  to reach 2  y y growth at the end of 2013  The recovery was once again revised downwards and the MPC now forecasts GDP to remain below its pre crisis level until the end of 2015  Despite the very moderate growth expectations  the signals from MPC members suggest a satisfaction with current policy and that it would take a setback in the recovery to trigger any additional stimulus   We have seen a gradual improvement in data in 2012  UK manufacturing PMI increased to 49 1 in November  from 47 5   Manufacturing PMI has been very volatile in the past year underpinning the great uncertainties in the UK economy  When we correct the latest seemingly strong Q3 12 GDP number for the disruptions from the Jubilee holiday and the Olympics  we estimate an improvement of underlying growth 0 2 0 4  q q   The Inflation Report forecasts inflation to remain above 2  until 2014  reaching the monetary target later than previously expected  However  several MPC members have since the last meeting indicated that the door for additional QE has not been closed and that domestically generated inflation is not a major concern  It is worth mentioning that the statements have been made from members not usually associated with a dovish stand  e g  Bean  Fisher   Weale  suggesting that the distance from additional QE may not be as big as the minutes from the November meeting indicated   In various public statements as well as highlighted in the past two MPC minutes  the effect of additional QE has been discussed  Hence  it seems that the majority of MPC members place a greater trust in the Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS  to boost credit growth and ultimately overall activity  With recent statistics in mind  it is not an overstatement to conclude that the FLS has had a slow start To Read the Entire Report Please Click on the pdf File Below ,2012-12-05,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bank-of-england-preview:-no-move-from-the-mpc-146317,146317
12898,234413,FLS,India s Gold Investment Picks Up,opinion,Today it appears as though the gold price is going to remain in Christmas Sale mode as it looks to finish today on its second week of decline Those who concerned with the slowdown in gold investment in India can relax a little as it showed signs of recovery yesterday A Bloomberg survey showed gold traders are at their least bullish in 14 weeks  Bloomberg attribute this to Goldman Sachs  earlier declaration that gold had already peaked  However  given this is a survey which looks at the gold market over a number of weeks rather than months or years  it is not surprising gold traders are feeling slightly more bearish given gold s reaction to fiscal cliff talks which will continue on into the next few weeks  As long as the fiscal cliff discussions continue  we are likely to see sentiment in the gold market and gold bullion investment affected Gold Bullion Investment And Political TalesYesterday the gold price did make some gains as Draghi indicated that there may be a cut in rates next year as the economy looks set to continue to contract As Zerohedge pointed out yesterday  despite Draghi s insistence that  significant  progress had been made  the numbers tell a different story   Euro zone youth unemployment is at a record 23 9  but Spain and Italy saw the biggest jumps  to 55 9  and 36 5  respectively   Greece remains the worst at over 56  based on last data  while Germany rests at 8 1   As someone said on the BBC s Question Time last night  we might deal with all this a little better if we didn t feel we were being lied to and patronised all the time Speaking of the UK  the MPC decided to hold rates at the low of 0 5  yesterday and there were no further changes to QE  Some analysts believe the committee is falling out of love with QE and is now favouring its Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS   It seems the MPC has given up on QE boosting demand and is instead relying on the FLS to boost consumer spending through increasing credit and corporate investment The UK s citizens are still muddling their way through the Autumn Statement in an attempt to understand how they have been affected  As we often see after such statements  another think tank or institute has to come along and tell us what it all really means and how realistic it all is  This morning the Institute of Fiscal Studies say that further spending cuts will be seen in 2015  whilst too much fiscal consolidation is coming from tax hikes rather than cutting spending Today  look out for US non farm payroll data which is expected to show a sharp fall in November  thanks to Hurricane Sandy no doubt  Later next week the US Fed will announce its decision on monetary policy  the decision will be interesting given the political pressure over the fiscal cliff Please Note  Information published here is provided to aid your thinking and investment decisions  not lead them  You should independently decide the best place for your money  and any investment decision you make is done so at your own risk  Data included here within may already be out of date ,2012-12-07,Jan Skoyles,https://www.investing.com/analysis/india's-gold-investment-picks-up-146631,146631

12900,234415,FLS,7 Market Drivers For The Week Ahead ,opinion,There are seven items that will be on the radar screen of global investors in the week ahead   1  There is confusion over Fed policy  Despite the leadership  Bernanke  Yellen and Dudley  demonstrating their unwavering commitment to use heterodox monetary policy in an attempt to promote a stronger economy in the face of household de leveraging and fiscal consolidation  many have read the FOMC minutes to imply an early end to the  85 bln a month in long term asset  MBS and Treasuries   That December meeting was historic not because it marked the beginning of the end of QE  but the exact opposite  it provided for the nearly doubling of monthly purchases and the adoption of macro economic guidance  6 5  unemployment and 2 5  inflation  before rates are lifted   2  A few elements of the recent price action strike us as important  The euro  Swiss franc and sterling bounced off key trend line supports and this points to further recovery from the sharp decline seen in the first few days of the new year  The yen remains on a weakening trend  Japanese government encouragement may slow when the dollar nears JPY90  The dollar bloc currencies and many of the more liquid and freely accessible emerging market currencies  including the Mexican peso  South African rand and the Turkish lira  also appear poised to trade higher against the US dollar  The VIX posted an unprecedented large decline last week and the S P 500 closed at new 5 year highs  The higher risk appetites have also weighed on core bonds and lifted European peripheral bonds  especially Italy and Spain  This in turn tends to be positive for their financial sectors  It also reduces the pressure on Spain to seek a formal aid package from the EU and trigger the ECB s Outright Market Transaction program   3  The ECB meets on Thursday  According to reports  a majority of the governing council favored a cut in December  The unchanged outcome was a function of a concession to the Draghi and the German representatives  according to the same reports  With the PMI readings pointing to a continued contraction  and private sector lending contracting for three months  it is tempting to expect the ECB to cut the refi rate by 25 bp  However  we suspect the ECB will stand pat again  The weak economic data was largely within ECB expectations and price pressures appear to have increased into the year end period  If the regional economic data does not improve substantially  a rate cut in the coming months is possible   4  The Bank of England meets on Thursday  It is less likely than the ECB to change rates or announce a new gilt purchase program  The BOE seems content to monitor the progress of the Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS   which appears to have boosted some mortgage lending  More interesting on Thursday will be the National Statisticians recommendation for changes in the the Retail Price Index  Like the US  the UK is considering changing the inflation calculation used with an eye toward lowing government obligations  in the US case Social Security benefits and in the UK inflation link bonds and some pensions    5  The immediate focus in Japan is on monetary policy  The BOJ meets Jan 21 22  It is to review the 1  inflation target it adopted a little less than a year ago  The government hopes it will raise it to 2   In fact  as ironic as it may seem  the BOJ can preserve its relative independence by capitulating to the government s demands in some form  This will mean the government is less likely to change the BOJ s charter  Sometimes losing a battle allows one to win a war  The BOJ will participate in a meeting the government is hosting this week to begin coordinating its policy response to what is sees as a economic emergency  The Council of Economics and Fiscal Policy will likely discuss ways finally overcome the 15 year old scourge of deflation  Late in the week  Japan is expected to report a November trade deficit  but an overall current account surplus   6  China s monthly data dump begins in the second half of the week  On balance  we expect more evidence that the world s second largest economy has stopped slowing  even if the lift is still modest  Renminbi loans may have increased slightly in December from November s almost CNY523 bln pace  An increase in both exports and imports would also lend credence to ideas that there is an underlying improvement taking place  A CPI around November s 2  would maximize the official room to maneuver   7  Highlights from the other emerging markets include a likely 25 bp rate hike by Poland s central bank  Thailand and South Korea s central bank also meet in the week ahead  but on balance  no change in official rates are expected  Indonesia s central bank meets and it may narrow the rate corridor by lifting the floor  FASB  25 bp to 4 25   but keeping the key rate steady at 5 75   Lastly  while we noted the expectation for improved Chinese imports and exports  India does not look as fortunate  The fall in India s exports and imports will likely result in a larger trade deficit ,2013-01-07,Marc

12901,234416,FLS,BoE  No Change In Policy  But Discussions On Inflation Mandate ,opinion,We expect the Bank of England  BoE  to remain on hold at Thursday s Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  meeting  Any policy changes on Thursday would be a surprise  All analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect both unchanged rates and that the Asset Purchase Facility  APF  will be kept on hold at GBP375bn   At the November meeting  the effects of a rate cut were discussed with the conclusion that a cut might prove counterproductive for aggregate demand as a whole  Staff analysis points to a likely reduction in the profitability for lenders  where in particular building societies have loans with interest terms linked to the Bank Rate  Hence  we expect the Bank Rate to be floored at the current 0 50  and a possible rate hike seems a long way off given the weakness of the UK recovery   The general tone in the December minutes indicates that the MPC is in a wait and see mode  The BoE forecasts a slow recovery of the UK economy and it is still too early to judge the effects from the Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS   Inflation is expected to remain above 2  for most of 2013 and the members stated that  developments on the month had done little to alter the balance of arguments between maintaining and increasing the size of the monetary stimulus    In a speech in mid December  MPC member Spencer Dale outlined his stance against more quantitative easing  QE   stating he would not have voted for more QE even in the absence of the Treasury s decision to transfer APF coupons  equivalent to a monetary expansion in the short run   as e g  Bent Broadbent stated he would  As a lone minority voter  David Miles has been voting in favour of increasing the size by a further GBP25bn for two months  As this is not an unusual position for Mr Miles  he was a minority voter six times in 2012   we do not expect many more MPC members to support this for now   While data on actual lending to households remained broadly flat in November and the first statistics on FLS point to a slow start  BoE s 2012 Q4 Credit Condition Survey points to an improvement in UK lenders  willingness to supply of credit  It will be some months before the effectiveness of FLS can be assessed  Nevertheless  it seems that the MPC has faith that the FLS will ease credit conditions and feed through to the real economy   The Bank of Canada s governor  Mark Carney  will take over from Sir Mervyn King in July 2013  This will be interesting given Carney s recent statement that central banks should consider more radical measures such as clearer policy guidance  see Research UK  NGDP level targeting in the UK don t ignore it  12 December 2012   Carney s speech on new policy measures and guidance has started a wide discussion on BoE s inflation mandate  However  changes are remote as the Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  stated  inflation targeting had served the country well  and  benefits would have to be substantial to warrant a shift   Nonetheless  the discussion should be followed closely as a shift to  for instance  nominal GDP targeting could have substantial market implications   If we are right and BoE remains on hold  we expect a muted market reaction To Read the Entire Report Please Click on the pdf File Below ,2013-01-07,Danske Markets,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/boe:-no-change-in-policy,-but-discussions-on-inflation-mandate-149875",149875

12924,234439,FLS,Bernanke And The Fed s Options ,opinion,Many observers continue to clamor for a new round of asset purchases from the Federal Reserve  They were disappointed when the FOMC statement and press conference after last months meeting failed to provide fresh clues  They were disappointed again with the minutes from that meeting  They were disappointed again yesterday when Fed chairman Bernanke did not play up the likelihood of QE3   This does not mean  however  that the Fed is content with the status quo  Indeed the Fed is reviewing its options  Bernanke listed several options for the Fed  These include purchasing Treasuries and mortgage backed securities  changing the Fed s guidance  cutting the interest on excessive reserves  and using the discount window for direct lending   Bernanke seemed clear   We haven t really come to a specific choice at this point  but we are looking for ways to address the weakness in the economy should more action be needed to promote a sustained recovery in the labor market     The problem is that the combination of Fed policy  the disappointing economic data and the European debt crisis have pushed US interest rates to historically low levels  It is not just Treasury yields that have fallen  The spread between corporate bonds and Treasuries has fallen for six consecutive weeks  The spread between commercial paper and T bills has fallen  Mortgage rates have fallen   Nevertheless  Bernanke identified still tight borrowing conditions for some market segments  which he believes are still a headwind on the economy  This suggests a subtle shift from reducing the cost of borrowing to increasing the availability of credit   On a couple of occasions now Bernanke has expressed interest in the UK s attempt to bolster lending through a new program  funding for lending scheme   FLS   It is essentially a collateral swap  Banks can swap loans to households and businesses with the BOE for T bills  which then can be used to secure cheaper funding in repos  for example  The program allows banks to draw on up to 5  of their loan book  For banks increasing their loan book  the FLS can reduce sterling borrowing costs considerably  from around 150 bp to closer to 50 bp Even if a bank reduces its loan book marginally  pays a modest penalty  there is still a savings to be had   The Federal Reserve is engaged in Operation Twist  It is reducing its holdings of short term securities  This means operationally it cannot duplicate the BOE s program  even if it wanted to  Hence  Bernanke s hint at the possible use of the discount window   As is widely appreciated  the discount window is neither a discount nor a window  The so called discount rate is set 50 bp on top of Fed funds  Although Bernanke s comments have not been fleshed out  he may be considering lowering the discount rate penalty for banks expanding their loan book  perhaps in general or perhaps for household  including mortgage loans  and small businesses  The duration of discount window borrowings could be extended to a year  from 90 days   A wide range of collateral is also accepted   US banks have about  6 trillion of household and business loans  If the program was the same size as the UK s  which can be as much as 5  of UK bank loan book  it would entail about  300 bln  This would boost the Fed s balance sheet but in a different way that the first two rounds of QE  It would link more closely lending and lower cost funding   There are some counter arguments  For example  unlike in the UK  and the euro area   US bank lending is not contracting  but instead rising modestly   5    Interbank rates are also lower in the US than in the UK  and euro area    There are three take aways from this discussion  First  the key decision makers at the Fed  we have referred to them as the real Troika or BYD  Bernanke  Yellen and Dudley  are concerned about the faltering growth and the stalling out of the labor market improvement  Second  they are looking at existing tools and other options  Third  Bernanke himself seems to look sympathetically to what his one time classmate and BOE Governor King is doing  Although it cannot be precisely duplicated in the US  it seems Bernanke believes it can be tailored to the US circumstances and may involve using the discount window  Some of the opposition to QE in the form of buying Treasuries is that it blurs the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy  Using of the discount window or other facilities tied closer to private sector lending  may overcome some of the objections ,2012-07-19,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bernanke-and-the-fed's-options-130051,130051
12925,234440,FLS,Yen Sold Off Broadly Following US Treasuries  Aussie Reversing,opinion,The biggest development last week was the broad based selloff in the Japanese yen  which followed rally in US Treasury yield on receding expectation on additional easing from Fed  Another development to note was aussie s decoupling with risk markets and the selloff intensified after treasury noted RBA could cut rates due to the currency s strength  The euro  on the other hand  remained steady with Spanish yield continuing to dip on expectation of ECB actions in September Sterling was supported by solid economic data  Nonetheless  strength in European majors were generally limited  Technically  while stock markets extended recent up trend with S P 500 edging higher to close at 1418  we d maintain our view that reversal is imminent as it should face strong resistance from 1422 high  And should stocks reverse  the already weak aussie will be sold off deeper and such development could limit yen s weakness Even though we re favoring more upside in European majors  the current development doesn t give us much confidence in it  So  firstly  we d prefer AUD USD short in the near term  Secondly  while we d also favor USD JPY long  we ll be cautious at it hits 80 psychological level  Thirdly  we d avoid European majors Recent economic data from US were mixed to positive  with strong retail sales figures in July even though regional fed surveys disappointed  A key event ahead in the month is Fed Chairman Bernanke s speech at Jackson Hole conference in August 31  And  recent developments dented the hope for Bernanke to announce anything significant in this traditionally important event  The markets are still leaning towards the case for the Fed to do another round of easing  But that would require some substantially weak economic data to push Fed to act The receding expectation of QE3 from Fed was clearly reflected in the surge in treasury yield last week  10 year yield jumped to close at 1 816   comparing to prior week s close of 1 649   The move was even more impressive when comparing with the intraday historical low of 1 394  made on July 24  that is  less than a month ago  The 30 year yield rose to close at 2 934   comparing to prior week s close of 2 806  and the intraday low of 2 452  made on July 25  The jump in yield pushed USD JPY and other yen crosses higher with USD JPY set to taken on 80 psychological level soon BoJ minutes also exerted some pressure on the yen  Minutes of the July 11 12 meeting of BoJ unveiled that a few members warned that Japan s economy  could be adversely affected through various channels if  for example  a substantial risk materialized  stemming from the European debt problem   And  these members urged to bank to  stand ready to take appropriate actions without ruling out any options in advance   Nonetheless  the bank s view is that  growth prospects will likely remain broadly unchanged   Regarding inflation  CPI is expected to be  broadly inline with the April forecasts   At that meeting  BoJ voted unanimously to keep rates unchanged at 0 0 1  and maintained the scale of stimulus program at JPY 70T  Japan s GDP grew only 0 3  qoq in 2Q12  well below expectations of 0 6  qoq and 1 2  qoq in the first quarter  The major disappointment came from weak consumer spending  Although the government has been giving subsidies on a number of green products since the earthquake last year  the impact on stimulating spending has been limited  As the positive effect of the subsidies fades  Japan s consumption outlook is expected to weaken further in coming quarters  an outlook that would hurt investors  confidence In the eurozone  Spanish 10 year yield dipped further to settle at 6 443  last week  and is now comfortably below the 7  unsustainable level  Spanish bonds was supported by news that Spanish is ready to seek a sovereign bailout at a meeting of finance ministers next month  And as Spain requests for aid  ECB would restart bond purchase as part of an overall package  Also  it s reported that Spain s Bankia will receive an emergency disbursement from the EUR 100b bank bailout program soon due to dropping for the plan for Bankia to get loan from ECB due to restrictions imposed on bank borrowings Meanwhile  sentiments were generally lifted after German Chancellor Merkel voiced her support to ECB s effort on fighting the debt crisis  Merkel stated that policymakers  feel committed to do everything  they can  in order to maintain the common currency   She also affirmed that Draghi s decisions have  made it clear that the ECB is counting on political action in the form of conditionality as the precondition for a positive development of the euro   These comments indicated that Germany has moved away from the opposition position over the ECB s purchases of Spanish and Italian bonds and further affirm the chance that ECB will be acting soon  Though  a risk to note is that Greek prime minister Samaras  facing deepening recession in the country  is set to meet with Luxemburg prime minister Juncker  German chancellor Merkel and French president Hollande next week to persuade eurozone leaders to extend the time of austerity from two years to four years  up till 2016 Meanwhile  eurozone data showed French GDP was flat qoq in Q2  comparing to expectation of  0 1  qoq contraction  German GDP grew 0 3  qoq comparing to consensus of 0 1  qoq  Greek GDP contracted  6 2  yoy in Q2  suggesting the recession continued and implementation of fiscal austerity measures would be more difficult  Eurozone Q2 GDP showed  0 2  qoq as expected August BOE minutes indicated that policymakers voted unanimously to leave the Bank rate unchanged at 0 5  and adopt no change in asset purchases  Yet  it also unveiled that some members favored more easing  Unlike previous minutes  the August one did not hint that the BOE is biased for further rate cut  We believe the BOE would gauge the impact of the new Funding for Lending  FLS  scheme before implementing additional easing measures  As such  the most likely of further easing would be in November  when the 50B pound of asset purchases is completed and the impact of the FLS would be reflected in the economy  Economic data from UK was also solid  Claimant count unexpectedly dropped  5 9k in July and unemployment rate also unexpectedly improved to 8 0  in June  Headline retail sales rose 0 3  mom  2 8  yoy in July versus expectation of 0 0  mom  1 5  yoy  Ex auto  fuel sales was flat mom  rose 3 3   also better than consensus of  0 2  mom  1 7  yoy  CPI unexpectedly rose back to 2 6  yoy in July while core CPI also rose back to 2 3  yoy  Both were much higher than expectation of 2 3  yoy and 2 0  yoy respectively  RPI also beat expectation and rose more than expected to 3 2  yoy   The Australian dollar dipped sharply against US dollar after an Australian treasury report noted that RBA could cut rate further on aussie s strength  The report noted that aussie is  well above its post float average  and is  overvalued compared to its medium to long run equilibrium value   While Treasury economist thought that intervention might lead to market instability  they do believe that thee are rooms for RBA to cut rates if the strength of aussie inflicts too much pressure on the economy

12926,234441,FLS,FX Outlook  How The US Dollar Could Trade In Q4,opinion,The lack of U S  data over the weekend gives us the opportunity to take a step back and actively consider what could be in store for the U S  dollar in the fourth quarter  The year has flown by quickly and after this week  the third quarter will officially come to an end  For most portfolio managers and professional investors  this means 2 more months of hard core trading before the volatility in the financial markets dries up due to the holidays  Not only will the U S  Presidential Election be taking place in the fourth quarter  but the next few months will also be an important test of the effectiveness of central banks  2012 has been a tough year for the U S  dollar  The most significant losses occurred over the past 2 months and in that period alone  the dollar underperformed every major currency  dropping more than 6  against the euro  Yet the price action in the FX market over the past week has many investors wondering whether the dollar is consolidating before a larger move lower or attempting to bottom  To answer this question  we take a look at the factors driving the dollar right now  the impact of central bank monetary policies and the 3 parts of the world that pose the greatest risks for the U S  dollar in the fourth quarter Like it Or Not   Central Banks Take Credit for Driving Stocks Higher and Dollar LowerImproving risk appetite is the main reason why the U S  dollar performed so poorly over the last 2 months  While the U S  economy is still in rough shape and Americans are only cautiously optimistic  U S  stocks have performed extremely well  Last week the S P 500 climbed to its highest level in 4 years  which is surprising because this hardly feels like a well supported rally  Job growth in the U S  has been anemic  consumer spending is stagnating  Europe is still a mess and China is slowing  True  corporate earnings have been better than expected but that doesn t say much when companies have been lowering the bar  So why in the world are stocks rallying  The answer is simple   central banks and their persistent demand for government bonds  The Federal Reserve  European Central Bank  Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have been doing everything in their power to make government and corporate bonds unattractive to investors  With interest rates at record lows  the only place investors can turn to for yield and return are equities  Some investors moved into stocks early and others followed shortly thereafter as they look at what they can get from stocks versus bonds  While it can certainly be argued that the rally in stocks can t last because of global headwinds  the abundance of liquidity from central banks is aimed at keeping the party going and we don t recommend fighting central banks that are determined to keep their economies supported  especially if they are working together Don t Fight Central Banks Especially If They Are Working TogetherThe goal of flooding the markets with liquidity is to inflate or reflate asset prices  Higher stocks and bond prices are exactly what central banks seek to achieve and yes by consequence  commodity prices may rise as well  What is significant about this month s announcements from the Fed and ECB is that they have not only flooded the market with cheap money  but they also laid out a firm commitment to be a buyer of last resort AND to do more if the labor market weakens  in the case of the U S   or a country like Spain needs a bailout  In other words if stocks start falling sharply as a result of a significant downturn in the labor market or more trouble in the Eurozone  central banks are telling the market that they will do everything in their power to reverse sentiment  The Fed and ECB are not going at it alone   the Bank of Japan also increased asset purchases last week and the Bank of England is engaging in a Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS  which basically provides lower funding costs for banks with the hope that it will increase the quantity and lower the price of lending for businesses and households  Whether you think reflating asset prices is the right path to growth or not  higher asset prices are generally positive for risk appetite and negative for the U S  dollar  While the greenback has recovered in the past weeks  if central banks keep on buying and equities keep on rising in Q4  the dollar should resume its slide Dollar Will Win the Race to the BottomWe also believe that the dollar will win the race to the bottom  Central banks have gone pedal to the medal on monetary easing and aggressively eased monetary policy  Traditionally  monetary easing is negative for a country s currency but with all 3 central banks moving at the same time  investors are wondering which currency will be the biggest loser and which central bank will win the race to debase  We think it will be the U S  dollar because the ECB s program can t be implemented until a country formally requests aid and the BoJ s program is limited by size and timing  The Federal Reserve on the other hand expanded their asset purchase program immediately this month  So even though both central banks pledged to buy more bonds  the Fed is the only one of the two that has put money on the table and this is why in the long run  we expect the dollar to underperform the euro  Also  at the end of the day  these initiatives by central banks will reduce default risk and overall risk premium  Since investors are still net short EUR USD  the decline in risk should lead to more short covering in the EUR USD 3 Main Risks in the Fourth QuarterAs the fourth quarter nears  there are 3 main risks that could affect how the dollar trades  1   U S  November Elections Could Raise Concerns About U S  Credit RatingWith regard to the November elections  it is less about the men running in the race and more about how the fiscal cliff is handled  Regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins  the expiration date for tax cuts and automatic spending programs will be extended beyond December 31st  Given the highly partisan nature of the U S  government  even if Obama is reelected  unless he has a strong majority in Congress  there s not enough time for a formal grand sweeping agreement to be reached  The current administration has battled over the best way to reduce the budget deficit for more than 2 years now with no agreements  When the elections are over  smaller deficit reduction measures will most likely be announced and then followed by a new deadline for tax cuts to expire in the first or second quarter  While this means that the issue of the fiscal cliff can be avoided for now   if Congress kicks the can down the road  it could raise concerns about the U S  sovereign debt rating leading up to the November elections  which would be a problem for the U S  dollar  2   China Gears Up For Major Leadership Change  Could They Ease Immediately After China is gearing up for its most significant leadership change in more than a decade  but they have been super secretive about when it will happen  We know that it will be at the 18th Party Congress  which should take place over the next 2 months  but Chinese leaders are struggling to determine the right time  This in contrast to the past  when it was customary to give delegates at least a month s notice  Seven out of the nine ruling members are scheduled to retire and it is not clear who exactly is in the running outside of the 2 officials set to replace President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao  While many people believe that the leadership change won t have a big impact on the financial markets because the party remains the same  there is one scenario that could have a real impact  The Chinese government could choose to announce substantial monetary or fiscal easing after the leadership change  which will most likely be in October  to drive confidence in the new government  We know that the Chinese economy could certainly use it given the recent deterioration in data  More stimulus from China would be extremely positive for risk appetite and bearish for the U S  dollar  3   No Bailout for Spain and More Clashes at EU Summit Could Drive the Dollar HigherWhile developments in the U S  and China are expected to weaken the dollar  ongoing problems in Europe could maintain the attractiveness of the greenback  The possibility of a full Spanish sovereign bailout has not disappeared with the ECB s unlimited bond buying program and after so much speculation  an application for a credit line from the European Financial Stability Fund  EFSF   which is a necessary step to activating the ECB s buying program could actually be positive for the euro  However  Spain refuses to bow down and ask for help and last week  both the Spanish and German government have denied Spain s need for a European bailout  The longer that Spain holds out  the greater the concern about their fiscal performance  which could ultimately renew risk aversion  sending investors back into the arms of the greenback  EU Leaders will also be holding 2 key summits in the fourth quarter   one in October and one in November  If heads of states do nothing but clash over near term crisis measures and the banking union  concerns about the future of the euro and the critical safety net for the banking sector could also drive the euro lower and the dollar higher Central bankers and economists around the world have made it clear that Europe poses the greatest risk to the financial markets  So even though there are plenty of reasons why the U S  dollar should lose value in the fourth quarter  it only takes one fire in Europe to trigger a flight to quality and a rally in the U S  dollar  However  if the actions by central banks in September effectively eliminates the tail risk in the market and stabilizes sentiment  then the foundation has been laid for further weakness in the greenback  Dollar weakness is not a bad thing if it is driven by risk appetite   in fact  that s exactly what we all hope to see in Q4 ,2012-09-24,Kathy

12927,234442,FLS,Daily FX  USD Up Against All Pairs,opinion,EUR  Uh Oh  Protests in Spain Turn ViolentUSD  A Round of Stronger US Data Fails to Lift SentimentGBP  FLS Details ReleasedCAD  Stronger Retail SalesAUD  Financial Stability Review Shows Cautious OptimismNZD  Trade Balance on TapJPY  Political Change Cuts Chance of Yen InterventionEUR  Uh Oh  Protests In Spain Turn ViolentFor the euro this week  it s been all about Spain  As the images of protesters clashing with police in Spain s capital flashed across the television screens on trading floors  the euro fell quickly against the U S  dollar  Throughout the European trading session  the EUR USD quietly edged higher but when the media showed how much tension has been created by the plans for further austerity  investors realized that the economic crisis could also create a broader social and political crisis for Spain  Tens of thousands of protestors clashed with police in Madrid today  tearing down barriers blocking access to Parliament and prompting the firing of rubber bullets  There s no easy way out of this mess and this social unrest will only make the tough decisions even tougher  On the one hand  the financial community won t let up on Spain until they succumb to a sovereign bailout and on the other  the Spanish government is struggling to contain this unrest that has included calls for the government to resign  While there have been a number of clashes between protestors and police that have involved firing of rubber bullets and beatings with batons  this latest violence is occurring days before Spain is expected to announce a new round of unpopular reform measures on Thursday in the draft of the 2013 budget  Considering that this will be the Prime Minister s fourth round of belt tightening in nine months  we can t blame the people of Spain for being very angry  If Spain were to ask for a sovereign bailout  it would come at a cost of even more austerity  Aside from a new reform package and the 2013 budget due on Thursday  the details of the banking sector s stress tests will be released on Friday  This final report will tell us how much additional capital Spanish banks need to maintain an adequate buffer of reserves  The current estimate is EUR62 billion  if the sum exceeds that  the euro will be in trouble  The bid to cover ratio for Spain s bill auction and Italy s bond auction was also lower than the last auction  which is sign that investors are nervous about the Spanish economy and their need for further financial assistance  Concerns about growth prompted S P to cut its economic forecasts for the Euro zone  They now expect Euro zone GDP to shrink by 0 8  in 2012 and 0 3  in 2013  Rating agency Moody s is set to finish its review of Spain by the end of September  If it decides to slash the country s ratings  we could see recent gains in the EUR USD evaporate quickly  especially if the country doesn t react immediately with a bailout request  ECB President Draghi agrees that the Euro zone crisis is not over and urged European politicians to take advantage of this calmer period to make big decisions  He also urged the Germans to remember how much they have benefitted from the euro and how much they stand to benefit going forward  While we hope that his recommendations won t fall on deaf ears  we are not optimistic since politicians have been blinded by nationalist priorities  German Finance Minister Schaeuble for example said Spain doesn t need a new program they need to fix their problem of communication and regain market confidence  German consumer prices are scheduled for release tomorrow USD  A Round Of Stronger U S  Data Fails To Lift SentimentThe reversal in U S  stocks drove the U S  dollar higher against all of the major currencies  Despite better than expected U S  economic data  the uncertainty in Europe made investors nervous and caused a broad based sell off in the financial markets  This week s economic reports from the U S  are mostly second tier  which means they will only have a limited impact on the U S  dollar  Instead  risk appetite and developments in Europe will determine whether the dollar rallies on a flight to quality or weakens on optimism  Federal Reserve President Plosser expressed skepticism about the need for the latest round of stimulus by saying point blank that it probably won t be effective in boosting employment  Plosser is traditionally one of the more hawkish members of the FOMC so his skepticism is not unusual and we take his views with a grain of salt since he is not a voting member of the monetary policy committee this year Treasury Secretary Geithner expressed his own concerns about the uncertainty in Europe  the lack of U S  growth and the level of political paralysis in the U S  Yet amidst all of caution  there have been bright spots in U S  data including today s economic reports but don t be mistaken    the rally in the U S  dollar is not caused by the positive economic reports because if that was true  stocks would have also closed higher  Consumers are more optimistic this month compared to the last according to the Conference Board whose index rose from 63 1 to 70 3 in September  While job growth has been anemic and some high profile companies are laying off workers again  the rise in the stock market gave consumers a more positive outlook for the U S  economy  The Conference Board s findings are consistent with what we have seen from the University of Michigan and Investors Business Daily  Manufacturing conditions in the Richmond region also turned positive in September which is a nice surprise considering that economists were looking for the fourth consecutive month of contraction  House prices continued to increase in July but at a slower pace than June according to both the S P CaseShiller Home Price Index and FHFA House Price Index  New Home sales are due for release on Wednesday and low interest rates should continue to lend support to the housing market GBP  FLS Details ReleasedThe British pound ended the day slightly lower against the U S  dollar and unchanged against the euro  The only piece of U K  data released today was the number of loans for house purchases from the British Banking Authority  According to their report  loans increased substantially in the month of August thanks to ultra easy monetary policy  The Bank of England also released participation details for their Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS   A total of 13 banks signed up including all of its largest lenders with the exception of HSBC  However lending levels was smaller than most economists had anticipated  Nonetheless the central bank remains committed in their belief that the FLS program will keep rates low and increase the volume of transactions  The success of the FLS is important because it plays a critical role in determining whether another round of Quantitative Easing will be needed  No major U K  economic reports are scheduled for release on Wednesday  CAD  Stronger Retail SalesRisk aversion in the financial markets drove the Canadian  Australian and New Zealand dollars lower against the greenback despite hotter retail sales numbers from Canada  Consumer demand up North rose 0 7  in the month of July compared to forecasted growth of 0 2   After falling 0 3  the previous month  spending rebounded strongly but part of the improvement can be attributed to the volatility in auto demand  Retail sales less autos rose only 0 4  as Canadians spent more money on furniture and home furnishings and less on electronics  While the uptick did not drive the Canadian dollar higher  it supports the Bank of Canada s persistent call for higher interest rates  The commodity currencies would have been probably been hit harder by the slide in stocks if not for the data from Canada or a more upbeat report on the economy from the Reserve Bank of Australia  In the RBA s twice yearly Financial Stability Review  the central bank said Australian banks are in a relatively strong position and households are taking a prudent approach to debt  They continue to prefer saving and paying down their debt more quickly than required  More importantly  they are confident that modest employment growth will continue  With the RBA feeling cautiously optimistic  the Australian dollar has managed to avoid steeper losses  New Zealand trade numbers are due for release this evening and unfortunately the surplus is expected to turn into a large deficit as exports fall and imports rise  JPY  Political Change Cuts Chance Of Yen InterventionThe Japanese Yen traded higher against all of the major currencies including the U S  dollar  The big story this week was the resignation of Finance Minister Azumi  While Azumi stepped down to take a larger position in the ruling party as the Deputy Secretary General of the Democratic Party of Japan  the leadership change comes at a time when the Japanese Yen is trading at dangerously high levels  The decision of intervention rests with the Ministry of Finance and not the Bank of Japan  Even though Azumi said this change would not affect currency policy  until a successor is picked  the chance of intervention in the Yen has decreased significantly  While the Japanese government has not intervened this year  they have not been shy to do under Azumi s watch in 2011  All eyes are now on who will be the new Finance Minister and that person s stance on currency policy  Currently  there s word that Deputy Prime Minister Okada is being considered for the post along with Policy Chief Seiji Maehara whose appointment would be interesting because he has been a vocal proponent of taking more active measures to weaken the Yen Kathy Lien

12928,234443,FLS,FLS  A Gift From The Bank Of England To UK s Lenders ,opinion,The Bank of England recently implemented a new incentive program for banks called Funding for Lending Scheme  FLS  to encourage more lending to households and businesses The idea is to give British lenders access to cheap financing for four years in return for expanding credit   The financing is in the form of a four year collateral swap  Banks deliver illiquid loans  pools of mortgages and small business loans  to BoE in return for UK Treasury bills  The bills are then used as collateral for cheap repo loans  Bank of England  Over the eighteen months to the end of January 2014   the  drawdown period    the Bank of England will lend UK Treasury Bills to banks and building societies  hereafter  banks    These will be lent for up to four years  for a fee  As security against that lending  banks will provide collateral   in the form of loans to businesses and households and other assets   to the Bank of England   This type of transaction is known as a  collateral swap   When the loans from the Bank of England mature after up to four years  the collateral will be swapped back again  This arrangement ensures that the risk from the loans remains the responsibility of the originating bank   Banks can use the Treasury Bills they access in the Scheme to borrow money at rates close to the expected path of Bank Rate  Taking that rate together with the fee paid to the Bank of England gives the cost of funding for a bank using the Scheme To encourage banks to lend more  the amount of this cheap financing increases if banks expand lending and declines if lending shrinks  Once again  it s a good scheme in theory  but may play out quite differently in practice   Many banks have issued longer term debt that is coming due shortly  unsecured bonds   As this relatively expensive debt matures  they will simply roll it into FLS to reduce interest expense  There is nothing in the program that requires that new loans are exchanged for bills   existing loans on banks  books will do just fine  Banks will simply deliver their illiquid loan portfolios and use FLS to refinance their maturing debt   Daiwa Capital Markets  Ultimately  we expect U K  banks to opportunistically use the FLS as a cheaper substitute for funding from bond issuance in the wholesale capital markets and  principally  to refinance existing bonds when they mature  as opposed to increasing lending to the economy   The chart below shows how much FLS some of the largest lenders qualify for as well as lenders  debt maturing through 2014  Except for Nationwide  the bigger banks will have enough FLS capacity to repay a great deal or all of their maturing bonds  There is nothing in the program that requires UK banks to lend more and there is nothing to indicate that they will  Instead FLS is becoming a free gift by the Bank of England to the UK s banking system  FLS will be used to reduce interest expense and boost banks  profits  Of course given that the UK government owns large chunks of some of the lenders  Lloyds and RBS   maybe the UK taxpayer will benefit from the program after all ,2012-09-30,Sober Look,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/fls,-a-gift-from-the-bank-of-england-to-uk's-lenders-138014",138014
