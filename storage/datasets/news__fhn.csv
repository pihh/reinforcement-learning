Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  4 Bank Stocks to Buy Despite Low Rates   Other ChallengesAt present  investors are mostly shying away from the bank stocks given the lower interest rate environment  After raising interest rates four times in 2018  the Federal Reserve reversed its stance and cut rates in July  September and October this year  Though it is widely expected that there will be no further rate cut when the Fed officials meet next week  the three cuts have largely offset the favorable impact of last year s higher rates Additionally  several other macroeconomic matters  including the ongoing U S  China trade conflict  Brexit ambiguity and global slowdown fears weigh on investors  sentiments  These factors have also resulted in a slowdown in capital investments by corporates Despite these near term concerns  strong fundamentals and prospects make several banks a good investing option  But before we check out those banks  let s dig into the factors are likely favorably impact their performance Digitization of Operations  Banks are undertaking several measures to improve operating efficiency  For this  banks are digitally improving product offerings and services  Also  they are taking steps to upgrade technology at ATMs and branches  making these more client friendly  Though these initiatives will result in higher expenses in the near term  these are expected to support financials going forward Inorganic Expansion Backed by less stringent financial regulations and large amount free cash available owing lower corporate tax rates  banks are undertaking expansion via acquisitions  These deals are expected to be accretive to earnings and will lead to cost and revenue synergies  In one of the biggest deals in a decade  BB T  NYSE BBT  has agreed to acquire SunTrust  leading to the creation of sixth largest bank in the United States Additionally  several smaller banks are opting for a similar route to expand their market share amid a tough operating backdrop Revenue Diversifying Banks are foraying in to new avenues to improve revenue mix  With loan demand being moderate  banks are focusing more on generating fee income  This will enable banks to be less dependent on interest rates  Also  they are opening branches in new markets  which will support cross selling opportunities Strong Economy Banks  financials is directly related to the health of the nation  The U S  economy continues to show strength  Last week  per the data release by the Commerce Department  the country s real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 2 1   second

178011,399527,FHN,Southeastern U S  lenders First Horizon  IBERIABANK to merge,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    First Horizon National Corp  N FHN  and  IBERIABANK Corp   O IBKC  said on Monday they had agreed to merge to create one of the largest banks based in the southeast of the United States 
The transaction  the second largest U S  bank merger this year by assets  received a positive response from both sets of shareholders  First Horizon and IBERIABANK stock ended 3 2  and 2 8  higher respectively on Monday 
Structured as a merger of equals  albeit with legacy First Horizon shareholders controlling 56  of the new entity  the combined bank   called First Horizon   will have around  75 billion in assets and a presence in 11 southeastern U S  states 
 We have a complementary market presence throughout the south  and the combined franchise will have a good mix between high growth and stable markets   Bryan Jordan  chief executive of First Horizon  told an analysts  call 
American banks have been under pressure to consolidate as a way to manage the increased costs of regulatory compliance and spending on technology  as well as combat heightened competition in many markets from the largest four lenders in the country 
The recent reversal in interest rate outlook   the U S  Federal Reserve cut rates for the third time in 2019 last week   also makes it harder for banks to generate profits 
In February  BB T Corp  N BBT  and SunTrust Banks Inc  N STI  said they would combine in the largest U S  bank merger since the global financial crisis  That is also structured as a merger of equals 
The combined First Horizon IBERIABANK would have a market capitalization of more than  9 billion  based on current valuations  The current chief executives  Daryl Byrd of IBERIABANK and First Horizon s Jordan  will serve as executive chairman and CEO respectively 
Under the terms of the deal  IBERIABANK stockholders will receive 4 584 First Horizon shares for every share they own  The new bank  following the closing of the deal in the second quarter of 2020  will be headquartered in Memphis

over to Bryan D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Aarti  Good morning and thank you for joining our call  I m pleased with the strong performance we demonstrated throughout 2019  including the fourth quarter  We ended the year with very good momentum  positioning us well for 2020  Over the past year  we showed profitable balance sheet growth  including growth in key markets  We have delivered significant earnings contribution from our counter cyclical businesses  improved efficiency and deployed capital effectively We spent much of 2018 integrating Capital Bank into our legacy business  In 2019  we successfully leveraged the combined platform with an expanded market presence and increased balance sheet capacity  We were able to deliver good earnings power and delivered merger synergies  Our announced transactions with the IBERIABANK MOE and the Truist branch acquisition should further enhance our growth prospects  We should also deliver nice earnings accretion in 2020 Our strategic focus paid off with broad based loan and deposit growth in key markets  Our higher return specialty areas were especially strong  Our diversified loan portfolio was up 7  from 2018 to 2019  and credit quality trends remain stable  We were able to favorably shift our funding mix  with customer deposits replacing wholesale funding with a regional bank average deposit growth of 9  Our counter cyclical business mix helps us to produce solid returns  even in a challenging interest rate environment  such as 2019  Our fixed income business benefited from falling interest rates and market volatility  Fixed income revenue was up 52  from 2018 to 2019  and average daily revenue was over  1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 Our mortgage warehouse lending business was also helped by lower rates in customer expansion  and showing 133  growth year over year The momentum we accomplished through balance sheet growth  expanded market presence in counter cyclical businesses resulting in the achievement of the financial targets we laid out for 2019  in our 2018 Investor Day  We now have a strong foundation to build on this momentum  and we ll use our experience with the Capital Bank merger to successfully execute on our MOE with IBERIABANK We will also have meaningful opportunities with the acquisition of the 30 branches in very attractive markets  that will provide additional earnings accretion  Throughout the next year  we will remain focused on growing our balance sheet and not getting distracted  while we close and integrate these transactions  I am pleased with our integration planning to date  and are more confident today about our ability to deliver the announced synergies and build a leading regional franchise The current economic environment is relatively steady in our view  Our markets are still showing solid growth  Our customers broadly remain relatively optimistic with the economic outlook I ll now turn the call over to BJ to go through the quarter  Then I ll be back with some closing comments  BJ William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGreat  Thanks Brian and good morning everybody  I ll start on slide 7  by reviewing our EPS trends we saw quarter by quarter through the course of 2019  which gives a good perspective of how the momentum of the business has accelerated over the last year  Our key financial objectives this year were primarily two fold  first to accelerate the strong loan and deposit growth momentum that we were seeing toward the end of 2018  post the Capital Bank integration  And number two  leverage the full year impact of merger cost savings and continue expense efficiency efforts Coming into 2019  we like others  expected a rising rate environment  Yet that outlook quickly shifted at the beginning of the year and put significant pressure on our net interest income growth  However  our business model and our teams adapted as we expected First  we did an excellent job of growing loan in deposits  with total average loans up 7   and total average deposits up 5  year over year  Second  we maintained strong loan and deposit pricing discipline  In particular  our ability to continue growing core deposits  while lowering our deposit rates paid from 1 03  in 1Q  19 to 82 basis points in 4Q  19  helped mitigate the impact of three Fed cuts Third  our counter cyclical businesses like fixed income and loans to mortgage companies generated strong earnings growth  that more than offset the rate headwinds  And lastly  we took out almost 7  of our growth s expense base  through actions designed to both improve our efficiency  and allow for needed reinvestment  Through all this  we posted quarterly earnings growth over the year on an adjusted basis  that continue to strengthen throughout the year  culminating in full year adjusted EPS growth of 18  versus 2018 As you can see on slide 8  our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter show the line item drivers of growth  both linked quarter and year over year  Few highlights I would point out  average loans from fourth quarter  19 versus fourth quarter  18 were up 13  year over year  Despite the challenging rate environment with the multiple Fed rate cuts  we still grew NII 3  year over year  due to strong commercial loan growth and managing deposit costs lower  Fees were up materially  both linked quarter and year over year  from both continued increases in bank fees from strong customer growth  and excellent performance from the fixed income business  You will see on the bottom right  notable items are related to the merger costs from the pending Iberia deal  a charitable contribution that we made to our foundation  and our previously announced rebranding launch that occurred in the fourth quarter Let s take a deeper look at the broad based loan growth we re seeing on slide 9  and as you can see here  the 13  growth in loans  which is well ahead of industry growth  comes from all parts of our franchise  in both our specialty businesses  which grew 31   and 8  excluding loans to mortgage companies  which had an outstanding year  And across our markets  we saw healthy growth  with particular strength in our highest opportunity markets like Middle Tennessee  South Florida and Texas  Encouragingly  pipelines into 1Q also remained strong and we expect that favorable momentum to continue Taking a look at deposit trends on slide 10  you see that our core deposit gathering in the regional bank is strong  and as with our loan growth  our growth in deposits is also broad based across both our specialty businesses  and our markets  And again we ve done this while being very disciplined on pricing  Deposit rates paid declined 13 basis points linked quarter  and are down 21 basis points since the first quarter of 2019 Turning to slide 11  this brings us to the fixed income business  which again as Bryan said  had an outstanding year  We ve known that this business had the nimbleness and capability to quickly capture revenue opportunities when the market turned  and with the decline in interest rates and the market volatility  it was favorably impacted in terms of market activity in our sales and trading  across all of our desks  And in addition  our other product revenue increased with customers continuing to execute rate swaps  resulting in higher fees in our derivatives business  And during the last few years  the management team has repositioned the expense base for improved profit leverage  as volume returned  which is clearly evident in the results we ve seen this year  Given the general level and direction of rates along with some expectation of continued market volatility  we expect the fixed income business to continuing delivering solid results into 2020 Let s turn to net interest income and margin on slide 12  linked quarter  we saw increases in both NII and NIM  as strong loan and deposit growth  coupled with deposit cost discipline and a rebound in accretion  led to a 3  linked quarter increase in NII  and a 5 basis point expansion in the net interest margin  In the bottom left  we wanted to dimension for you  how much of a headwind the change in the interest rate environment was  yet how well our teams were able to manage through it  through strong customer growth and solid pricing discipline Now let s turn to expenses on slide 13  underlying the great growth in revenue performance we saw across our markets and businesses  we also continued to actively reposition our expense base for improved efficiency  The disciplined approach to expense management we ve had over the last several years was a major contributor to our earnings tower over the last year as well  And on an adjusted basis  we were able to reduce expenses slightly versus 2018  despite a  40 million increase in fixed income expenses that supported its higher revenue We did it by both lowering our core expenses through the achievement of cost saves from the Capital Bank deal  and continuing with further efficiency actions  such as branch closures  decreases in vendor and discretionary spending  The  80 million of expense reductions we ve referenced here  equates to about 7  of the gross expense base  By continuing our efficiency efforts  we were able to make some reinvestment in our customer experience and technology initiatives that will be critical to our future success And by driving significant positive operating leverage  we are able to bring down our efficiency ratio substantially  about 600 basis points from 2018 to 2019 on an adjusted basis  to finish fourth quarter at 59 9   We believe expense management is the strength of our company  and this track record gives us confidence in our ability to gain the expected further scale and efficiency benefits from the Iberia merger Turning to asset quality on slide 14  our credit trends remained excellent throughout the year  as we maintained our underwriting discipline  Net charge offs in the quarter were at only  3 million  with delinquencies and non performing loans declining both linked quarter and year over year as well  with provision growth largely due to the strong loan growth  Again  credit quality remained strong and we expect our credit trends to remain stable Slide 15 gives you a preview of our expected CECL impact  which as you are aware  we will adopt in first quarter of 2020  We currently estimate that the adoption of CECL will result in allowance to loans ratio of 100 basis points to 110 basis points  We will experience an increase in the reserve  largely due to longer term consumer loans  and establishing a reserve for previously marked and acquired loans  Other commercial portfolio reserves are expected to remain relatively stable  As a reminder  we will also see an impact on the reserves  when we close our Iberia transaction  and we have repeated these and laid them out at the bottom half of this slide On slide 16  you see a brief update of our Iberia merger and branch acquisition activities for both  the closing and integration planning remains on track  In addition to holding townhalls and engaging employees  we have already completed several steps in the regulatory application process and commence integration planning  Our current expectation is to close and integrate the branch transaction in the second quarter of 2020 and to close the Iberia merger sometime mid 2020Wrapping up on slide 17  again  2019 was a transformative year for us  Our successful execution of the Capital Bank deal strengthened our franchise  improved our efficiency  and favorably shifted our funding mix through market and customer expansion  We delivered on our financial targets in 2019 that we had laid out at our Investor Day  We showed meaningful earnings growth  despite a challenging rate environment  We showed strong business momentum by generating earnings and balance sheet growth and demonstrating the benefits of our complementary business model  Our merger of equals with IBERIABANK and the Truist branch acquisition will expand our opportunities in attractive  high growth markets  enhance our scale and lead us toward top tier profitability  We re not done  Momentum continues across our business into 2020  And that s all I have Bryan D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  BJ  To repeat BJ a little bit  we ve accomplished a great deal over the past year  We delivered on our financial targets we set out in our Investor Day  We grew earnings  despite the challenging rate environment and successfully executed on the opportunities from the Capital Bank merger We ended the year with strong momentum and we see that momentum continuing into 2020  as we work on the integration of our MLE with IBERIABANK and our branch acquisition from Truist  Thank you to all of our employees for all their hard work over the past year  on behalf of our customers  our communities and our shareholders With that Sarah  we will now take questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Our first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan  Please go ahead Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystHey  good morning everybody D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Steve Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystI want to start on the margin  maybe for BJ  how are you thinking about the core NIM here  like near term as well  as we work through 2020 William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I think    what I would say  into 2020 Steve  is we would expect net interest margin trends to remain relatively stable through the next couple of quarters  There usually is a seasonal decline in the first quarter  related to seasonality of loans to mortgage companies  which is a point of our higher yielding businesses and day counts and that type of thing  So there could be a dip because of those factors in the first quarter  But generally speaking  given the pricing discipline that we ve got on the deposit side and the loan side  we would try to hold that relatively stable over the next couple of quarters Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then appreciate the CECL disclosure  As we think through the Day 2 impact and we look at the 1  to 1 1  range  should we assume that you stay in the middle of that range or is the bias a decline over time  as items such as non strategic run off  for example William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think as you know  the CECL impacts really are largely on us  Phonetic   There is a significant effect of future views of the economy  as we get into the use of CECL  And so  if we re assuming that the future economic environment is relatively the same as how we view it today  then I would expect that the 100 to 110 basis points largely stays  Our non strategic portfolio now is well under  1 billion and so  not nearly as big of an impact as it used to be So if we continue to have a commercially oriented balance sheet  which we expect  then I think largely that range will likely hold Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  And does the potential capital hit from CECL change your thoughts around buybacks at all William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNot necessarily  Now  of course  we can t do any share repurchases with the pending Iberia merger  right  So nothing would be occurring till that closes  But not really  I think you re moving from one pocket to another  In terms of capital in my opinion  So all of that will be put into our stress test  which again is the foundation for how we think about deploying excess capital and with that  we feel very strong Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystAnd then finally  I m curious if you guys look at the synergies post the Iberia deal closing  the benefit from the SunTrust branches  do you guys feel consensus properly captures the earnings power of this new company  Thanks William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerProbably the short answer is no  I think the momentum that we ve got in our business is going to carry on into 2020  Bryan talked about it at the beginning  as being a major focus of not losing sight of continuing to run the business as we integrate  So that s one of our top priorities  Then if you look at how we re performing today  how we are taking cost out of our own organization  how we ve done it in the Capital Bank deal  how much expertise Iberia has  integrating and doing the same types of things  We feel very confident in our ability to put these two companies together well and deliver that profitability profile over time  that we expect from the deal D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerSteve  this is Bryan  I have to add to what BJ said  we don t think about how we influence consensus in the short run  Our role is to deliver on the commitments that we make  and we are very optimistic about what we see in both of these transactions  And as I said in my opening comments  the more planning that we do  the more optimistic I am that we will not only deliver  but potentially over deliver on those commitments  So we see both of these transactions accreting to earnings and we see both of them delivering significant shareholder value over time  We recognize  that it is our responsibility to manage the business day to day  and to execute on what we said we re going to do  and that s what we re set out to do Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  I appreciate the color  Thanks for taking my questions D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYes  thank you  Have a good weekend OperatorOur next question comes from Brady Gailey with KBW  Please go ahead Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystThanks  Good morning  guys D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Brady Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystSo in your opening comments  I mean you guys said that expense management continues to be a strength of the company  You took out another  80 million  7  last year in 2019  and that s above and beyond any sort of deal related cost savings  How do you think about that going forward  Do you think there s still opportunity to reduce the legacy expense base from here  or are you to the point where reductions are not going to be as notable D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerBrady  this is Bryan  I will start  I think it s going to be really really difficult in the next year or two to separate out what s associated with our integration or the merger or merger of equals with Iberia  But we continue to believe that through this period and beyond that  we will continually have to rethink our expense base and think about how we manage expenses to what BJ said  control costs  but also invest in the technology and infrastructure to deliver the products and services that our customers are looking for The short answer to your question is yes  I think there are other additional opportunities in the legacy expense base  as well as on the IBERIABANK side  that will allow us to deliver our merger synergies  and will allow us to fund the investments that we need to make long term  So I am optimistic that we will be able to do exactly what you described  And as BJ said  if you go back 10 12 years  we have consistently worked on our expense base  We have consistently deliver greater efficiency  and it showed up on our overhead efficiency ratio improvement in 2019 and I expect that you ll continue to see that improve throughout the merger and the integration of the two transactions that we ve talked about Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystAll right  that s helpful  And then the mortgage warehouse was also very strong in 2019  it was up    average balances were up 75  year over year  and you finished on a high note at  4 4 billion  in a seasonally soft quarter  How do you think the mortgage warehouse will trend  as we continue through 2020  And I know you all talked about the warehouse    the yield being one of your highest or one of your higher loan yields  Does that yield still run about 5 5  D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerBrady  this is Bryan again  I ll start  Mortgage warehouse is a seasonal business  The first quarter is historically the lowest  and I would expect that that could be down  400 million to  500 million on average versus the fourth quarter  But as you look at it vis a vis a year ago  I expect it to be up  We ve gained market share and we continue to grow our customer base and we continue to broaden the breadth and scope of the business  So while it will have seasonal    fluctuations or seasonality  as we said in the past  we believe it s a extraordinarily valuable business  it creates a tremendous amount of shareholder value by delivering very strong returns  And so we live with the seasonal volatility Our outlook overall for the business is good  We expect long term rates to be low  We expect purchase activity to continue to be very good in 2020  Refi is a little less than half of the business  we re seeing today  So overall  we re optimistic about the outlook for mortgage warehouse in 2020 Susan L  Springfield    Executive Vice President and Chief Credit OfficerA few specifics I would add to what Bryan said  if you look at where we are just the first 10 days of January compared to the January average last year for mortgage warehouse  we are more than double where we were last year for January  So the tick up in the number of clients we ve added  17 net new clients year over year and we re continuing to do business with good sized companies  medium and large sized mortgage companies  where we ve been able to increase our average mortgage warehouse relationship from about  22 million to  30 million over the course of the last 12 months So in addition to the the economy  leading to that great work by the team on bringing in new customers and continuing to deepen relationships with customers  that will really help sustain that business  even through some seasonal and cyclical fluctuations OperatorOur next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Securities  Please go ahead Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Securities    AnalystGood morning D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Ebrahim Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Securities    AnalystJust one  wanted to follow up on the margin  BJ  how should we think about the accretion  at least through the first half  before you close either of the deals relative to the 15 basis points in the fourth quarter William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So we ve put here on slide 12  just to dimension for you  the total loan accretion in the year was  42 million  That continues to step down every quarter  right  So accretion by nature would be lower in 2020  than it was for 2019  The other factor that s going to drive it even lower  is the impact of CECL  which takes away some  not all of the accretion that you have from purchased or acquired loans  So loan accretion will continue to come down over the next few quarters Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Securities    AnalystGot it  OK  So a step down from the 15 bps in the fourth quarter  I guess Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystOh  yes  Yeah  Yeah  because we were    if you think about it  We should have been averaging something like 10 ish a quarter  Third quarter was abnormally low  Fourth quarter was abnormally high  Put the two together  and it is right around the  10 million  But it will continue to come down a couple of million dollars a quarter Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Securities    AnalystThat s helpful  And just going back to the Iberia deal and is it safe to assume that    I know you said mid 2020  but the deal could close by the second quarter or by the end of the 2Q  20  given just the timeline we ve seen with other deals like DCF last year  And Bryan  would love to get a little more color around    just your confidence around the expense savings  As you said  Iberia has done a fantastic job in terms of getting expense savings from its deals historically  and you guys have done a great job on expense management  If you could just talk to in terms of the possibility that expense savings from that deal could run ahead of schedule  and how do you think    just how the integration plan like  Do we see a good amount of savings come through by the end of the year or by the first half of next year  Would love to hear any color that you can provide on this D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYes  sure  So the first part of your question was timeline  and we have no reason to believe at this point that we won t get the requisite shareholder and regulatory approvals by second quarter of this year  So we expect to close late first half of this year  So as far as we know  everything there is on track and as BJ mentioned  we have made the required filings and so the ball is rolling in that regard To your point  clearly the experience base with the Iberia team has been very very strong  They ve done a number of mergers and integrations over the years  And so  when I step back and think about their experience base and couple with ours  I think fundamentally  we have the right focus on how we execute on these transactions The thing that has really encouraged me  has been the way the eight executives that we announced in the merger announcement  as well as our ability to roll that out further in the organization  The way these teams are coming together in planning for this integration is very very good in my view and I ve seen a lot of these over the years  and there is a strong focus on  not only how we deliver on these commitments  but how we build the franchise to be in a very strong and stable place for the future  delivering strong shareholder value and products and services that our customers won t  Phonetic  need for the long term So without trying to fine tune where expenses will fall throughout the back half of this year  I would say that I am optimistic that we re going to hit our synergy numbers  and I think over time  we may prove that there is some upside to that  So I m optimistic in the way the planning has gone to date  I love the way that the team is working together  to plan the combined organization  And as we get through this approval process and shareholder vote  I m excited about bringing the team together  to manage the combined business Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Securities    AnalystThat s great to hear  Thanks for taking my questions D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYes  thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Tyler Stafford with Stephens  Please go ahead Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystHey  good morning guys  Nice quarter D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystJust following up on one of the earlier questions about Street estimates  perhaps not reflecting the earnings power of the combined company  Obviously  there is a lot of moving pieces this year with the branch purchase and Iberia acquisition  Just curious  why you guys chose to not provide 2020 guidance  even on a stand alone basis  given the momentum coming out of 2019 William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think generally speaking  as you know  we don t provide guidance  We did    I guess you can call it our Investor Day targets  a form of guidance  that I think was a little bit unique  I think if you listen to what Bryan and I said in some of our opening comments  you can take some trends away  strong business momentum  loan pipelines remain strong  We maintain pretty good discipline on deposit pricing  We talked earlier in the Q A  on what we thought around margin  Fixed income  given continued market volatility and the level and direction of rates  we feel good about the level of what we re seeing there  And our expense discipline will remain a key focus for us  through the first half of the year  Now again  as Bryan said and as everybody knows  it s going to get a little noisier  as we get to close with Iberia deal and things are going to start to come together  but the fundamental business momentum that we re seeing  continues into the first quarter Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  Thanks BJ  And just thinking about loan growth for 2020  I think Bryan mentioned perhaps roughly a  500 million step down in mortgage warehouse balances  But just trying to triangulate what that could mean for 2020 growth last year for  19  you had the 3  to 6  growth expectations  Obviously you came in ahead of that  But is that a good range that we should think about    on a stand alone basis for 2020 William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah I think so  Yeah  I think clearly  we had really really strong loan to mortgage company growth  It would be great if that continued  but we ll assume that that s going to come back in a little bit  but the fundamentals of the rest of the growth feel really good  such that that low to mid single digit range feels feels appropriate Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  thanks for that  And then just one more for me on expenses  backing out the onetime expenses  it looks like the employee compensation expense was up  call it  10 million or so quarter over quarter on a core basis  even with the FTN expenses up only  2 million or so  Can you just give us any color on what drove that step up in employee comp  Did you guys hire  Was that incentive kind of catch up for the year  or just any color you can share on that increase  Thanks William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerIt was a variety of things  It was fixed income  variable comp driving much of it  But then year end bonus accruals  given the strong year that we had as well  both on the front line side  related to volume based incentives  as well as overall corporate results D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerBJ  you may correct me if I m wrong  but Tyler referenced the step up in FTN expenses  Last quarter  was high because of a legal settlement that was reflected in those numbers  And that didn t recur in compensation expense  it was higher as a result this quarter William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  That s a good point Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystYeah  thanks for that  I think I was taking that into account  but regardless    yeah  that was    the FTN was definitely a driver of that step up  So I can appreciate that  Okay  thanks guys  That s it for me D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Thank you William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Tyler OperatorOur next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson  Please go ahead D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerHey Jennifer Jennifer Demba    SunTrust Robinson    AnalystHi  good morning  Question on asset quality  you indicated you think things will be relatively stable this year  Your net charge offs were so low in 2019  just wondering how you kind of think about it going forward  And also  your franchise lending  I know it s a small business for you  but just wondering how that s performing these days  given restaurant pressure  Thanks Susan L  Springfield    Executive Vice President and Chief Credit OfficerJennifer  our outlook for asset quality is    remains stable and strong at this point  based on what we re seeing in our portfolio  And I know Bryan touched on the client sentiment as well  We continue to be selective and disciplined  in terms of both increases to existing clients and bringing on new clients and disciplined around servicing Just as a sidebar  I would add that I think client selection throughout  for a long term sustainable portfolio is so critical  and our bankers really do a great job with that  I think that s a tribute to the model  of having market presidents and local credit officers in the market  who know those markets and the people that we re doing business with  because if you do have a situation where you need to come to the table  it s always great to see clients who step up and do the right thing  and that s  that s something that we talk about day in and day out  So I feel very good about the asset quality that we re seeing and the way in which we brought business on the book The franchise finance team is no different in terms of discipline around underwriting client selection  The way that they follow various concepts and look for both opportunities and threats  that portfolio    excuse me  portfolio is performing well  But that is an area  and I would tell you  even though customer sentiment across the board is very strong  the one thing we re hearing both from franchise finance clients and really others  is the pressure on wages and quality of labor  So we do talk a lot with customers about that  and you also have many states  who went to a higher minimum wage that was expected  and so these clients have put that in their run rate  but it is something that we watch closely Jennifer Demba    SunTrust Robinson    AnalystGreat  thank you  Another question    just Bryan  wondering how you re thinking about retention of key Iberia revenue producers  One of Iberia s competitors reported yesterday  it seemed very excited about a potential merger disruption  Can you just talk about what your strategy is there  Thanks D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  absolutely  Look the    when you re in merger  it s even more of a focus  But the reality of our business is  is that our people are very important to us all the time  And so we spend a lot of time thinking about how we really create a culture  where people want to be here and serve their customers  And we are working really really hard with the team at Iberia to think about how we bring together these two organizations And it really starts with a fundamental similar culture  as the way we do business  as the way we view credit  as the way we fundamentally think about how we serve our customers and communities and so I don t expect very much  if any change on most of our bankers in terms of the way we do business  We ve also been able to say very clearly to our frontline bankers that  given the limited branch overlap that we have  that we are going to have a role for the folks that are facing our customers in the organization So we don t think we re going to create very much disruption  But we re also thinking about how we use all the tools that are available to us  to ensure that people are committed to the organization  They re committed to serving their customers and committed to growing the business  So I understand  people might express optimism or whatever they may express  But we are clearly going to work very very hard to keep all of our bankers engaged in serving customers and community  keeping up the great momentum with full knowledge  that when we put these businesses together  they re going to be in a better place and better products and services to serve customers and do a better job for their communities OperatorOur next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies  Please go ahead Casey Haire    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  good morning everyone  Wanted to touch on the liquidity profile post close  once you guys do close these deals  they obviously bring a lot of liquidity  The network deposits were up this quarter  around  4 4 billion  What s a reasonable level for those network deposits this time next year  given all the liquidity  Because that could be a potential NIM defense lever for you guys D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Casey  it s BJ  That s a good point  Particularly the Truist branch acquisition gives us probably a net    little over net  2 billion of very low cost incremental funding that we can then build a profitable loan and deposit business on  in some attractive markets  So as a thought process  on the corporate finance case for those branch acquisitions is  bringing on net  2 billion of deposits at 50 basis points  and letting go the market index deposits  And then over time  reshaping further the funding mix  And so  yes  that is clearly a benefit that we expect to gain in the second half of the year immediately  and then and then leverage it further What we ll do is I    I can t really give you an idea necessarily yet of what we think market index deposit levels will be going forward  simply because we want to put the two companies together and see where we need net funding with those types of deposits  Clearly a gap filler if you will  much like how we use it today for excess growth in loans to mortgage companies or movements in our fixed income trading inventory And so the key point though is that  the branch acquisition will certainly improve our funding mix  and we ll continue to optimize it with the Iberia merger as well Casey Haire    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And just switching to the NIM outlook  it sounds like it s stable    core NIM stable near term  even with mortgage warehouse sort of going against you this quarter  You guys did a decent job on the core deposit side pricing this quarter  Is there still some room to push that lower  and offset some of the mortgage warehouse D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think so  There is a lag effect as you well know  when rates    when the Fed cuts rates  LIBOR comes down pretty much immediately  It actually leads into a cut  whereas deposit pricing takes a little bit of time to flow through  And so the margin compression that we saw in the third quarter reflected that dynamic with pressure on loan yields  which continued into the fourth quarter  But we started to see the benefit of the pricing changes we made on the deposit side coming through in the fourth quarter  Those deposit rate changes will continue more into the first quarter  where we believe the pressure on loan yields will moderate a bit So all in all  I think your theory is correct  that that will help loans to mortgage company balances and yields coming down will be a headwind  But all in all  I see our margin being relatively stable a couple of basis points here and there  to either side of where we ended the fourth quarter  based on what I can see today Casey Haire    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thanks  And just last one on capital markets  sounds like the momentum is continuing into the first quarter here  I was wondering if you could just give us a flavor as to where ADRs are trending year to date William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I think through the first 16  17 days of the year  I think we re between  950 000 and  975 000 a day  We had  1 1 million in the fourth quarter  which was great and so we expect something around the range of    between those levels to to be where we re at in the first quarter OperatorOur next question comes from Brock Vandervliet with UBS  Please go ahead Brock Vandervliet    UBS    AnalystGreat  thank you  I just wanted to probe more on Tyler s question on expenses  BJ  I had been thinking more in the range of  2 75 million to  2 80 million or so in terms of core core expenses  I know there is a lot of moving parts here  but is that too optimistic  Should we really be around closer to  2 90 million going forward William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI think it s probably not the  2 90 million range  It s probably lower than that  But probably higher than the  2 75 million range given  given how well fixed income has been growing  So I would say in  2 80 million   2 85 million range would probably be more appropriate  going into the first half of this year D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerIt all depends on how you think about fixed income and those things William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  exactly Brock Vandervliet    UBS    AnalystOkay  excellent  And also  the biggest overhang I think right now on expenses is around systems and the integration  And in terms of    is it Jack Henry  Is it your internal system  Is it third party  When    can you clear the air at all on that topic  And if not  when do you think you ll have a decision made  that you can share with investors D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerBrock  this is Bryan  And clear it a little bit  it s either going to be  Jack Henry or our internal system  Hogan  etc  I think that decision is relatively close  We are doing some evaluation and some work to evaluate the various angles  and I expect that decision will be made in the next 30 days or thereabouts  But it s going to be    it s going to be one of those two sets of systems  We re not going to go reinvent the wheel or do something completely different  So we re going to keep the organization moving  and I think that it would be a decision that will be solved fairly quickly here Brock Vandervliet    UBS    AnalystOkay  And you think you re already kind of bracketed with respect to that decision and expense dynamics of that decision  Or do you think that could result in new guide around expenses D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerI don t think that decision will have any adverse impact on what we ve laid out in terms of expense guidance  And potentially  it may    there may be some value down the road  as we think about how all of the systems lace together  But we think we ve put together something in our forecast  and in our estimates  when we announced the deal  that took into account  that we re going to have to make that decision and we think we put something in place  that was very achievable in terms of an estimate So I don t expect any adverse impact to our expense estimates  as a result of that Brock Vandervliet    UBS    AnalystGreat  thank you D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorOur next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo  Please go ahead Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo    AnalystHi  good morning D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo    AnalystJust I guess looking at the Truist deal  is that creating any opportunities yet for you  in terms of being able to go on the offensive and maybe hiring employees or seeing any opportunities with customers  that otherwise were tied up  Or is it still too early for you to say D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerJared  this is Bryan  It s probably a little too early to know the full impact  but clearly in the 60 to 90 days that we    since we ve announced that  it had a very positive impact  particularly in the Mid Atlantic markets  where we already have a presence  and there is a tremendous amount of excitement  And it does create    it basically allows us to do in the Mid Atlantic market  call it the triangle and the Triad area of North Carolina in particular  We re doing 20  25 years of work in terms of building branch share  branch franchise  So that has a positive impact  and we think it will be positive for us in the long term We re excited about the other markets that we get an opportunity to acquire in that branch transaction  And so I think longer term  it will be a very positive thing for us  and I m optimistic that you ll start to see that momentum building  as we close it some time in second quarter  and the early mid part of 2020 second quarter Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  great  thanks  And then  just on the average daily revenue in the capital markets business  is that  1 million   1 1 million sort of a natural ceiling  Is it going to be hard to see that ever drift higher than that  given the current structure  Or is that sort of the solid wheelhouse right now  given the the outlook William C  Losch III    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think    like I like I said  a couple of minutes ago  I think  900 000 to where we re at today  Near term  what we    what we think the business should be at over the next quarter or two  its harder to look beyond that  But if you look on whatever slide we had  slide 11 for fixed income  the bottom right gives you at least a bit of a dimension for how to think about it  and how average daily revenues flow in the business  right  So direction of rates coming down has been helpful  Market volatility has been helpful  But the state of the economy continues to be fairly healthy If you think back to when we had really really big quarters in fixed income like of 2009 2010  there was a very negative view on the economy  and direction in rates and market volatility were favorable to the business as well  So all of that to say is  I don t think that this is a ceiling  Now we don t necessarily want the state of the economy to be    I don t know what it would be  to drive average daily revenues higher  but we like the counter cyclical benefit of having fixed income stronger  if there are pressures on the margin  which is exactly what we saw in 2019 So business is still performing very strong  Like I said in my opening comments  the management team out there has done an incredible job over the last couple of years  repositioning the expense base  such that when revenue and volume and activity did come back  our profit margins got better  So as an example  three or four years ago  the leverage  if you will  for every  10 or so that we would generate in incremental revenue  we would have  6 or so of expense Today if you look at the results in the graph  it s roughly  5 of expense for every  10 of revenue  So they have improved and expanded their profit margin  which will only help us on the upside and mitigate things on the downside OperatorOur next question comes from Garrett Holland with Baird  Please go ahead Garrett Holland    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThank s and good morning  I just had a follow up on loan growth  The ACA  Phonetic  data for C I lending for the industry has softened considerably  I was hoping you could elaborate on what s driving your improving pipeline activity  following the good performance in 2019 Susan L  Springfield    Executive Vice President and Chief Credit OfficerYeah  we are seeing a strong pipeline this quarter  and we ve had even our    what I would call core commercial  So that s our commercial teams that are out in the markets  not specialty  We had good year over year growth there  As you know  we ve hired additional bankers in some of our    what we call our expansion markets  or key markets  So  Florida and mid Atlantic  Houston continuing to hire bankers as has some of our specialty lines of business So in addition to    I d say just doing the right thing day in and day out  talking with existing customers  bringing in new to bank  Being able to attract new bankers who have a different rolodex they can bring in over time  some of the clients might have been banking at another institution  So we feel good about it and as I ve said earlier  not only do I feel good about the type of growth we re seeing  but the continued discipline around which we re looking at these growth opportunities Garrett Holland    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThank you  And then maybe a bigger picture question  In the past  you provided good insight about the heavy lifting involved integrating Capital Bank  With outbound calls and training hours and the company s performance notably improved  as you move past that  how do you sustain the core operating momentum  as you work through the much larger Iberia integration D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerGarrett  this is Bryan  It is a reality that as you get into the training around the conversion schedule and start communicating with customers  it does impact  to some extent momentum  The best anecdote to that is  one  trying to compartmentalize as much of the integration as you can  to a small group of people and allow our bankers    as Susan just referred to them  our core bankers in the market continue to do what they re doing  which is to take care of customers and their community So we re going to try to compress any of that outbound calling and communication through a smaller window as we can  We don t have the full integration schedule laid out yet  With the Capital Bank merger  we integrated all over one week in  and we did all the systems conversion  And it s not clear yet  how we re going to do all of these integrations  It could be staged out  So our focus  as we talk to our bankers and the organization and then  the same things happening and on the Iberia side is  is look  let s stay focused on growing the business  Let s say focused on growing customers and community activity  and let s let our integration team worry about the integration  And so while it will invariably have some small impact  we re doing what we can to minimize that Garrett Holland    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThat s helpful  Thanks for taking the questions D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott  Please go ahead Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystThanks  Good morning  Bryan and BJ  I wanted to just reinforce on the systems conversion a few months after the merger  To what extent does the fact that you are a core provider    that you re such a large part of their business  I think maybe their largest customer  Does that give you some positives that you can leverage off of  and are there any risks that go along with that D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah Chris  this is Bryan  A reference evaluation  I think that s part of what we ve got to evaluate as we look at these systems decisions  and clearly  if you go one direction you re running systems that are being    ours for example  you re running systems that are run at Bank of America  So they are infinitely scalable  at least from the perspective of a  45 billion banking organization Your references to the IBERIABANK systems  and part of the testing we have to do is  how scalable is it and what does that mean in terms of the ability to grow and invest in the systems over the long term  And that s the work that s going on now  We re trying to make a systems evaluation  that when we get to the end of the integration  it leaves us in the best position to serve our customers and community to grow our business and deliver the lowest landed cost that we can  for that system s decision So it s a complicated decision  but there is an awful lot of good people spending a fair amount of time looking at it  And I expect  as I said earlier  in the next 30 days or so  we ll have a decision on it Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystOkay  So there is still room for change in evolution on that  and I presume that your merger charges kind of    long covers the costs associated D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  as I referenced to the question earlier  Chris  I don t think that any systems  decision will deliver anything  As we sit here today  I don t expect any adverse impact on that  I think that the way we thought through it on the front end  took an approach where    while you might say conservative  I would say that it s achievable and deliverable  So I m not expecting anything adverse from that Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystGreat  Bryan  Thank you for the background  I appreciate it D  Bryan Jordan    Chairman  President   Chief Executive OfficerSure thing

178023,399539,FHN,7 Value Based  Low Price to Sales Stocks To Garner Profits,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by a company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenue generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity

178028,399544,FHN,U S  top court rejects banks over FDIC lawsuit,news,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by banks to avoid a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp lawsuit over the 2009 collapse of Alabama s Colonial BancGroup Inc 
The justices left in place a May 2016 ruling by the New York based 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals that found that the FDIC did not wait too long to sue  Credit Suisse  Group AG  S CSGN   First Horizon National Corp  N FHN   Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  L RBS    Wells Fargo    Co  N WFC  and seven other banks for selling or underwriting toxic mortgage securities that Colonial bought 
Colonial  based in Montgomery  Alabama  went into FDIC receivership in August 2009 after struggling from losses tied to mortgage securities and an aggressive foray into Florida 
Three years later  the FDIC sued the 11 banks  stating that they violated federal securities law by selling  388 million in toxic debt to Colonial in 2007  It said the lawsuit was timely because it had three years from the start of the receivership to sue 
A lower court judge threw out the case  accepting the banks  argument that the clock ran out in 2010  three years after Colonial bought its securities  But in the reversal  the appeals court found that the U S  Congress intended that an  extender statute  giving the FDIC more time to pursue some legal claims covered the Colonial case ",2017-01-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-top-court-rejects-banks-over-fdic-lawsuit-451944,451944

178044,399560,FHN,Should Value Investors Buy First Horizon National  FHN  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put First Horizon National Corporation   NYSE FHN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  First Horizon National has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 99  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 24  If we focus on the long term PE trend  First Horizon National s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 75  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that First Horizon National has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 56  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for First Horizon National stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  First Horizon National has a P S ratio of about 2 43  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 66 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  FHN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  First Horizon National currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes First Horizon National a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 62  which is better than the industry average of 12 00  Clearly  FHN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though First Horizon National might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives FHN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 1 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below First Horizon National Corporation Price and Consensus    This positive trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFirst Horizon National is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 31  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth

178073,399589,FHN,3 Bank Stocks Worth Buying Despite More Rate Cut Expectations,opinion,The Federal Reserve is once again expected to announce an interest rate cut at the end of the two day FOMC meeting scheduled next week  Per the CME FedWatch   there is an 88 8  chance that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points  Earlier in July  the Fed had cut interest rates for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis We know that bank stocks thrive in the rising rate environment  Banks seek to borrow money at short term rates and lend at long term rates  As interest rates decline  they earn less on lending  This compresses net interest margin  NIM    the main indicator of a bank s profitability Moreover  as interest income constitutes a significant portion of their revenues  decline in rates hurts banks  net interest income growth as well  Hence  a cut in interest rates is bad news for the banking industry and is likely to place the companies in a disadvantageous position Adding to this  inversion of the yield curve  which is seen as a harbinger of economic slowdown or even recession  has been hurting banks  NIM growth over the past few months Thus  because of the central bank s accommodative monetary policy stance  expected global economic slowdown  yield curve inversion and uncertainty related to the trade war and Brexit  investors are shying away from bank stocks of late However  the main driving factor for banks  financials is the overall health of the nation  Despite expectations of a slowdown  the U S  economy is growing  thereby providing some support to the banking industry as a whole Moreover  majority of the banks are making efforts to streamline operations and expand business  organically and inorganically  to diversify footprint and revenue base  In fact  lower corporate tax rates along with easing of stringent regulations will likely support these efforts and hence aid profitability Further  banks are undertaking measures to align their businesses for technology driven clients  They are spending substantially on technology to upgrade and add advanced features  This is expected to lower costs and improve operating efficiency  going forward Thus  investors will be wrong if they show apathy toward bank stocks solely on fears of rate cut In fact  recently  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note increased  Widening of spreads between long and short term rates along with decent loan growth is expected to provide some support to banks  top line growth amid rate cuts  Also  banks  efforts to focus more on non interest income are likely to boost top line growth to some extent Hence  it can be said that all is not lost for bank stocks  Investing in bank stocks with robust fundamentals and prospects is a good

178182,399698,FHN,Is First Horizon  FHN  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put First Horizon National Corporation   NYSE FHN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  First Horizon has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 57  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 24  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts First Horizon s current PE ratio above its midpoint  which is 15 94  over the past three years However  the stock s PE is slightly unfavorable with the Zacks classified Banks Southeast industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 29  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Nonetheless  we should also point out that First Horizon has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 11  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for First Horizon stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  First Horizon s P CF ratio of 14 32 is considerably lower than the Zacks classified Banks Southeast industry average of 17 75  which indicates that the stock is reasonably undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  First Horizon currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes FHN a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though First Horizon might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives FHN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and three downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate inched up 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below First Horizon National Corporation Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  First Horizon is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineFirst Horizon is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  despite a decent industry rank  top 20  out of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  3  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  However  over the past one year  the Zacks Banks Southeast sector has significantly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below

178203,399719,FHN,First Horizon Stock Looks Ready To Jump,opinion,"First Horizon National Corporation  NYSE FHN   headquartered in Memphis  Tennessee  is a large bank holding company  founded in 1864  during the American Civil War  But as the last stock market crash demonstrated  even companies with such a long history are not immune to the laws of the market cycle 
Between February 2007 and July 2008  First Horizon stock plunged from as high as  37 85 to as low as  3 77  To say that it took a hard hit would be an understatement  However  the company survived that recession  too  and its stock is currently trading slightly above the  15 mark 
But if we want to see where it is most likely headed to from now on  we need to see how it has been developing decades before the 2007 2008 crash  First Horizon s monthly log chart will come in handy 
In late 1975  the stock was hovering near 50 cents a share  Almost thirty years later  in March 2004  the stock reached an all time high of  40 53  But to us  the most important thing is the wave structure of this phenomenal bull market 
As the chart shows  First Horizon s uptrend took the shape of a clear five wave impulse  According to the Elliott Wave Principle  every impulse is followed by a correction in the opposite direction  So  it is not at all surprising that the stock lost over 90  by July 2008  If this is the correct count  the 5 3 wave cycle is complete and First Horizon stock could be expected to resume its uptrend  In the very long term  this means that the bulls should be strong enough to exceed  40 53 and reach a new all time high  This is what Elliott Wave analysts mean  when they mention  undervalued  ",2016-09-18,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/first-horizon-stock-looks-ready-to-jump-200154115,200154115
178204,399720,FHN,First Horizon  FHN  Stock Slips Despite Q3 Earnings Beat,opinion,"First Horizon National Corporation   NYSE FHN   posted earnings per share of 27 cents for third quarter 2016  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents  Moreover  the figure represents an increase of 8 0  over the year ago quarter 
However  the company s stock declined 1 7   following the earnings release  Rising operating expenses and a significant increase in provisions for loan losses have made investors  apprehensive on the stock 
Nevertheless  better than expected results were aided by a rise in both net interest income and non interest income  Also  strong growth in loans and deposits supported the top line  Moreover  the company recorded a one time gain of  4 4 million related to recoveries in prior mortgage servicing sales and a  4 3 million gain from reversal of litigation accrual 
Net income for the quarter amounted to approximately  67 6 million  up 7 0  from the prior year quarter 
Segment wise  net income at Regional Banking jumped 18 2  year over year to  65 0 million  Meanwhile  net income for Fixed Income amounted to  9 5 million  compared to a net loss of 2 7 million in the year ago quarter  However  net loss at the Corporate segment totaled  11 2 million  compared to a net gain of  2 7 million in the prior year quarter  Also  the Non Strategic segment recorded a 49 0  plunge in net income to  4 3 million 
Rising Improve  But Expenses Rise
Total revenue for the quarter came in at  333 7 million  up 16  year over year  The rise was attributable to an increase in net interest income as well as fee income  Moreover  revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  327 0 million 
Net interest income increased 13 0  year over year to  185 2 million  primarily due to higher commercial loans in specialty lending areas  Net interest margin was 2 96   up 11 basis points  bps  from the prior year quarter s figure of 2 85   Non interest income climbed 19 0  year over year to  148 5 million  due to increased average daily revenues in Fixed Income and higher fees in the Regional Bank segment 
However  non interest expense rose 8 0  year over year to  233 6 million  primarily due to technology upgrades and increased personnel and marketing investments in expansion markets 
Efficiency ratio came in at around 70 0   compared to 74 5  year over year  Note that a decline in efficiency ratio indicates improvement in profitability 
Total period end loans  net of unearned income  came in at  19 6 billion  up 17  year over year  Also  total period end deposits amounted to  21 6 billion  depicting a growth of 14  from the year ago quarter 
Credit Quality  Mixed Bag
The company s provision for loan losses was  4 million  substantially up from  1 million in the prior year quarter 
However  allowance for loan losses was down 4  year over year to  201 6 million  As a percentage of period end loans on an annualized basis  allowance for loan losses was 1 03   down 23 basis points  bps  year over year 
Also  net charge offs plummeted 80  on a year over year basis to  2 3 million  As a percentage of average loans and on an annualized basis  net charge off was 0 05   down 23 bps on a year over year basis  Moreover  non performing assets dropped 20  year over year to  173 6 million 
Deterioration in Capital Ratios
Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9 79   down from 10 71  at the end of the prior year quarter 
Efficient Capital Deployment
During the quarter  First Horizon repurchased shares worth  7 1 million  Notably  the bank completed acquisition of around  537 million in franchise finance loans 
Our ViewpointFirst Horizon s results do not reflect a strong quarter  However  appreciable growth in loans and deposits  along with improvement in the company s credit quality  will likely supplement its financial strength  Also  steady capital deployment will help enhance investors  confidence in the stock However  regulatory pressure  mortgage repurchase issues and a low interest rate environment are expected to pose near term headwinds FIRST HRZN NATL Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
