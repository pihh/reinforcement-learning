140791,362306,WELL,Is Ventas Following Welltower s Lead in Standing Pat on Its Dividend ,news,"Ventas  NYSE VTR  is one of the largest players in the healthcare real estate investment trust  REIT  space  It has a long history of executing well  with its CEO often receiving awards for her management skills  But it has stumbled lately  which management believes is just a temporary supply demand mismatch  There s no particular reason to worry  except Ventas just chose to stand pat on its dividend  That breaks with recent history  What s going on 
Here s what just happened
In five of the six years leading up to 2019  Ventas increased its dividend in the fourth quarter  The one year that it didn t do this included a spin off  so that year is something of an anomaly  Investors have come to expect a dividend hike at the end of the year  It didn t happen in 2019  Ventas kept the dividend static at  0 7925 per share per quarter  If it doesn t increase the dividend at least once in 2020  the company s nine year streak of annual increases will come to an end  

Here s the thing  Welltower  NYSE WELL   one of Ventas  largest competitors  let its much longer streak of annual increases die not too long ago  Welltower hasn t increased its dividend for three years  with the last hike taking place at the start of 2017  Welltower  for reference  is considered one of the best run REITs in the healthcare niche  Healthpeak Properties  NYSE PEAK   formerly known as HCP  the other big name in the space  hasn t increased its dividend since 2017  as well  following the spin off of its nursing home business  which resulted in a reduced dividend payment to Healthpeak investors   
The lack of dividend growth at Welltower and Healthpeak was a selling point for Ventas  Although dividend growth in recent years hasn t been huge  hovering around the long term rate of inflation growth over the trailing three  and five year periods  it is much better than no growth at all  In fact  the buying power of a dividend that isn t increased over time will slowly get eroded by rising prices  That Ventas has chosen to stand pat on the dividend is a big deal  
The backstory
Despite the industry accolades  Ventas stumbled badly in 2019  It entered the year calling for a pickup in growth in 2020  but ended it by saying that the growth it expected wouldn t show up until 2021 or later  Investors were not pleased  pushing the REIT lower on the news  It has notably underperformed its two closest peers over the past year 

VTR data by YCharts
A big piece of the problem is self inflicted  Rule changes have allowed healthcare REITs to own and operate some properties  the REITs actually hire an operator  the big difference is that they do not lease the properties out   That allows the performance of these assets  called senior housing operating properties  SHOP   to flow through to the top and bottom line  When times are good  that boosts performance  When times aren t so good  it s a drag  Ventas  SHOP portfolio has struggled lately  It s not alone in that  Healthpeak s SHOP portfolio has also been weak  But Welltower s has not  it s still doing quite well  So Ventas took on the extra risk of a SHOP portfolio and didn t execute well  
Adding to the concern here is that Ventas wasn t overly responsive to analyst requests for additional clarity on 2020  The party line was that such information would be given as normal on the fourth quarter conference call  If the REIT hadn t so obviously stumbled  that would be an acceptable response  Worse  based on its implied outlook for the fourth quarter of 2019  2020 could be a tough year  To put some numbers on that  through the first nine months of 2019 normalized funds from operations  FFO  was  2 92 per share  The REIT s guidance for the full year is  3 83 per share  A little subtraction shows that normalized FFO in the fourth quarter is expected to be around  0 91 per share  
If you assume that roughly  0 90 is a run rate for 2020  full year normalized FFO comes in at around  3 60 a share next year  That s a sizable drop from 2019  And it would push the normalized FFO payout ratio up to nearly 90   That s pretty high for a healthcare REIT and doesn t leave a lot of room for further problems in the SHOP portfolio  So it is understandable that the dividend would be held static  Note that Welltower and Healthpeak are both likely to have payout ratios around the 85  range in 2019  Ventas isn t wildly out of line with peers  but with the information available today  it is understandable that investors would be concerned about the dividend  
The positive spin here is that the properties in the SHOP portfolio are getting hit by the lingering effect of a construction boom that has largely tapered off  Ventas reports that new construction is at a nine year low  Equally important  the REIT also says that customer demand remains high  So it looks like a temporary supply demand imbalance that just needs time to correct itself  If that s the case  then Ventas  with a price to normalized FFO ratio of around 15  using the 2020 FFO projection from above  and a dividend yield of 5 5   looks like a relatively good deal  Welltower is currently trading with a yield of 4 5  and a price to FFO ratio of roughly 20  based on 2019 expectations  The problem is that  without more guidance  it s hard to tell if Ventas is worth the risk  since recently weak performance could also be the start of a longer and more negative trend  Long time dividend investors know all too well that  sometimes  a dividend that stops growing can end up getting cut  
Good call  but time to pay attention
Investors looking to own a large and diversified healthcare REIT should have Ventas on their watch lists  That said  the weakness in its SHOP portfolio and the fact that it is holding pat on the dividend should be a worry  This isn t the end of the world  by any means  assuming that management is right about the supply demand outlook improving in the near future   In fact  there s still time for Ventas to extend its nine year dividend growth streak  if it hikes sometime in 2020   However  this is an issue that investors  particularly those who own the shares already  need to be watching very closely  In fact  truly conservative investors should probably stay on the sidelines here until management offers its 2020 outlook  when it reports fourth quarter results ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph2h4,2057607

140796,362311,WELL,This  Dividend Time Machine  Lets You Buy 7  Payouts At 2019 Prices,opinion,"Let s be honest  our lives would be much easier if we could just buy the typical S P 500 stock  get the 7   dividends we need for retirement  and call it a day  Trouble is  the popular kids only pay high yields when the market s in flames 
Like  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   which yields a ho hum 3 8  now  But if you d bought when stocks bottomed during the financial crisis  you d be sitting on a cash machine  back then  March 2009   Pfizer s payout shot up to an incredible 11  
Pfizer s  Very  Temporary 11  Yield






Of course  you needed quick reflexes and nerves of steel to lock in that yield before it vanished in the rebound  Luckily  I ve found a way  three ways  actually  to grab big 7  payouts much more peacefully  More on those in a moment 
Don t Let Desperation Ruin Your Retirement
These days  we re faced with the opposite situation of March  09  yields are in the basement and stocks are soaring  driving desperate retirees  and near retirees  to roll the dice on wobbly high yielders like  CenturyLink   NYSE CTL  
It s easy to see why  the telco boasts a fat 6 8  yield right now 
But that outsized yield doesn t tell you that the company slashed its payout in half last year  Over the past three years  the stock has plunged 42  while the S P 500 went 47  in the other direction 
A High Price to Pay for a 6 8  Yield






Dividend disasters like this are why I launched my  service in mid 2015  We go one step beyond the mainstream stocks everyone is obsessed with to dig up safe 7   dividend payers with price upside  too 
True to its mission  Contrarian Income Report has notched 12  annualized total returns since launch  with most of that gain in dividend cash  as I write  the 17 stocks and funds in our portfolio yield 7 1  
REITs  Retirement Income Done Right

High yielding  have been a big part of that performance  Heck  you ll double the S P 500 s yield just by swapping your sub 2  yielders for the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  NYSE VNQ   payer of a 3 3  dividend now 
But buying the  dumb  ETF still only gets you less than halfway to the 7  minimum you d need to finance your retirement 
Not good enough   By the way  I say 7  is a minimum because it ll get you  35 000 in dividend income on a  500K nest egg  which could be enough to let you retire on dividends alone  
The other problem with REITs these days is  even though I m still finding bargains for my  members  the truth is  deals are thin on the ground  as REITs have paced the market higher in the last year 
REITs Roar  Deals Disappear






But don t worry  there is still one place you can grab big 7   REIT dividends at a discount  It s an obscure corner of the market few people ever bother to check  I m talking about   including the five specific names  and three  best bets   we ll get to in a moment 
First  let me explain why CEFs offer you a great shot at 7  dividends  with upside  in this bubbly market 
 Like Buying 7 Months Ago  but With a 7  Dividend 
CEFs are similar to ETFs you can buy and sell them on the market  just like regular stocks  they give us three other critical advantages  too 
Big dividends  There are around 500 CEFs in existence  and their average yield is 7   the minimum we need for a secure our  dividends only  retirement Big discounts  CEFs often trade for less than the value of their portfolios  Called the discount to net asset value  NAV   this situation only exists with CEFs  So if you bought a CEF trading at a 7  discount  like the Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund  JRS  below  it would be like buying the typical REIT seven months ago  but with a gaudy 7  dividend Expert management for free  Unlike ETFs  CEFs are actively managed  And we re often  comped  for these pros  fees  because if a CEF trades at  say  a 7  discount and the fees are 2 1   they re covered by the discount and basically thrown into the deal By the way  you can forget what you ve heard about humans not being able to beat the index  when you dive into areas like REITs  preferred stocks and high yield bonds  managers who lose to their index are the exception  not the rule 
I ll show you that outperformance in action in a moment  First  let me roll out the five REIT owning CEFs I want to share with you today then we ll cut this down to a  shortlist  of the three best funds on this list 
5 Ways to Buy REITs at a Discount






Right away  we can see that each of these funds trades at a nice discount to NAV  And you re getting serious performance for your money here  too  with each posting at least a 7  five year annualized return 
And remember when I said it was a snap for human managers to outrun their benchmarks in markets like REITs  Check this out 
REIT CEFs Cruise Past Their Benchmark






I know there s a lot going on in this chart  but the upshot is that four out of five of the funds above did just that  with the Cohen   Steers REIT   Preferred Income Fund  RNP  only trailing VNQ by a nose 
These 2 Laggards Don t Make the Cut
That leads me straight into the real meat of this article  we re going to cut this group of five CEFs down to the top three  And we ll start by cutting our lone underperformer  RNP 
That s not the only reason why it s getting the axe  RNP also sports the smallest discount of our quintet  potentially capping our upside  and a 6 2  dividend  well short of our 7  target 
Next  let s dispatch RIF  whose big discount might also tempt you  But a big discount is useless unless management has a plan to close it  and RIF s crew hasn t done that 
RIF s Never Ending Sale






Now  management wants to transform RIF into a commercial mortgage lender  and plans to ask shareholders to vote on the change  If it doesn t get the go ahead  RMR Funds says it will likely have to cut RIF s dividend  which is already the second lowest yielder on our list  only RNP s is lower  
Verdict  I see no reason to buy into RIF s endless sale  especially with the fund aiming to move away from the CEF structure  and or potentially cutting its dividend  
The Final 3
So where does that leave us 
With a three fund  mini portfolio  of AWP  RQI and JRS  Their average dividends are right on our 7  target  plus they boast a nice 8  average dividend and 8 1  average return on NAV between them  too 

That 8  off deal let us grab top quality REITs like warehouse operator  Prologis   NYSE PLD  and senior care center operator  NYSE WELL   both top holdings of AWP  at a nice markdown 
Finally  we re getting a dose of steady preferred shares to add ballast to our REITs  thanks to RQI s preferred holdings  14  of the portfolio  and JRS s preferred stocks  40  of the portfolio  
NEW  4X Your Dividends With My  Perfect Income Portfolio 
A 7  dividend is great  but what if I told you I d found a proven way to boost that yield to 8  
In other words  if you hold the typical investor s stock portfolio  you d be yielding right around 2  today  But you could increase your income 4 TIMES just by swapping your middling S P 500 names for the diversified picks in my new    
It s hard to understate what a difference that could make  on a  500K nest egg  a  10 000 income stream becomes  40 000  Got  750K  Great  Your sorry  15 000 income becomes  60 000  
And on it goes 






We haven t even talked about the upside  If you followed the simple strategy behind this breakthrough portfolio  here s what would have happened to your cash in the last decade

140817,362332,WELL,What s In Store For Welltower  WELL  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Welltower  Inc    NYSE WELL   is scheduled to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 28  after the market closes  While the company s revenues are expected to reflect year over year  y y  growth  its funds from operations  FFO  per share is expected to have remained flat In the last reported quarter  this Toledo  OH based healthcare real estate investment trust  REIT  reported normalized FFO per share of  1 05  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Results reflected healthy same store net operating income  SSNOI  performance of its seniors housing triple net  outpatient medical and long term post acute care segments Further  Welltower delivered an average positive surprise of 0 25   in the last four quarters  surpassing estimates twice  missing on one occasion and meeting in the other  The graph below depicts this surprise history Welltower Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors at PlayThe July September period marked a busy transaction period for Welltower  The company is banking on the solid market to prune its portfolio  repositioning it for growth  In July  it announced a series of transactions to acquire seniors housing assets  medical office buildings  MOBs   and expand collaborative relationships with third party operators  In fact  as health care trends are shifting from hospitals and other high cost care settings  seniors housing communities are emerging as an increasingly important alternative  Hence  Welltower has strengthened its seniors housing portfolio backed by strategic transactions  which is anticipated to have aided the company s third quarter performance Notably  revenues from resident fees and services for the quarter are projected at  932 million  suggesting 6 5  y y growth Moreover  fundamentals of the seniors housing industry remained favorable nationwide during the third quarter  supported by decent occupancy and demand  from the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing   Care  NIC  indicates that seniors housing occupancy rate in the United States registered a sequential expansion of 30 basis points  bps  to 88  during the quarter  This was aided by increase in occupancy at independent living  IL  properties and assisted living  AL  properties  As compared with the prior quarter  third quarter occupancy at IL properties advanced 20 bps to 90 2   while the same at AL properties climbed 30 bps to 85 4     Although developers have been adding seniors housing properties to the market  in a bid to benefit from the upcoming silver tsunami  rising construction costs and lower development yields have cooled down the construction pipeline  The 30 basis point sequential decline in annual inventory growth during the quarter under review highlights the decline in construction starts for new seniors housing units Sluggish growth in development activity  along with favorable demand trends  will likely have aided performance of healthcare REITS in third quarter 2019 Further  Welltower has been making acquisitions in its MOB portfolio  Given the better risk reward profile as compared to senior housing  benefits from its MOB investments are expected to have contributed to the company s quarterly revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter 2019 revenues is pegged at  1 31 billion  indicating 6 1  growth on a y y basis Nonetheless  the NIC data suggests annual rent growth for seniors housing properties shrunk 30 bps sequentially to 2 7  during the September end quarter  We believe  this  along with management s expectation of higher insurance premiums and tough comp in second half 2019  will likely have moderated SSNOI growth for its seniors housing operating portfolio during the quarter under review In addition  the company exited its Benchmark Senior Living s portfolio during the quarter for  1 8 billion  This is likely to have resulted in earnings dilution  Also  elevated laborcostsmight have put pressure on its bottom line growth for the third quarter In fact  prior to the third quarter earnings release  the company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter to be reported has been revised marginally downward to  1 04 over the past week  reflecting analysts  bearish sentiments Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Welltower this time around  A

140845,362360,WELL,U S  Booming Real Estate Could See Storm Clouds,opinion,"The U S  real estate market is booming  The Wall Street Journal reported that real estate stocks are reaching new highs  and home prices are rising across the United States  Higher prices will spook investors who remember 2008  but many of the factors which caused that crash  such as lower lending standards and excessive house flipping  are not present 
There are certain troubles on the horizon which could spell trouble for the real estate market and the U S  economy by extension  but I remain convinced that the real estate market will perform well for at least the rest of 2019  Nevertheless  here are some of the key trends  both positive and negative  to watch for in real estate 
Booming Demand for REITs
Real estate stocks and REITs have become popular investment vehicles for investors chasing reliable yields  The 10 year treasury rate has fallen over a whole percentage point compared to last October  and there are strong indications that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates later this year  With bonds becoming less attractive  REITs become a stronger alternative 
Investors can turn towards REIT ETFs such as iShares US Real Estate  NYSE IYR  or Schwab  NYSE SCHH   but an alternative is to look for REITs which specialize in growing fields in the U S  market  For example  Welltower Inc  NYSE WELL  is a large REIT which focuses its portfolio on senior housing and healthcare properties  and we know how the healthcare industry will continue to grow as the American population ages  Welltower has seen its stock rise by 45  over the past 12 months while offering a 5 5  dividend 
E commerce and industrial REITs are other strong sectors which can count on growth  Even retail based REITs  which may seem like a bad investment due to the decline in physical retail  can be strong value investments depending on the company and location  If you want a reliable yield greater than bonds  real estate stocks are currently a strong investment 
A Strong Economy
The real estate market should be expected to do well because general indicators for the U S  economy remain positive  There are some disconcerting factors  such as the Fed backtracking from raising interest rates as well as the threat of a trade war  And we should expect a slowdown in growth later in the year which will continue in 2020 
But that does not take away from the fact that unemployment is low  wages are rising  and consumers are willing to spend money on homes  If there is an economic slowdown or even a recession in the next year or two  it will not be remotely as dramatic or catastrophic as 2008 
The Generational Conflict
Finally  no discussion about the real estate market is complete without noting the real generational battle between millennials and older generations  Millennials want to buy property in popular locations such as in cities along the two coasts  which has led to local housing markets going completely haywire  Millennials cannot buy homes because they are not affordable  The Atlantic points out that it would take a millennial making the average wage in Los Angeles 43 years to save up enough money for a down payment
Basic economics dictates that if there is an excess of demand for a product  the supply of the product will increase to meet the demand  But that is not what we are seeing with housing in places like San Francisco or Washington D C  While there are a variety of factors behind this failure to build  a major factor is that current homeowners do not want housing built which would lower property values and hurt their bottom line 
Other proposals have been floated around in order to combat high housing prices  Rent control is a popular idea with politicians if not with economists  Regulations against foreigners holding houses have been proposed  which might be comparable with the free zone versus freehold property model which exists in Dubai 
The conflict between homeowners and prospective homebuyers could depress sales in the long term  hurting the real estate market and stocks and threatening changes in government regulations on housing  We have growing political pressure in favor of building in the form of the  YIMBY  movement  But in 2019 and 2020  homeowners will continue to have the advantage  boosting prices and stock values 
Overblown Fears
Memories of 2008 are still fresh in many investors  minds  which means that the slightest twinge in the markets sends people panicking about another real estate bubble or downturn  But the U S  economy should be expected to do well for the rest of 2019 and much of 2020  and real estate is in an even stronger position  Whether it is homes in California  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  warehouses  or industrial businesses rising  real estate stocks have plenty of room for growth and further dividends 
With bonds in their current dismal state and real estate demand high  REITs are the best place for investors looking for a strong  reliable yield  Pick out businesses and properties in sectors which will continue to stay in demand over the long term  and prepare to reap the rewards 
The U S  real estate market is booming  The Wall Street Journal reported that real estate stocks are reaching new highs  and home prices are rising across the United States  Higher prices will spook investors who remember 2008  but many of the factors which caused that crash  such as lower lending standards and excessive house flipping  are not present 
There are certain troubles on the horizon which could spell trouble for the real estate market and the U S  economy by extension  but I remain convinced that the real estate market will perform well for at least the rest of 2019  Nevertheless  here are some of the key trends  both positive and negative  to watch for in real estate ",2019-06-21,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-booming-real-estate-could-see-storm-clouds-200433748,200433748
140850,362365,WELL,Factors Setting The Tone For Welltower s  WELL  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Welltower  Inc    NYSE WELL   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 31  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year  y y  growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Toledo  OH based healthcare real estate investment trust  REIT  posted reported normalized FFO per share of  1 02  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results reflected healthy performance of its seniors housing triple net  outpatient medical and long term post acute care segments Further  Welltower delivered an average positive surprise of 0 26   in the last four quarters  surpassing estimates twice  missing on one occasion and meeting in the other  The graph below depicts this surprise history Welltower Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors at Play from the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing   Care  NIC  indicates that fundamentals of the seniors housing industry weakened nationwide during the second quarter  with occupancy rates dropping to the lowest level occupancy level since second quarter 2011 In fact  senior housing occupancy rate in the United States decreased to 87 8  during the quarter under review  indicating a sequential decline of 20 basis points  bps   Additionally  annual rent growth shrunk 20 bps sequentially to 2 9  Further  existing excess speculative supply of seniors housing properties has likely dampened seniors housing fundamentals  Hence  lackluster senior housing fundamentals will likely result in a decline in Welltower s revenues from the seniors housing operating portfolio  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues from seniors housing operating portfolio is pegged at  842 million  calling for a sequential decline of 3 4  Although developers have been adding senior housing properties to the market at an aggressive pace since 2014  rising construction costs and lower development yields have cooled down the construction pipeline recently  The 10 bps decline in annual inventory growth during the quarter underlines this downward trend in construction starts for new senior housing units Further  the demographic driven demand boom from the aging boomer generation remains the most significant tailwind for healthcare REITs  Specifically  this generation is a wealthier cohort  anticipated to lead longer lives  thereby  consuming healthcare at a rate far exceeding

140857,362372,WELL,Realty Income  O  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Realty Income Corp    NYSE O   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results after market close on May 1  The company s results are anticipated to reflect year over year increase in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this monthly dividend paying real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 5 3  in terms of FFO per share  The company benefited from year over year growth in revenues and also witnessed high occupancy levels Over the trailing four quarters  Realty Income surpassed estimates on three occasions and met in the other  resulting in average positive surprise of 2 28   This is depicted in the graph below Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderRealty Income s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant  industry  geography and property type  Further  this freestanding retail REIT derives more than 90  of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service  non discretionary and low price retail businesses  Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions  as well as competition from Internet retailing  This is expected to contribute to its cash flow in the first quarter In addition  the healthy U S  economy and job market gains are important catalysts for the retail real estate industry s growth  Consumer confidence is getting a boost  fueled by job growth and rising wages  thereby spurring demand for retail goods  This is anticipated to have sent positive ripple effects across the industry in the to be reported quarter In addition  the company focuses on external growth through exploring accretive acquisition opportunities  Healthy property acquisition volume at decent investment spreads will likely aid the company s first quarter performance Realty Income s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have also helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently  Since 1996  the company s occupancy level has not moved below 96   This trend is likely to have continued in the to be reported quarter as well  Further  same store rent growth is likely to exhibit limited operational volatility These are anticipated to lead to higher quarterly revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is pegged at  347 6 million  indicating a rise of 9 2  from the year ago reported figure Nonetheless  despite all these efforts  the choppy retail real estate environment might limit its growth momentum to some extent as secular industry headwinds  including retailer downsizing and tenant bankruptcies are continuing to affect the industry fundamentals Recent  from Reis shows that the neighborhood and community shopping center vacancy rate remained flat in the first quarter at 10 2   but marginally inched up from prior year s 10   Additionally  the regional mall vacancy rate witnessed an uptick of 0 3  to 9 3  during the quarter  Nonetheless  national average asking rent and effective rent inched up 0 4  on a sequential basis and 1 6  year over year In addition  Realty Income has substantial exposure to single tenant assets which raises its risks associated with tenant default Further  prior to the first quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at 80 cents over the past month  Nevertheless  the figure indicates a 1 3  increase from the year ago reported figure Here is what our quantitative model predicts Realty Income does not have the right combination

Price and EPS Surprise   MAA has provided guidance for first quarter 2019 FFO per share and expects it to be in the range of  1 41  1 53  Let s see how things are shaping up  prior to this announcement Factors at Play Going by a recent  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    the U S  apartment market managed to retain the rent momentum achieved in the later part of 2018  although new supply volumes remained elevated during the January March quarter  Apartment rents were up 3 2  on an annual basis as of first quarter 2019  In fact  for six straight months  annual rent growth exceeded the 3  mark  In addition  occupancy came in at 95 2  in the quarter  expanding 10 basis points year on year  Also  occupancy came in at 95 4   up from 95  reported at year end 2017  Reflecting the strongest demand realized since 2010  occupied apartment tally moved up 323 290 units in 2019  and demand surpassed annual completions that aggregated 287 007 units Notably  a decent economy and job market gains drove demand for residential space in first quarter 2019  Further  favorable demographics  lifestyle transformation and household creation trends remain tailwinds Amid this encouraging backdrop  MAA s redevelopment program that entails interior upgrades is expected to attract renters during the quarter  In fact  these upgrades provide the company with higher pricing power  thereby driving top line growth  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2019 revenues is pinned at  400 2 million  calling for a year over year improvement of 4 6  Further  the March end quarter is also the one in which the company will report its first results after completing integration efforts with regard to the Post Properties merger  Through enhanced scale and leveraging  the company is expected to generate higher operating margins in the to be reported quarter However  MAA has been experiencing new supply across a number of markets  This new supply is anticipated to limit the company s ability to demand higher rents and may result in lesser absorption rates at its properties Furthermore  MAA s activities during the quarter under review were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter 2019 FFO per share remained unchanged at  1 50  over the last 30 days  indicating year over

140869,362384,WELL,What s In The Cards For Annaly Capital  NLY  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Annaly Capital Management Inc    NYSE NLY   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on May 1  after the market closes  The company s earnings per share  EPS  will likely decline year over year  y y  
In the last reported quarter  this mortgage real estate investment trust  REIT  posted core earnings of 29 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents  However  net interest income  NII  totaling  272 9 million  witnessed a sequential decline of around 13 5  in the fourth quarter 
Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and met in the other two  It delivered an average positive surprise of 1 76  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history 
Annaly Capital Management Inc Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play 
Following a turbulent fourth quarter 2018  the agency MBS sector benefited from the Fed s dovish stance  In fact  per   in the first quarter  agency MBS recovered nearly half of negative excess return incurred in 2018 by posting excess return of 28 basis points  bps  compared to treasuries 
This is expected to drive Annaly s first quarter 2019 returns  which primarily invests in agency MBS  Further  in a bid to diversify the investment portfolio  the company has been aiming to expand its holding in credit focused asset classes  Since credit focused residential investments are less affected by rate volatility  these strategic investments will likely lent support to the company in the quarter under review 
Also  stable interest rates are expected to reduce agency prepayments and improve sentiments across the broader mREIT sector 
Additionally  it raised nearly  840 million in gross proceeds through an overnight common stock offering in January  This will likely open up ample investment opportunities for the company to expand its three credit businesses 
Further  Annaly is anticipated to have benefited from a diverse funding profile and impressive liquidity position  Notably  with easy access to financing capital  the company has likely enjoyed flexibility in the opportunistic enhancement of its portfolio 
However  U S  housing activity was dismal in the March end quarter  In fact  the first quarter is seasonally slower for housing activity  as compared with the second and third quarters that are key home buying seasons  This is likely to impact the company s mortgage origination business 
In addition  the U S  treasury yield curve inversion and weaker U S  economic fundamentals might act as dampeners for the company in the to be reported quarter  Furthermore  interest rate volatility and wider Agency MBS spreads in the January March quarter might affect Annaly s net book value 
Lastly  Annaly s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter FFO remained unchanged at 29 cents in a month s time  In addition  it indicates a 3 3  year over year decline 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Annaly is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

company has more than 37 years of experience in the outlet industry and its properties are leased to more than 3 100 stores which are operated by more than 530 different brand name companies Amid choppy environment in the retail real estate market  Tanger Outlet has been making strategic efforts to boost its mall traffic and filling vacancies with new high quality in demand tenants  The company focuses on merchandising its centers  and targets popular and productive tenants  It takes strategic marketing measures to drive traffic and boost loyalty for Tanger brand  The company is also focusing on helping online brands which are looking for addition of retail store component to their growth strategy  Such efforts help the company maintain a solid occupancy and the trend is likely to continue in the to be reported quarter as well Nevertheless  despite the company resorting to different strategies  mall traffic continues to decline  owing to a change in shopping patterns  with online purchases taking precedence over in store purchases  This has forced retailers to reconsider their strategy and shift investments from traditional retailing to online channels  and optimize their brick and mortar presence These optimization efforts and the consequent decision to close stores by a number of retailers have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords  Additionally  retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies  This is affecting the demand for retail real estate space and has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs like Tanger Outlet Also  the recent  from Reis shows that the neighborhood and community shopping center vacancy rate remained flat in the fourth quarter at 10 2   However  it inched up from 10  at year end 2017  Mall vacancy rate edged down to 9  in the quarter from the third quarter s 9 1   At year end 2017  the mall vacancy was 8 3  Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  121 4 million   indicating a year over year fall of almost 4    Adjustments to rents and term are likely to have continued in the quarter as the company aggressively seeks to increase occupancy with productive tenants  Rental growth is likely to remain muted and same center NOI might be impacted in the quarter under review amid store closures and lease modifications In fact  for

consolidated portfolio Furthermore  Tanger Outlet s activities during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at 62 cents over the last 60 days  The figure also indicates nearly a 6 06  decline  year over year   Here is what our quantitative model predicts Tanger Outlet does not have

announced that Welltower and ProMedica Health System would acquire Quality Care Properties  QCP  real estate in newly formed joint venture  80 20   for  20 75 per share  Also  ProMedica entered into a definitive deal to acquire the operations of HCR ManorCare and Arden Courts  QCP s principal tenants  In addition  ProMedica would enter into a 15 year absolute triple net master lease as a tenant to real estate joint venture Notably  this  2 2 billion Welltower investment is estimated to provide around 20 cents per share annual accretion to the company  Further  it represents an 8  initial cash yield and 1 8xproperty level EBITDAR coverage  with corporate lease guarantee from a secure investment grade health system  Moreover  with this partnership  ProMedica will gain immediate scale in the

At this time  WELL has a subpar Growth Score of D  though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with an F  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy

140964,362479,WELL,7 REITs To Buy Now And Hold Forever,opinion,"Real estate investment trusts  REITs  and their typically high dividend yields are a key part of a payout powered retirement portfolio that s built to dish out higher and higher dividends every single year 
The five REITs we ll discuss today will pay you 4  to 7 3  per year in dividends alone  And this income stream will only grow as time passes  because these firms have growing cash flow streams they must pass on to shareholders in order to keep their privileged REIT status 
REITs may not get much mainstream coverage  but the academics are starting to catch on to these dividend machines  Last year  I pointed you to a study from Wilshire Research that showed  dramatic  results when REITs were added to a retirement portfolio 
Let s also consider recent research from global benchmarking company CEM Benchmarking that shows publicly traded real estate has no equal in retirement focused accounts 
Equity REITs Are the Best of the Best
Source  Alexander D  Beath  PhD   Chris Flynn  CFA CEM Benchmarking Inc 
Their important finding   Listed equity REITs had the highest average net return over the period  averaging 11 4   
Ready to retire  Stick with REITs  They re the best asset class for retirees who  ironically  aren t invested in them  More from CEM Benchmarking  emphasis mine  
Although they had the highest arithmetic average annual net return of 11 4 percent over the period  listed equity REITs were the least used asset class covered in the study  Allocations to listed equity REITs averaged just 0 6 percent of total assets 
If you re looking to live off of dividends in your retirement  you must consider REITs  Here are five candidates that pay 4  and up today 
MGM Growth Properties LLC  NYSE MGP Dividend Yield  5 8 
MGM Growth Properties  MGP  is a relatively new kid on the block in the REIT world  spun off of MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM  in 2016  This REIT owns seven Las Vegas properties including Mandalay Bay  Luxor and the Mirage  a handful of regional resorts in places such as Atlantic City and Washington  D C   and a right of first offer on an MGM property being built in Springfield  Massachusetts 
I like this regional coverage for two reasons 
It provides diversification against Las Vegas  inevitable ups and downs 
It gives MGM and MGP exposure to the eventual boom that I expect to see across the rest of the U S  as other states begin to legalize sports betting 
I also like what I see in examining MGP s dividend  The REIT has hiked its payout four times in nine quarters  and the company has done so with a very reasonable payout ratio of just under 80  
Just remember  The success of gaming stocks and REITs is heavily tied to a strong economy  so all bets are off if America s current economic boom starts to peter out 
Until then  game on 
MGM Growth Properties   MGP  Price Should Follow Its Dividend Higher
Gaming and Leisure Properties  GLPI Dividend Yield  7 3 
Speaking of the virtues of regional gaming  Gaming and Leisure Properties  GLPI  is intriguing for its  pop  potential 
GLPI is another spinoff  carved out from Penn National Gaming Inc  NASDAQ PENN  back in 2013  The company owns a few dozen regional casino and gaming properties in 14 states and leases them out on a triple net basis to the likes of Penn National and Pinnacle Entertainment Inc  NASDAQ PNK   Their six Mississippi properties may get a lift from the state s new legalized sports betting  too 
Management seems to believe in their own stock  too  Gaming and Leisure Properties enjoyed some aggressive insider buying earlier this year  And Wall Street analysts are high on its growth prospects  too  modeling 7  EPS growth this year followed by a 22  burst in 2019 
Pebblebrook Hotel Trust  NYSE PEB Dividend Yield  4 1 
Pebblebrook Hotel Trust  PEB  is a play on another one of my favorite mega trends  the  experience economy   Americans increasingly seem to value experiences more than acquiring a mountain of stuff  and we re especially seeing this trend play out in the ever important  and affluent  Millennial generation 
Pebblebrook is a hotel REIT that targets the most important economic class  the rich  The United States  middle class is shrinking rapidly  meaning you re either chasing low income Americans or the well heeled   and you and I both know which route leads to fatter profits 
Pebblebrook has a tight portfolio of just 28 properties  but most of these house elite properties such as the LaPlaya Beach Resort   Club in Naples  Florida  the Hotel Monaco in Washington  D C   and the Hotel Palomar in Los Angeles  There s some geographic diversity  though PEB s properties are primarily crowded along the West Coast s largest cities 
This is a potential turning point for Pebblebrook  This month  the company beat out Blackstone Group LP  NYSE BX  to buy up LaSalle Hotel Properties  NYSE LHO  for  5 2 billion  which will boost its portfolio of hotel properties to 66   though the company s expected to sell at least three LaSalle properties and execute other asset sales to tamp down debt 
This merger is a double down on the strong U S  economy  If America keeps it up  Pebblebrook stands to come out smelling like a rose 
Pebblebrook  PEB  Will Try to Spark Growth Through M A 
CubeSmart  NYSE CUBE Dividend Yield  4 0 
Self storage REIT CubeSmart  CUBE  is a model operator that continues to grow like a weed  It also has been a serial dividend raiser for years  boosting its quarterly payout by 217  over the past five years 
CubeSmart  CUBE   419  FFO Growth Since 2010
Unsurprisingly  Wall Street has priced it at a premium 
CubeSmart owns 981 self storage properties across the U S   providing not just traditional personal storage solutions  but also business  vehicle and boat storage options  That gives it reach 
Demand comes from the very nature of CubeSmart s business  Self storage is an  anytime  industry   economic expansions see a greater need for storage as people accumulate more stuff  and economic contractions usher in a greater need for storage as people need to find a place to store their things as they scale back into smaller living quarters 
But what makes CubeSmart the dynamo you see today is a brilliant set of proprietary systems that help manage inventory and maximize space efficiency  as well as a sophisticated rate increase system to help squeeze out more profits from customers while still retaining them for the long term 
That s how the company has more than doubled FFO over the past five years alone  and why analysts continue to project high single digit top line growth over the next few years  That in turn should keep CUBE chugging higher  rain or shine 
Welltower Inc  NYSE WELL Dividend Yield  5 2 
Baby Boomer plays will continue to be an investing gold mine for the next decade or more  America s 65 plus population is expected to explode by 36  by 2025  In the REIT category  we can primarily play the boomers through either healthcare or senior living 
Welltower  WELL  gives us a little bit of both 
You might remember Welltower as Health Care REIT  NYSE WELL   but the company rebranded in 2015  and changed its ticker from HCN in 2018   and has widened its focus over the past few years  too 
This monster of a real estate company owns 1 502 properties  Importantly  93  of NOI comes from private pay sources  so Welltower s success doesn t hinge on what the government decides to do with programs such as Medicare and Medicaid 
The wild card to watch right now is a first of its kind joint venture with top 15 U S  health system Promedica  which includes a 15 year absolute triple net master lease 
Under that system  Welltower is expected to generate 67  of net operating income coming from senior housing  under brands such as Sunrise Senior Living and Silverado   16  from outpatient medical  10  from long term post acute care and 7  from health systems 
Just keep an eye on the dividend  While the payout ratio is perfectly healthy at a little more than 80   the payout didn t come up at its normal time earlier this year  The company has one more quarter to keep up its streak of dividend hikes 
Income Investors Are Waiting on Welltower  WELL  
My Top 2 REIT Buys  Recession and Rate Proof Landlords for 7 5   Yields with 25  Upside
These five REITs are laudable  but they re not quite elite   not like my two favorite REITs  which are comfortably positioned in recession proof industries 
They ll have no problem continuing to raise their rents   and reward their shareholders   no matter what the Fed decides at its next meeting  what President Trump tweets or when the stock market finally takes a breather 
My favorite commercial real estate lender  a 7 7  yielder   lets us play Monopoly from the convenience of our brokerage accounts  They do all the legwork  building a secure  diversified loan portfolio featuring offices  retail space  hotels and multifamily units 
Management then collects the monthly payments  deposits the checks  and then it sends most of the profits our way as dividends  a legal requirement to have REIT status  
Better still  this firm has also smartly eliminated interest rate risk because it uses floating rates  In fact  it s actually set up to make more money as interest rates move higher 
More Income as Interest Rates Rise
Another REIT favorite of mine is a 7 5  payer backed by an unstoppable demographic trend that will deliver growing dividends for the next 30 years  Interest rates are no problem for this landlord because it will simply continue raising the rents on its  must have  facilities 
Its founder Ed admitted that  14 years ago  he had  zero assets  a dream  and a business plan   Well  his dream and plan were plenty   the visionary entrepreneur parlayed them into more than  6 7 billion in assets 
Right now is the best time yet to  bet on Ed  because his growing base of assets is generating higher and higher cash flows  powering an accelerating dividend 

I love dividend increases because they are proof that management is actually making more money  so it can afford to pay us shareholders more  And an accelerating payout is a flat out cry for help 
These two REITs are both  best buys  in my 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio   an 8  dividend paying portfolio that lets retirees live on secure payouts alone  Now  as active recommendations for my premium subscribers  it wouldn t be fair to reveal their names here

141050,362565,WELL,100 High Yield Stocks Down Big Last Week  These 10 Are Worth Considering,opinion,"Stock of the Week
Last week was volatile and painful for many higher yielding securities  For example  REITs  BDCs and MLPs  all known for high yield  sold off significantly  see charts below   We are in no way suggesting last week was a bottom  or suggesting an immediate rebound  for any of these securities  but we do believe some high quality companies have sold off thereby making for more attractive entry points for long term investors  This article highlights 100 high yield equities that sold off last week  and then reviews 10 specific opportunities that long term income focused investors may want to consider 
For starters  here is the list of 100 high yield equities that sold off 

 Data source  Stock Rover  Data dates  4 28 17   5 4 17  
Before getting into the ten specific opportunities  first we review a few reasons for the sell off  For example  declining oil prices hurt the energy sector  which clearly had a big impact on many of the Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  in the group because they are largely energy related 

And here is a look at the recent performance of the Alerian MLP Index 


However  in addition to hurting the energy sector  declining oil prices also hurts many high yield debt securities  Specifically  here is a look at the High Yield Bond ETF  NYSE JNK  versus the S P 500 over the last week 


And interestingly  as high yield sells off  BDCs often sell off too  The reason is because BDCs provide financing  generally debt  to riskier middle market companies  BDC s are often essentially riskier high yield debt funds   And here is a look at the BDC index performance versus the S P 500 

Additionally  REITs are also sensitive to the debt markets because they rely on outside capital to finance growth  REITs have significantly underperformed the market SPY  NYSE SPY  over the last year because investors fear the negative impacts of rising interest rates  especially considering the aggressive growth agenda of the Trump Administration  Here is a look at how REITs have performed over the last year and over the last week 

 Note  REITs made up a lot of ground on Friday  but not all of them did as we ll see later in this report  
And here is a look at the decline in interest rates  long dated treasuries  over the last week 

Overall  it was a tough environment for REITs  BDCs and MLPs last week  and that helps explain the declines  However  we also believe the declines have created some attractive entry points for long term investors  For example  here are ten specific high yield investment opportunities that income focused investors may want to consider given the recent decline in prices 
Real Estate Investment Trusts  REITs 
1  Welltower  NYSE HCN   Yield  5 0 
Welltower is a big dividend healthcare REIT that was down 2 3  the last week  It is one of the more blue chip opportunities in the healthcare REIT space  and it currently trades at an attractive 15 times Funds from Operations  FFO  

Welltower is  well diversified across senior housing  triple net and operating   outpatient medical and long term post acute   It also benefits from strong demographic tailwinds of an aging population and growing healthcare needs  If you are looking for a high quality REIT that pays a big dividend and trades at an attractive price  Welltower is worth considering 
2  Realty Income  NYSE O   Yield 4 5 
Realty Income is an income investor favorite because it pays big safe monthly dividends  And as the following chart shows  its price came down significantly last week 

Additionally  the dividend payment has increased for 77 consecutive quarters  We believe O is worth considering now because its business remains strong but its valuation has also come down  Specifically  the following chart shows that Realty Income s price versus its Funds from Operations   FFO   has come down significantly since last summer  i e  the shares are on sale  


Plus  Realty Income only expects to pay out   83  of its adjusted FFO as dividends in 2017  which is a healthy margin of safety for this low beta company  If you are a long term  income focused  value investor  Realty Income is worth considering  especially after this week s decline 

3  Omega Healthcare Investors  NYSE OHI   Yield  8 0 
In our view  Omega is an exceptionally attractive  undervalued  big dividend healthcare REIT  And its price has become decidedly more attractive over the last week 

Besides the sell off in REITs  Omega was already on sale due to uncertainty surrounding Congressional efforts to repeal replace the Affordable Care Act  Simply put  investors are afraid  Omega s price has also been dragged lower as the entire REIT sector is down due to rising interest rates fears  In our view  both of these fears are baked in and overblown  and Omega currently represents an exceptional contrarian opportunity to invest in a big safe dividend 
With regards to healthcare reform  here is what Omega had to say in its most recent investor presentation 

Specifically  Omega believes the healthcare reform fears are overblown because alternative payment models will expand under Medicare  And regarding Medicaid  the phase in process will be long thereby allowing states to offset the burden  and Omega s geographic diversification will help minimize the impact of rate changes in any one state 
On a comparative basis  skilled nursing facilities REITs  like Omega  have lagged the overall healthcare REIT space because of the regulatory reform uncertainty  Also  these REITs still have some of the highest short interest as fearful investors continue to place their bets  Worth noting  despite the high short interest  Omega has a relatively high expected annual earnings growth rate of 15 8  over the next five years  largely because the demographics of a growing aging population with increasing healthcare needs are strongly on Omega s side  
Also  as we mentioned previously  the entire REIT group has sold off because investors are afraid that rising rates will negatively impact these highly levered companies  i e  they use a healthy amount of debt to run their businesses   However  this fear is already significantly baked in  the prices are down   and Omega has the strong ability to continue to generate FFO to cover and grow its dividend  In fact  Omega recently raised its dividend  again  and announced that their earnings expectations continue to rise 
Overall  we recognize Omega faces unique regulatory reform risks  but we believe it is a risk worth taking  If you are an income focused value investor  Omega is absolutely worth considering  especially after this week s sell off  
4  Physicians Realty Trust  NYSE DOC   Yield  4 7 
Physicians Realty is another attractive healthcare REIT that sold off significantly this week  as shown in the following chart 

As we wrote two weeks ago 
 Physicians Realty Trust is a differentiated  high income  contrarian opportunity in the Medical Office Building REIT space  The company faces risks related to healthcare reform and rising interest rates  but its valuation remains attractive given the high growth opportunities  If you are an income focused investor  Physicians Realty Trust is worth considering for an allocation within your diversified investment portfolio

Master Limited Partnerships
5  CVR Energy  NYSE CVI   Yield  9 4 
Though technically not an MLP  CVI is a holding company that controls two partnerships  CVRR and UAN   It also pays a big dividend  and the shares sold off significantly over the last week  as shown in the following chart 

CVI is certainly not a  widows and orphans  stock  i e  it is very risky   but it also has a couple power forces on its side  Mainly  Carl Icahn and Donald Trump  Specifically  Icahn is a highly seasoned and successful investor that controls CVI  and he is also currently a special advisor to President Trump  We recently wrote in detail about the risks and rewards of this opportunity in our article titled      The shares are up since our article was posted back in late March  but the recent pullback may be giving investors another bite at this apple  If you are a long term income focused investor  will an iron stomach   CVI may be worth considering 
6  Teekay Offshore  NYSE TOO   Yield  9 4 
We ve been following Teekay for over a year now  and its 10 2  price decline over the last week makes it more interesting  in our view 

If you don t know  Teekay is a provider of marine transportation  mainly oil production  storage  long distance towing and offshore installation and maintenance and safety services to the offshore oil industry in North Sea  Brazil and the East Coast of Canada 
The maritime shipping industry as a whole has been in distress over the last 18 months as companies struggle with declining commodity prices and an oversupply of shipping capacity  Teekay appears to be one of the companies that will survive  Even though it dramatically cut its dividend a little over a year ago  and its price declined sharply  it is still in business and paying a dividend  unlike many of its peers that have cut their dividends to zero  or filed for bankruptcy altogether   This one is not for the faint of heart  but if you believe the economy will continue to recover  Teekay may be worth considering 
7  Teekay Preffered Shares  NYSE TOO pa   Yield  8 8 
If the common stock is too risky for you  then you might consider the preferred shares which are far less volatile and sit higher in the capital structure  Unlike the common shares  the preferred shares haven t cut the dividend  and the price was down only about 4  over the last week  You can read our write up on the preferred shares from May 2016 here    Incidentally  the shares are up since our article was written  but they still trade below their  25 redemption price  Teekay can redeem them at  25 per share after April 30  2018   The shares are down 4  over the last week  and they currently trade at  20 59 
8  Ares Capital Corporation  NASDAQ ARCC   Yield  9 2 
Ares Capital is a big dividend BDC that has experienced a 5 5  price decline over the last week 

In particular  the shares were down after a sluggish first quarter   in this case it isn t all about the macro  it s company specific too   Specifically  core earnings were only  0 32 per share versus  0 37 a year ago  and estimates of  0 38  CEO Kipp deVeer attribute the declines to a competitive market environment  In our view  the BDC industry as a whole faces challenges such as high valuations  less opportunities  and more competition  However  ARCC is a large BDC with deep relationships to source deals  and we like that the recent price decline brings its shares back closer to par with its book value 
9  Medley Capital Corporation  NYSE MCC   Yield  11 7 
Sticking with the BDC theme  Medley Capital is another big dividend name that is down significantly over the last week 

To be upfront  MCC is a high risk opportunity  and is likely not for everyone  but if you are interested in higher risk reward opportunities  MCC may be worth considering  Specifically  we believe that Medley s dividend is healthy despite challenging market conditions  Also  relative to peers  and on an absolute basis  Medley s valuation is attractive  You can read our recent write up on Medley here   
10  Stag Industrial  NYSE STAG   Yield  5 4 
Stag Industrial is a big dividend industrial REIT  and its shares are down significantly over the last week 

Many investors appreciate the monthly dividend payments provided by Stag  and we also like its valuation at around 14 3 times FFO  The company announce earnings earlier this week whereby FFO was in line with expectations  and revenues were better than expected  We wrote more about the attractiveness of STAG last fall  read that article    and we still consider it attractive despite its price gains so long as the economy remains strong 
Conclusion
The combination of recent earnings announcements  rising interest rates  and declining energy prices has resulted in significant price declines for many high yield REITs  BDCs and MLPs  However  we believe investors should be selective  Just because the yield is high  doesn t mean it is a good investment  Investors should always work to cater their investment selections to meet their individual needs and risk tolerances within the constructs of a diversified investment portfolio ",2017-05-08,Blue Harbinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/100-high-yield-stocks-down-big-last-week:-these-10-are-worth-considering-200187579,200187579
141051,362566,WELL,Market Top Coming  10 Safe High Income Opportunities,opinion,"According to Bank of America s chief investment strategist  Michael Hartnett  it s  no longer politically acceptable  for central banks  to stoke  the  Wall St  bubble   likely setting up for a  big top  in stock markets this fall 
At Blue Harbinger  we believe the stock market is going much  much higher over the long term  but we also know many investors simply cannot stomach short  and intermediate term volatility  and thereby prefer to focus their investments on safe income generating opportunities instead of simply very long term capital appreciation 
This article highlights 10 high income investments opportunities that we believe are worth considering 
The Qualitative and Quantitative Backdrop 
Before getting into the 10 high income opportunities  it is helpful to examine the current state of the market in terms of a narrative and then actual data  The narrative is that central banks are reducing the easy monetary policies  low interest rates  quantitative easing  that helped lead the world out of the 2008 2009 financial crisis  And as the volume of that narrative increases  the data show the multi year market rally is flashing serious signs of capitulation  For example  consider the data in the following table 

Specifically  we see three groups of data that strongly support the narrative that the rally is capitulating  First  growth  IWD  and technology  QQQ   XLK  stocks have been underperforming the rest of the market over the last week and the last month  And as the data in the above chart show  this is the exact opposite of what has happened over the last one  three and five years  And this data fits the narrative that the fed s extended period of easy money  which favors growth and technology stocks  is expected to dissipate  i e  the market is forward looking  
Second  international  non US  stocks  EEM   EFA   ACWX  have been beating US stocks so far this year  and this is the exact opposite of what has happened over the last three and five years  And as the narrative goes  the US led the world into the financial crisis  and they ve lead the world out of it too  And considering the  connectedness  of global markets  it would have been unreasonable for US central bank monetary policies to be drastically different  more hawkish  than non US monetary policies  i e  even if the US wanted to tighten sooner  it would have been unreasonable because the rest of the world was still easing to deal with more challenged economic condition   And now that the rest of world is stronger  or at least expected to be per strong international equity market performance   it makes sense for the US to tighten monetary policies  And the data fits this narrative 
Third  highly levered and high dividend paying REITs  VNQ  have been underperforming the rest of the market over the last week  month and year  and this is both a signal and an opportunity  First  it is a signal that REITs  which rely on debt to grow  will likely face more expensive financing costs in the years ahead as interest rates rise 
However  this is also an opportunity  because not all REITs are created equally  the weak will struggle  the strong will flourish  and the recent REIT sell off  see the chart above  has created an attractive opportunity to invest in select REITs that have inappropriately sold off  more on this later  
And with that qualitative and quantitative backdrop in mind  here is the list   
10  Welltower Inc  NYSE HCN   Yield  4 8 
Welltower is a big dividend  blue chip  healthcare REIT that is well diversified across senior housing  triple net and operating   outpatient medical  and long term post acute  And as the following chart shows  its shares have performed poorly over the last year and especially over the last week 

The narrative against Welltower is that not only will it face the same challenges as REITs in general as described earlier  i e  rising interest rates will make it more expensive for HCN to grow   but also the company faces unique challenges related to efforts in the US to repeal and replace Obamacare  i e  a lot of the customers of Welltower s tenants rely on government sponsored reimbursement  which could be reduced under changes to the law  
However  despite the challenges  Welltower s price to FFO has dropped to a compelling level  its dividend is very well covered  and the long term demographic trends  i e  a growing population of healthcare needs  are strongly in favor of the company over the long term  in our view 
Plus the big dividend yield and value stock status of Welltower put it right in the sweet spot of a market style shift that we expect to strengthen over time  i e  the markets long term reversion to favor income value stocks over growth stocks  
9  Verizon  NYSE VZ   Yield  5 3 
Verizon is another stock that we expect to benefit from the long term reversion to a market that favors value and income stocks over growth stocks  And given Verizon s recent underperformance  as shown in the following chart  now is an excellent time to consider investing from a contrarian standpoint 

Clearly Verizon has faced challenges in recent years  ranging from the slow death of wirelines  to the slowing growth of wireless  and more recently to the troubled acquisition of Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA   Howerer  the company still generates lots of free cash flow to support the dividend  Plus we believe it has been taking appropriate steps  such as the Yahoo acquisition  to transform itself to be more relevant in a constantly evolving marketplace  We ve written about Verizon several times this year  for example  and    And considering its recent poor performance  combined with market conditions that we believe will favor value and income stocks  i e  the end of easy money by the fed   we believe Verizon is an attractive  Dog of the Dow  that is worth considering 
8  Realty Income  NYSE O   Yield  4 7 
Another high income opportunity that investors may want to consider is Realty Income  Not only has this REIT sold off over the last year as rising interest rates stoked fears of more expensive and challenging growth  but value and income investments in general have been out of favor as growth stocks have been dominating over the last year  as shown in our earlier table  

We believe the market narrative has driven Realty Income s price too low  and it now presents an attractive opportunity for income investors  Specifically  Realty Income is a large steady REIT that invests in commercial and retail properties across the US  And as fears of retail challenges have spooked investors  Realty Income has sold off hard  However  the company has a reasonable level of leverage  and plenty of liquidity to keep supporting its big growing monthly dividend payments which have now been increased for 78 quarters in a row   earlier this year  and we believe it remains a particularly attractive opportunity for income investors now 
7  Teekay Offshore Partners LP B  NYSE TOO pb   Yield  11 3 
Shifting gears from common stocks to preferred stocks  we believe the preferred shares of marine transportation company Teekay Offshore are worth considering  Not only is the dividend big and safe  i e  we believe the company has plenty of financial wherewithal to support the dividend   but we believe market conditions favor this company going forward because it will benefit as the market shifts from growth to value stocks  Further  we believe the maritime shipping industry is showing signs of improvement and continued recovery   over a year ago  and the price is again attractive  in our view  If you re looking for big safe yield that will benefit from current market conditions then Teekay preferred series B is worth considering 
6  New Residential  NYSE NRZ   Yield 13 1 
New Residential is a big dividend REIT that invests in mortgage backed securities  and we believe now is an attractive time to consider investing considering it just raised its dividend but the shares are down over the last two weeks as shown in the following chart 

It may seem counterintuitive to invest in anything  residential mortgage related  right now considering interest rates are expected to continue rising and that will make it more expensive to buy a residence with a mortgage  However  NRZ owns powerful Mortgage Servicing Rights   MSRs   giving it the right to service a pool of mortgage loans in exchange for a fee  and NRZs MSRs have the ability to continue delivering big returns  12 20   despite our current rising interest rate environment

141071,362586,WELL,New Senior Group  This 10 2  Yielder Looks Like A Buyout Target,opinion,"New Senior Investment Group  NYSE SNR  is a small equity REIT  operating in the highly fragmented  but very large and rapidly growing senior housing space  New Senior is struggling with a heavy debt load  they re trying to sell more assets to pay down debt   and they re also struggling with a small handful of troubled operators  It seems if New Senior can get through near term challenges then there are plenty of healthy profits  and dividend payments  ahead  and for this reason we ve ranked it  14 on our list of   Worth Considering  
However  considering New Senior s external management group was recently acquired by Softbank  T 9984   a large  deep pocketed  Japanese firm that is looking to deploy cash  there may be a more direct way for New Senior to get through its near term challenges  In our view  there are clear benefits  the cost of debt could be dramatically lowered  and incentives  there are significant  economies of scale  opportunities in the large and growing senior housing space  for Softbank to acquire New Senior at healthy premium to its current market price 
About New Senior
New Senior Investment Group is a publicly traded real estate investment trust   REIT   with a diversified portfolio of senior housing properties  managed properties and triple net leased  located across the United States 


Very importantly  New Senior relies on private pay sources of revenue which are considering more stable and predictable compared to government reimbursed property types which rely significantly on payments from Medicaid or Medicare  For this reason  New Senior is dramatically less sensitive to healthcare law changes that currently weigh heavily on peers  such as Omega Healthcare  NYSE OHI   for example 

The property mix includes mainly Independent Living and Assisted Living properties 

The company recently released its fourth quarter financials which show strong improvement in net operating income  but the company continues to struggle with debt and negative earnings 

According to the earnings release 

 The year over year decrease in the fourth quarter net loss was primarily driven by a gain on sale of real estate of  13 4 million and a decrease in expenses of  6 8 million  

Specifically  New Senior sold  38 5 million in assets over the last six months and the proceeds were used to pay down debt 

Also  as noted by the company  it is currently considering strategies to deal with five trouble operators 

When asked during the fourth quarter earnings  about the five underperforming assets  New Senior CEO  Susan Givens  explained 

 So of those five  I think  we have a few that we re actually considering selling and a few that we re working with either our existing operators  or in certain cases  considering transitioning to new operators to try to improve performance  

The Dividend
Many investors are attracted to New Senior because of its big dividend yield  currently 10 2    However  the dividend does not have a large margin of safety  For example  New Senior s quarterly dividend payment is 26 cents per share  but its Adjusted Funds From Operations  AFFO  and Funds Available for Distribution  FAD  just barely cover the divided  as shown in the following table 


And worth noting  the tax treatment of the most recent dividend  as shown in the following table  was largely a return of capital  not a qualified dividend  this means you defer the tax payment until you sell the shares  unless your cost basis has been totally returned to you before then  

New Senior s Management
There are a lot of interesting things going on with New Senior s management and leadership team  For starters  New Senior has no employees  The company is externally managed and advised by FIG LLC  NYSE FIG   an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC  which is a leading global investment management firm  Further  affiliates of Fortress manage private equity funds that currently own a majority of New Senior s largest tenant  Holiday  And Blue Harbor  New Senior s second largest tenant  is also an affiliate of Fortress  So there are some significant conflicts of interest here 
Additionally  New Senior s CEO  Susan Givens  is also a Managing Director in Fortress s Private Equity group  Further  the chairman of New Senior s board  Wesley Edens  is a principal and a Co Chairman of the Board of Directors of Fortress Investment Group  Further still  New Senior board member  Michael Malone  is a former Fortress Managing Director 
More interesting still  Fortress recently  it will be acquired by Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group for about  3 3 billion in cash  In our view  it is critically important to consider the intentions of Softbank before investing in New Senior 
The Opportunity
With Sofbank now basically calling the shots at New Senior  because Softbank now essentially owns New Senior s external manager and board of directors via Fortress   it s important to consider New Senior from the perspective of Softbank  From Softbank s perspective  New Senior is very small  New Senior s market cap is less than  1 billion  Softbank s is around  77 billion   but New Senior does fit into a larger growing real estate play by Softbank which includes not only its management interest in New Senior but also its ownership and management of New Senior tenants and Fortress affiliates Holiday and Blue Harbor  And according to the Wall Street Journal  

 SoftBank believes it can double Fortress s assets in the next few years  partly by shopping its funds to  its   network of sovereign funds and global billionaires  according to people familiar with the matter  It plans to sell a slice of Fortress s operating unit  known as the general partner  to some in that network  the people said  

In our view  this suggests a consolidation of real estate interests is on the table considering the large growing industry opportunities  potential economies of scale  and Softbank s desire for growth  For example  if Softbank were to acquire New Senior  it could easily refinance its debt and increase its profitability almost immediately  Also  a deep pocketed Softbank could eliminate the liquidity concerns of many New Senior investors  thereby reducing the perceived risks  and increasing its valuation  Further  the long runway for growth and consolidation in the senior living industry fits Softbank s growth aspirations in terms of the large size of the opportunity 
For perspective  according to New Senior s annual report 
We believe that the rapidly growing senior citizen population in the U S  will result in a substantially increased demand for senior housing properties as the baby boomer generation ages  life expectancies lengthen and more health related services are demanded  The U S  Census Bureau estimates that the total number of Americans aged 65 and older is expected to increase from approximately 47 8 million in 2015 to 79 2 million by 2035  with the number of citizens aged 65 and older expected to grow at four times the rate of the overall population by 2035  Healthcare is the largest private sector industry in the U S   with healthcare expenditures in the U S  accounting for approximately 17  of gross domestic product in December 2013 
And for further prospective  also according to New Senior s annual report 
We believe there are significant investment opportunities in the U S  senior housing market driven by three factors   i  growing demand from significant increases in the senior citizen population   ii  highly fragmented ownership of senior housing properties among many smaller local   mom and pop   and regional owner operators and  iii  operational improvement opportunities to increase property level net operating income leveraging the experience and economies of scale of our Manager  We estimate the size of the senior housing industry in the United States to be approximately  300 billion  and  according to the 2015 American Seniors Housing Association 50 Report  approximately 58  of these senior housing facilities are owned by mom and pop operators with 5 or fewer properties  Given our strong track record of external growth  we believe an opportunity exists to continue to participate in the consolidation of this fragmented industry as many of these smaller owner operators may decide to sell their portfolios  An attractive investment opportunity exists to acquire high quality properties where operational performance can be improved by leveraging the experience of our Manager 
Valuation 
Relative to healthcare REIT peers  New Senior is trading at a very low price  For example  the following chart shows SNR s low price relative to funds from operations  FFO  compared to some of it healthcare REIT peers 

These are all healthcare REITs  so it s NOT an apples to oranges comparison  but it is a Macintosh to Granny Smith comparison  For example  New Senior  SNR  is focused exclusively on senior housing whereas Welltower  NYSE HCN  is diversified across senior housing  post acute communities  and outpatient medical properties  Also  SNR deals with private pay operators  whereas the skilled nursing facilities of Omega Healthcare  NYSE OHI  are very sensitive to healthcare reforms as they pertain to Medicaid  Regardless  New Senior is very cheap relative to peers 
Another valuation consideration is the impact of rising interest rates on the real estate sector  in general  As the following chart shows  publicly traded real estate  as measured by the real estate sector ETF  has significantly underperformed the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   over the last year 

Many investors fear that rising rates will negatively impact the real estate sector which relies on borrowing to fund its operations  Also  many dividend stocks in general have fallen out of favor as the pro growth  Trump Rally  has continued to run  In our view  investor fear is already baked into prices  and REITs currently provide an attractive contrarian opportunity  especially for income focused investors 
The Risks
In our view  New Senior is ripe to be acquired  but obviously there is no assurance that this will happen  And if New Senior isn t acquired by someone with deep pockets  then it will be challenging for the company to pull itself up by its own bootstraps to get its debt under control and maintain its dividend 
As we mentioned earlier  there is very little margin of safety with New Senior s dividend payments considering they consume essentially all of the company s AFFO and FAD  And if New Senior cannot get its debt under control  by selling more asset  and by dealing with its troubled operators  then the company runs the risk of being forced to cut its dividend  a very bad thing from the vantage point of many income focused investors  
Another risk is that its business is highly concentrated among two large tenants  Holiday and Blue Harbor   If something goes wrong with one of these tenants then New Senior could face dire challenges 
Further  New Senior s business is not diversified as they focus very specifically on senior housing  If this industry suffers a significant downturn  or less growth than New Senior investors are anticipating  then the company could suffer significant losses 
Conclusion 
Without question  New Senior faces uncertainties  This is a huge dividend REIT that may experience significant price appreciation if it can get its debts and troubled operators under control  It can also experience significant price appreciation if it is acquired at a premium to its current market price  as we believe it is ripe for such an acquisition  However  if none of these positives occur then the company could face a dividend cut or further price declines 
The good news is that New Senior s stock price is already extremely cheap considering the high risks have already been priced in  in our view  If you are looking for a big dividend healthcare REIT that is less correlated to the risks of healthcare reform  is trading at a very low price  and has significant near term and long term price appreciation potential  we believe New Senior is worth considering for an allocation within your diversified  long term  income focused investment portfolio ",2017-04-12,Blue Harbinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/new-senior:-this-10.2-yield-looks-like-a-buyout-target-200182365,200182365
141091,362606,WELL,Retirement REITs Poised To Profit From The Graying Of America,opinion,"The Baby Boomers are going to need a new place to crash 
The largest generation in U S  history is entering retirement en masse  and as things stand now America lacks the senior housing inventory to accommodate them   10 000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day  and over the next 15 years  the number of Americans over the age of 50 will    This means unprecedented demand for everything from active retirement communities with golf and tennis lessons to assisted living with full time nurses 
This is fantastic news if you happen to be a senior housing landlord and with the plethora of publically traded senior themed REITs  you can  indeed  be a landlord   Today  we re going to look at the senior housing REITs best positioned to profit from the graying of America 
I should be clear on one point  Investing based on demographic trends is a long term strategy   But your patience is likely to be rewarded   In their  on demographics and industry returns  professors Stefano DellaVigna and Joshua Pollet found that  over time horizons of five to ten years  each additional point of annual demand growth due to demographic factors led to a 5  10  jump in annual abnormal industry stock returns   But over periods of five years or less  demographics had little impact on stock returns   With demographic trends  patience is key 
With that said  let s jump into some of the best potential long term senior REIT buys 
LTC Properties
LTC Properties  Inc   NYSE LTC  is a real estate investment trust that invests primarily in the long term care sector of the health care industry  including long term care provider properties  skilled nursing properties  assisted living properties  independent living properties and memory care properties   LTC also invests in first lien mortgages secured by long term care properties 
A little over 80  of LTC s portfolio is invested in properties with the remainder in mortgages   And among properties  skilled nursing is the biggest single segment  at 55    Assisted living comes in second at 37  
With any health related stock  you have to address the issue of Medicare   It s no secret that the U S  government is short of funds these days  and Medicare cutbacks have been an unfortunate outcome  But that is what makes LTC such an attractive way to play the trend of Boomer aging   LTC is a landlord  not a care provider  so Medicare cutbacks will have little impact on revenues   And even better  most of LTC s properties are leased under triple net leases  meaning the tenant covers taxes  insurance and maintenance 
LTC s monthly dividend works out to a current yield of 5 3   making it competitive with other medical REITs   LTC is also a relatively small REIT with a market cap of just  1 34 billion   I like that  as smaller REITs can generally grow their portfolios and their dividends at a faster rate than their lumbering large cap cohorts   And with a debt to equity ratio of only 46   which is half the level of many of its peers  LTC has a lot of room to borrow  This too gives it flexibility to grow that its competitors do not have 
Health Care REIT
A larger  more liquid option would be Health Care REIT  Health Care REIT Inc  NYSE HCN    From its name  you might assume that HCN was primarily a play on hospitals and doctor s offices  but it s not   Only about  is invested in health related properties 
About 64  of the portfolio is in senior housing  split between properties that HCN operates  38   and those that are leased on a triple net basis  26    In a triple net lease  the tenant is responsible for all taxes  insurance and maintenance  the landlord s only responsibility is to collect the rent check  Looking at the health related properties  medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities make up another 16  and 14  of the portfolio  respectively  and the rest is split between hospitals and research facilities 
Impressively  apart from the skilled nursing facilities and hospitals  which depend heavily on Medicare and Medicaid  HCN s tenants have very little dependence on the government  Across its portfolio   are from private pay clients  That s a major positive in an era of slashed reimbursements and Obamacare restrictions 
HCN sports a dividend yield of 5 0  and has steadily raised its dividend over the past decade 
Senior Housing Trust
Next on the list  Senior Housing Properties Trust  NYSE SNH   one of the biggest players in the senior housing segment with 372 properties spread across 38 states and Washington DC 
Despite its name  Senior Housing is not a pure play on the senior housing market   About  is invested in medical office buildings   That is not necessarily a bad thing  mind you   In fact  I like medical office buildings as a low risk way to invest in the rising healthcare needs of an aging America without complicated aspects of Medicare reimbursements or ObamaCare mandates   But it s something to consider if you are specifically looking for investments in senior housing 
29  of SNH s portfolio is invested in independent living facilities with another 21  in assisted living   Nursing homes and wellness centers make up about 3  of the portfolio each  And importantly  97  of Senior Housing s net operating income comes from private pay properties  exposure to Medicare is minimal 
Dividend growth has been fairly modest over the REIT s history  though it currently pays a very attractive 7 2

141094,362609,WELL,Look To Healthcare REITs For Income,opinion,"With Baby Boomers entering old age  U S  demographics favor one particular sector  healthcare  And within that sector  investors seeking sizable yet stable dividend returns may want to look at healthcare and senior housing real estate investment trusts  REITs  
Generally speaking  real estate is an attractive source of reliable dividends because rental yields provide steady income  with few expenses required to maintain them  In addition  rentals tend to rise with inflation  which should ensure future dividend increases 
Senior care and medical real estate offer the additional benefit of demographics  and demand for such facilities should remain robust in the years to come  These properties are also somewhat less prone to leveraged speculation than other forms of real estate   and since many medical costs are paid by the government  they re less likely to lose rental income in a downturn 
However  caution is needed  Too many healthcare REITs are paying dividends far in excess of their earnings  making their income streams unreliable in the long run 
Indeed  with interest rates so low and monetary conditions so easy  companies can borrow money to pay dividends   and for REITs whose share prices are sustained by dividend yield  there s a strong temptation to do so 
In addition  depreciation allowances on real estate provide cash flow from which dividends can be paid  while capital investments can be financed with new share issues from a buoyant stock market  This tempts real estate companies to pay dividends greater than earnings   which  in moderation  may not be a problem  However  in the longer term  companies that increase leverage or allow their real estate to age without being replaced will be unable to maintain earnings as available rents decline  In such cases  the dividend cannot be relied upon for long term income 
I kicked the tires on five healthcare and senior housing REITs to see which ones offer the best investment at this point in time 
Breaking Down the Opportunities
Physicians Realty Trust  NYSE DOC   a self managed company that leases medical properties to doctors and hospitals  offers a 5 7  yield with an annual dividend of  0 90 per share  However  it consistently makes modest losses  making the dividend unlikely to be sustained in the long run 
HCP Inc  NYSE HCP   which invests in both healthcare buildings and mezzanine loans  earned just  0 92 per share in the last four quarters compared to its dividend of  2 26  Even though this company is a Dividend Aristocrat  having increased its dividend annually for more than 25 years  I think its fine track record looks certain to be broken in the next downturn 
A better investment is Omega Healthcare Investors Inc   NYSE OHI   which invests primarily in long term healthcare facilities  OHI has a long track record of increasing dividends  and its latest quarterly dividend of  0 55 is more than double the  0 22 it paid in the equivalent quarter of 2005  Its current trailing four quarter yield is a healthy 6 1   While its earnings per share in the past four quarters were just  1 61  compared to dividends of  2 16  its operating cash flow of  337 million was enough to support dividends of  258 million  New investments  meanwhile  were financed with low cost borrowings  I wouldn t regard OHI s 6 1  dividend yield as risk free  but the chance of increases is also substantial  so the risk reward tradeoff looks worthwhile 
Another healthcare REIT that appears to be providing solid dividends is Sabra Health Care REIT  NASDAQ SBRA   which invests mostly in skilled nursing facilities  SBRA pays quarterly dividends of  0 39  to give it a yield of 5 8   In the last four quarters  Sabra only earned  1 21  less than its  1 56 dividends  but its cash flow was again ample to cover dividend payments  Plus  its dividends have increased 22  since its founding in 2011 
An alternative approach to healthcare REIT investing is to buy preferred stock  where the dividends don t increase year over year but are better protected against downturns  When the stock market is high  as at present  I prefer this approach to income seeking  because it involves somewhat less capital risk  as well 
For example  Health Care REIT  Inc   NYSE HCN   which invests in a broad spectrum of healthcare and senior living properties  has  1 billion of preferred stock capital in addition to its ordinary shares and has issued two series of preferred stock  I and J  Its ordinary shares yield 4 8   but the dividends are currently about twice earnings  On the other hand  its series J preferred shares currently yield 6 3  and have the additional advantage of being senior to the dividends on common stock

141098,362613,WELL,REIT Q1 Earnings To Watch On May 3  HCN  MAC,opinion,"After the first wave of real estate investment trust   REIT   earnings last week  the sector is geared up for another busy week of releases  Notable among these will be the first quarter earnings reports of The Macerich Company   NYSE MAC   and Welltower Inc    NYSE HCN   slated on May 3 
Last week  companies like Essex Property Trust Inc    NYSE ESS   and Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc    NYSE HST   have come up with positive surprises But what has emerged from the reporting season so far is that the overall growth pace has not picked up and is  in fact  trending below the recent past periods  But actual results managed to pull off surprises after estimates were considerably revised down over the last three months Of course  the latest Fed announcement of keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 25 0 50  has essentially provided the rate sensitive REIT industry some more time to enjoy the low interest rate period Then again  a slowdown in economic activity with moderation in household spending in recent months raises concerns over the health of the overall economy  This can also cast a pall on REIT performance as the pace of economic activity plays a major part in determining the demand supply factors in the real estate business 
So it becomes important to peek into the fundamentals of the REIT to gauge what s in store for them this earnings season  Here  we focus on the two S P 500 constituents named above Welltower is slated to report first quarter 2016 results before the market opens on Tuesday  May 3  This healthcare REIT has an  of  0 89  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Welltower s diversified portfolio  business relationship with experienced healthcare management companies   operators and strategic investments are expected to serve as growth drivers  National healthcare expenditure is rising  with senior citizens incurring higher medical expenses than the average population  offering the company ample scope to capitalize on However  intense competition remains a concern while earnings dilution from substantial dispositions might have restricted any robust growth of the company in the to be reported quarter    Read more   
Retail REIT Macerich is also expected to report first quarter results on May 3  2016  after the market closes  The company has an Earnings ESP of  1 16  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Though our model had predicted an earnings beat earlier  current data reduces the predictive power of ESP Macerich s portfolio of premium malls in the dynamic U S  markets and presence of well capitalized retailers have enabled it to maintain a stable source of rent over the past quarters  Also  the absence of ample supply is expected to help the retail real estate market in the to be reported quarter However  lackluster retails sales in the first quarter raise our concern  Moreover  increasing consumer spending on online platforms has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs  as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space  The company also faces competition from its peers  While it strives to counter such pressure through various initiatives  we believe that the implementation of such measures require considerable upfront expenditure  which might limit near term growth in profit margins   Read more

141128,362643,WELL,Low Cost Funds Dupe Investors  3Q12,opinion,Fund holdings affect fund performance more than fees or past performance  A cheap fund is not necessarily a good fund  A fund that has done well in the past is not likely to do well in the future  e g  5 star kiss of death and active management has long history of underperformance   Yet  traditional fund research focuses only on low fees and past performance   Our research on holdings enables investors to find funds with high quality holdings   AND   low fees   Investors are good at picking cheap funds  We want them to be better at picking funds with good stocks  Both are required to maximize success   Figure 1 shows that 55  of fund assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with low costs but only 6  of assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with Attractive holdings  This discrepancy is astounding   Figure 1  Allocation of Fund Assets By Holdings Quality and By Costs Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Two key shortcomings in the ETF and mutual fund industry cause this large discrepancy A lack of research into the quality of holdings Not enough research focuses on the quality of Portfolio Management of fundsA lack of high quality holdings or good stocks With about twice as many funds as stocks in the market  there simply are not enough good stocks to fill all the funds These issues are related  in my opinion  If investors had more insight into the quality of funds  holdings  I think they would allocate a lot less money to funds with poor quality holdings  Investors deserve research on the quality of stocks held by ETFs and mutual funds  Quality of holdings is the single most important factor in determining an ETF or mutual fund s future performance  No matter how low the costs  if the ETF or mutual fund holds bad stocks  performance will be poor  Costs are easy to find but research on the quality of holdings is almost non existent  Figure 2 shows investors are not putting enough money into ETFs and mutual funds with high quality holdings  Only 590 of 7278  6  of assets  of ETFs and mutual funds allocate a significant amount of value to quality holdings  94  of assets are in funds that do not justify their costs and over charge investors for poor portfolio management  Figure 2  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Portfolio Management Rating  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Figure 3 shows that Investors successfully find low cost funds  55  of assets are held in ETFs and mutual funds that have Attractive or better rated Total Annual Costs  my apples to apples measure of the all in cost of investing in any given fund   Out of the 7 278 ETFs and mutual funds I cover  1 197  55  of all assets  earn an Attractive or better Total Annual Costs rating   Clearly  ETF and mutual funds investors are smart shoppers when it comes to finding cheap investments  But cheap is not necessarily good   Fidelity Salem Street Trust  Spartan Real Estate Index Fund  FSRNX  is one of many funds with low costs but a Very Dangerous Portfolio Management rating  It gets an overall predictive rating of Very Dangerous because no matter how low its fees  I expect it to underperform because it holds too many Dangerous or worse rated stocks  Low fees cannot boost fund performance  Only good stocks can boost performance   One of the Dangerous or worse rated stocks held by FSRNX is Health Care REIT  Inc   HCN   to which it allocates over 3  of its value  The company has misleading earnings  dismal returns on invested capital  ROIC   negative cash flow  and an expensive valuation  To justify its current valuation    60 75   HCN must grow after tax profits  NOPAT  at 13  compounded annually for 36 years  HCN s poor past performance and high expectations offers investors a poor risk reward trade off   Out of the 79 stocks held by FSRNX  none earn my Attractive rating  One has to wonder how the manager failed to pick at least one good stock   Figure 3  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Total Annual Costs Ratings  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  Investors should allocate their capital to funds with both high quality holdings and low costs because those are the funds that offer investors the best performance potential   But they do not  Not even close   Figure 4 shows that 5  of ETF and mutual fund assets are allocated to funds with low costs and high quality holdings according to my Predictive Fund Ratings  which are based on the quality of holdings and the all in costs to investors   Note the fund industry offers 2 882 Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds compared to just 245 Attractive or better ETFs and mutual funds  nearly 12 times more bad funds than good funds  That means a lot of fees are being paid to managers that do not deserve them   Figure 4  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Predictive Ratings  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Investors deserve forward looking ETF and mutual fund research that assesses both costs and quality of holdings  For example  Manning   Napier Fund  Inc    Dividend Focus Series  MDFSX  is a fund with both low costs and an Attractive Portfolio Management rating  Two of the good stocks held by MDFSX are Exxon Mobil Corp  XOM  and Bristol Myers Squibb Company  BMY   Both stocks earn my Very Attractive rating  They have positive or rising economic earnings  high ROICs and cheap valuations  XOM s current stock price    82 share  implies profits will permanently decline by 37  when our model shows rising economic earnings in 2011  BMY s current stock price    36 share  implies the company s NOPAT will permanently decline by 40   Both of these stocks offer Attractive risk reward because the expectations in their valuations are low and their economic earnings are strong Why is the most popular fund rating system based on backward looking past performance I do not know  but I do know that the lack of transparency into the quality of portfolio management provides cover for the ETF and mutual fund industry to continue to over charge investors for poor portfolio management  How else could they get away with selling nearly 12 times more Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds than Attractive or better John Bogle is correct   investors should not pay high fees for active portfolio management  His index funds have provided investors with many low cost alternatives to actively managed funds However  by focusing entirely on costs  he overlooks the primary driver of fund performance  the stocks held by funds Research on the quality of portfolio management of funds empower empowers investors to make better investment decisions  Investors should no longer pay for poor portfolio management Disclosure  I own XOM  I receive no compensation to write about any specific stock  sector or theme ,2012-07-22,David

141130,362645,WELL,High Yield Buys  There Is A Lot Of Value In This Market  Part 3 ,opinion,This article is Part 3 of a series of articles focusing on finding value in the S P 500 today  In Part 1  we laid out several classifications of equities that comprise the S P 500  In our follow ups we are focusing on each of these classifications one at a time  in order to focus on finding fair valuation within each category  There s a lot of discussion  much of it suggesting that stocks are overvalued today  We disagree  because we conducted a thorough examination of each of the S P 500 constituents  we did indeed find a lot of value in this market  Here is a where we laid out our thesis of a market of stocks rather than the stock market  and identified the categories that we are writing about in these subsequent articles  In  exclusively on high growth stocks that are constituents of the S P 500 and we believed were fairly valued today  In this part 3  we turn our attention to the highest yielding stocks that are constituents on the S P 500  However  we submit that there are essentially two primary reasons that explain why these stocks offer such high yields  The most prominent is that these are low growth entities that need to offer high dividend yields in order to attract investors  The next most prominent reason is that some of these entities have seen their stock prices collapse because of fundamental issues and challenges within their respective business models  Consequently  their high yields could be either a temporary illusion that will soon change  or perhaps indicative of high risk  Therefore  we submit that the moral of this story is that everything is not all that it often appears to be  High yield is nice  but if it also implies high risk  the investor has to be prepared to factor that into their decision making process  In other words  the prospective investor has to decide whether or not the reward is worth the risk taken to achieve it  We have identified 17 companies in the S P 500 that offer a yield of 5  or greater  We then broke this down into two sets  one that we felt had higher risk  and one that we felt represents good opportunities for the investor either seeking high yield  or high yield plus growth  It is very important to state that this is a prescreened list based solely on organizing the S P 500 by order of highest dividend yield to the lowest utilizing the  fundamental analyzer software tool  Then we ran individual earnings and price correlated graphs on each of our 17 selections in order to sort them by risk  More importantly  the reader should understand that we are not recommending any of these selections  Nor are we suggesting that any of these selections should be avoided  Instead  we are offering both lists for the sole purpose of providing the reader with a selection of S P 500 high yielding constituents that may be worthy of further due diligence and research  On the other hand  we hope that the reader finds it useful to have both lists sorted by apparent risk  based on fundamentals  High Risk High Yield S P 500 Constituents We do not believe it is a coincidence that our high risk list contains most of the highest yielding S P 500 constituents  In today s interest rate environment  the prudent investor needs to proceed with caution when they see yields that are significantly higher than the current environment generally is offering  On the other hand  given that the market can often improperly appraise the price of a stock  an aberrantly high yielding security should not be immediately rejected either  There is always the possibility that a more comprehensive research effort may uncover a great long term opportunity  The following table lists nine high yielding S P 500 constituents that we believe should be carefully evaluated and scrutinized  With many of the selections  further examination will show that there are current issues with the companies  profitability  In other words  some of the selections are experiencing deteriorating earnings for one various reason or another  Consequently  dividend cuts or even price erosion should be considered as real possibilities  In other cases  there are valuation issues  or more precisely  overvaluation issues that need to be evaluated  Later we will provide a more detailed example of both for illustration purposes Windstream Corp   WIN Our first example reveals a telecommunications company that has experienced a lot of earnings pressure Windstream Corp  provides high speed broadband Internet  phone service and Digital TV packages to residential customers as well as products and services for small  medium and large businesses  and government agencies  Windstream Corp  was formed from the spinoff of Alltel Corporation s landline business and merger with VALOR Communications Group  Inc As can be clearly seen from the following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs   due to the challenges of its legacy wire line business  Windstream Corp  has experienced a steady erosion of its earnings  Consequently  we believe that the risk of a dividend cut is high  and therefore  investors should be cautioned not to be too enamored with its high yield As you review the performance of Windstream  there are two important concerns that need to be considered  First  note that as earnings have eroded  so has the principal value  Second  the current high payout ratio should serve as a red flag warning about the viability of its dividend long term Health Care REIT Inc   HCN Health Care REIT  Inc  is a real estate investment trust that has been at the forefront of senior living and health care real estate since the company was founded in 1970  Since REITs are primarily based on their ability to generate dividends  the reader should note that the following F A S T  Graphs  represents a Funds From Operations  FFO  and price correlated graph instead of earnings and price Consequently  what we see here is a very stable REIT  however  history also shows that there hasn t been a lot of growth  But most importantly  the reader should notice that the company is currently trading at the highest valuation relative to Funds From Operations  FFO   its normal price to FFO  and its cash flow capability  the light purple line   There is another good way to assess the current valuation of a REIT by evaluating its current dividend yield relative to historical norms  In other words  if Health Care REIT Inc  was trading at a more historically normal valuation  its current yield would be higher than the 5  it currently offers  All this suggests is that today s moderate overvaluation may limit both the total income and capital appreciation potential that the risk of owning this REIT would justify Moderate to Low Risk High Yield S P 500 ConstituentsOur second list of high yield S P 500 constituents appear to offer their yields at lower levels of risk than our first list  However  the reader should be cautioned that it is only based on a prescreened review of the earnings and price correlation  Therefore  it is also possible that some of the companies on this list may also be of higher risk than many investors may be willing to accept  As always  a more comprehensive due diligence effort is suggested before any buy or sell decisions are made Lorillard Inc   LO Lorillard is the third largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States  And from the earnings and price correlated graphic below we discover that  like it or not  tobacco is a growth business  Consequently  it appears that Lorillard offers the conservative dividend growth investor the best of all possible worlds  Historically this company has generated above average growth  an above average yield and can be purchased at a sound valuation TECO Energy  Inc   TE TECO Energy is a Tampa  Florida based utility with a reasonably stable record of producing above average yields and moderate growth for shareholders  Currently  the company appears to be trading at historically sound valuation relative to its earnings power  However  the primary allure here is the above average dividend yield Summary and ConclusionsAlthough the primary focus of this article was to review the highest yielding opportunities in the S P 500  it provides a secondary illustration that it is a market of stocks and not a stock market  From the examples we reviewed  it should be clear that there are significant differences between the actual individual constituents of the S P 500  Even though they all share membership in the same fraternity  each company is an individual in its own right  Moreover  even when they share similar attributes such as yields  etc   there can be great differences in the reliability and safety that these similar numbers represent The moral of the story  and the moral of this series  is simply to remind investors that it is more important to make the decisions based on the actual merits of the individual companies they own than it is on generalities  Not all common stocks are the same  and most importantly  not all stocks will generate the same returns  nor will their returns mirror the general stock market  We believe this builds a strong case against worrying about what the markets are going to do  Furthermore  predicting markets is difficult to

141160,362675,WELL,3 High Yield Stocks For The Coming Wave Of Retirees,opinion,The greatest demographic trend affecting the United States today is the aging of the baby boomer generation  Many of the baby boomers  those born between 1946 and 1964  are beginning to retire  In fact  starting this year it is estimated that 10 000 baby boomers will retire every day  This means there will be more than 3 6 million potential retirees every year for the next 17 years    Given the magnitude of this trend  every investor should own a stock or two that will benefit  One of the best ways to invest for this demographic is to own health care REITs  Real estate investment trusts   These REITs usually own assets such as hospitals  rehab facilities  nursing homes and medical office buildings  Most pay very healthy dividends and all should experience steady growth as aging baby boomers demand more of their services    To identify the best health care REITs  I ran a screen for companies with positive five year earnings and dividend growth  less debt than equity and a current dividend yield higher than 5   These metrics establish some level of safety and a good starting point for narrowing down the

care REIT on the stock market  The company owns 378 properties spread across 39 states and has an investment portfolio valued at more than  5 billion  Compared to other health care REITs  Senior Housing has a more secure income stream because 90  of the company s income comes from private pay properties and not from facilities that rely on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement    Senior Housing made more than  1 billion of acquisitions last year  As a result  the REIT metric for cash flow  funds from operations  FFO   rose 18  to  258 million in 2011 from  219 million a year earlier  FFO provided 140  coverage of the dividend    Analysts target 8  income growth for the REIT this year  Senior Housing has a solid balance sheet with debt at 74  of equity and an investment grade rating from Moody s and Standard   Poor s  Senior Housing has increased its dividend in each of the past 10 years and grown the dividend roughly 3  a year in the past five years  The last increase was a 2 7  hike in October to a  1 52 annualized rate  These shares currently yield about 7 2   2  National Health Investors  NYSE    Yield  5 National Health Investors finances health care properties through purchase and leaseback transactions and mortgage loans  It primarily invests in nursing homes and assisted living facilities  as well as medical office buildings and hospitals  National Health has investments in 122 properties across 24 states and a portfolio valued at  473 million  About 45  of its leases are with one large tenant  National Healthcare Corp   AMEX     which has leases running through year end 2021    National Health funded  100 4 million of health care real estate investments last year  which resulted in 5  growth in FFO to  80 2 million in 2011  from  76 5 million in 2010  This REIT beats its peers handily on key ratios of financial strength and profitability  National Health has the least financial leverage of any health care REIT  with debt at only 22  of equity  as well as the best operating margin    75  compared with operating margins averaging 57  for industry peers     National Health has posted 10 years in a row of dividend growth and has a 5 4  yield  The company raised its dividend by 5 7  in December to a  2 60 annualized rate and also paid a special one time dividend of  0 22  The payout is a bit high at 90  of FFO  but analysts say this REIT will deliver at least 7  income growth this year  3  LTC Properties  NYSE   Yield  6  This REIT invests mainly in senior housing and long term care facilities through facility lease transactions  mortgage loans and other investments  LTC s portfolio consists of 208 properties in 30 states and is valued at  798 million  More than 60  of LTC s income is from private payers  which lowers risk from Medicare cuts    In the past 15 months  LTC has acquired 11 new facilities  mainly in the Southwestern United States  These acquisitions were the main driver of 31  growth in FFO last year to  59 5 million  from  45 4 million in the prior year  Even with recent purchases  LTC has maintained a high quality balance sheet  showing total debt at  159 million compared to more than  976 million of equity    LTC stands out from the health care REIT pack for the safety and strong growth of its dividend  Since 2003  LTC has grown the dividend by an average of 12 6  a year  Payout is very manageable at 84  of earnings  The last increase was 3 6  in January to a  1 74 annualized rate  Also  unlike most of its peers  LTC pays dividends monthly  Shares yield about 5 6     Risks to consider  Health care REITs could be hurt if Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates decline  since this would affect tenant revenue and their ability to pay rents  Because REIT dividends are taxed as ordinary income rather than at the 15  dividend rate  these investments are best held in a tax sheltered account  Action to take    My top pick overall is Senior Housing because of its generous dividend and comparatively low exposure to Medicare Medicaid cuts  but both National Health and LTC also offer exceptional dividend safety and good growth  by Lisa

141162,362677,WELL,Top 10 Total Bond ETFs,opinion,For some investors a  one size fits all  approach can be more compelling  After all  it s easier to deal with just one ETF in a sector than trying to deal with many different subsectors  Lastly  some investors feel they just don t have the resources to chop their allocation into many different ETFs devoted to bonds     Therefore we examine a comprehensive list of aggregate bond ETFs to satisfy these investors  This seems more manageable for most investors  Let s remember  in the fixed income sector there are many choices but with many being repetitive it s not necessary to cover them all  In fact most of the choices we list in this review are repetitive although most sponsors would no doubt disagree    Our goal is to cover the most important ETFs within this category using high assets under management  liquidity and   or strategies that make a difference  Newer issues tied to new indices with long  over 5 years  of historical data may be worth investigating  featuring and using if warranted after they become more seasoned  Total Bond ETFs have the characteristic of incorporating many different maturities and issues into one all inclusive issue     From a total return view  2011 was a great year for bond investments generally  2012 is shaping up as a more challenging environment as further appreciation beyond low yields seems less likely  In 2011  investors fled stock markets and central bankers around the globe were lowering interest rates on fear of stagnant economic growth  Investors sought refuge in bonds and under the mattress    Ultimately accommodative central bank policies  if continued too long  historically will lead to inflation  Central planners can t have it both ways fighting deflation and preventing inflation   The U S  Fed as of this publication is now 40 months into near zero interest rate policies   This is why many bond investors have matched their fixed income holdings with gold  Finally we all know the reality the previous year s winners often become the next year s losers  With yields this low on many bond ETFs they re hard to justify given both the twin risks of low to negative yields and longer duration    We feature a technical view of conditions from monthly chart views  Simplistically  we recommend longer term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month simple moving average  When prices are above the moving average  stay long  and when below remain in cash or short  Some more interested in a fundamental approach may not care so much about technical issues preferring instead to buy when prices are perceived as low and sell for other reasons when high  but  this is not our approach    Members to the ETF Digest receive added signals when markets become extended such as DeMark triggers to exit overbought   oversold conditions     For traders and investors wishing to hedge  leveraged and inverse issues are available to utilize from ProShares
