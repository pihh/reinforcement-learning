147044,368560,CI,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday  6th February,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    China said it will cut tariffs on some U S  imports  sparking further gains in global stocks  The spread of the coronavirus appears to be slowing  according to the latest data on deaths and new infections  Oil markets reacted cautiously to reports that OPEC and its allies may cut another 600 000 barrels a day to bring the world oil market back into balance  Christine Lagarde warned the European parliament that the ECB is running out of road for further policy stimulus  And of course there s a whole load more corporate earnings coming down the track later  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  6th February 
1  China cuts tariffs on U S  imports
China said it will cut tariffs on an annual  75 billion worth of U S  imports from Friday  reciprocating the partial roll back in U S  tariffs on Chinese goods that the two sides agreed last month 
Although the step was as expected and hardly moved the price of commodities that were affected such as soybeans and oil  it cements the recent truce between the two and supports hopes that the biggest drag on the global economy will fade this year 
The news overshadowed hints elsewhere from the Chinese press that the government may seek to use the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse not to buy the full volume of U S  goods it agreed to in January 
Elsewhere  China s biggest buyer of gas CNOOC reportedly declared force majeure on contracts to import liquefied natural gas  a reflection of the collapse in industrial demand following the extended shutdown of Chinese factories due to the outbreak 
2  Global markets extend risk rally  mostly
The headlines on the tariff cuts were still all that was needed to justify another move up in global stock markets overnight  Major Chinese stock indices rose by between 1 4  and 2 8   while the Euro Stoxx 600 hit a new all time high before retracing its gains 
However  commodities and emerging market currencies were less impressed   Crude futures gave up early gains after reports that China is also looking to cut purchases of Saudi Arabian oil due to the coronavirus impact on local demand  amidst reports that refineries have slashed throughput 
Copper futures also could only drift sideways  while there were better bids for haven metals Gold and Silver than for industrial ones such as Aluminum and Nickel 
The virus itself continues to spread  although both the incidence of new cases and the death toll are rising more slowly than at any time so far during the outbreak   The trend rate of increase is slowing   said Ian Shepherdson  chief economist at Pantheon Economics in London 
3  OPEC  officials reportedly recommend further oil output cuts
The world s biggest oil exporters look set to cut their production even more deeply in order to restore balance to an oversupplied global market suffering from the impact of the coronavirus 
Newswire reports suggested that the technical experts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia would recommend additional supply cuts of 600 000 barrels a day  That compares with an estimate from   BP    LON BP  earlier this week that the virus could hit destroy an average of 400 000 b d over the whole year 
However  it wasn t clear whether Russia s government would support the action  Russia has argued that U S  shale producers should take more of the strain in balancing the market  having ramped up their output considerably at the cartel s expense last year  
Crude markets reacted cautiously  U S  crude futures were up 0 9  at  51 88 a barrel  while Brent was up 0 2  at  55 38  but both blends were off intra day highs posted earlier 
4  Stocks set to open higher  Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  disappoints  Philip Morris  NYSE PM   Uber  NYSE UBER  earnings due
U S  stock markets are set to open modestly higher after another big jump on Wednesday  helped by the continuation of the rally in overseas markets 
By 6 30 AM ET  1130 GMT   Dow 30 futures were up 112 points  or 0 4   with the Nasdaq 100 futures contract rising in parallel and the S P 500 contract lagging only slightly  up 0 3 
After the bell on Wednesday  chipmaker Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  had lowered its guidance range the year through September  citing the potential impact of the coronavirus  Yum China Holdings  NYSE YUMC  had also said it had temporarily closed over 30  of its 9 000 outlets due to the outbreak

5  Lagarde warns on further easing scope  German orders fall
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told the EU parliament that the current environment of low interest rates has left the bank with  reduced scope  to provide further support to the economy with monetary policy 
Her words mark a change in emphasis from predecessor Mario Draghi  who never failed to talk up the possibility of further easing  even as outside analysts cast doubt on the diminishing returns of its extraordinary stimulus measures 
Lagarde s comments came after a surprising 2 1  drop in German factory orders in December  leaving them down over 8  on the year and suggesting that the manufacturing slump in the euro zone s largest economy still hasn t run its course  The euro stayed stuck at  1 1000 ",2020-02-06,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-6th-february-2077730,2077730

147049,368565,CI,Cigna s Express Scripts Acquisition Continues to Pay Off With Its Q4 Earnings Beat,news,"Cigna Corporation  NYSE CI  took investors on a wild ride in 2019  The stock plunged more than 20   only to make a big comeback toward the end of the year  Cigna ultimately delivered a gain of nearly 8  and entered 2020 with strong momentum 
That momentum was put to the test when the global health service company announced its 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before the market opened on Thursday  But it looks as if Cigna passed that test  Here are the highlights from the company s Q4 update 

By the numbers
Cigna announced Q4 revenue of  38 2 billion  a huge 167  increase from the  14 3 billion reported in the same quarter of the previous year  This result easily beat the average analysts  revenue estimate of  35 1 billion 
The company reported net income in the fourth quarter of  977 million  or  2 60 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   This reflected significant improvement from Cigna s net income of  144 million  or  0 55 per share  generated in the prior year period 
Cigna s adjusted non GAAP bottom line also looked good in the fourth quarter  The company announced Q4 adjusted earnings per share of  4 31  up 75  year over year  The consensus Wall Street estimate was for Cigna to post adjusted EPS of  4 20 
Behind the numbers
There was a simple explanation behind Cigna s tremendous year over year growth  The company acquired pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts on Dec  20  2018  
Express Scripts is now part of Cigna s health services segment  This segment generated adjusted revenue of  25 6 billion in Q4  Health services made  3 3 billion in revenue in the prior year period 
Cigna s integrated medical segment includes the company s U S  commercial and government insurance products  The integrated medical segment delivered adjusted revenue of  9 2 billion in the fourth quarter  up 11  year over year  This growth stemmed primarily from adding new commercial customers and premium increases 
The company s international markets segment sells supplemental health  life  and accident insurance in countries outside the U S  and provides healthcare benefits for employees of multinational organizations and individuals who travel extensively to other countries  Cigna reported that the international markets segment had adjusted revenue of  1 43 billion in Q4  an increase of 5 5  year over year 
Cigna also sells group long term and short term disability products along with group life  accident  voluntary  and specialty insurance products in its group disability and other operations segment  Adjusted revenue for this segment in the fourth quarter rose nearly 4  year over year to  1 29 billion 
Looking ahead
The company projects adjusted revenues of between  154 billion and  156 billion for full year 2020  Cigna expects that adjusted income from operations for 2020 will be between  6 8 billion and  7 billion  On a per share basis  adjusted earnings for full year 2020 are expected to be between  18 00 and  18 60  
Cigna CEO David Cordani said   Our strong momentum going into 2020 positions us for continued growth  and to deliver sustained value for our customers and clients  as we create greater affordability  predictability and simplicity for their benefit   
There are some factors that could slow Cigna s momentum down this year  The U S  presidential campaign negatively affected some healthcare stocks in 2016 and could do so again in 2020  A nasty flu season and the potential for a wider outbreak of the coronavirus could also drive medical costs higher  eating into Cigna s profits ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps3i4,2078338

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning  Ladies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by for Cigna s Fourth Quarter 2019 Results Review   Operator Instructions  We ll begin by turning the conference over to Mr  Will McDowell  Please go ahead  Mr  McDowell William McDowell    Vice President of Investor RelationsGood morning  everyone  and thank you for joining today s call  I am will McDowell  Vice President of Investor Relations  With me this morning are David Cordani  our President and Chief Executive Officer  and Eric Palmer  Cigna s Chief Financial Officer  In our remarks today  David and Eric will cover a number of topics  including Cigna s full year 2019 interim results as well as our financial outlook for 2020  As noted in the earnings release  when describing our financial results  Cigna uses certain financial measures  adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues  which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  otherwise known as GAAP A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures  shareholders net income and total revenues  respectively  is contained in today s earnings release  which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna com  We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance  And our remarks today  we will be making some forward looking statements  including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation  A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today s earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC Before turning the call over to David  I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures  Regarding our results  in the fourth quarter  we recorded an after tax special item charge of  116 million or  0 31 per share for integration and transaction related costs  We also recorded a special item charge of  162 million or  0 43 per share for severance costs associated with a series of actions we are taking to improve our organizational efficiency  As described in today s earnings release  special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results  Please note that consistent with past practice  when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2020 outlook  we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or prior year development of medical costs Additionally  our outlook for 2020 assumes a full year of earnings from Cigna s Group Disability and Life business  We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed by the third quarter of 2020  I will remind you that  as previously disclosed  beginning in 2020  we will no longer exclude contributions from transitioning clients from our performance measures as the transition for those clients was substantially complete as of December 31  2019  And finally  I would note that this morning  we posted an investor presentation to the Investor Relations section of cigna com that outlines our strategy and track record  the strength of our four growth platforms  2020 operating and capital guidance and details of our longer term outlook  We hope that you will find this a helpful resource With that  I will turn the call over to David David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Will  and good morning  everyone  Thank you for joining our call today  In 2019  we delivered consolidated adjusted revenue of  140 billion and grew earnings per share by 20  to  17 05  As a result  we exceeded the guidance that we had already raised each quarter during 2019 for revenue  earnings and EPS as well as cash flow from operations  Today  I ll comment on how we delivered these exceptionally strong results and on the contributions made by each of our four growth platforms  led by Health Services and Integrated Medical segments  I ll also discuss how we are positioned to drive attractive growth in 2020 and achieve our 2021 EPS target of  20 to  21 per share  Finally  I ll highlight a key point of differentiation and a driver of future growth  our focus on being the undisputed partner of choice in healthcare Following my comments  Eric will share more details about our full year 2019 financial results and 2020 outlook  and then we ll take your questions  Let s dive in  At our Investor Day last year  we committed to building on our decade long track record of delivering industry leading cost trends  consistent growth and effective capital stewardship  In 2019  we delivered on each of these commitments  By remaining focused on our customers and patients  we executed well across each of our businesses  deepened our customer relationships and achieved our integration priorities  Together  this fueled our outstanding performance  In Health Services  we delivered market leading customer client retention  including 97  retention for the 2020 selling season and continued strong organic growth in prescriptions  In Commercial  we again delivered industry leading medical cost trend and grew our Commercial medical customers for the tenth consecutive year led by another year of double digit growth in the Select segment  And in our Government business  CMS  most recent Star s ratings position us to have 87  of our Medicare Advantage customers in four star or higher plans for 2021  a reinforcement of our strong customer satisfaction and high levels of clinical quality Additionally  we made significant progress in advancing our five key integration priorities  First and foremost  we kept our promises in the marketplace by ensuring our more than 107 million customer relationships around the world experience ongoing high service quality throughout the year  Second  we delivered medical and pharmacy cost savings for the benefit of our customers and clients  effectively completing their transition to industry leading pharmacy solutions  including Accredo s Specialty Pharmacy and Express Scripts customer friendly home delivery pharmacy  Additionally  more than 95  of our customers have access to SafeGuardRx  an innovative suite of value based programs that improve care and value for customers with challenging medical conditions  Third was our focus on talent  As a health service company  our talent and their engagement is key to our performance and ongoing growth  Our retention and engagement levels today one year into our combination are above our already strong pretransaction levels  Fourth  we made significant progress toward securing base operating expense synergies  The organizational efficiency plan we announced earlier today is another important step toward achieving these targets And finally  we kept our vision top of mind by accelerating marketplace innovations that improve affordability  predictability and simplicity  including our Embarc Benefit Protection program which improves customer access to life changing gene therapies while shielding clients from the price shock of multimillion dollar treatments  our digital health formulary to better carry and generate value from the 300 000 digital health apps in the marketplace today  and our Patient Assurance Program  with insulin dependent patients with diabetes pay a maximum of  25 for a 30 day supply of insulin  As a result of this program  our customers are already realizing significant out of pocket savings  Overall  2019 was an exceptionally strong year for Cigna and gives us considerable momentum for ongoing attractive growth in 2020 and beyond  Our achievements were and continue to be driven by the focus  commitment and passion of our employees who wake up every day to fulfill our mission to improve the health  well being and peace of mind of those we serve  In 2020  we will continue to drive significant growth in customer relationships  revenue  earnings and EPS as well as strong cash flows  In Health Services  we expect adjusted script growth in a range of 20  to 23  over our year end 2019 levels In Integrated Medical  we are on track for continued medical customer growth  highlighted by our Government business  where we expect 13  to 16  customer growth in Medicare Advantage  and we remain positioned for very attractive growth over the next five years  Additionally  after a very successful first year as a combined company  we remain on track to complete our integration activities over the next year  We also expect to close the sale of our Group Disability and Life business to New York Life by the third quarter this year  and we are on track to return our balance sheet to normalized levels of debt by year end 2020  In short  we are on pace to meet the commitments we made when we announced the combination nearly two years ago and meet the commitments we made at our Investor Day in May of 2019  Looking forward  a key point of differentiation and growth driver for Cigna in 2020 and beyond is our orientation toward partnering in order to achieve accelerated innovation  improved affordability  predictability and simplicity and to further expand our distribution reach  Several recent examples demonstrate our proven differentiation  First is our new arrangement with Prime Therapeutics Starting in April 2020  together  we will make pharmacy care more affordable  by enhancing pharmacy networks and pharmaceutical manufacturer value for Prime s 28 million members who are covered by 23 health plans  including employer programs  Medicare and Medicaid  Together  Express Scripts and Prime will help each other to continue to grow in the market across the country by innovating new solutions to improve affordability  increase access to medicine and further improve individual health  This agreement shows our ability to work across healthcare and partner with those who seek to deliver innovative high quality health services and solutions to employers  health plans and governmental agencies for the benefit of customers and patients  A second example of our partnership orientation is our work with emerging and highly innovative companies  A great recent example of this is our partnership with Oscar Health  With Oscar  we will deliver new innovative solutions for small businesses  which all too often are left with limited options that are highly priced  We will offer small businesses access to affordable  fully insured health plans that brought in choice and prioritize whole person health We will focus in four geographies with Oscar later this year and we ll take our proven test and learn framework to accelerate growth over time  A third example is our trusted relationships with healthcare professionals  We have a long history of innovative value based arrangements with healthcare professionals in both our U S  Commercial and Government businesses  including more than 650 collaborative accountable care relationships  Today  more than 65  of Cigna s medical payments are in value based arrangements across our top 40 commercial markets and all our Medicare markets  Importantly  92  of healthcare providers in our programs are delivering differentiated levels of quality and 90  of care providers believe Cigna is the industry leader in this area  These deep partnerships drive our growth  particularly in Medicare Advantage  where we focus on geographies where our commercial business already has aligned high performing collaborative accountable care relationships in place Approximately 25  of medical eligible seniors live in geographies where our Commercial business has deep ties and delivery systems but where we have no Medicare Advantage presence today  That provides a meaningful growth opportunity for our Medicare Advantage business that we have begun to capitalize in 2020 by accelerating our geographic expansion and bringing new PPO solutions to market  This  combined with the fact that 87  of our Medicare Advantage customers are in four star or greater plans in 2021  and our high customer NPS levels which approximate 70 across all of our markets  make us excited about our future customer growth  which we project to be in the range of 10  to 15  on an annualized basis over the next five years Each of these examples gives a clear view of how diverse healthcare stakeholders view Cigna as their best partner for future success and how being the partner of choice in the healthcare marketplace will contribute to our sustained  differentiated growth over time  Now briefly to summarize  At Cigna  we delivered exceptional full year 2019 financial results across our four growth platforms  led by Health Services and our Integrated Medical segments  These results drove strong financial performance in 2019 and provide us with considerable momentum as we step into 2020 with outstanding strategic and financial flexibility  and we remain on track to deliver our EPS goal of  20 to  21 per share in 2021 With that  I ll turn the call over to Eric Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  David  Good morning  everyone  In my remarks today  I will review Cigna s 2019 results and provide our outlook for 2020  Key consolidated financial highlights for 2019 include  adjusted revenue of  140 billion  earnings of  6 5 billion after tax  earnings per share growth of 20  to  17 05  and operating cash flows that more than doubled this year to  9 5 billion  These results reflect strong  consistent execution across our businesses throughout 2019  Regarding our segments  I ll first comment on Health Services  Full year 2019 revenues were  96 4 billion and pre tax earnings were  5 1 billion  Results for 2019 reflect organic growth with outstanding client retention and the addition of 2 7 million pharmacy customers  strong volumes with 1 22 billion adjusted pharmacy scripts fulfilled and growth in Specialty Pharmacy  Overall  Health Services performed well in 2019 with results in line with our expectations and reflecting significant progress across our integration activities Turning to Integrated Medical  2019 revenues grew 11  to  36 5 billion driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships  premium growth  reflecting underlying cost trends  and the inclusion of the Express Scripts Medicare Part D business  We organically grew our global medical customer base to 17 1 million lives  In 2019  we once again delivered double digit organic customer growth in our Select segment with continued enrollment gains in middle market  Full year earnings grew 9  to  3 8 billion  reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships  strong operating expense discipline and continued effective medical cost management  Turning to medical costs  For our total U S  commercial book of business  full year medical cost trend for 2019 was approximately 4   which marks the seventh consecutive year Cigna has delivered an industry leading result  Our full year 2019 total medical care ratio or MCR was 80 8   finishing the year at the low end of our guidance range  Our MCR performance reflects stable trends and focused execution of affordability initiatives across our Commercial and Government businesses and the pricing effect of the health insurance tax suspension Full year 2019 Integrated Medical earnings benefited from  85 million pre tax of favorable net prior year reserve development  For all  Cigna s Integrated Medical segment delivered strong financial results in 2019  In our International Markets business  revenues grew to  5 6 billion  an increase of 8  on a currency adjusted basis  and full year 2019 pre tax earnings grew to  762 million  reflecting continued business growth partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts  For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment  full year 2019 revenues were  5 2 billion  Full year pre tax earnings for this segment were  501 million with strong performance in Life and continued administrative efficiencies partially offset by higher disability claims  For our Corporate segment  the full year 2019 loss was  1 8 billion primarily driven by  1 7 billion of interest costs  As Will mentioned  during fourth quarter  we reported a special item charge of  162 million after tax for severance costs related to our organizational efficiency plan  Under this plan  we will implement efficiency initiatives that we identified primarily through our integration work These actions reflect our commitment to providing affordable quality solutions to the marketplace and the savings associated with this plan are included within the multi year administrative expense synergy targets that we ve previously communicated  Overall  Cigna s 2019 results reflect focused execution across each of our businesses  Before discussing our outlook for continued attractive growth this year  I would remind you of the 2019 earnings per share baseline adjustment that we quantified on our third quarter earnings call  Specifically  Cigna s earnings per share performance in 2019 should be adjusted for the following three items  first   0 12 per share for the tax item we favorably settled in the second quarter of 2019  second   0 18 per share of favorable net prior year reserve development  and finally   0 25 per share associated with the industry tax  which was suspended for 2019 but returns in 2020 for a final year  This impact is increased to reflect the incremental timing effect of the recent repeal of the industry tax  When adjusting for these impacts  Cigna s 2019 earnings per share baseline was  16 50 Turning to our outlook  We have entered 2020 well positioned to drive both continued growth and innovation  We also expect to complete our integration activity associated with Express Scripts combination over the next year  For full year 2020  we expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of  154 million to  156 billion  representing growth of 10  to 11   We expect full year 2020 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be  6 8 billion to  7 billion or  18 to  18 60 per share  This represents growth in the range of 9  to 13  over our 2019 baseline  We expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2020 to be approximately 47  in the first half and 53  in the second half of the year  taking into consideration seasonality patterns within our businesses  For 2020  we project an expense ratio in the range of 8 6  to 9 1  and the consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23  to 24   Additionally  our outlook excludes any contribution from future share repurchases and prior year reserve development and assumes a full year of contributions from our Group Disability and Life business  And as previously communicated  in 2020  we will no longer report transitioning client contributions since those transitions were substantially complete as of December 31  2019  I will now discuss our 2020 outlook for our segments For our Health Services business  we expect full year 2020 earnings in the range of  5 3 billion to  5 45 billion  This represents year over year growth in the range of 4  to 7   In Health Services  we expect first quarter 2020 earnings to grow by a mid single digit percentage over first quarter 2019  This outlook reflects solid underlying growth and the benefits of increased year over year administrative expense synergies  I would also note that we expect our first quarter 2020 Health Services SG A expense ratio to be higher than first quarter 2019  reflecting impacts of the client transitions we ve discussed previously and including start up costs associated with our collaboration with Prime Therapeutics  For 2020  we expect adjusted pharmacy scripts in the range of 1 47 billion to 1 50 billion claims  This reflects the impact of completing the insourcing of Cigna pharmacy services  growth associated with the first year of the Prime collaboration and additional organic growth of 25 million to 35 million adjusted pharmacy scripts All in  this represents year over year growth of 20  to 23   For Integrated Medical  we expect full year 2020 earnings in the range of  4 billion to  4 1 billion  which represents growth of 11  to 13  over the 2019 baseline  This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth  deepening of customer relationships and effective medical cost management  This outlook also included the benefit of administrative expense synergies  Key assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2020 include the following  Regarding global medical customers  we expect 2020 growth in the range of 150 000 to 250 000 customers driven by continued organic growth in our Commercial business  led by the Select and Middle Market segments  partially offset by lower National Accounts enrollment  We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth of 13  to 16   Our growth outlook also includes an expectation of lower enrollment in our U S  individual business and the expected loss of our Texas Medicaid contracts  collectively resulting in a reduction of approximately 90 000 customers Turning to medical costs  For our U S  Commercial Employer book of business  we expect full year 2020 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3 5  to 4 5   We expect the 2020 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80 2  to 81 2   reflecting the return of the health insurance tax in 2020 and continued strong performance of our Commercial and Government businesses offset by the mix impact of new Medicare Advantage lives and normalized margins in our U S  individual business  We also expect strong contributions from our International Markets  Group Disability and Other businesses as they continue to deliver solutions that enhance affordability and predictability and provide a more simplified experience for those we serve  Regarding interest expense  we expect costs of approximately  1 6 billion pre tax in 2020  So all in  for full year 2020  we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of  6 8 billion to  7 billion or  18 to  18 60 per share  I would also remind you that our outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and prior year reserve development and assumes a full year of contributions from our Group Disability and Life business Overall  these expected results represent a very attractive outlook  aided by the strong performance across our differentiated portfolio of businesses  These expected results also position us well to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of  20 to  21 per share  Now moving to our capital management position and outlook  Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized  and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long term growth and innovation  In 2019  we deployed  5 2 billion to repay debt  and we repurchased 11 8 million shares of stock for  2 billion  We ended 2019 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 45 2   an improvement of 570 basis points over year end 2018  For 2020  we expect greater than  7 5 billion of cash flow from operations  reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses  As previously discussed  we have a near term focus on accelerated debt repayment and remain on track to return our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020 In 2020  we expect to deploy  4 5 billion to  5 billion to debt repayment and  1 billion to capital expenditures  As a reminder  our capital priorities remain as follows  reinvestment back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth  strategic M A on a targeted basis  and returning capital to shareholders  which historically we have done primarily through share repurchase  Year to date  as of February 5  2020  we have repurchased 1 2 million shares for  245 million and we have  3 72 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization  Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong  benefiting from our highly efficient service based orientation that drives strategic flexibility  strong margins and attractive returns on capital  Now to recap  our full year 2019 consolidated results reflect the considerable strength and momentum across our four growth platforms and continued effective execution of our focused strategy  We are confident in our ability to deliver our full year 2020 earnings outlook  and we remain on track to achieve our  20 to  21 of earnings per share target for 2021  Further  our clear strategic focus  differentiated value proposition across our businesses and outstanding financial flexibility give us continued confidence in our long term targets for growth in revenue  earnings and EPS And with that  I ll turn it over to the operator for the Q A portion of the call OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research  Mr  Lake  your line is open Justin Lake    AnalystThanks  Good morning  Wanted to ask a quick numbers question and then a little bit about the capital deployment  So first  just in terms of the Group Disability sale on numbers  I know you have it in there  Just want to understand how you deploy capital that you receive to keep this earnings neutral for 2020  Wouldn t the company have to begin buying back stock early or do an ASR given the earnings will go away at a moment in time and yet the share capital deployment might take time Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJustin  it s Eric  Thanks for the question on that  So just to step back  So for the Group Disability and Life transaction  as we noted  in December  we entered into that agreement  We expect  5 3 billion of after tax proceeds  and we re on track for that to close in the third quarter  So again  the  5 3 billion  first  will be incremental to our operating cash flow for the year  We ve got flexibility in terms of the timing of how we deploy things that    how we deploy the capital for the year  Our primary focus is on achieving our debt to capitalization ratio of below 40  by the end of the year and we ve got flexibility beyond that and throughout the year to begin to do share repurchase and such  We haven t provided any specific guidance in terms of the exact timing of the share repurchase  but we do have flexibility to get started on that even at the end of the close Justin Lake    AnalystOkay  But will it be earnings neutral to the year  the combination of using the disability and the capital deployment Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s our expectation  and that s the guidance that we provided back when we announced the transaction Justin Lake    AnalystOkay  And then if I could just ask a question about the Prime relationship  Congratulations on that  obviously  I wanted to understand two things  One  in terms of the relationship itself  it s somewhat narrow in focus  but it sounds like it could expand over time  How do you kind of look at the risk versus opportunity  the risk being that some of your existing Express Scripts customers  where you have a much broader relationship  move to Prime and  therefore  could be somewhat dilutive versus the opportunities to work with these blues and potentially expand that partnership and kind of offset some of that risk David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerJustin  good morning  It s David  First and foremost  let me just really underscore how pleased we are to have entered that relationship  the validation of our deep commitment to servicing health plans  partnering with health plans and growing those relationships  Two  your ability to retain any relationship  be it commercial  health and otherwise  is based on a couple of basic tenets  a  are you able to drive partnership and alignment  b  deliver differentiated value  c  innovate together  We re committed to doing so  And actually  we view the opposite of the maybe risk that you identified  this further broadens our reach and our opportunity to serve more lives  both individual customers and patients and a broader portfolio of health plans as we go forward  So we re delighted by securing this  and we look forward to beginning to serve that relationship in the second quarter of this year Justin Lake    AnalystThanks for the call OperatorThank you for the question  Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America  Your line is open  sir Kevin Fischbeck    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks  Actually  this is a quick numbers question first  too  It sounds like you re saying that the guidance basically is similar to what you were saying with Q3  but you ve got another  0 05 drag from HIF being removed in 2021  Do I just have that right that  that s the main change versus Q3 initial outlook Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerKevin  it s Eric  Really two small things to think about there  the HIF incremental drag of a few cents that you noted  and we have the benefit of a  0 02 pickup because of the lower share count as we completed repurchase from the time period  So those are the two differences Kevin Fischbeck    AnalystOkay  And then a question being  I think that when you guys provided initial membership guidance at the beginning of this year  that was kind of a little bit disappointing  And I guess  it s clear now that some of it s individuals  some of it s Medicaid  But you  in your presentation  have long term commercial top line growth of 8  to 10   which is a higher number than I think most people think about as far as commercial growth  How much of that is able to be driven by just growth in the Select and Middle Market accounts  Or do you need to be starting to grow National Accounts and Individual to kind of achieve that over the long term  And how do you    if so  how do you turn that around Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerKevin  it s Eric  I ll start on that  First of all  those targets are very consistent with the results we ve driven in the commercial markets for a number of years now  And I think of the growth in that    the frames that we target in that business is being driven by really three things  The first category would be around continued customer growth as we continue to grow in the Select and Middle Market segments  We ve got a lot of opportunity to continue to grow in those segments  The next one  I would say  would be on deepening our existing client relationships and so as we work to identify new solutions and deepen our existing solutions in terms of new product sales and  again  for other programs and services  And then the third category to think about would be around working to innovate and to deliver new solutions more broadly  But again  that s the recipe that we ve used for a number of years now  and we see a lot of opportunity to continue on that track in the commercial market Kevin Fischbeck    AnalystAnd you don t need National Accounts growth per se  Or is that part of the growth pipeline David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerKevin  it s David  When you think about National Accounts  put it back in context  we define that segment to remind you much more narrow than maybe the market in total  So for Integrated Medical  it s commercial employers  5 000 or more employees that are multi state  Based on that definition and our strategy  we view that marketplace as a flat to somewhat shrinking marketplace based on our strategy within Integrated Medical  Now Eric s point two and point three reinforce how we continue to actually grow and deepen relationships with National Accounts  Even today  we re able to successfully do that  And then lastly  what we re quite excited about is adding to that  more broadly  off of our Health Services platform the ability to offer broader coordinated services  So we continue to see deepening of relationships and broadening relationships within National Accounts even with the medical membership performance that you re making reference to  And over time  we see the ability to even further accelerate that by leveraging our Health Services portfolio  So that will be a net contributor as well OperatorThank you for your question   Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies  Your line is open  sir Mr  Windley Are you perhaps on mute Dave Windley    AnalystSorry  Thank you  I was on mute  Sorry about that  Thanks for taking my question  On Medicare Advantage  as you look at a double digit growth trajectory here  and I think that s your expectation for multiple years  that larger cohorts can sometimes come in and put a little pressure on margin  I m wondering what your expectations are around that and what kind of platform and resources you have in place to onboard risk or risk assess and get new Medicare Advantage members into programs to mitigate any initial margin pressure David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerIt s David  First and foremost  we re really pleased with the start to 2020  As we indicated in 2019  we expect to grow this platform 10  to 15   and we re on track to do 13  to 16   Just back to reminding you of some of the context  We re well positioned today in 2021  Our Stars rating picks up yet further to 87  of our lives in four star or greater plans  and our Net Promoter Score is tracking at a tad over 70 across our broad portfolio  So our ability to grow both in markets  on platforms  net new geographies  being adjacent counties and new markets we re opening and broadening our PPO platform  will fuel this and drive it on a go forward basis Clearly  the rate and pace of that growth may put a little margin pressure and draw us toward the lower end of our margin range where we are at times maybe a tad below that  We ll balance that in our portfolio as we continue to invest as we are today  but we like the growth outlook  We like the aggregate margin profile  We like the sustainability  The last sub note maybe to have there in terms of the coding and otherwise  Our value based provider relationships and our high engagement programs are well positioned to coordinate the care of the services  etc   as reinforced by the Stars rating and as reinforced by our overall performance  So we feel good about the outlook for this year and the trajectory going forward Dave Windley    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you for your question  Your next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs  Your line is open  sir Steve Tanal    AnalystSo I guess I ll ask one in Oscar  It sounds like partnership but trying to understand what elements of their business are difficult or costly for Cigna to build or offer independently  So just trying to really understand what are the functions each of the companies will do in the context of the partnership  And maybe that s it for me David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerSteve  thanks  It s David  So stepping back  as I noted in my prepared remarks  first  at a philosophical level  we view that the notion of partnering and beyond partnering  striving to be the undisputed partner of choice  it s a competitive advantage and something we want to build on  Why  It accelerates pace of innovation  It accelerates value creation  whether it be around affordability  predictability  simplicity  and it could broaden speed and absolute reach within the marketplace  Oscar is a wonderful example of that  And if you take it up to the macro level  you ll recall that Cigna s historically not participated in the smallest end of the employer marketplace  be it under 50 or under 100 depending on where the regulatory lines are drawn from that standpoint  Two  we believe that s an underserved marketplace with less choice and less leverage of some of the most innovative solutions Now to the core of your question  when you re open minded to partnering  you could have both focus and acceleration  in this case  by leveraging Oscar s phenomenal  technological infrastructure  digital first infrastructure and information flow infrastructure  which is similar to our philosophy but we just apply it upmarket in Select  Middle and National  And this is a case where we re philosophically aligned  but the durable infrastructure is there to serve the unique needs of the small employers  and then we re able to pour it over our value based network configurations  our high performing engagement  clinical  behavioral pharmacy capabilities to make one plus one equal a lot more than two  So we re excited about that  And as I noted in my prepared remarks  we re staged to open up four markets toward the latter part of this year and then fuel some growth OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from A J  Rice with Credit Suisse  Your line is open  sir A J  Rice    AnalystHi everybody  Just to maybe ask about the 2020 bottom line and 2021 bottom line ranges that you have for    two parts to it  First  Eric made some comments about divisional level seasonality this year and how we might think about that  I know some of your peers have made a bigger deal about the first quarter and the impact of leap day  Perhaps because your business is diversified  it doesn t mean as much to you  but is there anything you d like to say about the seasonal pattern relative to a normal year  And when you think about the range itself  I guess my question is  there s a number    you ve got a number of business lines  You ve got variability around your capital deployment and cost synergy realization  Is that    is there a couple of things in that range that you see as standing out that would particularly move you into the high end or the low end of your forecast given its  0 60 range and  1 range for this year and next  Or is it just the agglomeration of all these different business lines and it falls out  But I guess I m just trying to figure out of there a couple of things that are big variables in your mind as to where you re going to be  say  versus the  20 to  21 next year David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  On the item related to the leap year and February having an extra day this year  that does move the pattern around a little bit in the Integrated Medical segment  All else equal  that runs the loss ratio up a little bit for the first quarter  it will normalize out over the course of the year  Of course  fully factored into our guidance and such  but that does put a modest amount of pressure on the first quarter that will recover over the balance of the year  nothing that I would call out as particularly significant  As it relates to the range more broadly  there aren t any big items I ve called out other than just the rate and pace of our spending and our investments in terms of future growth  As you know  we have continued to invest in building new capabilities and the like  There s spend every year as we get ready for new clients to come on board and things along those lines  So it would be those types of items that I d think about more than anything else at this point A J  Rice    AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi  Your line is open  sir Ralph Giacobbe    AnalystThanks  Good morning  I want to go to interest expense guidance  So it looks like you re run rating to  1 6 billion  at least as of the fourth quarter  The guidance calls for  1 6 billion of interest cost in 2020 despite the  4 5 billion to  5 billion debt pay down  So is it just timing related  Maybe if you can kind of help reconcile that  And then along those lines  I guess  to Justin s first question  I just want to make sure  That share repo  I mean  to the extent that you re doing it and accelerating it early on as an offset for the Group Disability and Life  does that mean any upside  essentially  in the first half of the year  essentially  it s not going to carry through to the EPS line simply because of the timing again Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerRalph  it s Eric  So on the interest expense  really nothing in particular I d call out other than and maybe looking out to the decimal point a little bit further and the timing throughout the year  Obviously  to the extent we were to extinguish that earlier  the interest expense will go down  but again  our current expectation would be for  1 6 billion  as I noted in my prepared remarks  In terms of the timing on the capital deployment  the mechanics are consistent with what I outlined to Justin s question  We do have flexibility in terms of the timing at which we would deploy  Our expectation is that we would fully offset the absence of the group transition by reducing the share count through share repurchase  and we ll approach that as we go through the course of the coming months and quarters here OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question from Sarah James with Piper Sandler  Ma am  your line is open Sarah James    AnalystThank you  Looking at the five year Medicare growth strategy  There s a shift to focus on PPO  Wondering what dynamics changed in the market to make PPO more attractive  And why not focus on Group  given your large National Account base  Your peers have had good success on retiree accounts  So why is that not a strategy Cigna s pursuing David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerSarah  it s David  So first and foremost  I wouldn t view it as a shift  We didn t go from something and away from something to something  So the individual HMO continues to be a bedrock of the platform and  in fact  is a major driver of our growth in 2020 as an example of that  We sought to add the individual PPO platform to our portfolio  invested to do so  stood it up and have the arrangements with the dollar based provider community to be able to offer that  So it s expanding choice and building on a successful platform and track record  And as we both enter new markets and expand in counties  we will make our decisions in terms of individual HMO  individual PPO or both on a go forward basis We just see it as an end and a natural extension of our portfolio  Additionally  to your important point  we view that the employer marketplace is also a very attractive addressable market  And as you know  beyond National Accounts  our broad  well performing commercial portfolio of employee relationships presents another opportunity for that  and it s on our growth trajectory  We re just very disciplined as it relates to building the momentum  So going from the proven HMO to adding the PPO  expanding geographies  and you should expect us over time to come back and talk with you about the very attractive additional growth opportunities that exist in the employer marketplace for us as well Sarah James    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan  Your line is open  sir Gary Taylor    AnalystHi  good morning  Two quick numbers questions  The first one is to Eric on the 80 basis point impact on the MLR from the HIF recurring next year  Just wondering when you derive that  do you just presume that on MA there s no impact because there s no explicit growth up there  which is kind of a yes no question  My other question was on the PBM  So for next year  you ve got like 5  at the midpoint pre tax growth on like 22  script growth  Obviously  the Prime scripts are coming in at breakeven  you ve told us  We know that the Optum scripts coming over are lower profitability per script  So when we just think about the core and the organic growth in script  should we assume that organic EBITDA margins are similar  those new organic scripts are coming in at similar margins and the sort of dilution and profitability per script is purely being driven by Optum and Prime Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGary  it s Eric  On the first part of your question  I think the short answer is yes  Think of that as not having a specific impact in terms of the quantification  given there s not a way to specifically build that into how you bid for MA  On the second portion of your question  I think also the answer is yes  The dynamics you outlined are really the biggest pieces here  When you adjust for the Prime volumes  and you adjust for the Cigna transition volumes  I think of the core side on those items as being consistent Gary Taylor    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets  Your line is open  sir Matthew Borsch    AnalystThank you  You guys just asked about the commercial market  maybe a little bit about what you ve seen from  I guess  what you call your Select segment in terms of preference to shift to alternate funding away from risk and if you ve got any sense for how that may be affecting the risk pools  I m asking the question partly in light of another company that spoke to seeing some deterioration in the remaining underwriting risk David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerMatthew  it s David  So specific to the commercial marketplace  and I think you re going into the Select segment  recall that we offer choice in that marketplace  The choice is heavily oriented around a well configured  integrated value proposition with the medical  the pharmacy  the behavioral  the care management programs  etc   and building choice around funding options  Today  think about  from a new business standpoint  it s tracking about 50 50  About 50  of the new business we re writing right now is risk  About 50  of it is ASO stop loss  plus or minus  and that vacillates in any given year a little bit more one  a little bit more of the other  and we re delighted with that  We re delighted to be able to be in position to offer it in that way I d also remind you from prior conversations  one of our strengths when you offer that choice is oftentimes  you re literally offering that choice side by side  And it s a good validation for the purchaser  in this case the client  of our conviction to the ASO proposition when you re able to put the guaranteed cost side by side  But today  think about it  the new business is running about 50 50 and I wouldn t describe any difference we re seeing in terms of your terminology from a risk pool standpoint of performance  It s performing really well for us Matthew Borsch    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research  Your line is open  sir Josh Raskin    AnalystThanks  Good morning  I m going to ask a little bit about capital deployment  and you re talking about getting your debt to cap under 40  by the end of this year  You ve got another  5 3 billion of proceeds from Disability and Life and  7 5 billion of available deployable cash next year  You think about adding all these numbers up and it s approaching 20  of the market cap  And I understand the priorities  but is there a little bit more urgency from a capital deployment perspective rather than sort of sitting on cash that s dilutive to returns  Do you think about more aggressive buybacks  Is there a dividend increase  things like that  I m just curious if you re starting to feel a little bit more pressure in terms of that deployment Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJosh  It s Eric  Appreciate where you framed that up  Obviously  we re very excited about the capital generation that we ve got  the cash flow from operations visibility that we ve got for 2020 and into 2021  and that gives us a lot of flexibility  I think we ve got a really good track record of not  to use your word  sitting on cash  We will deploy the capital in a way that s effective and aligned with our shareholders  interest and such versus just accumulating  to be clear  But again  the overall history we ve got from    and track record we ve got from an effectiveness of capital deployment and managing our capital  coupled up with the visibility and flexibility that we ve got coming with the capital available for us  is an exciting combination  David  I don t know what else you ll add on that David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerI ll just reinforce    Josh  I appreciate your question  Recall from the    our strategic positioning  pre combination  aided to by the combination  etc   our ability to generate a significant amount of operating cash flow is a critical competency and we believe a strategic advantage with  9 5 billion in 2019  at least  7 5 billion in 2020 and at least  8 5 billion in 2021  so quite deliberate  And as Eric said  we note the importance of that responsibility  not something we take lightly  but our effective capital stewardship responsibility will be clear as we go forward  and we have tremendous value creation opportunity in front of us right now OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein  Your line is open  sir Lance Wilkes    AnalystGreat  Just had a question on the individual business line and the strategy and appetite in that business going forward  And then maybe also if you can comment on the SG A increase in Health Services for the fourth quarter and maybe what drove that David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerLance  it s David  I ll take the first question and I ll ask Eric to take the second part of your question  Individual business line  I m presuming you re referencing the individual exchange  Just to remind everybody  the individual exchange marketplace  we took a very focused  deliberate posture on that  in that marketplace in 2014 and have stayed steady within that marketplace  systematically but slowly growing our posture  We re in 10 markets today  Think about the positioning of being in 10 markets highly oriented around leveraging our value based provider relationships  and that marketplace has performed pretty darn well in the last couple of years Going forward  we ll monitor the competitive landscape  but we see the ability to continue to grow that reasonably over time with fair returns  Cornerstone to our value proposition  though  is ensuring that in those states  we go down to sub MSA level and make sure we re building the value prop or the offering around our highest performing physician relationships and getting the requisite alignment with the delivery system  And thus far  that s performed well for us  And we look forward to year in  year out making individual decisions of additional market expansion  Eric  I ll ask you to address the SG A comment Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Lance  it s Eric  On the Health Services  fourth quarter  really two items that I ll have you think about on that front  One  as we noted throughout both David and my prepared remarks  continue to spend to invest in terms of building new and additional capabilities and such  Additionally  we re spending on facilitating and effectuating the transitions associated with the full reinsourcing of the Cigna volumes and the like  The other item I would just note that we ve provided some commentary throughout the year last year around the effect of the transitioning client going away  sometimes the volumes in our transitioning clients wound down  that s added cost back into the core  if you will  and we re well on track to extinguish that as we work through 2020 Lance Wilkes    AnalystPerfect OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is open  sir Peter Costa    AnalystThank you  I d like to follow up with    on Dave s question earlier about margins in Medicare  and in particular  timing of when that will start to add to your earnings from a perspective of    first off  how are you getting the members that you re getting today  Are they coming electronically  Are you setting up broker networks  And can you talk a little bit about the channel and how that s going to evolve going forward  And then also in 2021 with ESRD patients coming on  how do you expect that to impact your margins in the Medicare business David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerPeter  it s David  First  broadly speaking  just to reiterate  we re really pleased with the positioning we have in our existing MSAs and expanding into new markets  Our individual HMO platform is the lead offering still in the lead part of the growth chassis  aided by the new market entrees as well as the PPO platform  Specifically  to your question of how we go to market  think about that as an end proposition  So it s a multi channel approach relative to captive partnered and otherwise and expect that to continue to expand over time  Specific to the margins  as I mentioned to the prior question  the margins  we would expect to be at the lower end of the range that we put out as a long term range as we accelerate our growth trajectory over the near term potentially ticking below that Having said that  with the growth  we would have earnings growth that  that brings along with it  And finally  relative to ESRD  as we flagged in the past when asked a question  it will be a smaller impact on our aggregate franchise  We will manage the final ESRD posture  MSA by MSA  benefit offering by benefit offering in alignment with our value based physicians  And we ll be well positioned to manage that to the extent the final changes transpire as currently proposed from that standpoint  Net net  taken together  attractive growth  even at the lower end of the margin range  we will be experiencing earnings expansion while simultaneously investing for growth going forward Peter Costa    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets  Your line is open  sir Frank Morgan    AnalystThank you  Two real quick questions  Any thoughts on last night  CMS proposed rule around 2021 MA rate update  And then any update on the Cigna  Anthem litigation David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerFrank  it s David  Specific to the rate notice  as you might imagine  we re digesting the detail of it given the magnitude of it  It s the preliminary notice  You know the process in terms of getting to the final rate notice  Big picture  I would suggest to you we re macro in line with the aggregation of what that rate notice indicates  And when we think about the posture of that rate notice  the expansion of our charge proposition for 2021  we ll be in good shape for 2021  More to follow  but big picture  our impact is  broadly speaking  in line with what the rate notice speaks to  As it relates to the    you asked specifically about the Cigna  Anthem litigation  That is on course to resolve itself by the end of this calendar month Frank Morgan    AnalystAny other color you can share on that  What gives you confidence it will be wrapped up this month and would that result in a settlement payment David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo comment in specificity relative to litigation other than I would reinforce  we feel very strong about our position relative to our contractual responsibility and contractual ability to collect our break fee  and the court is on track to resolve that by the end of this calendar month Frank Morgan    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank  Sir  your line is open George Hill    AnalystGood morning  guys  And thanks for taking the question  I guess  David  you talked a lot about the partnership strategy and maybe digging a little bit more into Prime    the Prime deal  I guess  can you talk about the network component of it and I guess  where do you guys see the most significant points of operating leverage that delivered through to earnings beyond 2020  Is it more on the rebate side  Or is it more on the network side  And kind of can you talk a little bit about the strength that each side brought to the relationship David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I m not going to go through the micro pieces of the components of the relationship  I d rather just reframe what we re trying to achieve together  This is a wonderful example of two organizations identifying philosophical alignment and strategic alignment and then pursuing leverage that results in additional value for customers and clients  That s the end of and the net net of this  which is improved affordability  potentially improve coordinated access and then clinical program leverage on a go forward basis  We will continue to work with Prime in terms of the best ways in which we could add additional value for them There s 28 million individual relationships that our customers and members that are within the Prime relationship  And we ll be guided by the components that they feel we could create the most value for  We ll make value added suggestions and evolve that over time  all with the objective of creating more value for their members and clients and  therefore  getting some benefit for Cigna as well over time  So we re delighted with it and it s another validation of our ability to work with other like minded partners to create mutual value George Hill    AnalystMaybe a quick follow up then is  how do we think about you guys effectively strengthening a competitor at the margin or kind of enabling their competition against you in the PBM business David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe don t    I appreciate the question  We think about it the exact opposite way  It s a dynamic marketplace and those who create the most valuable win  those who try to preserve or regress to control value will lose over time  So big picture  we re more oriented around a perpetual innovation cycle and continue to drive more value  And we like to do that with others and create mutual value and we have a long track record  The legacy of ESI has that  The legacy of Cigna has that  and we re fueling more of it  So this is an opportunity to create more value for 28 million more customers starting in 2020 and further improve affordability and further improve quality from that standpoint  that s a great outcome  Each organization has to continue to innovate  Each organization has to deliver value  and there s ample growth opportunity in front of both organizations going forward  and we ll align to mutually identified beneficial opportunities for both organizations to grow  but the cornerstone is innovation and more value delivery  So we view it as upside and not downside OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley  Your line is open  sir Ricky Goldwasser    AnalystYes  Hi  good morning  As we start thinking about 2021 selling season for the PBM business  can you give us some sense of the size of the book that s up for renewal in also any    what are    what s the size of the opportunities you re seeing that s up in the market from the other PBMs  And then my second question is on the MA growth guidance  Obviously  you came in    the guidance you gave based in January  I think it was ahead of your initial goal  at least near term goals  So maybe you can share with us what really resonated in the marketplace  And what do you think drove the above expectations performance or at least its materializing earlier David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerRicky  it s David  Specific to the 2021 PBM selling season  break it up into two components  health plan relationships  corporate relationships  As we sit here today  the health plan relationships  as you would expect  drew out a closure or completion sooner given the size  shape and scope of those relationships  They re substantially completed through the renewal cycle  and we feel great about the outcome  So that would be the picture I gave you for 2021  continued strength from that standpoint  The corporate part of the relationships are getting into full steam right now  We think we re going to have another very good year from that standpoint  and our value proposition is resonating very well in the marketplace  specifically relative to the    our value proposition and some of the new innovations that we put into the marketplace  be it the patient insurance program  be it Health Connect 360  etc  Put a circle around it  in aggregate  think about the size of the book moving or up to move about    from a normal standpoint As it relates to Medicare Advantage  pleased that you re calling out the fact that we re a bit ahead of the market we put down before  Remind you  we said 10  to 15  on average over time  We said in our first year  we would expect it to be at the lower end of the range as we re stepping into that new result  There s no one driver of what moved us to the 13  to 16   I would call out a bit higher retention  so what we had initially put into our projection  Our retention is even higher  We love that  And as I noted in my prepared remarks  we re sitting at an NPS right now just in excess of 70 across the aggregate book of business that we have and the vast majority of our customers in this space are in value based arrangements  So I wouldn t call out anything else  Our existing platforms drove the majority of it  Our new markets contributed  and we had a bit higher retention rate Ricky Goldwasser    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens  Your line is open  sir Scott Fidel    AnalystHi guys  Good morning  A question just on hospital volumes  And there s been a little bit of debate on whether those have been picking up or not over the course of the year  And just interested from your perspective across both the Commercial and Medicare books  what you saw in terms of hospital volumes in the fourth quarter and how those trended relative to your expectations Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerScott  it s Eric  Overall  nothing that I would call out as particularly notable  We finished the year with a trend of about 4   which is right in the middle of our expectations  Again  nothing that I would call out as a particular change in trajectory in either the Commercial or in the Government business Scott Fidel    AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays  Your line is open  sir Steven Valiquette    AnalystAll right  Great  Thanks  Good morning  Dave and Eric  Thanks for taking my question  So I have two just somewhat interrelated questions on pharmacy  I guess  first  are you able to provide a little more color on your drug procurement strategy going forward for the PBM mail order operations  There s been some conjecture you may be changing one of your buying group relationships  I m not sure if you be able to comment on that or not  And then secondarily  in pharmacy  for the 3 5  to 4 5  commercial medical cost trend that you re expecting for 2020  are you able to discuss whether this includes any incremental pharmacy savings and maybe a lower pharmacy trend this year versus prior years  which obviously may be tied to further integration David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerIt s David  I ll take the first question  I ll ask Eric to take the second question  We don t get into individual actions we re taking relative to our supply chain and procurement strategy  I would just step back and say we have a broad portfolio of tools  solutions and capabilities and we re going to continue to dynamically manage those to get the best possible value for existing and prospective customers and clients going forward  Beyond that  we re not going to comment on any individual actions we re taking in the supply chain activity  Eric  I ll ask you to comment on the trend Eric Palmer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Steve  on the trend piece  we ve had pharmacy trend in that low  to mid single digits range for some time now  I mean  that would be the expectation we d have going into 2020 as well  Just to remind you  gosh  Express Scripts delivered in 2018 a 0 4  commercial trend  We ll be publishing our Express Scripts client  our drug trend report later this month and expect another really attractive result there  but typically  nothing else I would call out OperatorThank you for your question  Our last question will be from Charles Rhyee with Cowen  Your line is open Charles Rhyee    AnalystYes  Hi  thanks for squeezing me in here  Maybe I can ask about the    if you look at the chart here in your presentation  and obviously  over the last 10 years  you ve really driven your medical cost trend down and you re guiding here 3 5  to 4 5   If I m not mistaken  that s sort of the same range you gave last year  I know you ve talked about trying to get toward CPI  Anything in the short term that might be keeping you in this range  Can you talk about what are the factors that you re seeing that s going to help you to get lower from here  And sort of how should we think about the pacing of that David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerCharles  first  to your point  we re delighted with the fact that we have seven years now and going into a plus in terms of delivering the lowest medical cost trend in the industry  And our clients and customers benefit from that immediately  especially given the profile of our business  highly ASO oriented from that standpoint  and we ll continue to drive exceptional value for our clients and customers  Two  I appreciate you calling out the CPI level goal and objective  A couple of years ago  we put forward the strategic objective which said we strive to deliver a level of medical cost trend approximating CPI by 2021  We view that as indicative of a sustainable trend that the system and society could tally and manage on a go forward basis and indicative of a responsible trend I would note that today  we feel like we re well on our way to that journey  and I would underscore that with the fact that many of our clients today  we have established relationships with us and are leveraging our most advanced consumer engagement  health improvement and value based relationships  are benefiting from CPI or a better trend from that standpoint  So there s a toolkit we have that we ll continue to innovate and evolve around how do we get engagement in support of the consumer in their life journey  how do we evolve the precision and speed of the health improvement programs  especially as we continue to expand in the whole personal health arena on an accelerated basis with our market leading behavioral health and pharmacy capabilities and then just further deepening the activation of and value based care delivery platforms that we have in the marketplace  And we re already able to deliver  as I indicated  CPI or better for many of our clients  So we re going to see further expand that in 2020 and beyond  I appreciate your question OperatorThank you for your question  I will now turn the conference over to David Cordani for closing remarks David Cordani    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  To wrap up  I d like to highlight just some    a few key points from today s conversation  First  to

147065,368581,CI,Here s Why You Should Add BioDelivery Stock To Your Portfolio,opinion,"BioDelivery Sciences International  Inc    NASDAQ BDSI   is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments in the areas of pain management and drug addiction  The company s portfolio consists of three marketed products   Bunavail  buprenorphine naloxone buccal film   opioid dependence   Symproic  opioid induced constipation  and Belbuca  buprenorphine HCl buccal film   chronic pain   Belbuca is the major revenue generator for the company 
Here we discuss five reasons why adding BioDelivery stock to one s portfolio may prove to be beneficial in 2020 
Favorable Share Price Movement  Strong performance of BioDelivery s marketed drugs has enabled the company to outperform the   Shares of the company have rallied 56 2  in the past six months compared with the industry s growth of 6 7  

 
Strong Performance of Belbuca  The drug generated  69 3 million in sales in the first nine months of 2019  representing a year over year growth of almost 130   Moreover  sales of the drug grew sequentially in the last three reported quarters  The company expects the growth momentum to get reflected in the fourth quarter results 
It expects full year sales for the drug to be at the upper end of  105  110 million  suggesting an increase of more than 139  from 2018  Sales growth is also expected to continue in 2020 as well 
The sales growth can be attributed to the company s efforts to increase accessibility to Belbuca for covered patients in the United States  The company has several commercial agreements with Medicare insurers in the country  including Cigna Corp    NYSE CI    and has brought more than 165 million patients under coverage for Belbuca  Notably  it re acquired all rights to the drug from Endo International   NASDAQ ENDP   in 2017 
Acquisition of Constipation Drug Symproic  In April 2019  BioDelivery acquired U S  commercial rights to Symproic from Japan based Shionogi  The drug is approved as treatment for opioid induced constipation in adult patients with chronic non cancer pain  The acquisition seems encouraging as the drug has demonstrated rapid growth 
During the third quarter of 2019  total Symproic prescriptions were 15 686  an all time high  and represented more than 39  growth from the prior year period  The company expects Symproic to generate sales of  7  9 million in 2019  The company is also focusing on placing the drug on preferred formulary position of pharmacy benefit managers 
It has brought more than 40 million commercially covered lives with expanded access to the drug so far  These efforts should drive sales higher in the coming quarters 
Encouraging Guidance for 2020  BioDelivery expects total sales for 2020 to be between  165 million and  175 million  This indicates nearly 60  growth at mid point compared to full year sales expectation for 2019  primarily driven by Belbuca  The company expects 2020 sales for the drug to be in the range of  150  160 million 
Rising Estimates  BioDelivery s earnings estimates for 2020 have increased 7 1  in the past 90 days  In fact  the company came up with impressive earnings performances and exceeded expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  It recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 159 38  
Conclusion
Belbuca and Symproic are likely to be key drivers for the company s top line going forward  However  we note that performance of BioDelivery s third marketed drug  Bunavail  has been lackluster  The drug is facing significant competition from generics of London based Indivior s opioid treatment drug  Suboxone  Moreover  Belbuca also targets a highly genericized  crowded and competitive market and faces competition from Butrans and opioid drug abuse deterrent formulations  which include Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Embeda 
Nevertheless  BioDelivery sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and looks like a good investment now  You can see  BioDelivery Sciences International  Inc  Price

147066,368582,CI,Cigna  CI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Cigna  CI  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  70 3  
Revenues are expected to be  35 30 billion  up 156 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 03  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cigna 
For Cigna  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 31  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cigna will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cigna would post earnings of  4 37 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 54  delivering a surprise of  3 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cigna doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cigna-ci-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200503260,200503260

147076,368592,CI,Is Cigna s Stock a Buy ,news,"Healthcare provider Cigna  NYSE CI  was having a lackluster 2019 until the past three months  since then  its stock has been soaring more than 35   soundly outperforming the S P 500 s 11  returns over that time  At a market cap of  76 billion and trading near its 52 week high  the stock s seen lots of bullishness of late  but whether it can continue that into 2020 is by no means a sure thing 
Let s take a close look at what it s been up to as well as the risks the company is facing to determine whether the stock is a good investment today 
The Express Scripts merger is paying off
Cigna s stock began soaring in October after hovering around its 52 week low  An attractive buy  it became even hotter when the company released its third quarter results at the end of the month  which benefited from the acquisition of Express Scripts  In December 2018  Cigna finalized its purchase of Express Scripts  valued at  54 billion in a cash and stock deal for the pharmacy benefits manager  the deal has proven to be worth it thus far  

In Q3  Cigna s sales of  38 6 billion increased 237  from the prior year quarter  when the company recorded just  11 5 billion in revenue  The increase comes primarily from pharmacy revenue  which is due to the merger with Express Scripts  A year ago  Cigna recorded just  747 million in pharmacy sales for Q3  but this past quarter that number s soared to  26 billion  It s now the company s largest segment and accounted for more than two thirds of Cigna s top line  The results trickled down to the bottom line as well  with Cigna s net income nearly doubling from  774 million in the prior year quarter to  1 4 billion in Q3 2019 
The company beat expectations and also raised its forecast for adjusted earnings for 2019  bumping up its projections from a range of  16 60 to  16 90 per share up to  16 80  17  The company also expects earnings per share to rise from 10  to 13  in 2020  which is also the annual goal the company has  over the long term   
Healthcare uncertainty could weigh on the stock
One of the risks for healthcare stocks as a whole is the potential that greater transparency in the industry could put more scrutiny on insurers and hospitals  leading to lower prices  President Trump signed an executive order in November relating to the secrecy that exists in the industry  stating that  We believe the American people have a right to know the price of services before they go to visit the doctor   
The new law would allow patients to see the rates that hospitals and insurers have negotiated  It would give patients the ability to shop around before going to a particular hospital  which could impact the revenue that healthcare providers like Cigna are able to generate  While the law may not come into effect until 2021 and will likely face opposition along the way  it s a risk that investors need to be aware of  Healthcare could become a key issue in the upcoming federal election  with a particular focus being on bringing down costs  That could have an adverse impact on Cigna being able to meet its long term growth targets 
Why Cigna is a good buy despite the risks ahead
Although there is uncertainty ahead for the industry  Cigna remains a solid healthcare stock for investors to add to their portfolios  With Express Scripts having such a positive contribution to the company s results thus far  there s plenty of reason to be optimistic  Although Cigna is trading near its high  at just 16 times earnings and 1 7 times book value  the stock is a good value buy  a low PEG ratio of 0 91 confirms that 
Management s strong outlook for the future should give investors plenty of hope that the stock can continue building on its recent results and that its value will continue to climb  That growth and a reasonable valuation make Cigna a good stock to buy today ",2020-01-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdk05,2052415

147102,368618,CI,White House kills rule aimed at ending Medicare drug rebates,news,"By Caroline Humer and Bryan Pietsch NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration on Thursday scrapped one of its most ambitious proposals for lowering prescription medicine prices  backing down from a policy aimed at health insurers and raising the possibility of new measures focused on drugmakers   The abandoned proposal would have required health insurers to pass billions of dollars in rebates they receive from drugmakers to Medicare patients  The decision represents a new setback to U S  President Donald Trump s efforts to deliver on a pledge to lower drug prices for consumers before the November  2020 election  when Republicans want to capitalize on voter concern over high healthcare costs   It allows companies like  Cigna Corp   NYSE CI  and CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS   which negotiate rebates with drugmakers on behalf of the government s Medicare program  to continue to benefit from those discounts   Shares of Cigna rose 9   CVS gained 5  and UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  was up 6    Pharmaceutical company shares fell  with Merck   Co off 4   Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  Co down 3  and  Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE  off 2   Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said Trump was likely refocusing his reform efforts on the pharmaceutical companies themselves   There are still many headwinds for the supply chain  but    pharma and biotech seem to have drawn the ire of the administration more recently   said Coldwell  noting the industry s successful legal challenge of a rule that would have required drugmakers to include list prices in TV ads for their medicines   Shelving the rebate reform initiative  which pharma strongly supported  feels like payback   Coldwell added  The White House first floated the idea of ending the rebates last year as part of a drug pricing  blueprint  aimed at bringing down costs  Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have also seized on drug pricing as a key issue for the 2020 elections  Legislators  including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  are pushing for new laws to allow the government to negotiate drug prices directly with manufacturers   A senior administration official  speaking on the condition of anonymity  said the rule was too costly and could have hurt chances for bipartisan legislation   The decision was made that    it was not prudent to go forward with the rule right now  that it would be too disruptive  that the risk was probably too high  and that it might upset a legislative deal  which is our primary focus   he said  The rebate rule would have forced companies like Cigna and CVS either to forgo the discounts or pass them onto Medicare patients enrolled in their health insurance plans and drug plans  They argued that such a change would force them to raise monthly premiums and had been pressing the administration to consider its impact on Medicare  which includes people aged 65 and older and the disabled  and instead focus on drugmakers   Only drug manufacturers have the power to set drug prices  We believe that the key to lowering drug costs is to enact policies that encourage greater competition   JC Scott  chief executive of industry lobbyist Pharmaceutical Care Management Association  said in a statement  PhRMA  the main pharmaceutical industry lobby group  disagreed  saying in a statement that the move ended the only government proposal that would have provided immediate savings at the pharmacy counter for patients   UNINTENDED WINDFALL PROFITS  FOR DRUGMAKERS  The Trump administration is considering a proposed rule that aims to bring some U S  drug prices in the Medicare program in line with lower prices paid by other countries  U S  Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Thursday that Americans overpay for medicines  subsidizing socialist European systems  Most European countries pay for citizens  healthcare and directly negotiate drug prices  Azar also said that he and Trump are working on allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from other countries  a move Trump has endorsed but which drugmakers have long opposed  The rebate rule was estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to cost the government  177 billion over the next 10 years  The CBO also said it was likely drugmakers would not cut their prices because of the rule  The government had hoped that by eliminating rebates of 15 percent to 30 percent  or more  of a drug s listed price  the prices would fall  JP Morgan analyst Gary Taylor said in a note that political momentum had been building against the rebate rule  due to the perceived unintended windfall profits that might have accrued to pharmaceutical manufacturers    Politico first reported the planned scrapping of the rebate rule on Thursday and the White House confirmed the decision to Reuters    Based on careful analysis and thorough consideration  the President has decided to withdraw the rebate rule   White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an emailed statement  
In recent weeks  Politico and other publications reported that the White House and Azar had disagreed over the rule  Azar said on Thursday that he planned to stay in his job as long as Trump wanted him there ",2019-07-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/white-house-kills-rule-aimed-at-ending-medicare-drug-rebates-1920965,1920965
147106,368622,CI,Is Cigna Corporation  CI  A Solid Value Investor Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cigna Corporation   NYSE CI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cigna Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 18  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cigna Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 70 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 37  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Cigna Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 04  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Cigna Corporation s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value  focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cigna Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 59  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 37 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cigna Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cigna Corporation a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Cigna Corporation is just 1 03  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 18  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  CI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cigna Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of F  This gives CI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at the best  The current year has seen 12 upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to no downward revisions  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen three upward revision compared to eight downward revisions in the same time period The current year consensus estimate increased 0 95  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate fell 0 43   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cigna Corporation Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCigna Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 34  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2019-11-26,Zacks Investment

147117,368633,CI,The obscure advisory committees at the heart of the U S  drug pricing debate,news,"By Caroline Humer CHICAGO  Reuters    Expectations were high last year for three new migraine drugs hitting the market from  Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN   Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  and Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA    Priced around  7 000 each  the drugmakers called them  breakthrough  treatments designed to prevent migraines when taken year round  and estimated that millions of patients could benefit  The U S  Food   Drug Administration said Amgen s Aimovig   the first of the three drugs approved   was an  important addition  to available treatments  But a small group of external medical experts who quietly advise U S  health insurers on new drugs was not impressed  according to a private meeting held at UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  Group s OptumRx offices in Chicago that was attended by Reuters   They concluded that all three medicines offered no clear benefit over drugs already on the market and that insurers could consider them optional when it came to health coverage  They advised putting limits into place on their use   While these experts do not discuss drug costs  their view of the clinical value of the new migraine drugs emboldened OptumRx  which manages prescription drug benefits  to demand steep discounts from the three manufacturers  Similar  pharmacy and therapeutics   P T  committees at rivals CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  and Cigna  NYSE CI  Inc s Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  came to the same conclusion   The impact of their rulings will be on display on Tuesday  when Amgen  which co markets the drug with Novartis AG  and Lilly report on their quarterly financial performance   When asked by Reuters about the OptumRx committee decision  the three drugmakers said the new therapies represent an important advance to patients who are not helped by existing treatments  or who have struggled to stay on their medications  They stress that for some patients  the new migraine drugs cut by half the number of days they experience headaches each month   These relatively unknown expert committees have been involved in drug coverage decisions for decades  Their identities are kept secret due to federal regulations aimed at preventing pharmaceutical industry interference  The committees make their decisions based on a drug s clinical value  independent of cost  pharmacy benefit managers say  But their power has grown more recently with the consolidation of most of the U S  pharmacy benefits business under OptumRx  CVS and Express Scripts  Taken together  their three advisory committees now guide drug coverage for more than 90 million Americans   P T committees also hold sway over record numbers of novel and expensive medicines introduced into the U S  market each year  more often with less evidence of effectiveness or safety than in the past   New drugs that may fall under their scrutiny in the next year include potentially life saving therapies for spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as oral treatments for migraine  diabetes and multiple sclerosis   Their decisions have new consequences as the pharmacy benefits companies they advise are more likely to exclude a new treatment from coverage if it is deemed on par with existing therapies  Or they can demand discounts   or rebates   from drugmakers in exchange for the coverage    If the committee says  a treatment  is no better than the existing drug  there is a very decent possibility that it might get a less preferred status or not be included  for reimbursement  said Jack Hoadley  a health policy expert at Georgetown University   OptumRx s ability to call the shots on drug coverage for more than 30 million people make it a formidable negotiator for clients like Ben Johnson  a pharmacy director for a health plan in Utah that covers about 20 000 railroad union workers  Johnson once relied on his own P T committee to determine whether a drug was effective and worth the price   Now he is often among the dozens of OptumRx clients and consultants invited to observe the quarterly P T committee meetings in Chicago  Handing that role to OptumRx has tripled the value of rebates that his plan receives  Johnson said   FROM  BREAKTHROUGH  TO  OPTIONAL   Drugmakers say pharmacy benefit managers such as OptumRx are middlemen that take too great a cut of the discounts they negotiate and ultimately drive prices higher   U S  Congress and President Donald Trump have taken up that criticism  and the administration has proposed banning rebates in government health programs unless benefits managers hand over the savings to patients   OptumRx  Express Scripts and CVS say that their method of reviewing a drug s benefit and subsequent price negotiations has lowered prescription drug costs  and that 95 to 98 percent of the discounts they receive are passed on to their clients   In the case of the migraine drugs  Amgen  Lilly and Teva were quick to advertise the potential benefits directly to U S  consumers once they were approved  months before the pharmacy benefits companies made decisions on how to cover the drugs   Television commercials from the drugmakers highlighted how some patients had their headache days cut in half  or more  The manufacturers offered the drugs to commercially insured migraine sufferers for free for up to a year or even longer to entice people to try them  Their primary competition is older  cheaper generic drugs  Migraines affect more than 39 million Americans  mostly women  and Amgen estimated 8 million could be candidates for the preventative therapies  which are delivered by injection every month or few months  Analysts forecast  4 billion in annual sales by 2026 in major global markets   OptumRx convened its advisory committee of a dozen doctors and pharmacists last November to review the new migraine drugs  These experts pointed to clinical trial data showing that patients taking the new drugs experienced an average of 1 to 2 5 fewer migraine days a month than those treated with a placebo  and said that was on par with existing therapies  though there were no clinical studies directly comparing the two groups of medicines   The committee acknowledged that some patients saw a much bigger benefit from the new drugs  but said the data did not show who might be helped the most  They questioned the limited safety data and the unknown long term effects on the body    Let s be cautious and see how it all plays out  but we need to look at these studies with a jaundiced eye   one of the members said  The committee s verdict  All three drugs should be considered  optional  treatments that provide no unique benefit  OptumRx Chief Medical Officer Sumit Dutta said the decision  based on available clinical data  provided balance to the drugmakers  claims    There are plenty of examples of drugs that have a lot of enthusiasm in the beginning   but that later turned out to be problematic  Dutta said   Because OptumRx could choose not to cover any of the new migraine drugs  it could push aggressively for discounts  On February 1  it began to cover Amgen s Aimovig and Lilly s Emgality  Teva s Ajovy would only be covered if patients did not benefit from the other two drugs   Leerink biotech analyst Ami Fadia estimates manufacturer rebates on the drugs are as high as 50 percent   Amgen said 200 000 U S  patients have been prescribed Aimovig  with about half of prescriptions being filled for free  Teva and Lilly have not provided figures on patient use  Teva said in February it expects 2019 sales for Ajovy of  150 million

While recent earnings history doesn t bode particularly well for the security  Cigna  NYSE CI  has done well in November  historically speaking  The equity just showed up as one of the  next month  per data from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  boasting a 90  positive return rate over the past 10 years  and averaging a 4 6  monthly pop

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 89   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health insurer would post earnings of  3 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 30  delivering a surprise of 15 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Cigna  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  posted revenues of  35 83 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 08   This compares to year ago revenues of  11 45 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters

Cigna shares have lost about 7 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 5  
What s Next for Cigna 
While Cigna has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cigna was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

147157,368673,CI,Bill Gross Is a Cautionary Tale for Any Future Bond Kings,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Six months ago  I asked if  it s worth stepping back to wonder whether we re witnessing the end of the line  for Bill Gross  There s no need to wonder any longer 
Gross is retiring from Janus Henderson Group Plc  the firm announced Monday  more than four years after leaving his perch atop the bond market world at Pacific Investment Management Co  His stint running the Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund should serve as a cautionary tale for fixed income investors who think they re smarter than the rest of the market 
The issue that plagued Gross was that he was too unconstrained for his own good at Janus  His fund topped out at about  2 2 billion of assets   not an insignificant sum  but a far cry from the almost  300 billion that he ran at Pimco  That huge pool of money meant he was the market  which explains why bond traders used to hang on his every word  Being the world s largest mutual fund also restrained his investing because by and large there wasn t enough for him to buy aside from the more traditional fixed income securities 
During his time at Janus  however  he was nimble enough to invest like a hedge fund manager  He made a big bet on the convergence of U S  and German 10 year yields at precisely the wrong time  with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates while the European Central Bank remained on hold  The effective duration of his fund somehow fell to minus 4 58 years at one point  even though the prospectus on Janus s website says the  fund s average portfolio duration may range from negative 4 years to plus 6 years   What s more  it went against what Gross was saying publicly   that the bond bear market would be  relatively mild   hardly an environment to take a big bet on rising rates  Most recently  he appeared to employ a  merger arbitrage  strategy  a long position in shares of Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  Holding Co  and a short position in those of  Cigna Corp   NYSE CI  
This experiment didn t end well for Gross or for those who entrusted their money with him   The unconstrained strategy Mr  Gross manages has underperformed its three month Libor benchmark since Mr  Gross joined Janus Henderson in late 2014   according to the press release announcing his retirement  Just over the past year  the fund fell 4 86 percent  It gained 2 43 percent in 2017 and 5 26 percent in 2016  which trailed its peer group  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  In 2015  when the fund fell 0 43 percent  it did better than its counterparts 
Gross  for his part  seems to understand that he may have miscalculated with his unconstrained fund  
 Maybe I should have stuck to total return and been a little more constrained   he said in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television  He said he managed some total return accounts at Janus and they outperformed  like the old days  
Gross said that the idea of total return investing  in his mind  was  based on measured risk taking   He didn t heed that advice  and that was his downfall  He seemed contemplative during the interview with Keene  comparing his big bet on Treasuries versus bunds in terms of blackjack  saying he put too many chips on the table with that trade  Of course  Gross was briefly a blackjack success in Las Vegas   turning  200 into  10 000 over four months  raising the tuition for his MBA at UCLA   which only added to his mystique as a bond savant  
By now  it should be clear that there is no such thing  Not when a fund manager is able to  go anywhere   unshackled by any sorts of guidelines or parameters  Gross learned that the hard way  After all  much of his own money was at stake  Anyone else who wants to stake their reputation on running an unconstrained strategy   or investing in one   should do so at their own risk ",2019-02-04,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bill-gross-is-a-cautionary-tale-for-any-future-bond-kings-1768500,1768500

147166,368682,CI,Can Cigna  CI  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Cigna  CI   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this health insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 9 78   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Cigna was expected to post earnings of  3 73 per share  but it reported  4 30 per share instead  representing a surprise of 15 28   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 74 per share  while it actually produced  3 90 per share  a surprise of 4 28  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Cigna  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cigna has an Earnings ESP of  2 20  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-cigna-ci-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200470745,200470745

Valuation is also important  so investors should note that CI has a Forward P E ratio of 8 86 right now  This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 10 42 
Investors should also note that CI has a PEG ratio of 0 76 right now  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Insurance   Multi line was holding an average PEG ratio of 1 16 at yesterday s closing price

Increased visibility for business growth in the second half of 2019 have supported the stock price gain of 7 8  compared with the  s decline of 5 4   In 2018  the stock slid 41  due to its disappointing performance 

 
During June 2018  sources reported that Magellan Health was mulling its possible sale to private equity firm Centerbridge Partners  after it came under pressure  due to its prolonged underperformance  from activist hedge fund Starboard Value  which owned nearly 10  stake in the company 
The second quarter earnings provide a clearer visibility into second half earnings performance  Though the company anticipates year over year decline in top line for 2019  it expects new business wins and lower costs to support overall results 
Magellan Health expects earnings growth in the Pharmacy Management segment  which contributed nearly 40  of total revenues in 2018  This should be driven on the back of improvement in cost of goods sold  addition of a new business in 2019  and a normal seasonality in the fourth quarter 
Also  Healthcare segment  which made up nearly 60  of the company s revenues in 2018  should see higher earnings from the normalization of utilization and finalization of New York reimbursement rates 
The sale of Magellan Health has become deadlocked  Thus  it is focusing on business growth 
Magellan Health carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked players in the same space are Molina Healthcare    NYSE MOH    UnitedHealthcare Group  Inc    NYSE UNH   and Cigna Corp    NYSE CI    Each of these stocks carries a zacks rank  2  Buy  You can see

147190,368706,CI,Cigna  CI  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Cigna  CI   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cigna is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Cigna imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cigna
This health insurer is expected to earn  16 77 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 17 9  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cigna  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Cigna to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-09-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cigna-ci-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200468351,200468351

147215,368731,CI,Buy CVS Health  CVS  Ahead Of Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"CVS Health   NYSE CVS   will be reporting their second quarter performance before the opening bell on Wednesday  The company hasn t been able to stay in the green this year  down 17 9  year to date  Furthermore  the broader retail drug stores market has struggled as a whole this year  down 20 7  
The company is coming off earnings and revenue beats in Q1 and is looking to repeat this in Q2  The ongoing issue of Medicare For All has made the pharmacy and drug market volatile in recent months  Can CVS kickstart its second half of 2019 with a strong Q2 report  Let s see how Zacks estimates have the company performing in Q2 
Overview and Q1 Performance 
The company is based out of Woonsocket  Rhode Island  and changed its name to CVS Health from CVS Caremark to better reflect its health commitment  In November 2018  CVS Health acquired insurance giant Aetna  NYSE AET  for  70 billion  The company reports in four segments  Pharmacy Services  Retail LTC  Health Care Benefits  and Corporate Other  The company s pharmacy services segment provides pharmacy benefit mangers  PBM  solutions  The company recently benefited from the Trump administration s decision to withdraw its proposal to eliminate rebates from government drug plans  The plan would have effectively lowered the prices of drugs for consumers by hindering the profits of PBM 
In Q1  CVS Health brought in  61 6 billion in revenue and reported earnings of  1 62 per share  beatings estimates by 8  and 1 9   respectively  In addition  the reported bottom line was a jump of 9 5  and the top line was a surge of 34 8   Net income was  1 43 billion for a 42 99  gain from Q1 2018  The company s pharmacy services segment jumped 3 11  to  33 56 billion while the retail LTC segment generated  21 1 billion for a jump of 3 3   The health care benefits segment reported  17 87 billion in Q1 which was primarily driven by the Aetna acquisition 
Q2 Outlook 
Consensus estimates are calling for CVS to report EPS of  1 70 and total revenue of  62 61 billion for a jump of 0 59  and 34 05   respectively  Key Company Metric estimates are forecasting pharmacy services to post  34 18 billion in revenue for a 2 79  jump  The retail LTC segment is predicted to gain 2 77  to  21 24 billion  The pharmacy network that is within the pharmacy services segment is projected to jump 5 65  to  21 73 billion  Mail choice  also within pharmacy services  is projected to jump 5 22  to 75 65 million  In the retail segment  prescriptions filled is expected to increase 5 86  to 349 million  The total number of stores is expected to add 45 to the Q1 number  bringing it to 9 945 
CVS Health is highly optimistic about the merger with Aetna  They believe Aetna s analytics and CVS s  touch of humanity  on the health care side provides a platform to better serve consumers  Over the last few quarters  the retail LTC segment registered positive revenue growth after several quarters of sluggish performances  The 3 3  growth in Q1 was driven by continued adoption of patient care programs and collaborations with PBM  The increasing demand for PBM and specialty pharmacy  along with continued growth in the retail segment  will bode well for CVS 
Additionally  PBMs being clear from federal regulation for the moment also sit well for CVS and other companies like Cigna   NYSE CI   and UnitedHealth   NYSE UNH    CVS Health is listed as a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  with a Style Score of A in Value  CVS has historically traded at a discount relative to its industry for the better part of 3 years

Insurance  including The Joint Corp    NASDAQ JYNT    Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM    Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   and UnitedHealth Group  Inc    NYSE UNH   Industry  Health InsuranceLink  The Health Maintenance Organization  HMO  industry comprises entities  either private or public  that take care of the basic and supplemental health services of its subscribers  Companies in this space primarily assume the risks involved and assign premiums for health and medical insurance policies  Industry participants also provide administrative and managed care services for self funded insurance Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers  called in network   which include primary care physicians  clinical facilities  hospitals and specialists  However  out of network exceptions are made in emergencies or when medically necessary  Health insurance plans can be availed by ways such as private purchase  social insurance or social welfare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid  funded by the government Let us take a look at the industry s three major themes      As life expectancy continues to increase in the United States and seniors account for a higher percentage of the total U S  population  overall demand for health insurance for seniors will increase  According to the 2018 U S  Census  between 2010 and 2030  the number of individuals aged 65  is projected to nearly double from 39 million to 73 million  a growth rate nearly 5 times faster than the 17  increase expected for the total population  The census estimates this group to grow from 13  to 21  by 2030   one of the fastest growing within U S  population      The HMO industry is rapidly consolidating with mergers and acquisitions  The most common takeovers in recent years have been in the nature of horizontal expansion in the areas of Medicare and Medicaid as the players seek to garner a greater share of the attractive MA market  Lately  however  the companies have shown interest in expanding vertically and add capabilities to its supply chain through mergers and acquisitions  The mega mergers of Aetna  NYSE AET  with CVS Health Corp   NYSE CVS  and Cigna Corp   NYSE CI  with Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  are the best examples of inter industry deals that led to the union of a health insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager      The industry has also witnessed development in ancillary business to diversify revenue sources in the wake of tough regulations laid  via the ACA  on health insurance business   These businesses  mostly in the form of health care services  are growing rapidly  opening up new avenues of growth and forming an increased proportion of the industry s total revenues  Health services business is an important growth area for HMOs as these provide unregulated cash flows and enable players to become comprehensive healthcare providers  Ample opportunities of growth exist in the health service business and continued investments are being made in this area  A poster child for the same is UnitedHealth s Optum  which provides a range of healthcare related services Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the

147231,368747,CI,Stocks Rise On Fed Hopes   But Likely Due For A Breather ,opinion,"Summary 

The S P 500  SPX  rose 18 points last week to 3013  an increase of 0 6  
Our projection is for the S P 500 to chop around this week  and then move lower as the current short term market cycle moves in to a small corrective period 

The stock market continued its upward drive last week  as investors remained jubilant about a new round of easing by the Federal Reserve  as I pointed out in the latest Market Week show 
During the previous week   good news was bad news   as hopes rate cut were dashed by strong payroll data  But Fed Chair Jerome Powell flipped this around in his testimony to Congress  He continued to voice concerns about weakness in the world economy and trade relations  ultimately hinting at the possibility of new rate cuts 
S P 500  SPX  Daily Chart 
Our approach to technical analysis uses market cycles to project price action  Our analysis of the S P 500 is for choppy price action that may rise as high as 3032 but is likely to slip lower with the dominant larger cycle  Our short term support zone is between 2950 and 2971 
Let s also take a look at an individual stock that moved significantly last week  Cigna  NYSE CI  rose by 9 6  to over  179  This occurred after the Trump administration let go of its plan to cancel rebates related to Medicare and Medicaid 
Cigna  CI  Stock Weekly Chart 
Based on its market cycles  CI is either still in the rising phase of its current minor cycle  or has already started the rising phase of its next minor cycle  In either case  the stock is now in a Fibonacci resistance zone  Having just made a new low in April  and showing weak technical patterns  we are not optimistic about the intermediate term future of Cigna or the HMO group

147233,368749,CI,Analysts Estimate Cigna  CI  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Cigna  CI  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 1  
Revenues are expected to be  33 39 billion  up 190 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 03  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cigna 
For Cigna  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cigna will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cigna would post earnings of  3 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 90  delivering a surprise of  4 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cigna doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-cigna-ci-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200445072,200445072

147268,368784,CI,Is Cigna  CI  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  we focus on our proven ranking system  which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  to find winning stocks  But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies  so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong companies for our readers 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One company to watch right now is Cigna  CI   CI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with P E ratio of 9 38 right now  For comparison  its industry sports an average P E of 9 56  CI s Forward P E has been as high as 14 12 and as low as 8 44  with a median of 11 53  all within the past year 
We also note that CI holds a PEG ratio of 0 77  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  CI s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 1 04  Over the past 52 weeks  CI s PEG has been as high as 1 16 and as low as 0 69  with a median of 0 93 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is CI s P B ratio of 1 47  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  CI s current P B looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 54  Over the past year  CI s P B has been as high as 3 52 and as low as 1 30  with a median of 1 85 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  CI has a P S ratio of 0 82  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 07 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Cigna s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that CI is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-07-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-cigna-ci-stock-undervalued-right-now-200437696,200437696

147271,368787,CI,Drug Pricing Woes Linger On Repealing Drug Rebate Proposal,opinion,Major pharma industry players were in the red on Jul 11 following the scrapping of the Trump administration s proposal to eliminate rebates offered by the drug companies to pharmacy benefits managers  PBMs   The proposal was part of the government s efforts to control drug pricing PBMs act as intermediaries to negotiate with drugmakers for rebates on the listed price of their branded drugs to lower the costs on behalf of small buyers and insurers  PBMs retain a percentage of the rebate offered and sell drugs to the buyers insurers  However  these rebates and discounts were rarely passed down to the buyers aka pharmacies  The proposal stated that drugmakers will instead pay a certain fee to PBMs in return for placing the drugs on co pay or medicare beneficiary list and the rebates will be directly delivered to buyers pharmacies Following the Trump regime s decision not to proceed with the proposal for revoking rebates to PBMs  shares of PBM like Cigna Corporation   NYSE CI   rose while those of pharma companies declined  The committees overseeing this proposal remained wary of the fact that it could lead to rise in medicare premiums  The experts also suggested that the implementation of the rule will cost the federal government almost  177 billion over the next decade The proposal to remove rebates offered by drug makers to the PBMs prompted the pharma players to put the onus of skyrocketing drug prices on PBMs  shoulders  However  the Trump administration s announcement to withdraw the proposal has brought the drugmakers in focus again  Moreover  the decision also spurs uncertainty for the pharma industry as the government is hell bent on curbing the exorbitant drug prices  Investors remain skeptical about the next step from the administration and also expect drugmakers to bear the brunt of the same  This misgiving has caused the large pharma shares to crash down with Merck   NYSE MRK    Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY    Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY   and Pfizer   NYSE PFE   stocks registering a dip of 3 4  on Jul 11 Drug pricing controversy has plagued the industry since the last presidential campaign  Time and again  Trump has criticized drugmakers for escalating drug prices ever since he assumed office  He remains committed to take on the industry bigwigs on pricing issue and the opposition  Democrats  also supported this cause  making the situation more challenging for the pharma industry In 2018  several large pharma companies deferred their plans to increase the drug prices or decreased the same amid a strong opposition from the government  Earlier this year  senators grilled the respective management of these companies over the drug pricing issue and blamed the American patent system for perking up the prices by almost monopolizing the markets for drugs Notably  the Trump administration is planning an executive order   favorable nations clause   which will restrict drugmakers to charge the lowest price for a drug in any global market  If passed  the burden will be on the pharma companies to suffer the loss due to price decline  which will likely dent the industry s profits Meanwhile  a judge in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia  in favour of the pharma companies related to the disclosure of wholesale prices of the drugs in television advertising by the drugmakers  The federal court ordained that the pharma companies are not required to reveal the price tags in television adverts Every government has vowed to keep the drug prices under control  However  there has been little progress  As a matter of fact  drug prices have been touching staggering levels over the past decade  piling up pressure on patients in the United States with rising healthcare costs  Moreover  it is argued that PBMs prefer branded drugs over the generic versions due to better margins  which can induce high costs for customers  Meanwhile  the pharma companies argue that the high costs of drugs reflect high cost of research and development We expect the tussle between pharma companies and the government over drug pricing issue to persist in 2019  This raises volatility for the whole pharma biotech drug market While Merck has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Bristol Myers  Pfizer and Lilly carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/drug-pricing-woes-linger-on-repealing-drug-rebate-proposal-200439377,200439377

pressing them to forego the usual strategy of setting a high U S  list price  then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates  It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don t work within a defined timeframe  The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers  PBMs  bring prices down  and deflect growing criticism of their role as  middlemen  in the drug supply chain   The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter  Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co payments  making them responsible for more of their medical costs  Express Scripts is advising drugmakers to take that shift into account as they launch a new class of migraine drugs   If your expectation is that you are not going to actually get that high list price  then don t do that to patients who have high co pays   Chief Medical

Express Scripts is also pushing Amgen and its peers to refund two thirds of the cost of a migraine drug if a patient stops treatment within 90 days because it didn t work or caused major side effects   Such guarantees are becoming more prevalent for older drugs with competing products on the market  including diabetes and hepatitis C therapies  It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy  Amgen  which will market Aimovig in partnership with Novartis  declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts  Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model   Their demands for ever larger rebates has forced manufacturers to use higher list prices as a benchmark  he said    It is a ridiculous situation that we are in   Harper said   No one is paying the list price  but patients are exposed for a period of time  until they pay off their insurance deductible  TAKING OUT COSTS  Rising U S  healthcare costs  the most expensive worldwide  are straining budgets for families  employers and government agencies  That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs   To that end

 smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs  CVS declined comment   Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug  Officials at Lilly did not respond to a request for comment   The stakes are high for Amgen  which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years   The biotech company s last potential blockbuster  high priced cholesterol treatment Repatha  has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost  100 per year   Repatha and rival Praluent  sold by Sanofi  PA SASY  and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  launched in 2015 at list prices near  14 000 a year and were expected to be billion dollar products  But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death  As a result  Repatha sales totaled  319 million last year  while Praluent had sales of  195 million    If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again  I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money   said Jason Borschow  chief executive officer at Miami based Abarca   Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments  mainly low cost generic drugs  Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients   The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17  The agency s decision on Teva s treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June  but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues  A ruling on Lilly s galcanezumab is expected later in the year

drug  The stakes are high for Amgen  which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years   The biotech company s last potential blockbuster  high priced cholesterol treatment Repatha  has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost  100 per year  Repatha and rival Praluent  sold by Sanofi  PA SASY  and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  O REGN   launched in 2015 at list prices near  14 000 a year and were expected to be billion dollar products  But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death  As a result  Repatha sales totaled  319 million last year  while Praluent had sales of  195 million   If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again  I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money   said Jason Borschow  chief executive officer at Miami based Abarca  Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments  mainly low cost generic drugs  Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients  The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17  The agency s decision on Teva s treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June  but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues  A

147296,368812,CI,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Cigna  CI ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Cigna  CI  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this health insurer a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Cigna is 15 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 16 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 11 6  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Cigna is 31 5   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 10 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of  0 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Cigna have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Cigna a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Cigna is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-cigna-ci-200432831,200432831
147297,368813,CI,What Makes Cigna  CI  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Cigna  CI  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cigna basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Cigna  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cigna
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this health insurer is expected to earn  16 57 per share  which is a change of 16 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cigna  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

What s Next for Cigna 
While Cigna has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

147343,368859,CI,Cigna  CI  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"Cigna  CI  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9  
Revenues are expected to be  33 89 billion  up 196 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cigna 
For Cigna  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Cigna will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cigna would post earnings of  2 53 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 46  delivering a surprise of  2 77  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  3 74 per share  down 9  year over year  on revenues of  33 9 billion  up 197   
Factors Affecting Q1 Results
In the company s Integrated Medical segment  we expect to see rise in commercial customers and expansion of specialty relationships as well as premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends  Membership should increase from growth in the company s select  middle market and government segments 
The company expects rise in membership from global medical customers  strong customer and client retention  growth in the commercial business  as well as in Medicare advantage enrollments  partly offset by an expected enrollment decline in the U S  individual business 
The company s Health Service business should reflect solid performance from its mail order pharmacy operations  support from its integrated value proposition and contributions from the Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  business Contribution from the company s International Markets should bear evidence of solid business growth  continued administrative efficiency  and strategic investments for long term growth 
The company expects the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80 5  to 81 5   indicating continued strong performance of its commercial and government businesses  the impact of the health insurance tax suspension in 2019  as well as changes in business mix   We expect medical care ratio in the first quarter to be around this range We expect to see a year over year increase in interest expenses  due to debt taken  to fund the acquisition of Express Scripts

147360,368876,CI,Bull Of The Day  Centene  CNC ,opinion,Managed care provider Centene  NYSE CNC   CNC  was already in the upper realms of the Zacks Rank after delivering a strong Q4 report and guidance in early February  Analysts responded by raising 2019 revenue estimates to nearly  71 billion for 18  growth and projected EPS of  4 25 for 20  growth  Then we learned on March 27 that the company intends to acquire WellCare  WCG  in a cash and stock deal worth  17 3 billion  So it s time to review the investor and analyst reactions to see if it s still a good time to put money into CNC  Shares had already drifted back below  60 in March  and Wednesday the 27th  deal news came before the open  though Bloomberg got a leak Tuesday night  saw a plunge to  50 on heavy volume of 34 million shares  The transaction is obviously dilutive for CNC shares and thus the drop  Under the terms of the merger agreement  WellCare  WCG  shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 3 38 shares of Centene  CNC  common stock and  120 in cash for each share of WellCare common stock  Based on Centene s closing stock price on March 26  2019  the implied cash and stock consideration to be received by WellCare shareholders is  305 39 per share  The cash and stock consideration represents an approximately 21 0  premium to WellCare shareholders based on the 30 day volume weighted average closing stock price  or VWAP  of WellCare prior to signing and an approximately 32 1  premium based on the closing stock price of WellCare on March 26  2019  Upon completion of the transaction  Centene shareholders will own approximately 71  of the combined entity  with WellCare shareholders owning approximately 29   The good news is that the stock didn t fall further and recovered quickly back to  53 to close the quarter  And since we ve had plenty of positive investor and analyst reaction since the deal announcement  CNC shares have climbed back to  57 58 on good volume  The bad news is that things were looking so good again for new highs in CNC before this deal  as the stock made a strong run back to  68 from the Dec lows at  54  Why Buy WCG  This is obviously part of the company s long term growth strategy to compete with bigger players like UnitedHealth Group  UNH   Cigna  NYSE CI   and Anthem  NYSE ANTM   ANTM  in the vastly complex  9 trillion healthcare sector  On the surface  the new company would have strengths in Medicare Advantage  MA  and Medicaid  both of which are growing markets  As consolidation continues in the industry  so that economies of scale can handle the turbulent waters of healthcare reform  I had thought the sub  25 billion Centene would be an acquisition target for one of the larger players mentioned above   In the short run  investors face plenty of  uncertainty volatility  that could keep shares below  60  As we saw in Bristol Meyers  BMY   74 billion cash and stock bid for Celgene  CELG  this year  BMY shares fell immediately and that day marked the low  with the stock recovering to fill the down gap and then some  By the end of March  we saw CELG pop and BMY fidget as a key shareholder who had been blocking the deal fell in line  This anecdote doesn t  of course  guarantee anything  And classic  merger arbitrage  will be buffeting the shares of both companies until their shareholders  and the regulators  chime in with  yea  or  nay   But so far  so good  Centene Strategy Amidst ACA Turbulence The day before the deal announcement we learned that the DOJ shifted its stance  backing full invalidation of the Affordable Care Act  In a legal filing March 25 with the U S  Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans  the Department of Justice revealed a significant shift in its stance and said it now backs a full invalidation of the Affordable Care Act  The DOJ previously has said there were grounds only to strike down the ACA s consumer protections  So Centene s acquisition of WellCare comes just as the White House and Congress seem to be renewing a long running feud over the Affordable Care Act  While ACA survived a 2017 repeal effort by Republicans  20 conservative leaning states sued last year to have it repealed  saying that changes in tax law invalidated it  This week  the Department of Justice backed the effort for a complete repeal   Of course  Centene and WellCare had to have been planning and negotiating this deal for months prior to the DOJ move  And it might be coincidence they announced the same week  But the spotlight is certainly on them about whether this was the right move for long term growth given the legislative turbulence  In an interview on CNBC s Mad Money on the evening of March 27  Centene CEO Michael Neidorff said  The time was right to buy WellCare    When there is uncertainty  that is the time to act    There are a lot of things that need to be strengthened with the ACA    There is an opportunity to make it more affordable  WellCare acquisition made more sense than I ve seen in a long time   And in formal comments that morning in the press release  here s how he described the deal    This transformational combination creates a leading healthcare enterprise that is committed to helping people live healthier lives through a localized approach and provides access to high quality healthcare through a wide range of affordable health solutions  With the addition of WellCare  we expect to bolster and diversify our product offerings  increase our scale and have access to new markets  which will in turn  enable us to continue investing in technology and better serve members with innovative programs designed to meet their needs  Centene has grown significantly by adding capabilities that have increased revenues and enabled margin expansion  The addition of WellCare is the next logical step in our growth strategy and to drive value for our collective shareholders  We have long admired the WellCare organization and together look forward to building on our mission of transforming the health of our communities  one person at a time  Analyst Reaction to Deal Centene might internalize WellCare PBM business  says Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  Analyst Peter Costa expects Centene to eventually internalize WellCare s pharmacy benefit management  PBM  business  which would likely be another blow to CVS  CVS   WellCare s current PBM  Centene currently has some of its PBM business with CVS and is bringing that business in house to its own internal PBM  while WellCare is planning to rebid its PBM contract this year  He added that this merger would likely mean that contract rebid may not occur and that WellCare would more likely move its estimated  15B  20B in pharmacy spend away from CVS to Centene for 2021  Costa told investors that he does not believe the government would find the overlapping Medicaid markets as problematic from an anti trust point of view  since he believes the government views Medicaid market as a more national market of bidders for state contracts   Stephens   Excellent strategic combination  In a research note before the companies confirmed the deal  based on the early Bloomberg reporting   Stephens analyst Scott Fidel told investors that he would view a Centene WellCare deal as an  excellent strategic combination   While he acknowledged that the transaction could face some political hurdles  the analyst noted that the direct business overlap is  actually less than one might initially suspect   Both companies are in a position of strength as they are each poised to deliver top tier revenue and earnings growth performance in 2019 Fidel concluded  He kept an Overweight rating on both names  Leerink analysts see strong  offensive  play in CNC WCG deal While WCG earnings won t become accretive until year 2 of the merger  some cost synergies will start right away  Leerink analysts attended a reception after the deal was announced with managements from both companies and came away more optimistic about changes in managed care  reiterating their  78 PT    The net upshot for us is that fears that this deal has been inked to offset secular headwinds are unfounded  The combined almost   100 B entity is poised to be a Government powerhouse across Medicare Advantage  Managed Medicaid   Part D  Regulatory risk remains  but unlike MA  the Medicaid plans are price takers and there is no 35  market share ceiling  SunTrust   Powerful combination with opportunity on several fronts  The analysts view the proposed combination as compelling as it further increases scale  expands the Medicaid footprint  accelerates MA growth and provides an attractive opportunity in pharmacy  They noted that  synergies look quite doable  as the deal brings incremental diversification  is expected to be accretive in year 2 and CNC s integration track record provides comfort  They reiterated their Buy rating and  90 PT based on about 21 5X 2019E EPS  Oppenheimer analysts wrote a preliminary note on the morning of March 27 with these thoughts  The deal would expand Centene s leading Medicaid platform and provide a large boost in Medicare Advantage  MA   a business it has targeted  Although the price and equity heavy deal terms represent a hefty premium to Centene s own valuation  the company has done a good job with M A in the past  Since then  the Oppenheimer team has reiterated their Outperform rating and  83 PT  Are any i bank analysts not so enthusiastic about this deal  Yes  Jefferies analysts are far less sanguine  with this title on their report after the deal    CNC for WCG  Strategically Logical  but not Catalytic Jefferies analysts see the logic of the deal in a strong strategic rationale  enhances Medicaid and overall scale  accelerates MA growth agenda  and diversifies HIX exposure   but they see only modest financial benefit  They also think that cost synergies and earnings accretion contemplate divestitures  And regarding the probability of the deal actually getting done  they cite as many as 5 markets likely to be scrutinized by anti trust regulators  The Jefferies analysis of Medicaid market share  focuses on key states where CNC and WCG will have significant share of   30   MO  NE  IL and GA  These are likely to be most problematic since combined share is 60  75  and the states only have 3 4 MCOs in the market  Combined share in IL would be 54   but the market would still have 5 players after the deal closes  Here s how the Jefferies team described the impacts of potential divestitures    If CNC was required to divest the smaller contract in each of those 4 states  they estimate pro forma EPS impact of  15c  lowering year 2 accretion by 2 5 points  FL and NY have many more players  perhaps lowering the divestiture risk in those markets  That said  divesting the smaller contract in FL NY would lower EPS by 11c  Thus  the worst case is 26c of EPS risk across all 6 states  If that happened  the deal would still be accretive by 1 5  in year 2  Another issue is competitive bidders  Other big managed care players may want WCG more than CNC does  Deal  break up  fees increase after May 10  which suggests to the Jefferies team that both parties may be willing to entertain other offers  Bottom line  I remain a buyer of CNC in the low  50s and wait to see where large shareholders  regulators  and potential competitive bidders  stand on the deal  The recent ACA political rumblings are seen by many as mere posturing ahead of the 2020 elections  So the real test of this deal is how compelling it is for an unpredictable landscape  The bias leans toward  size wins  to compete on this bigger  more turbulent field  I should add that I wrote most of this report during the final weekend of March for my subscribers in Healthcare Innovators where we ve been long time CNC shareholders  So it does not include the impacts of April 1 proposals by the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS  in their 2020 Medicare Advantage and Part D Rate Announcement  Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019 In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy

147408,368924,CI,Hundreds of counties at risk for no Obamacare insurer in 2018,news,"By Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    With Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare in disarray  hundreds of U S  counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months  Republican senators failed this week to repeal and replace Obamacare  former President Barack Obama s signature healthcare reform law  creating new uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million Americans will be funded and managed in 2018  In response  Republican President Donald Trump on Friday again suggested that his administration would let the Obamacare program  implode   He has weakened enforcement of the law s requirement for individuals to buy insurance  threatened to cut off funding and sought to change plan benefits through regulations   Anthem Inc   Cigna Corp   NYSE CI   Health Care Service Corp and Molina Healthcare  four of the biggest health insurers selling Obamacare plans  said they are weighing whether to pull out of more markets for 2018 rather than face financial losses  They have until Sept  27 to finalize their plans   So far  40 U S  counties are expected to have no insurer offering individual coverage next year  but that number could rise by the hundreds  according to U S  government data  Kaiser Family Foundation analysis and insurer disclosures  More than 1 300 counties  primarily in 15 states  currently have only one insurer participating in 2018  Anthem and HCSC are the last man standing in one third of those counties and states   putting those areas in particular at risk   Right now the number of counties at immediate risk of having no insurers in 2018 is small  but it could easily grow significantly if a couple major insurers decide to exit   Larry Levitt  health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation  said   Many insurers have been waiting for an answer from Trump or lawmakers on whether they will continue to fund  8 billion in annual government subsidies  Without assurances  many insurers plan to raise rates an additional 20 percent by an Aug  16 deadline for premium prices  Others say that the many unknowns will make the business too risky  The last minute drama has left millions of Americans questioning whether they will have medical coverage next year  Julie Grady  a 59 year old small business owner in Carson City  Nevada  is currently covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nevada  part of Anthem  which has already decided to leave the exchanges in her county and most of the state  Carson City will have no insurer on the exchanges next year       Grady s pays a reduced premium of  70 per month and a deductible under  1 000 for her plan  which is part of the Affordable Care Act  commonly called Obamacare  Grady is looking at being uninsured  as she was before the law       I would have to go without health insurance   she said   I would just stay healthy  hike  eat well  I d be in trouble if something catastrophic happened  I would lose everything              ANTHEM CONSIDERING 2018 PLANS      Anthem  the second largest U S  health insurer  sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states  It has already decided to pull out of most individual markets in Nevada  Ohio  Indiana and Wisconsin in 2018  Earlier this week  Chief Executive Officer Joe Swedish said he was still weighing 2018 participation in its other states     In states like Colorado  Georgia  Kentucky  Missouri  and Virginia  Anthem sells plans in more than 250 counties where it is the only insurer  and they could be left  bare  next year  according to government data       Health Care Services Corp is a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee in five states and is the only Obamacare individual insurer in more than 90 Texas counties  more than 75 Oklahoma counties  and half a dozen Illinois counties  It confirmed on Friday that it has submitted products for its five states but is still weighing next year       We re working through the regulatory filing process and hope to fully participate   in 2018  however no final decisions have been made   HCSC spokeswoman Kristen Cunningham said      Molina  which has more than 1 million members in Obamacare plans  and Cigna  with more than 250 000 participants  have said they need more certainty from the government to decide on 2018 participation and would weigh their decisions up until the late September deadline       State insurance regulators have worked hard in recent months to replace insurers who have left  In Nevada  for instance  Centene Corp and  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  entered in some counties that Anthem left after the insurance commissioner said he would favor these insurers for its Medicaid contract bids  But they are unlikely to find replacements for new dropouts in these final weeks  particularly if the Trump administration signals it won t fund  8 billion in subsidies for out of pocket medical costs       There is almost no chance they would step in to participate   said Kurt Wrobel  a fellow at the Society of Actuaries and chief financial officer of the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania           Some insurers say they will likely just raise rates and hope it works  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan filed two sets of rates with the state department of insurance  one up to 32 percent higher if the fate of subsidies remains unclear

147411,368927,CI,Cigna  CI  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Cigna  CI  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  31 4  
Revenues are expected to be  11 34 billion  up 7 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 75  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cigna 
For Cigna  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 45  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Cigna will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cigna would post earnings of  3 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 84  delivering a surprise of  11 30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cigna appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cigna-ci-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200379543,200379543

147430,368946,CI,Trump U S  antitrust nominee says will be independent of White House,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    Makan Delrahim  who was chosen by President Donald Trump to be the top U S  antitrust regulator  said on Wednesday that he would maintain independence from the White House in enforcing antitrust law 
The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim 
In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee overshadowed by repercussions over Trump s firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey  Delrahim reiterated that he would recuse himself from a fight over whether health insurer Anthem may merge with rival Cigna  NYSE CI  
Delrahim had worked for Anthem as a lobbyist when he was with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck  LLP 
Obama s Justice Department sued to stop the deal  and the case is currently under appeal 
Asked what he would do if the White House wanted to discuss a deal being considered by the division  Delrahim said antitrust enforcement was law enforcement 
 The independence of the decisions made in prosecuting and reviewing mergers as well as other conduct is a serious one that should be free from any political influence   he said   They will be free if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed  
Delrahim currently works in the White House as deputy assistant and deputy counsel to the president 
If confirmed as expected  Delrahim s antitrust division would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal making 
Former President Barack Obama s administration faced a large number of megadeals in what one enforcer called a  merger tsunami  and blocked many of them 
Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahim s career expect him to follow in the footsteps of a former boss  Hewitt Pate  who was assistant attorney general for antitrust from 2003 to 2005  Delrahim was Pate s deputy  specializing in international antitrust 
Under Pate  the division was criticized for allowing too many deals  but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar  It tried but failed to stop  Oracle Corp   NYSE ORCL  from buying PeopleSoft 
If confirmed  Delrahim would oversee the Justice Department s assessment of AT T  NYSE T  s Inc plan to buy  Time Warner  Inc  NYSE TWX   the owner of HBO  Warner Brothers and news network CNN 
The department is reviewing major transactions in seeds and agricultural chemicals  like the mergers of  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  Co and Dupont  and of Bayer  DE BAYGN  and  Monsanto   NYSE MON   Those proposed deals  along with ChemChina s purchase of Syngenta  would consolidate six agricultural chemical companies into three ",2017-05-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-u.s.-antitrust-nominee-says-will-be-independent-of-white-house-482673,482673

147449,368965,CI,Genworth Financial  GNW  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Genworth Financial  NYSE GNW   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  5 in the previous session  Genworth Financial has gained 6 7  since the start of the year compared to the 4 5  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 7 6  return for the Zacks Insurance   Life Insurance industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 30  2018  Genworth Financial reported EPS of  0 29 versus consensus estimate of  0 23 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 68  
For the current fiscal year  Genworth Financial is expected to post earnings of  1 02 per share on  8 56 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 per share on  8 51 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of  13 56  and  0 58   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Genworth Financial may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Genworth Financial has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are D and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 4 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 2 5X versus its peer group s average of 9 1X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Genworth Financial currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Genworth Financial fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Genworth Financial shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Genworth Financial Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Genworth Financial have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including FGL Holdings  FG   Athene Holding  ATH   and Cigna  NYSE CI   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 17  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Genworth Financial  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/genworth-financial-gnw-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200376116,200376116

147480,368996,CI,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Cigna  CI ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Cigna  CI   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this health insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 14 06   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Cigna was expected to post earnings of  3 45 per share  but it reported  3 84 per share instead  representing a surprise of 11 30   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 33 per share  while it actually produced  3 89 per share  a surprise of 16 82  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Cigna lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cigna currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 48   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 1  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-cigna-ci-200373708,200373708

147483,368999,CI,Delrahim to be nominated to head U S  Justice Department s Antitrust Division,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    A member of President Donald Trump s transition team  Makan Delrahim  will be nominated to head the U S  Justice Department s Antitrust Division  the White House said on Monday 
Delrahim is expected to move to the Justice Department after finishing up in the White House counsel s office  where he has worked to steer Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch through the Senate confirmation process 
The Senate must vote to confirm Delrahim once the nomination is formalized 
As the proposed chief of the Antitrust Division  Delrahim would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal making after years of tough oversight by the administration of former President Barack Obama 
Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahim s career have said that when it comes to merger approvals he would follow in the footsteps of a former boss  Hewitt Pate  who was assistant attorney general of antitrust from 2003 to 2005  Delrahim was Pate s deputy  specializing in international antitrust 
Under Pate  the division was criticized for allowing too many deals  but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar  It tried but failed to stop  Oracle Corp   NYSE ORCL  from buying PeopleSoft 
 I know Makan Delrahim to be smart  energetic and expert in antitrust  He is certainly no pushover   said Seth Bloom  a former general counsel of the Senate antitrust subcommittee who knew Delrahim when both worked on Capitol Hill 
Reuters first exclusively reported on March 17 that Delrahim was expected to be nominated to head the Justice Department s Antitrust Division 
If confirmed  Delrahim would oversee the Justice Department s assessment of AT T  NYSE T  s Inc plan to buy  Time Warner  Inc  NYSE TWX   the owner of HBO  Warner Brothers and news network CNN 
The department is reviewing a number of major transactions in seeds and agricultural chemicals  like the mergers of  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  Co and Dupont  and of Bayer  DE BAYGN  and  Monsanto   NYSE MON   Those proposed deals  along with ChemChina s purchase of Syngenta  would consolidate six agricultural chemical companies into three Before going to work at the White House after Trump s inauguration in January  Delrahim was a lobbyist with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck  LLP 
One client in 2016 was health insurer Anthem Inc  which this year lost a court fight with the Justice Department over whether it would be allowed to merge with Cigna  NYSE CI   Anthem has appealed the loss ",2017-03-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/delrahim-named-to-head-u.s.-justice-department's-antitrust-division-469190,469190

147501,369017,CI,U S  Republicans wrestle with effort to gut Obamacare,news,"By Susan Cornwell WASHINGTON  Reuters    Republicans in Congress struggled on Thursday with their efforts to dismantle Obamacare  with conservatives urging haste while some lawmakers said the task had become more of a repair job than the repeal of the U S  healthcare law promised by President Donald Trump s administration  Two influential conservatives in the House of Representatives  worried that the process was getting bogged down  said the repeal measure that the Republican majority Congress passed last year should be taken up quickly  But in the Senate  Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and chairman of the health committee counseled patience  He said changes to the law would be made in  chunks  and would be better labeled a  repair    It s more accurate to talk about repairing it     we re repairing the damage Obamacare has done   Alexander said outside the Senate   We re not repealing all of Obamacare  it s not technically possible to do that  now  in the procedures that we have in the Senate  and secondly  there are some parts of it we want to keep   he said  But Vice President Mike Pence  asked in a Fox News interview about talk of repairing Obamacare  pushed back  saying   We are absolutely committed to follow through on President Trump s directive to repeal and replace Obamacare and to have the Congress do it at the same time    Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned on a promise to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act  former President Barack Obama s signature domestic legislation that Republicans consider federal government overreach   While Republicans voted last month to start the process of scrapping the law  they missed a target date of Jan  27 to begin drafting legislation to do so  At a congressional retreat last week  Republican leaders told lawmakers they hoped Congress would finish the repeal by March or April   Representative Mark Meadows  chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus  and Representative Jim Jordan  the caucus  former chairman  urged the party leadership on Thursday to quickly enact a repeal measure   That s what the American people expect us to do   and they expect us to do it quickly   they said  Obama  a Democrat  vetoed the repeal passed by the Republican controlled Congress last year  INSURERS URGE CHANGES Three of the biggest national insurers have also stepped up pressure on the lawmakers to act   Aetna Inc   N AET   Anthem Inc  N ANTM  and  Cigna Corp   N CI  this week urged changes in Obamacare individual plan regulations in the next few weeks  in time for them to decide if they will sell the products in 2018  They want stricter oversight of eligibility and enrollment periods  as well as other changes  Without them  these insurers say they may pull out of the Obamacare exchanges next year  which would lead to less competition and higher premium rates  Rates for 2017 rose an average of 25 percent  Edmund Haislmaier  a Heritage Foundation senior research fellow who advised the Trump transition team to help craft the regulation change but has not seen the final version  said he expected it to address concerns of insurers  He said insurers were consulted   The incoming administration and the insurers have by in large the same agenda on a lot of this stuff   said Haislmaier  He said that pleasing the insurers could help Congress move more quickly on a plan to repeal and replace the law   The  administration  can reassure Republicans that we re taking steps so the market doesn t blow up when you move ahead with legislation  and I think that would actually maybe move the process along on the Hill   he said  Democrats were enjoying the Republican turmoil  They have long accused Republicans of rushing to gut the law without having a replacement plan ready  The law has enabled up to 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain health coverage

for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing  Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsBoth strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term For the rest of this Screen of the

147520,369036,CI,Chart Of The Day  Molina Torpedoed by Obamacare Ruling  Here s The Trade,opinion,"The healthcare sector dropped 1 99  on Monday after a US District Court judge in Texas ruled that Obamacare was unconstitutional since Congress repealed the individual care mandate  Markets took it as a signal that healthcare providers could be in line to lose a considerable chunk of business 
However  many are skeptical of the decision  questioning its merit  BMO Capital s healthcare analyst Matt Borsch believes there will be an appeal on the ruling within a year  He considers the current brouhaha a buying opportunity 
Indeed it may be  Shares of healthcare insurer Cigna  NYSE CI  were down 3 3  and US hospital manager HCA Holdings  NYSE HCA  was down almost 3   Molina Healthcare  NYSE MOH  which works with state agencies to help manage Medicaid programs plunged as much as much as 16  intraday  but closed 8 9  lower 

While the 200 DMA supported Molina s freefall and bounced it back above the November 20 trough  the damage may have already been done  Yesterday s low created the second trough to complete a downtrend 
Even if there s an appeal on the ruling  and irrespective of whether it will happen in as little as 12 months  that s still a long time for investors to hold on to shares that were torpedoed by the ruling  especially when the broader market is already falling  For that reason we predict prices will keep falling  However  be cautious of the confluence of supports  the November 20   114 44 low  which is a mighty hammer due to its small real body and exceptionally long lower shadow  as well as the 200 DMA 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders might want to wait for a close below the 200 DMA  then  wait for a rebound to retest the 200 DMA from below  with at least one long  red candle  following a green or small candle of either color 
Moderate traders may wait to wait for a close below the Nov  20   114 44 low or at least the Nov  19   118 21 close 
Aggressive traders may short after a close below the  110 41 hammer low  Then  they may take a contrarian  long position  hoping for a bounce

147524,369040,CI,Cigna  CI  Gains As Market Dips  What You Should Know,opinion,"Cigna  CI  closed the most recent trading day at  193 30  moving  0 65  from the previous trading session  This move outpaced the S P 500 s daily loss of 1 54   Meanwhile  the Dow lost 1 49   and the Nasdaq  a tech heavy index  lost 2 17  
Heading into today  shares of the health insurer had lost 7 57  over the past month  outpacing the Finance sector s loss of 7 86  and lagging the S P 500 s loss of 6 77  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from CI as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 7  2019  On that day  CI is projected to report earnings of  2 52 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 29 9   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  11 35 billion  up 8 02  from the year ago period 
For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  14 35 per share and revenue of  45 68 billion  which would represent changes of  37 19  and  10 4   respectively  from the prior year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for CI  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook

147564,369080,CI,Trump  U S  Congress will agree on some issues  long term questions loom,news,"By Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON  Reuters    President elect Donald Trump will enjoy Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress when he takes office in January and an early Capitol Hill honeymoon is likely on several issues  but a long term romance may be more challenging  Under normal circumstances  a president whose party controls both the Senate and House of Representatives can count on getting things done fairly quickly and Trump likely will not be an exception  but he will start with unusual handicaps  Many Republicans in Congress only backed Trump after he became the nominee  Some never fell in line  He offended and attacked some while running  including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan  who did not campaign with him  On top of that  the New York real estate businessman and former reality television celebrity who will head the world s most powerful government and largest economy  has no governing experience   Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government   Ryan told a news conference in his home state  Wisconsin  on Wednesday  promising to  work hand in hand  with him  Ryan said his relationship with Trump  is fine  and he has already spoken to the president elect twice  and to his running mate  Indiana Governor Mike Pence  a former House member  Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress agree on at least one major policy  They want to repeal Democratic President Barack Obama s landmark healthcare law  known as Obamacare  enacted in 2010  Ryan said Congress would move quickly to deal with the law  Trump also spoke extensively about scrapping trade deals and building a wall along the 1 989 mile  3 200 km  U S   Mexico border  but some Republicans are skeptical about both of those campaign pledges  INFRASTRUCTURE EARLY ON In his victory speech  Trump promised to invest in infrastructure  a proposal popular with lawmakers from both parties  possibly funded by ending a law that lets corporations hold profits offshore without paying U S  taxes on them  Plans by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling  a Texas Republican  to rewrite banking law to ease regulations  and to limit powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  are likely to have smoother sailing   My hope is that President elect Trump will focus on issues that unite us   Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins  an outspoken Trump critic  said in a statement  Trump appealed to voters as a Washington outsider  at times leading his rallies in chants of  Drain the swamp   about the capital city  But outside experts said the party leaders share enough of an agenda with Trump that they will move together as a group  Ryan credited Trump with turning his home state of Wisconsin to the Republican Party for the first time in decades  Trump is  going to pursue every deal that can get done and there is a large possibility that Congress is going to work to go along  but also to get passed what they want   said Lara Brown  interim director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University  Republicans kept control of both the House of Representatives and Senate  although Democrats cut slightly into their majorities  With a few races undecided  Republicans had secured 51 seats to Democrats 47 in the Senate  That number could rise to 48  New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan  a Democrat  claimed victory in New Hampshire on Wednesday morning over incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte  although Ayotte said the race was too close to call  COMMON GROUND ON OBAMACARE  TAXES  Repealing Obamacare would shake the U S  healthcare and insurance industries  which have broadly called for measured reforms  although not for its full scale elimination  America s Health Insurance Plans  or AHIP  a trade association that represents insurers such as Anthem Inc and  Cigna Corp   NYSE CI  in Washington  said late on Tuesday that it would work with any new administration on the issue  Trump has called Obamacare a  disaster  and vowed to repeal and replace it  House Republicans have already voted more than 50 times to repeal all or part of the law  Senate Democrats were certain to fight an Obamacare rollback  but could be outmaneuvered by Republicans at the procedural level with Trump s cooperation   It would be a tragedy  and I certainly won t in any way cooperate or work with an effort to take health insurance away   Senator Angus King  a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats  told CNN   Trump and congressional Republicans will find common ground on taxes  Trump generally sees eye to eye with Republicans in Congress in calling for major tax cuts  including those for the wealthy  although details of their plans are not an exact match  Trump has called for cutting the U S  corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from the current level of 35 percent  Ryan s tax plan proposes going to 20 percent  Trump and Ryan both back reducing the current number of tax brackets to three from seven  Trump supports lowering the top individual income tax rate to 25 percent from 39 6 percent  while Ryan wants it to go to 33 percent   Congressional Republicans likely would welcome a move by Trump to rescind some of Obama s executive actions on immigration  labor rights  the environment and global warming  Virginia Republican Representative Dave Brat said one thing he expected Trump to do early as president would be  taking a pen to all of Obama s executive overreach      That s a quick  easy fix to get the regulatory burden down   
Trump has also said he wants to do some things as president  such as ban Muslims from the country and allow torture in the fight against terrorism  that some experts say are legally questionable ",2016-11-09,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump,-congress-will-be-in-sync-on-some-issues,-but-long-term-questions-loom-439037",439037

147578,369094,CI,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Cigna  CI ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Cigna  CI   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cigna currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CI that show why this health insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CI  shares are up 2 12  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry is up 1 14  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 62  compares favorably with the industry s 0 45  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Cigna have risen 15 72   and are up 10 02  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved  3 26  and 7 61   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CI is currently averaging 2 413 399 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CI 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CI s consensus estimate  increasing from  13 87 to  14 23 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CI is a  1  Strong Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Cigna on your short list ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-cigna-ci-200358803,200358803

Elsewhere look for Gold to possibly pause in its downtrend while Crude Oil slowly drifts higher long term  The US Dollar Index is marking time sideways while US Treasuries are biased to continue lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets did nothing to change their downside trends 
Volatility has crept higher and set up to slowly continue  keeping pressure on equity markets  The equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  all reacted with moves lower on the week  The QQQ was the hardest hit and then the small caps with the SPY down less than 1   Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

147647,369163,CI,Health Insurance Industry Outlook   May 2018,opinion,"Strong operating performance of health insurers for the past many years continued in the first quarter of 2018  Higher medical enrollment  surging revenues  medical cost management and an increasing share of revenues from complementary services helped results  Most of the major players raised their earnings guidance for 2018  reflecting solid operating environment down the road  
Moreover  a strong U S  economy has held the health insurance industry in good stead  A record low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase bode well for the space  High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health related services provided by these insurers  
The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue  Despite being tied by a strict regulatory regime and a fast changing industry backdrop  insurers have time and again emerged as winners  
To put it into perspective  revenues and earnings of almost all dominant health insurers have shown a secular rise since 2010  when a sweeping and historical health care reform was put into effect by ex president Obama Ever since the enactment of the healthcare reform act  numerous changes have gone into effect  which have altered the traditional operating model of the health insurers  The ensuing changes were taken sportingly by health insurers  which then adapted themselves to the changed industry dynamics  
A shift in business mix from commercial to government  the way care is delivered from fee for service to value for care  greater emphasis on medical cost management  growing consumerism and technical innovations have been the game changers  
Rapid evolution is  however  continuing in the industry  Given the need of the hour  players in the industry are taking concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive health care providers from their earlier role of being traditional payers  The same is being effectuated by a cross sector collaboration wherein health insurers are foraying into another realm of the health care sector such as pharmacy benefit management  ambulatory care and physician services  
Some of the deals that are underway in this vein are the merger of CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS    CVS  with Aetna Inc  NYSE AET    AET  and Cigna Corp   CI  take over od Express Script Holding Co   ESRX  as well as the UnitedHealth Group Inc   UNH  acquisition of DaVita Inc   DVA   
All said  the industry has remained an outperformer having generated returns higher than the S P 500 index in each year since 2012  In the past five years  the health insurance industry has returned a whopping 257  compared with the S P 500 index s gain of 91   
Is Further Upside Potential Left  
While the industry has outperformed the broader market  valuations remain at the same level as that of the industry The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at a forward 12 month price to earnings ratio of 16 95 which is near 17 for the S P 500 index as a whole  Over the last five years  the industry has traded in a range of 10 6 to 20 1  with a median of 15 3  
We therefore go a bit further and look at the PEG ratio which bakes in the growth rate of the industry  The industry s PEG ratio is 1 3  which compares favorably with the industry s PEG ratio of 1 8  This shows that the industry is undervalued and has room for upside  
Zacks Industry Rank 
Within the Zacks Industry classification  health insurers are broadly grouped in the Medical sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors   
We rank 256 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry

Stocks Worth Adding

147691,369207,CI,Profit From Record Q1 M A With These ETFs,opinion,Merger and acquisition activities across the globe picked up rapidly in the first quarter thanks to U S  tax reform and faster economic growth in Europe Per the preliminary Thomson Reuters data  global mergers and acquisitions had their strongest start ever totaling  in the first quarter of 2018  This is up 67  over the past year and marks the fourth quarter that has surpassed  1 trillion over the past three years  United States M A volumes climbed 67  while Europe volumes doubled  Meanwhile  Asia saw an 11  increase  However  the number of deals dropped 10  year over year to 10 338 According to a report by research firm Mergermarket  M A activity across the world has hit a 17 year high record in the first quarter with 3 774 deals globally  totaling   This was the strongest start to the year since 2001 and represents an 18  year over year increase in value The healthcare space has so far been at the forefront as Amazon s move into the pharmaceutical sphere has spurred the major pharmacy retailers to consolidate  With regard to this  U S  health insurer Cigna   NYSE CI   will acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding   NASDAQ ESRX   for  67 billion  The deal is expected to close by the end of this year  In another deal  the drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp   NYSE CVS   is also in a process of acquiring the nation s third largest health insurer Aetna   NYSE AET   for  69 billion  The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year  read    Another large agreement is German utility EON SE s  38 5 billion deal to acquire RWE AG s renewable energy business Innogy SE The boom in M A is likely to continue given an accelerating economy  still low interest rates  and tax reform  which allows companies to bring offshore cash back home  Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra competitive environment How to Tap Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio  This strategy looks to tap the price differential  or spread  between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company  This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company  When the deal is completed  shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price  in some cases slightly below the deal price   giving investors a nice profit Below  we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M A deals  Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio  IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF  This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge  This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index  The fund has 44 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Blue Buffalo Pet Products   NASDAQ BUFF   and Rockwell Collins   NYSE COL   on the long side  These two firms combined to make up for 17 5  share  The product has amassed  503 7 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 119 000 shares a day  It charges 77 bps in annual fees  The ETF has lost about 2 3  year to date  see     ProShares Merger ETF  This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy  which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company  a target  trades after a proposed acquisition of such target is announced and the value  cash plus stock  that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target  a spread   This can be easily done by the S P Merger Arbitrage Index  The fund holds a well diversified portfolio of 33 stocks  Technology  industrials  healthcare and financials are the top three sectors  The ETF has been able to manage assets worth  4 4 million while it sees light volume of just 1 000 shares a day  Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock  the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk  Further  these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market  read     This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently  ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks  As a result  investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market Want key ETF info delivered

147707,369223,CI,Cigna To Buy Express Scripts  Healthcare ETFs In Focus,opinion,Waves of mergers and acquisitions have been heating up the healthcare space this year that could change the landscape of healthcare business  This is especially true given that health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain The latest catalyst is the health insurer Cigna   NYSE CI    which has planned to acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding   NASDAQ ESRX   for  67 billion  including  15 billion in debt  The moves comes three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp   NYSE CVS   agreed to buy the nation s third largest health insurer Aetna   NYSE AET    for  207 per share or  69 billion  read    Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal  Cigna will pay  48 75 in cash and 0 2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company  Upon closure  Cigna shareholders will own approximately 64  of the combined company The merged company would create a one stop shop for customers  healthcare needs  ranging from sale of drugs to insurance cover  It would benefit consumers by bringing together the medical care and pharmacy benefits at one roof to improve treatments and lower costs The combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    the largest U S  health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit  and CVS after it completes its merger with Aetna  The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business  The e commerce giant recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM   and Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  in order to curb medical costs for their employees The transaction would result in total cost synergies of  650 million and double digit accretion to earnings in the first year after it closes  As a result  Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from  18 to  20  21 in 2021  The deal is expected to close by Dec 31  2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti trust regulatory approvals  see    ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CI

147725,369241,CI,3 Stable Low Beta Stocks To Buy During Volatile Markets,opinion,"Markets began to rebound on Monday after their worst week in nearly two years  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500 both climbed over 1 30   Still  analysts are divided over whether the recent sell off is over just yet 
Concern that the Fed will raise interest rates faster than initially expected on the back of the first jobs report of 2018 is one possible reason for the pullback  A simple market correction  amid what has been a historic run  is another possibility 
Whatever the case may be  no one is sure if the worst is over right now  With that said  investors should consider looking for stocks that have proven to be less volatile compared to the market as a whole 
One tool we can turn to here is a stock s beta rating  which is a representation of how a security responds to rapid swings in the market  Historically  stocks and securities with betas below 1 0 are less volatile than the market 
Let s look at three low beta stocks to consider now 
1        Cigna Corporation   NYSE CI  
Cigna is an American health and life insurance giant that is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and rocks an overall  B  VGM grade  The stock s earnings estimates have been trending upward on strong revision agreement for the current quarter  current fiscal year  and the following fiscal year 
Investors should also be happy to note that Cigna has matched or topped earnings estimates all but once over the last three years  The company s bottom line is projected to expand at a healthy annualized rate of 12 90  over the next three to five years  And during these recent uncertain times  Cigna s beta of 0 45 theoretically presents less volatility compared to the market average 
2        Burlington Stores  Inc    NYSE BURL  
This off price department store sells far more than coats  and its name is iconic throughout the industry  Burlington is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports an  A  grade for Growth and an overall  B  VGM score  Burlington s beta of 0 48  which is calculated using data over a five year period  means that the company is less volatile compared to the market as a whole  in theory 
Burlington has also been on a hot streak when it comes to topping or meeting earnings expectations  The company has achieved this feat every quarter since the start of 2014  with an average surprise of over 15  in the trailing four periods  Looking down the road  investors should note that Burlington is projected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 18 65  over the next three to five years 
3        Anthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM  
Analysts have shown strong agreement when it comes to upping earnings estimates for this Indianapolis  Indiana health insurance and HMO powerhouse over the last 60 days  This has helped Anthem earn its current Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rating  The company also boasts an  A  grade for Momentum and has topped quarterly earnings expectations by an average of 9 60  over the last four quarters 
Anthem also currently rocks a beta of 0 83  which should help show investors that the HMO provider is a relatively stable investment compared to the average stock on the market  The company also looks poised to steadily grow its bottom line over the next three to five years  helping further demonstrate its solid overall fundamentals

147737,369253,CI,INTERVIEW DexCom aims steady  09 growth  eyes Europe expansion,news,"  Aims to post sequential quarterly revenue growth
   Sees growing demand for CGM products
   Says reimbursement not a barrier to CGM adoption
   Expects to expand in Europe
 By Anand Basu
 BANGALORE  July 2   Medical device maker DexCom Inc aims to
post higher sequential revenue through each quarter of 2009 and
expects to expand its presence in Europe 
  We continue to see demand for continuous glucose
monitoring  CGM  growing despite the economy and are quite
pleased with that growth opportunity   Chief Executive Terrance
Gregg said in an interview 
 The CGM systems  which DexCom markets under the Seven and
Seven Plus brands  check for dangerous spikes or dips in blood
sugar levels via a wire like sensor inserted under the skin of
diabetic patients  mainly Type 1 diabetics 
  Such products are not yet covered broadly by insurance
companies and depend heavily on reimbursement for higher
adoption rates due to the cost associated with both the device
and the sensors that need frequent replacement 
  However  the company said it does not see the
reimbursement environment threatening the adoption of its CGM
systems as more insurers  like Aetna Inc and Cigna Corp  are
now amending their policies to cover more patients 
  Two of the largest payers have actually amended their
coverage decisions to be more comprehensive and allow more
patients to receive coverage in reimbursement for the product
over the last six to nine months   Gregg said 
 However  patients may still have to go through a long
documentation process to have their claims reimbursed by the
insurers  DexCom Chief Administrative Officer Steven Pacelli
said 
 READY FOR EXPANSION
 DexCom also plans to expand its presence outside the United
States especially in Europe  its CEO said 
  We are currently in a couple of countries with the Seven
system and as we receive CE mark on the Seven Plus system  our
goal is to expand to a number of countries later this year  
Gregg said 
 In November  the company received the CE mark for its Seven
system  CE mark is required to sell any product in the European
Union 
 Gregg said there were seven countries in Western Europe
with reimbursement facility and the necessary infrastructure
for the distribution of CGM products  but refused to comment on
the revenue expectations from international operations

147816,369332,CI,Is Cigna Corporation  CI  A Good Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cigna Corporation   NYSE CI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cigna Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cigna Corporation s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen slightly over the past few months However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 3  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cigna Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 7  which is marginally higher than the current level  So on the ground of the forward earnings estimates  we might say that the company s share price is likely to appreciate in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cigna Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  However  as we can see in the chart below  this is in line with the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cigna Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cigna Corporation a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Cigna Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D  This gives CI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to nine lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and no downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cigna Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term   Bottom LineCigna Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 38   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn

147838,369354,CI,Pick 4 Solid Insurance Stocks From The Bull Market In 2017,opinion,Looking back  the year 2017 was full of both pleasant and unpleasant surprises  While an improving employment scenario and rising interest rates came as a breather to the insurance industry  the severe damages caused by devastating catastrophe events hampered the insurers  overall performance to a great degree  The insurance industry has been wading through these challenges this year and there have been a few outperformers  which have sparked an interest among investors and raised optimism among them Based on the above scenario  picking the prospective winning stocks and making a prudent investment decision for the best returns may seem an uphill task  We will discuss below about the various scenarios  which have influenced the insurance industry to a large extent Catastrophe Loss Loomed LargeAlthough the first half of 2017 was mainly affected by a hail driven weather related catastrophe loss  the second half proved even costlier for the insurance industry as well as the market as a whole  With the occurrence of hurricanes Harvey  Irma and Maria  the relevant industry suffered an apparent dent in the underwriting results  thus hurting its overall performance Even though the mounting losses badly impacted the overall performance of the insurers  there were a few good stocks  which weathered such losses and emerged winners Interest Rate Hike   A Long Awaited Boon to InsurersThe gradual rise in interest rates has benefited the insurance industry to a great extent  The Federal Reserve delivered in its promise to increase the rates thrice in 2017 by announcing the third and the final interest rate hike at the Federal Open Market Committee s meeting on Wednesday  Dec 13  2017  Notably  the interest rate now ranges between 1 25  and 1 50   which in turn has boosted the insurance industry s prospects and helped the companies strengthen their market position Even with the slow paced rising rate environment  life insurers   who have been suffering from spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates   have heaved a sigh of relief  Thus  given the high dependence on investment income  life insurers will gain more from a progressing rate environment  While non life insurers have already begun to display an improving investment income  instilling confidence in investors A progressing rate environment will also lessen the pressure on the insurers  investment income  thus boosting their earnings  This in turn will accelerate the insurance companies  overall growth in the future    Other Factors Resulting in Favorable PerformanceA few other factors have also impacted the industry performance so far  To that end  low inflation is expected to remain at 1 6   falling shy of the 2  target  which is considered good for the economy This apart  a reviving housing market has enhanced insurable exposures and premiums written  Additionally  an improving employment scenario and a positive consumer sentiment buoy optimism Outperformers in 2017Despite adversities raising concerns for insurers this year  positives like rising interest rate environment and an improving economy have helped the following stocks perform well and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification We have zeroed in on four stocks having outperformed so far despite all odds based on price performance  positive estimate revisions  strong surprise history in the last three quarters and a favorable

147886,369402,CI,4 HMOS For Gains Amid Constant Regulatory Chaos ,opinion,"Healthcare  particularly Obamacare  had been at the receiving end of President Trump  even before he assumed office  The Republicans  repeal and replace efforts have  however  failed  with the American Health Care Act  AHCA  not getting enough support in the House  thanks to a solid opposition from both conservative and moderate lawmakers 
Failure of Last Ditch Efforts
The most recent effort  in the form of the Graham Cassidy bill  also failed to get any success  due to numerous suggestions having been not well received by the industry participants  Among the most unpopular of them were putting an end to individual and employer mandate  giving a block grant to Medicaid  loosening provisions with regard to pre existing conditions  elimination of Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums  deductibles and co pays  plus ending cost sharing subsidies by 2020 
Also  CBO  Congressional Budget Office  analysis of the proposal fund that millions of Americans would lose health coverage due to  1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid through 2026  and that the bill would have resulted in loss of health insurance coverage  has destabilized insurance markets and decreased access to affordable coverage and care for commoners 
A Short Lived Relief 
Though the failure of final attempts to undo Obamacare brought a sigh of relief to the industry  it should only be temporary  given the recent comments made by Chairman of the Republican Study Committee  Mark Walker  who stressed efforts to continue with the fight to remove Obamacare 
How to Play the Sector 
Amid this conundrum  investors primarily want to invest in stocks with a robust business model to protect and shield from market swings  Many good players from the space have remodeled their business mix  diversified into new product classes  new territories and added new functionalities to provide them with an armor against market vagaries 
Insurers  share price performance and steadily growing business profits stand as a testament to their ability to successfully sail through these high tides  created by these ill fated reform proposals ever since   
Though the repeal and replace efforts have been creating noise causing investors to shy away from the sector  it would be unwise to turn a blind eye to some stocks in this space  which offer solid businesses to serve up handsome returns over time 
These stocks sporting a favorable Zacks Rank are indicative of witnessing positive estimate revisions over time  which generally translate into rapid price appreciation 
They also pride over a positive earnings surprise history and have outperformed the  s increase of 44  in the past year  Additionally  they sport a Value Style Score of A or B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Value Score of A or B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   effectively outperform other stocks 
Some of our preferred choices are 
Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   carries a Zacks Rank  2  It sports a Value score of A The stock beat estimates in three of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 8 6   Also the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 being revised  0 7  and 0 3  upward  respectively  over the last 90 days  The company returned 55  in a year  You can see  
The company is poised for long term growth  given low exposure to the troubled health insurance exchanges and relatively small share of revenue from Medicaid  which might see change in funding  Also  a strong balance sheet offers the potential for accretive deals

147911,369427,CI,UnitedHealth Group Latest Acquisition Gives Competitive Advantage,opinion,"After UnitedHealth Group s subsidiary Optum recently purchased the Advisory Board for   we took a harder look at one of the nation s largest insurers and started to piece together their plan to become the complete healthcare package 
Who is UnitedHealth Group 
UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  has a market cap of  184 billion according to Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Finance and operates two large subsidiaries  United Healthcare   Optum 
United Healthcare  which at its core is one of the nation s largest healthcare insurers  along with an international presence  You ll see the name United Healthcare along with other of the large insurers like Wellpoint  WLP   Aetna  NYSE AET   Cigna Corporation  NYSE CI  and others  They provide health benefit plans for individuals  national employees  public sector employees  military personnel and more 
Optum at its core is a healthcare data analytics firm  They provide   Optum Insight  health information  technology  services and consulting   Optum Health  population health management and healthcare delivery  and OptumRx  pharmacy care services   However they have a number of subsidiaries under them including OptumBank  Optum 360  Optum 360 Coding  Optu Care  OptumLabs  OptumRx  I ll focus on OptumCare in a bit 
Now why did Optum buy the Advisory Board for  1 3 billion 
The Advisory Board has partnerships with 4 400 healthcare organizations and provides data  research and consulting to these facilities  Optum want s to leverage those relationships and control more big data  UnitedHealth can now utilize the AB s clients to incrementally bolster its provider network and expand its user base of its Optum Insight software which analyzes the big data of Optum s and the AB s network  Here is a video on  to lower cost on multiple fronts 
Now Optum will control one of the largest healthcare consulting firms  Advisory Board  and has access to all of their data  In a time where big healthcare data is worth big money 
The biggest challenge with the acquisition will likely be to Advisory Board clients who entrust their data to the Advisory Board and may rely on its research in their pricing negotiations with big insurers like UnitedHealthcare  Yet Optum maintains that they re separated from UnitedHealthcare  at times advising hospitals and insurers that complete directly with UnitedHealthcare 
So at this point  UnitedHealth Group owns a large insurer network  and a large amount of analytical data to create predictive models to lower costs and provide competitive advantages 
Other Significant Acquisitions
In the last couple years  Optum s subsidiary OptumCare has been making other additional large acquisitions into the care provider realm  Meaning they are purchasing the facilities that people are actually getting their healthcare services from 
Some of these acquisitions are 
MedExpress   Owned by Optum has 141 urgent care centers around the country and growing  This acquisition happened in 2015 and since then these facilities have continuously popped up over 11 states at a time where outpatient procedures and checkups have been popularized by lower cost and convenient locations within local neighborhoods  To give you an idea the Urgent Care Market across the county has increased 14  to 9 300 centers since 2008 
New West Physicians   Owned by Optum  in 2017 New West Physicians  one of metro Denver s largest physician practices with 120 health care providers was acquired  These type of physician practices have been common acquisitions across multiple states including ProHealth Physicians of Connecticut in 2016  and a number of other states 
Surgical Care Affiliates   Owned by Optum in 2017  Surgical Care Affiliates operates 190 ambulatory surgery centers and surgical hospitals  most as joint ventures with physicians and health systems  Now those over 1 million patients that Surgical Care Affiliates serves per year  will in some way be touched by UnitedHealth Group 
Now at this point  UnitedHealth Group owns are large insurer network  a large amount of analytical data and the actual facilities where people get healthcare treatment 
Conflict of Interest 
Currently UnitedHealth Group has gotten away with these acquisitions that some have started to question  Traditionally patients have wanted to get the best healthcare possible from their doctor and insurers want to save costs every way they can  So what happens when the insurer now owns the doctor  insurance and the big data needed to influence the entire process 
Future of UnitedHealth Group
If current acquisitions are an indicator of future planning  I can see the UnitedHealth Group lowering their operating costs in a number of ways since they would own the entire patient process  They would own the facilities that patients go to get healthcare  the insurer who pays those healthcare facilities and the big data needed to inform future decisions  There is huge cost saving measures here that will provide a direct competitive advantage over their competitors in every sector

147912,369428,CI,Health Care Stocks In Focus As Repeal   Replace Gains Steam ,opinion,"Once again efforts are being made to repeal and replace Obamacare via the Graham Cassidy bill This bill is another attempt to undo Obamacare  after repeal and replace efforts by Trump hit the rocks due to insufficient votes The ChangesA number of proposals included in the plan would alter Obamacare  Among  the most unpopular of these are putting an end to individual and employer mandate  giving a block grant to Medicaid  elimination of  Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums  deductibles and co pays  and ending of cost sharing subsidies by 2020 Strict provisions relating to pre existing conditions are also likely to be loosened  While insurers will have to provide coverage for pre existing conditions  something that Obamacare also required   they will have the ability to charge more to sicker patients 
Concerns of Industry ParticipantsIn a letter addressed to the leaders McConnell and Schumer  America s Health Insurance Plans   AHIP   expressed its concerns that the bill  if passed  might have on the health care industry  The group is of the opinion that the proposal fails to stabilize the individual insurance market  which provides subsidized plans to low income people  It will also cause people with pre existing conditions to fall out of the insurance net and disrupt the Medicaid market  This would make health insurance less affordable and unattractive  ultimately causing more people to forego insurance  thereby leading to an increase in the uninsured rate Bernard Tyson  chairman and CEO of the sprawling Kaiser Permanente nonprofit health system  also holds a similar view on the proposal Overall  the various participants of the health care sector remain unsupportive of the bill and are lobbying against it Impact on Health Care CompaniesThe companies having high exposure to exchange business and Medicaid such as Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   and Molina Health Care   NYSE MOH   are likely to suffer the maximum earnings decline Hospital companies in general are expected to suffer from the likely increase in uninsured patients which will lead to a rise in uncompensated care and consequently increase their bad debt  Volumes will also be expected to remain under pressure as people shy away from medical help due to high deductibles and out of pocket costs Nevertheless  companies having more diversified operations such as UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH    Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   and Cigna  NYSE CI  are relatively better positioned to sail through The concern was reflected in the decline of 0 8  in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLV  on Sep 19  just after the proposal was made The health care sector has been in the limelight since Donald Trump took charge  Thenumerous proposals of repeal and replace   from time to time  has sent shock waves across the industry  The sector however  has been able to shrug off all concerns and perform strongly as evident by a gain of 18 8  year to date compared with the 11  returns by the S P 500   Going ForwardSep 30  is the deadline for the bill to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote  50 rather than 60   under the rules of reconciliation  The bill is fast gaining support  this time also likely from a key Republican governor  Doug Ducey of Arizona  This could lug along the support of Senator John McCain  who voted against the last repeal bill

Cigna helped investors to stay calm by disclosing its 2017 growth outlook just after the termination of the merger  The company projected that adjusted income from operations will grow in the range of 12 18  aided by its significant capital available for deployment  Moreover  the company announced that its board of directors has expanded its share repurchase authority to an aggregate of  3 7 billion  The amount of buyback will  however  be capped at  250 million per quarter until there is more clarity with respect to the litigation with Anthem 
On the organic front  the company is expected to strengthen its business position in Global Supplemental Benefits  The segment grew at a CAGR of 17  for revenues and 24  for earnings over the last six years  2011 2016   For 2017  the company expects adjusted income from operations in the range of  295  315 million  which translates into a year over year growth rate of nearly 4   calculated at the mid point

148200,369716,CI,3M  Mass Madness In The Making,opinion,"3M Company  NYSE MMM  is a diversified technology giant  founded in 1902  It is a component of the DJIA  the S P 500 and S P 100  Its steady earnings and dividend records makes it one of the most beloved blue chip stocks in the U S   which people think can be bought at any price  because they always seem to go up  We do not think so  No trend lasts forever so the price you pay always matters 
For instance  3M stock fell nearly 60  during the 2007 2009 market crash   from  97 to  40 87 a share  Fortunately  3M proved it is a great company and is currently trading above  178 a share   a recovery of over 430  from the March 2009 low  Does this mean investors should go ahead and buy near all time highs  The Elliott Wave Principle applied to the monthly log chart below might help us find the answer 

It makes the entire uptrend since the year 1970 visible  47 years of price data allow us to see that 3M s bull market has been developing as one large five wave   travelling from as low as  4 47 to as high as  182 27 in split adjusted prices  Wave II is a sideways  between a double zig zag in wave  w  and a  in wave  y   The sub waves of wave III are also clearly visible  Wave IV  obeying the guideline of alternation  is a sharp and swift decline  This leads us to wave V  which is still in progress  but seems to be in its final stages 
According to the Wave Principle  every impulse is followed by a correction of three waves in the opposite direction  This means that once wave  5  of V is over  3M stock should reverse to the downside for a major three wave decline  which could be expected to take prices down to the support area of wave IV  In terms of price  this translates into a selloff all the way back down to the 2009 lows near  40 a share  And before you say that this is impossible  we would like to remind you that the same pattern caused Cigna Corporation  NYSE CI  to crash from above  56 to  8 a share between June 2007 and November 2008 
Mark Twain once said that  history doesn t repeat itself  but it does rhyme   If we use history as a guide here  3M Company stock could be expected to enter a major bear market soon  which could ultimately cost it nearly 80  of its market value  In our opinion  2017 is going to be a bad year for 3M investors ",2017-01-02,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3m-–-mass-madness-in-the-making-200171231,200171231

148252,369768,CI,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Health Insurance Innovations  Allied World Assurance  Argo Group International  Cigna And MetLife,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   August 25  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Insurance  Part 1  including  Health Insurance Innovations  Inc      Allied World Assurance Company Holdings  AG     Argo Group International Holdings  Ltd      Cigna Corp  NYSE CI        and MetLife  NYSE MET   Inc     

	Industry  Insurance  Part 1

	Link  

	The long awaited benefits of a rising rate environment that the insurance industry were highly hopeful of after the Federal Reserve s first rate hike  in Dec 2015  in almost a decade  are unlikely to be felt any time soon  as any further liftoff is probably off the table for the rest of 2016  Though domestic economic factors   including growth  labor market conditions and consumer price inflation   are favorable for the Fed s next rate hike move  it will perhaps wait to see stability on the global front 

	If concerns over global economic growth weren t enough  the Brexit storm gave the already dovish Fed more reasons for staying away from the next rate hike 

	The insurance industry is one of the very few to thrive in a rising interest rate environment as its investment strategies are liability driven  But a prolonged low rate environment could not stop the industry from drawing investors  attention  as evident from the SPDR S P Insurance ETF s 124  gain in the past five years versus 94  gain of the S P 500  What made this possible 

	Many insurers have changed their asset allocation strategies in an effort to minimize the impact of the prolonged low rate environment on their business  Moving beyond their traditional holdings  they are investing in racier asset classes for increased returns 

	In fact  this has now reduced their ability to reap the benefits of rising rates  Of course  pricing changes based on rising rates will let them earn more  but their revenue model is now stable enough to counter a low rate environment 

	A rising rate environment will surely brace insurers  businesss sooner or later  But the business dynamics of insurers are not that simple  and the relationship of profit with the interest rate is not direct either 

	In particular  Property   Casualty  P C  insurance  which is not very sensitive to the interest rate environment  holds a significant amount of bonds  which would fall in value with interest rates rising steadily  which is very unlikely  though   This will lead to capital volatility in the industry 

	However  a rising rate environment would keep alleviating the pressure on P C insurers  investment income  and thus their earnings  Moreover  a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive  further supporting carriers to grow 

	Life insurers  however  depend heavily on investment income  so they will benefit more from a rising rate environment  There will be relief from operating pressures resulting from tight credit spreads that the low rate environment has exerted for so long  However  the benefit is expected to be modest as life insurers have significantly reduced their interest sensitive product lines in this low rate era 

	No matter how the changing interest rate environment impacts insurers  normal catastrophe losses   11 billion insured losses in the in the first half of 2016 versus  8 billion a year ago  and continued influx of capital are expected to keep most lines of P C insurance favorable for buyers  Yet  evolving threats such as cyber attacks and a persistently soft market pose challenges for carriers 

	On the other hand  containment of underwriting expenses and a modest increase in premiums are shoring up the prospects of life insurers  But the prolonged low rate environment has been intensifying their struggle to generate adequate returns to meet their commitment to policyholders 

	With glaring dissimilarity in business dynamics  it makes better sense to look at the prospects of these two key segments of the U S  insurance space separately  read our subsequent posts for a detailed insight  

Overall Insurance Market at a Glance

	While continued economic uncertainty across the globe is not leaving the U S  totally unscathed  domestic economic progress makes the backdrop stronger for the country s insurers  Insurers might not see significant improvement in their rate sensitive business in the near term  but growing demand for coverage with improving labor market conditions and evolving insurable risks  such as cyber threat  endemic disease  etc   should keep them afloat  In fact  increasing demand from economically recuperating American households should eventually place insurers in a favorable pricing cycle  too 

	Moreover  a strong liquidity profile by virtue of continued capital inflow into the industry  ample capacity  conservative product design and evolving coverage will not only limit any downside but will also keep the growth trend alive  Also  the ongoing reserve development should continue to support insurers  financials 

	Further  recovery in underwriting and a lower combined ratio for P C insurers are expected to continue if the trend of modest catastrophe losses prevails  Then again  lower catastrophe losses indicate lower premium rates 

	Moreover  heightened competition might curb insurers  profitability in the quarters ahead  But the rapid influx of alternative capital will keep prices down and expedite M A activities 

Will Regulation Hinder Insurers  Growth Prospects 

	Apparently  a safe and sleepy business nature keeps U S  insurers out of federal regulations  which could have marred business expansion  But the industry is yet to be strongly braced by the advantages of operating under state run regulations  Instead  decentralized regulation and consumer protection make the industry susceptible to insolvency 

	Now  the changing nature of business    more like banks in terms of liabilities    perhaps calls for federal oversight  Though the necessity for a regulatory revamp has been strongly felt after banks witnessed success  this would deliver another blow to the insurance industry 

	A provision of the 2010 Dodd Frank Act requires setting minimum capital and leverage standards on insurance companies  but these have yet to be implemented by U S  lawmakers  who are considering distinct business fundamentals different from banks  But the industry  which is increasingly contributing to GDP  has scant chance of being relieved of Federal Reserve control for very long 

Zacks Industry Rank

	Within the Zacks Industry classification  insurers are broadly grouped in the Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  and are further sub divided into five industries at the expanded  aka  X   level  P C  Multiline  Accident   Health  Life and Brokers  The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry 

	We rank 265 X industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry 

	We put our X industries into two groups  the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1   To learn more visit   

	The Zacks Industry Rank is  60 for Life   180 for Accident   Health   218 for P C   224 for both Brokers and Multiline 

Earnings Trends

	All S P 500 companies in the broader Finance sector  of which the Insurance industry is a medium level  or M level  component  have reported second quarter 2016 results  The earnings beat ratio  percentage of companies coming up with positive surprises  is 66 7   while the revenue beat ratio is 54 4  

	The sector has witnessed an earnings decline of 5 2  year over year compared with a 6 9  decline in the prior quarter  Revenues have declined 0 2  compared with an increase of 2 1  in the prior quarter 

	For the third quarter  the sector is expected to witness year over year earnings growth of 4 9  and revenue growth of 2 3  

	For a detailed look at the earnings trend for this sector and others  please read the latest  report 

Bottom Line

	Looking at the broader trends  the growth prospects of the industry appears bright even if the low rate environment continues  The emergence of new issues might not significantly dampen insurers  business either  Particularly  learning from past experience  insurers are resorting to expense saving measures to tread water 

	It may not be very difficult for insurers to overcome short term resistance  While the inability to increase premium rates will keep on curbing profitability  there are enough drivers for margin expansion in the medium term  Also  in the absence of federal regulation  insurers can take on new challenges with the ample capital that they now have 

How to Play the Insurance Industry

	As you can see  though the interest rate environment may not significantly benefit insurers any time soon  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the industry s prospects  So it would be prudent to pick a few insurance stocks that might outperform the markets in the near term 

	We highly recommend stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  such as Health Insurance Innovations  Inc      Allied World Assurance Company Holdings  AG    and Argo Group International Holdings  Ltd      

	However  we suggest staying away from or getting rid of Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stocks such as Cigna Corp     and MetLife  Inc

148325,369841,CI,Stocks Rally To Start Week,opinion,"U S  stocks rallied on the heels of broad based advances in Asia and Europe  with global risk aversion pulling back amid eased U K  Brexit concerns following new polls over the weekend ahead of Thursday s vote  Financials and technology issues saw solid gains  while a jump in crude oil prices powered the energy sector  Treasuries  gold and the U S  dollar were lower  while the domestic economic front was quiet today 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  rallied 130 points  0 7   to 17 805  the S P 500 Index jumped 12 points  0 6   to 2 083  and the Nasdaq Composite finished 37 points  0 8   higher at 4 837  In moderately heavy volume  892 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 8 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil increased  1 40 to  49 96 per barrel and wholesale gasoline added  0 07 to  1 58 per gallon  while the Bloomberg gold spot price decreased  8 98 to  1 289 67 per ounce  Elsewhere  the Dollar Index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 6  lower at 93 67

Cigna Corp   NYSE CI  128  and Anthem Inc   NYSE ANTM  133  are in focus following a report from the Wall Street Journal suggesting their  44 billion merger agreement is raising antitrust concerns among U S  regulators  per people familiar with the matter  None of the entities has commented on the report  while the companies have more meetings this week with top Justice Department officials  CI closed lower  while ANTM gained modest ground 
Economic calendar dormant today 
Treasuries were lower  while the U S  economic calendar was void of any major releases today  The yield on the 2 year note rose 4 basis points  bps  to 0 73   while the yields on the 10 year note and the 30 year bond gained 6 bps to 1 67  and 2 48   respectively  Bond yields rebounded somewhat from their recent fall as the Fed suggested that it is still in a  wait and see  mode  remaining data dependent in the wake of May s severely disappointing labor report  while growth concerns and uncertainty regarding a U K  exit from the European Union  EU   known as a Brexit  have also applied pressure 
Recent pressure on global bond yields has amplified the uneasy sentiment  with rates in Germany  Japan and the U K  hitting record lows  while the U S  10 year Treasury yield touched to a four year low 
This week s economic front will start slow but pick up steam tomorrow as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will begin her two day semiannual monetary policy report to Congress  Yellen s testimony will be accompanied by some key reads later this week on housing in the form of existing and new home sales reports  as well as manufacturing  with preliminary releases of durable goods orders and Markit s Manufacturing PMI Index  Other notable domestic reports due out this week include  the Leading Index and the final June University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index 
However  the focus of the global markets will likely be the looming June 23 U K  Brexit vote and no matter the outcome  the issue of a Brexit may not be put to rest entirely as EU member parliaments must also agree to the changes being proposed  Nevertheless  the British understand the key role trade has always played in their economy  The British may resent bailed out banks and bureaucrats in Brussels  but we believe economic considerations will favor the U K  remaining within the EU 
Europe and Asia gain ground as Brexit fears recede 
European equities moved broadly higher  with global sentiment being soothed by eased concerns about a U K  Brexit on the heels of new polls over the weekend suggesting the  remain  camp gained ground ahead of Thursday s vote  Financials rallied to lead the advance and higher crude oil prices lifted the energy sector  while the British pound surged versus the U S  dollar  The euro rose versus the U S  dollar and bond yields in the region were mixed  In economic news  eurozone construction output declined in April 
Stocks in Asia finished broadly higher with global risk aversion waning as recent polls are easing concerns about a U K  Brexit ahead of Thursday s vote  The yen gave back some of its recent rally to boost Japanese equities  despite a report showing the nation s exports fell more than expected in May  Chinese stocks battled back from some early weakness to finish higher  aided by an upbeat read on the country s May property prices  Australian securities advanced  led by strong gains in the heavy weight oil and gas  basic materials and financial sectors  while South Korean listings also rose  Indian stocks moved higher  with the announcement that Reserve Bank of India s Governor Rajan will step down at the end of his term in September being overshadowed by the eased Brexit concerns and the announcement that India s government relaxed foreign direct investment rules

April labor report misses job growth expectations
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 160 000 jobs month over month  m m  in April  compared to the Bloomberg forecast of a 200 000 increase  The initial rise of 215 000 seen in March was revised to a gain of 208 000 jobs  The total downward revision to job gains in March and February was 19 000  Excluding government hiring and firing  private sector payrolls increased by 171 000  versus the forecasted gain of 195 000  after expanding by a downwardly revised 184 000 in March  from the 195 000 rise that was initially reported  Job gains occurred in professional and business services  health care  and financial activities  while job losses continued in mining 
The unemployment rate remained at 5 0   compared to expectations of a dip to 4 9   while average hourly earnings grew by 0 3  m m  matching projections  and March s 0 3  rise was adjusted to a 0 2  increase  Finally  average weekly hours rose to 34 5 from March s unrevised 34 4 hours level  in line with expectations 
The job growth  which was the lowest in seven months  likely exacerbated recently flared up global growth concerns and could be preserving worries about a potential U S  recession  However  over the past 12 months  employment growth has averaged 232 000 per month  That data still suggests although we re unlikely to exit from a muddle through state  the risk of recession is objectively low 
Also  an upbeat aspect of the report was the rise in wages  which now have increased 2 5  over the past 12 months  an acceleration from the 2 3  pace in the prior month  Wage growth helps underpin consumer spending  which is the main driver of the U S  economy and could help the housing market another key economic driver improve further 
Consumer credit  released in the final hour of trading  showed consumer borrowing expanded by  29 7 billion during March  well above the  16 0 billion forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg  while February s figure was adjusted down to an increase of  14 2 billion from the originally reported  17 2 billion  Non revolving debt  which includes student loans and loans for vehicles and mobile homes  rose  18 6 billion  while revolving debt  which includes credit cards  increased by  11 1 billion 
Treasuries were lower  with the yields on the 2 year note and the 30 year bond increasing 2 basis points  bps  to 0 73  and 2 63   respectively  and the yield on the 10 year note ticking 3 bps higher to 1 78  
Europe mixed  Asia mostly lower
European equities finished mixed  posting a solid weekly loss  Traders digested the softer than expected U S  April employment report that appeared to dampen Fed rate hike expectations  likely helping crude oil prices overcome early pressure to boost the energy sector  and supporting an upside reversal in basic materials stocks  Basic materials issues showed some resiliency and the euro gained modest ground on the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region mostly moved lower 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly to the downside amid cautious trading ahead of today s key employment report in the U S  Japanese stocks declined  returning to action following a three day holiday break with the yen showing some late day strength to weigh on the markets  Chinese stocks fell with the recent pullback in commodity prices pressuring the resource sector  Also  this week s reports on manufacturing and services sector activity  which showed growth slowed  continued to foster uneasiness regarding the health of the world s second largest economy 
Indian equities dipped ahead of the U S  jobs report  while Australian securities rose after overcoming early pressure as the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its inflation outlook  sending the Australian dollar lower  The forecast comes as inflation was cited as a reason for the central bank to unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate this week  Markets in South Korea remained closed for a holiday 
Stocks pullback on soured global sentiment
U S  stocks posted a back to back weekly loss as global growth sentiment was challenged by U S  and Chinese manufacturing reports clinging to expansion territory  and U K  manufacturing output unexpectedly contracting  while the Reserve Bank of Australia surprisingly announced a rate cut  Also  volatility in the Japanese yen persisted and banking results in Europe did little to soothe heightened concerns about the health of the sector  Reports showing solid expansion in the all important U S  services sector and a surprising upwardly revised eurozone manufacturing growth were largely overshadowed  Crude oil prices pulled back to weigh on the energy sector and basic materials stocks saw pressure  while Treasury yields moved lower and the U S  dollar gained some ground  Earnings season  which is now in the home stretch  continued to paint a mixed picture  with about 76  of the 437 companies that have reported in the S P 500 topping profit forecasts  while only about 54  have bested sales projections  per data compiled by Bloomberg 
Currency moves have been a hot topic during 1Q earnings season with a lot of companies citing the strong dollar over the past year as a drag on profits  Others in Europe and Japan have acknowledged concerns over weaker exports stemming from the sharp year to date rise in their currencies  These drags may begin to fade if currency moves become less pronounced  and may help to lift earnings out of the slump they have been in for the past year or so  The return of earnings growth is a key factor in getting global stocks to move materially higher 
Health of the consumer set to take center stage
Next week s domestic economic calendar is poised to be headlined by data pointing to the health of the key U S  consumer  with the releases of April retail sales and the preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for May  Data on retail sales and consumer confidence suggest a still cautious shopper  but we think these reports underestimate what is actually occurring  as some services and experience type items aren t included in those numbers  The trend may also be shifting as consumers appear to have slowed paying down their debt balances  potentially a positive development for spending  but still seem reluctant to increase their borrowing 
Other key U S  reports next week include  the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index  wholesale and business inventories  the JOLTS Job Openings report  the Import Price Index  and the Producer Price Index 
International reports slated for next week include  Australia consumer confidence  China trade balance  Consumer Price Index  CPI  and PPI  foreign direct investment  new yuan loans  and aggregate financing  India trade balance  CPI and industrial production  Japan trade balance  Eurozone investor confidence  industrial production  new car registrations and 1Q GDP  as well as German factory orders  trade balance and CPI  U K  trade balance  industrial and manufacturing production and the Bank of England monetary policy decision

148392,369908,CI,5 Safe Stocks In A Dangerous Market,opinion,"Back in the peak bull days of 2013  it seemed like you could buy just about anything and its price would increase  It s safe to say those days are gone as the market has rediscovered volatility  The S P 500 is down nearly 3  so far this year and was down 9  just a few weeks ago  More than ever  investors that want to make money in the stock market need to do their due diligence and find companies with strong economic profits and cheap valuations 
Our past 48 long calls have outperformed the market by an average of 4 percentage points  increasing about 1  compared to a 3  loss for the S P 500  Five of our long calls over the past year stand out for their impressive returns and continued stability  Investors should take another look at these five stocks that are up 10  or more since our original calls and still earn an Attractive or better rating 


Universal Insurance Holdings  N UVE 


We love companies that consistently earn a strong return on invested capital  ROIC  and UVE has an impressive record here  Its current ROIC of 43  ranks highest of the 45 property and casualty insurers we cover  and since 2007 it s only earned an ROIC below 20  once  in 2007  This long term track record of efficiency led us to recommend UVE to investors in mid July 
Since then  the stock has risen by 27  on the back of strong earnings and a  10 million buyback announcement  Over this same time  the market has dropped nearly 6   Nothing has changed about the quality of the company and best of all the valuation remains appealing 
UVE has a price to economic book value  PEBV  of just 1 2  which implies that the market expects the company to grow after tax operating profit  NOPAT  by no more than 20  for the remainder of its corporate life  Given the fact that UVE has more than doubled its NOPAT in just the past two years  we believe it can continue to exceed market expectations 


Foot Locker  N FL 


Foot Locker has ridden the consumer recovery to big time profit growth and outperformance for investors since the recession  Its ROIC has improved from 3  in 2008 to 11  so far this year  and over the past five years the stock is up 387  compared to 70  for the S P 500 
In May  we argued that FL s strong underlying fundamentals and reasonable valuation meant that its streak of outperformance should continue  Sure enough  the stock is up 10  even as the market has dropped by 6  since our initial report  Steady growth in revenues and margin expansion has helped the stock keep rising 
At its current price of  70 share  FL has a PEBV of 2 1  This ratio implies that the market expects the company to grow profits by no more than 20  over the remainder of its corporate life  However  since 2009  FL has grown NOPAT by 20  compounded annually  If Foot Locker can grow NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  99 share today   a 41  upside  Such strong business operations coupled with low expectations make Foot Locker an opportunity worth looking into 


Inteliquent  O IQNT 


The market keeps looking for reasons to doubt IQNT  When the company reported full year earnings for 2014 in February  the market responded by sending shares tumbling 14   This response came despite the fact that the company beat on earnings and revenue and earned an ROIC of 28   its highest since 2009 
We responded to the drop in the share price by urging investors to buy IQNT in early April  Since then  the stock has risen 23  while the market has dropped by 4   IQNT received a big boost in August after landing a big contract with T Mobile  which adds the wireless carrier to its list of major customers along with Verizon and AT T  N T  
Even with this great news  IQNT still has a PEBV of just 1 2  With the new T Mobile deal providing a big boost to revenue  its margins continuing to expand  and plenty of cash on hand with which to invest in growth  we think IQNT can do much better than the market seems to expect 


The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company  O GT 


Investors in GT need to look beyond the top line  Declining revenues kept the share price low early this year  but that is in part due to GT s strategy of focusing more on its high value added  HVA  tires  which have higher margins  Even as revenue has fallen in each of the past three years  the company has continued to grow NOPAT and improve ROIC 
With increased efficiency offsetting revenue declines  we made GT our stock pick of the week in February  Since then  the stock is up 18  against a 5  decline in the market  Cheap commodity prices mean improved margins for GT  more people driving  and more needing replacement tires  These trends have manifested in strong profit growth so far this year 
Despite its track record of profit growth  GT trades at a PEBV of 0 7  which implies that the market expects the company s NOPAT to permanently decline by 30   There s no reason to believe such a drastic decline is going to happen  If Goodyear can grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  39 share today   a 22  upside from current prices 


Cigna Corporation  N CI 


Like UVE  CI tops its peer group in terms of ROIC  having earned a 13  return on capital last year  With the strong fundamentals  a cheap valuation  and growth opportunities from the Affordable Care Act and an aging population  we made CI one of our two stocks to own in 2015 
We re not the only one to see value in CI  as competitor Anthem  ANTM  announced a deal to acquire it for  54 billion in July  The deal consists of  55  cash and 45  stock and would make the combined company the largest health insurer in the nation  It would be a tie up of two great companies  as ANTM also earns an Attractive rating 
CI is up 37  since our call  but it still trades at a 21  discount to the acquisition price of  175  Concerns about the deal failing to pass regulatory muster have weighed on the share price  but investors shouldn t be worried  The upside if the deal goes through is great  but even if it doesn t CI is still worth the same  175 share price if it can grow NOPAT by 8  compounded annually for the next 10 years  This scenario seems even more realistic given that over the past five years Cigna has grown NOPAT by 10  compounded annually 
Diligence Matters
Making money in a market like this is tough  It requires lots of effort to dig through the footnotes and discover the true profitability and value of companies  That effort pays off when you find stocks like these that earn great returns in a down market  There s still value to be had in this market  it s just going to take more and more work to find

148444,369960,CI,Enhance Returns In Managed Health Care Sector By Rolling Down The Yield,opinion,Since the Presidential election  managed care health care stocks have been battered on concerns that profit margins will be squeezed  The re election helped clarify the future of health care overhaul which should cover millions of uninsured people and will result in higher fees and coverage restrictions for the insurance providers  Cigna  CI  and Aetna  AET  have fallen 4 and 6 percent  respectively from the November 6 close to Monday  While the stocks in the sector have tanked  the bonds on the other hand have held in  highlighting the difference in risk between the safer vehicle in bonds and the highly volatile equities  Having said this  here we will cover our best picks in the managed health care sector of the corporate bond market  Furthermore  we will illustrate a simple strategy for each bond that total return fund managers employ that can significantly enhance returns beyond a traditional buy and hold approach  In particular  the strategy captures both income and price appreciation by allowing time to pass and Rolling Down the Yield Curve  For more information  please review    Cigna Corporation  CI  is a global health service organization and is one of the largest managed care companies in the country with over 11 million clients  The company s Health Care segment accounts for roughly seventy percent of revenue which totaled close to 22 billion in FY 2011  The remaining segments  International and Disability   Life account for the remaining portion of total revenues  We will focus on their bond that pays a semi annual coupon of 8 5  and matures on May 01  2019  CUSIP 125509BL2   The bond is a senior note and is straight bullet maturity with no embedded early call feature  This bond is rated BBB by Standard   Poor s and Baa2 by Moody s which falls under the Investment Grade part of the credit spectrum  In addition  the bond deal size is just over  250 million outstanding and this bond is actively traded  These senior notes are currently being offered at a dollar price of  133 00 which translates to a yield to maturity of 2 87   Based off of our analysis  this is the steepest part of Cigna yield curve and offers a nice pickup in yield over shorter maturity Cigna bonds  Comparatively  there is a 4 Year Cigna bond which yields significantly less  Cigna 2 75  Coupon Maturing November 15  2016  CUSIP 125509BR9  can be sold at a dollar price of  104 66 which is a yield to maturity of 1 55   So by extending an additional two plus years provides an additional 132 basis points of yield  As for the Cigna 8 5  May 01  2019 at a dollar price of  133 00  an investor will  lock in  that annual return of 2 87  assuming the coupon payments are reinvested and you hold to maturity  All an investor has to do is wait and collect  If you take a total return approach by rolling down the yield curve  an investor can enhance return  This can be achieved by selling the bonds prior to maturity  An investor will purchase that bond at the stated 2 87  yield and will hold the bond for a period of time  While held and collecting coupon  the bond s maturity will shorten  So after two and half years in time  that original 6 5 Year will become a 4 Year bond  Assuming stable interest rates  the yield of that bond will  roll  downward toward the aforementioned current 4 Year Cigna which is yielding 1 55   This rolling will in turn  result in price appreciation  To quantify this  we use horizon analysis shown below  Source  Bloomberg  to determine the gain As you can see  we purchased the Cigna bond at a yield of 2 87  percent or a dollar price of  133 00  Assuming that rates are stable during our time horizon of 2 5 years or ending April 15  2015  we plug in today s 4 Year yield of 1 55   Again we know that in two plus years our original 6 5 Year will become a 4 Year and hence assuming stable interest rates  we can use the aforementioned yield  This yield at this horizon date will correspond to a price of  127 13  This is the dollar price which we plan to monetize by selling in the open markets at our horizon date  Given our reinvestment rate of 0 29 percent for coupon payments earned during that time period  this profit results in a holding period return of 11 05  or 4 38  annualized gain  Now  when we compare this gain to a static Hold to Maturity strategy we can see the effectiveness of Rolling Down the Yield Curve Keep in mind that the main assumption to this strategy is stable interest rates  As we all know  if rates rise  bond prices fall and this approach as described will not work  Having said this  all is not lost  If rates rise and the objective is to avoid a loss  all an investor has to do is hold the bond to maturity as principal will be paid back at par  Problem solved To summarize  Cigna 2 75  Coupon Maturing November 15  2016  CUSIP 125509BR9 6 5 Year Cigna bond can be bought at a price of  133 00 yielding 2 87  and should roll down the curve to the current 4 0 Year Cigna bond at 1 55 Rolling Down the Yield Curve strategy  4 38  Annualized Return  2 5 Years

capitalization greater than 15 billion  Aetna has a long term contract with CVS Caremark to provide prescription drug benefits to its customer base  The company has several bonds outstanding  We will focus on their 6 Year bond that pays a semi annual coupon of 6 50  and matures on September 15  2018  CUSIP 008117AM5   The total deal size of this bond is  500 million  Standard   Poor s rates these senior notes at A  while Moody s provides a rating of Baa1 and is on negative watch for a possible downgrade  This bond is currently being offered at a dollar price of  125 86  This price translates to a yield to maturity of 1 81  which is one of the steepest parts of the Aetna yield curve  The 4 Year Aetna bond that pays a 6  Coupon Maturing on June 15  2016  CUSIP 00817YAE8  is yielding only 1
