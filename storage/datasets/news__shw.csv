9910,231425,SHW,California settles decades long lawsuit over lead paint  but outcome is bittersweet,news,"By Joshua Schneyer OAKLAND  Calif   Reuters    When Californian counties and cities first sued paint makers in 2000  they wanted the companies to pay billions to remove dangerous old lead paint from hundreds of thousands of homes  After a 19 year legal struggle  they have finally succeeded in getting the companies to fund a remediation program  albeit on a much smaller scale  Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW   ConAgra Grocery Products Co  and NL Industries have agreed to a  305 million settlement  according to a filing in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California on Wednesday  The resolution marks a rare success for a public nuisance claim  under which counties and municipalities can sue corporations for past activities   including those conducted decades ago   they say have harmed communities  High profile public nuisance claims have proliferated in recent years in the United States as local governments try to use the courts to make corporations pay for societal ills like lead poisoning  the opioid addiction crisis and climate change  Yet the glacial pace and complex twists in California s lead paint case highlight just how difficult it can be to use the public nuisance strategy against corporations  even in a state whose courts are particularly consumer friendly  A trial judgment in 2014 ordered the paint companies to pay  1 15 billion  but an appeals court decision led to the amount being slashed by more than half in 2017  Once the companies had exhausted the appeals process  they threatened to sue individual property owners who received help cleaning up their properties  by claiming they had failed to properly maintain their housing   This landmark settlement will allow thousands of homes to be remediated  and as a result current and future generations of California children will no longer face the threat of lead poisoning   said James Williams  NYSE WMB   County Counsel for Santa Clara County  where the lawsuit was first filed   We re pleased that we ve been able to hold lead paint manufacturers accountable and responsible   he said  The defendant paint companies did not admit any wrongdoing under the settlement  and Sherwin Williams and ConAgra welcomed the end of the legal battle   Sherwin Williams is pleased to have reached an agreement to resolve this litigation  and it will continue to vigorously and aggressively defend against any similar current or future litigation   the company said in a written statement  BITTERSWEET VICTORY The number of U S  children poisoned by lead has fallen sharply since the United States banned the toxic metal from residential paint and gasoline  during the 1970s and 80s  But for California districts like Oakland and Los Angeles  where childhood lead poisoning still exacts a heavy toll  the outcome of the legal struggle is bittersweet  In the decades it took the local governments to prevail  tens of thousands more children in California have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead  state public health data shows  In Alameda County  for example  some zip codes have lead poisoning rates higher than those found in Flint  Michigan  at the peak of that city s water contamination crisis     County inspectors found dangerous paint dust in the East Oakland home of 3 year old Alexander Avila  who tested with lead levels more than five times the elevated standard of five micrograms per deciliter set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   When a reporter visited the nearly century old home last month  Alexander was a ball of hyperactive energy  His mother Stephanie  26  said he is able to speak few words and has trouble engaging with other kids at preschool  She fears his past lead exposure will affect him for life   People just don t know what s in their own houses  or the dangers their kids can face   she said  A county program helped fix lead paint hazards at the home  but public funds are scarce to repair housing before it can harm children  In nearby Hayward  California  another predominantly working class city in the San Francisco Bay Area  five members of the Mariscal family  including two children  were poisoned by lead paint at their old home during 2017 and 2018  county health data and inspection reports show  Three year old Isaac  who tested at levels more than twice the CDC s elevated threshold  suffered anemia   a common symptom of lead exposure   and  like Alexander  has also had speech problems  The CDC says there is no safe level of lead in children s blood  At least 4 million U S  children remain at risk of exposure from chipping paint or lead dust in their housing  the agency says  Lead paint doesn t pose an immediate danger unless it is deteriorating  Many of the 10 counties and cities that brought the lawsuit have tens of thousands  or hundreds of thousands  of older housing units  Neutralizing lead paint hazards in a single home can cost thousands of dollars  so the settlement money may only cover the clean up of a fraction of homes that need work   The litigation money can only go so far  but it s a start   Larry Brooks  director of Alameda County s lead poisoning prevention program  said in an interview last month  More than 6 300 children have been exposed to elevated lead levels in his county since 2000  when the litigation began  according to county health data  Although the United States banned lead paint sales in 1978  most old housing still contains it  and thousands of U S  neighborhoods still have alarming poisoning rates  Reuters found in a series of articles in 2017     NEW LEGAL PRECEDENT  California jurisdictions are the first to have a public nuisance verdict upheld against former lead paint manufacturers  Several lawsuits in other states have failed since 2000  from Illinois to Missouri and Rhode Island  The California case may set a new legal precedent for seeking remediation  Legal scholars say it could encourage new lawsuits against paint companies  and Californian local governments report receiving inquiries from counterparts in other areas of the country interested in bringing their own nuisance claims  In product liability lawsuits  attorneys must prove harm to individual plaintiffs  In public nuisance cases  the plaintiffs don t have to prove harm to specific people  Instead  they can claim that the defendants  activities impeded broad community rights  such as the public right to enjoy property  In California  the plaintiffs argued the companies were responsible for creating a public health threat and knew of the toxic dangers of lead paint when they marketed it  without properly warning consumers  for decades before the U S  government banned its use in homes  The paint companies argued that they stopped marketing lead paint products once risks became known  They contended that home owners were responsible for preventing any poisoning hazards in their living spaces  Santa Clara County recently filed another public nuisance case against opioid pill manufacturers  and similar cases are popping up with increasing frequency nationwide  Many of these suits share a common goal  making big business pay to fix high cost societal burdens that their profit making activities may have left behind  Corporate defense attorneys worry that more wins for local governments under the public nuisance doctrine could saddle businesses with huge and unpredictable liabilities  in some cases for decades old actions they thought were safe at the time  WHY SETTLE NOW  The California local governments and the companies settled after a marathon legal battle that saw both sides suffer setbacks  Beyond seeing the earlier  1 15 billion judgment sharply cut back by an appeals decision  the plaintiffs were concerned with court imposed restrictions on how the money could be used   For instance  the terms had limited the remediation program to housing built before 1951  and only indoor paint hazards could be fixed  The local governments also faced a tight  four year window to complete the program  after which any unspent funds would be returned to the paint companies  As recently as January  court filings from the case show  lawyers for the paint companies vowed to sue California property owners who sought to use the remediation funds  Counties were concerned the mere specter of these suits would have a chilling effect on the remediation program  which will rely on housing owners  voluntary participation  It was an unusually bold move  legal scholars say   Talking about suing property owners is an aggressive tactic   said Bob Rabin  a tort law specialist at Stanford University   I can t think of another public nuisance judgment where defendants turned around and said recipients of the damages should be disqualified because they are to blame   he said  With the settlement in place  these threats and court imposed limitations on how the money can be spent will now be lifted  
Paint companies have agreed not to target property owners with lawsuits  cities and counties can take as much time as they need fixing homes  and housing built through the 1970s   when lead paint was still being sold   are also eligible for help  including on exterior walls ",2019-07-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/california-settles-decadeslong-lawsuit-over-lead-paint-but-outcome-is-bittersweet-1926517,1926517

9914,231429,SHW,Stocks   Wall Street Gives up Early Gains on Trade Fight Worries,news,"Investing com   A strong opening stock rally Thursday faded in the afternoon in part because of worries about the upcoming U S  China trade talks

s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Texas Instruments  Blackstone and Northrop Grumman  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Texas Instruments  shares have gained  35 6  year to date  outperforming the Zacks General Semiconductor industry which has increased  23 2  over the same period  Texas Instrument delivered better than expected second quarter results  However  both earnings and revenues declined on a year over year basis The company witnessed sluggishness across both the Analog and Embedded Processing segments owing to overall weak demand environment  Nevertheless  Texas Instruments has revised its guidance for 2019 revenues upward despite slowdown in chip sales globally  The Zacks analyst thinks this is likely to help the company in winning shareholders  confidence Moreover  the company remains confident on portfolio strength  efficient manufacturing strategies and optimized capital allocation in growth areas  Further  growing investments in industrial and automotive markets are positives  However  U S  China trade tensions is a major headwind  You can   Shares of Blackstone have outperformed the Zacks Investment Management industry over the past six months    48 5  vs   12 1    The company s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the trailing four quarters  Its second quarter 2019 results benefited from lower expenses  partly offset by a decline in revenues  The Zacks analyst thinks the company remains well positioned to capitalize on its fund raising ability Also  it will likely benefit from revenue mix  inorganic growth efforts and persistent asset inflows  The company has converted itself from a publicly traded partnership to a corporation  which will help it attract more investors for its stock However  mounting expenses  mainly due to higher general and administrative costs  will likely hurt bottom line growth  Moreover  the company s capital deployment activities look unsustainable which remain a major near term concern  You can   Northrop Grumman s shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace Defense industry over the past year  gaining  20 1  over the period versus the industry s  5  increase  Northrop Grumman ended second quarter 2019 on an impressive note  wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed their respective expectations The Zacks analyst thinks that since it is a major U S  defense contractor  Northrop Grumman continues to enjoy a strong position in the Air Force  Space   Cyber Security programs  Increasing international opportunities are expected to boost the company s margin growth However  it continues to incur high operating expenses on account of increasing product costs  Such higher operating expenses tend to hurt profit margins  A comparative analysis of its historical EV EBITDA ratio depicts a relatively gloomy picture that might be a

9964,231479,SHW,Sherwin Williams  SHW  Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Sherwin Williams  SHW  came out with quarterly earnings of  6 57 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 35 per share  This compares to earnings of  5 73 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 47   A quarter ago  it was expected that this paint and coatings maker would post earnings of  3 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 60  delivering a surprise of  0 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Sherwin Williams  which belongs to the Zacks Paints and Related Products industry  posted revenues of  4 88 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 95   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 77 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Sherwin Williams shares have added about 15 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 1  
What s Next for Sherwin Williams 
While Sherwin Williams has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Sherwin Williams was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  6 59 on  4 97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  20 97 on  18 25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Paints and Related Products is currently in the top 15  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sherwinwilliams-shw-beats-q2-earnings-estimates-200443005,200443005
9965,231480,SHW,Top Analyst Reports For Texas Instruments  Blackstone   Northrop Grumman ,opinion,"Thursday  July 25  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Texas Instruments  TXN   Blackstone  NYSE BX  and Northrop Grumman  NOC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Texas Instruments  shares have gained  35 6  year to date  outperforming the Zacks General Semiconductor industry which has increased  23 2  over the same period  Texas Instrument delivered better than expected second quarter results  However  both earnings and revenues declined on a year over year basis  
The company witnessed sluggishness across both the Analog and Embedded Processing segments owing to overall weak demand environment  Nevertheless  Texas Instruments has revised its guidance for 2019 revenues upward despite slowdown in chip sales globally  The Zacks analyst thinks this is likely to help the company in winning shareholders  confidence  
Moreover  the company remains confident on portfolio strength  efficient manufacturing strategies and optimized capital allocation in growth areas  Further  growing investments in industrial and automotive markets are positives  However  U S  China trade tensions is a major headwind 
 You can   
Shares of Blackstone have outperformed the Zacks Investment Management industry over the past six months    48 5  vs   12 1    The company s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the trailing four quarters  Its second quarter 2019 results benefited from lower expenses  partly offset by a decline in revenues  The Zacks analyst thinks the company remains well positioned to capitalize on its fund raising ability  
Also  it will likely benefit from revenue mix  inorganic growth efforts and persistent asset inflows  The company has converted itself from a publicly traded partnership to a corporation  which will help it attract more investors for its stock  
However  mounting expenses  mainly due to higher general and administrative costs  will likely hurt bottom line growth  Moreover  the company s capital deployment activities look unsustainable which remain a major near term concern 
 You can   
Northrop Grumman s shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace Defense industry over the past year  gaining  20 1  over the period versus the industry s  5  increase  Northrop Grumman ended second quarter 2019 on an impressive note  wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed their respective expectations  
The Zacks analyst thinks that since it is a major U S  defense contractor  Northrop Grumman continues to enjoy a strong position in the Air Force  Space   Cyber Security programs  Increasing international opportunities are expected to boost the company s margin growth  
However  it continues to incur high operating expenses on account of increasing product costs  Such higher operating expenses tend to hurt profit margins  A comparative analysis of its historical EV EBITDA ratio depicts a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause for concern

The company s expanding international business provides diversification  Its group disability and other businesses are expected to perform well  led by personalized and affordable solutions  Its growing membership has aided revenue growth 
Along with top line growth  Cigna has been able to maintain bottom line profitability as well  Its strong capital position enables investment in business  An increase in leverage might pose financial risks  Rise in operating expenses may weigh on margins

In the Eagle Ford alone  EOG Resources has identified 2 300 locations that will drive the firm s oil production  The Zacks analyst likes the fact that the company has been focused on consistently returning cash to shareholders 
Taking into account the latest quarterly dividend hike  the upstream energy player has managed to hike dividend payments by almost 72  since 2017  Notably  the upstream energy firm recently reported strong first quarter 2019 earnings  thanks to higher oil equivalent production volumes  Moreover  the company emphasizes on reducing cash operating expenses and expects to lower costs through 2019  thereby boosting its bottom line

Currently  the company is getting ready to move into full rate production for Triton  However  it continues to incur high operating expenses on account of increasing product costs  This may disappoint investors

9999,231514,SHW,Disappointing China And Global Growth Data,opinion," Tuesday Market Open  After a long  snowy weekend across much of the country  a shortened week kicks off with the financial wheels still spinning on some icy patches despite this month s sparkling stock market rally 
Some of the slippery spots early Tuesday included a softer global economic growth forecast from the International Monetary Fund  IMF  and Chinese economic data that showed the lowest annual growth for the country since 1990 
There s also the government shutdown  now in its second month  Movement over the weekend seemed slim  judging from news reports  and investors might want to keep in mind growing concerns about how this situation might affect economic growth  With 800 000 Federal employees not collecting paychecks  the lack of cash could start to reverberate beyond those directly affected  Rents won t be paid  people might be curbing purchases at malls and grocery stores  and airplanes won t be full 
Delta  DAL  said last week that the shutdown is costing it  25 million a month  Plus  about 10 000 companies hold contracts with currently shuttered Federal agencies  according to the Washington Post  which estimated the weekly value of their work to be about  200 million 
World markets were generally lower early Tuesday  and major U S  indices fell in pre market trading  In earnings news  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  reported earnings and revenue results that surpassed third party consensus estimates  and IBM  NYSE IBM  is scheduled this afternoon 
Major U S  indices all gained around 3  last week  and the S P 500 Index  SPX  is up 6 5  so far in January its best yearly start through this date since 1987  Stocks have risen four weeks in a row  The markets have been riding along partly on positive sentiment around U S  China trade  though it s unclear how much of last week s news represented actual progress  Intellectual property issues continue to be a challenge in the talks  Bloomberg reported over the weekend 
China  IMF Data Fail to Impress
If you took Monday off and missed the news  there were some developments that could play into the action today  The latest batch of Chinese economic data came out Monday and it looked like a mixed bag  Consumption and factory output both rose in December  but Q4 growth fell to 6 4   the weakest since 2009  Remember  just last week the Chinese government started taking some stimulus measures  but one analyst told Bloomberg she doesn t necessarily think the  measured  approach China is taking will help much to spur global growth  For all of 2018  China s economy grew 6 6   the slowest since 1990 
Also  the IMF sees the world economy growing 3 5  in 2019 and 3 6  in 2020  down 0 2 and 0 1 percentage points  respectively  from its previous estimates   The risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased   the IMF said  This doesn t necessarily mean anyone should panic  but it does help reinforce some thoughts already circulating that a slowdown might be on the way 
The U S  government might be stalled  but there s plenty of activity overseas as the week continues  Notably  the European Central Bank  ECB  is scheduled to meet mid week and hold a press conference Thursday  The meeting takes place as some analysts see fading momentum in the European economy 
There are some earnings of note in the days ahead  Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  and Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  bow later this week  A bunch of consumer staples companies  PG included  are among those reporting 
Flocking Toward More Risk On Trades
Last week ended with growing optimism and dissipating volatility  By late Friday  it felt like the entire market was heaving a big sigh of relief  Some investors appeared to be coming back to buy things with volatility trending lower  and suddenly  belief seemed to grow that maybe things weren t as bad as people might have thought 
It s a far cry from the end of December  when 71  of S P 500 companies had reached bear market territory  according to Barron s  Going into Monday  the SPX had recovered about 50  of the losses it sustained between the early autumn record high and the Dec  24 close that some analysts now think might have been some sort of bottom  though there s no guarantee that stocks won t go back and re test that low at some point 
From a sector standpoint  many investors continued to flock toward more aggressive parts of the market like financials and energy on Friday  with financials apparently getting a lift from another rise in 10 year Treasury yields  We ll have to see if the 10 year can continue to support financials in the days ahead  Financials had the best performance of any sector last week  Crude  another good indicator of economic strength or weakness  climbed to two month highs Monday on what looked like hope for trade progress with China that might lead to improved demand 
The other positive takeaway from last week was the market s ability to stay strong into Friday s close ahead of a three day weekend  That might speak to investors feeling a little less nervous about potential headline risk  The market s most widely watched fear indicator  the VIX  fell to below 18 at times on Friday  That s near the historic norm  and way down from levels above 30 seen back in late December 
As key earnings loom  consumer health still looks strong  However  a bit of concern developed Friday when the January University of Michigan Sentiment report headline number fell way short of Wall Street analysts  expectations  The reading came in at 90 7  down from 98 3 in December and below the Briefing com consensus of 96 0 
The people surveyed in the report said they were concerned about the partial government shutdown  the impact of tariffs  instabilities in financial markets  the global slowdown  and the lack of clarity about monetary policies  This might remain something to consider if the shutdown continues and trade talks don t accelerate toward a deal 
On a technical note  the SPX starts the week well above its 50 day moving average of 2625  It looks like that level might now form a support point  so the question is whether the SPX can spend some time above the 50 day as opposed to below it 

Figure 1  Risk Assessment  See the candlestick line in the one month chart above  That s the S P 500 s performance over that time frame  All the colored lines above it show some of the sectors that outperformed the broader index the last four weeks  including energy  consumer discretionary  industrials  and financials  This helps show how some investors are embracing more aggressive territory in the market  Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Leading the Pack  Back at the start of the month  we mentioned the need for certain sectors to show leadership if the rally was going to grow some legs  Three weeks later  it looks like some of the key sectors have come through  Through Friday s session  leaders so far this year included some of the key cyclicals  Energy  financials  industrials  and consumer discretionary are the top performers year to date  All these sectors have outperformed the S P 500  SPX  since the end of December  perhaps a sign that some investors are starting to feel more comfortable embracing risk 
Meanwhile  some of the so called  defensive  sectors that helped lead in Q4  including utilities  health care  and staples  all are near the back of the pack so far in January  There s still a long way to go in Q1 and the next news about trade with China could always conceivably be negative and help make people risk averse again  but investors  embrace of more aggressive stocks appears to be a positive sign 
Housing Relief On Way  Last week saw 30 year mortgage rates fall back to 4 45   the lowest they ve been since last spring  according to MarketWatch  That s down from nearly 5  back around Halloween when rising interest rates seemed to spook the entire stock market  Though recent housing market news hasn t been too positive most recently what we mentioned Friday about weaker than expected preliminary Q4 results from paint maker Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW  and home construction company PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  receiving a downgrade home buyers tend to be motivated by monthly payments  If rates keep falling  it s possible some home buyers will make their calculations and figure out they can afford a little more home  That means higher priced properties might start getting more traction  One thing holding back housing  according to many analysts  is the current excess of luxury homes that  with rates near 5   started looking unaffordable to more buyers 
To put this into clearer terms  A  250 000 mortgage at 5  has a monthly principal and interest  P I  payment of  1 343  But if the rate falls to 4 5   the same payment would get someone a  265 000 mortgage  Maybe that gets them home with one more bathroom or a bigger kitchen  Alternatively  you could view that interest rate drop as an extra  76 a month to be used toward DIY projects or another discretionary spending  Either way  a fall in mortgage rates could be seen as a windfall for the consumer 
The  It Happens to Everyone  File  Think you suffered a bad quarter with your trading or investing  Well  so did many of the professionals  it appears  That s evident after the big banks reported Q4 earnings last week and cited poor performance in their trading divisions  Seems that low volatility made it hard for them to successfully trade in 2017  and high volatility in late 2018 also proved difficult for them to navigate 
The average investor might beat themselves up about their sagging portfolios  but pros can have a tough time too  The reality is  it s been very difficult for anyone to consistently make money in the market over the last year and a half  It s a tough market for everyone  so investors might want to consider putting greater emphasis on staying in their game  keeping trades relatively small  and not getting over extended  These strategies won t guarantee success  of course  but treading cautiously in volatile markets is never a bad idea

10000,231515,SHW,Sherwin Williams  SHW  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Sherwin Williams  SHW  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 05 billion  up 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 92  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sherwin Williams 
For Sherwin Williams  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 30  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sherwin Williams will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sherwin Williams would post earnings of  5 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 68  delivering a surprise of  0 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sherwin Williams doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sherwinwilliams-shw-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200378966,200378966
10001,231516,SHW,Sherwin Williams  SHW  Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Sherwin Williams  SHW  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 54 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 56 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 95 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  0 56   A quarter ago  it was expected that this paint and coatings maker would post earnings of  5 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 68  delivering a surprise of  0 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Sherwin Williams  which belongs to the Zacks Paints and Related Products industry  posted revenues of  4 06 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 24   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 98 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Sherwin Williams shares have added about 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 7  
What s Next for Sherwin Williams 
While Sherwin Williams has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Sherwin Williams was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 84 on  4 09 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  21 63 on  18 29 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

10005,231520,SHW,RPM Misses Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates  Shares Decline,opinion,RPM International Inc    NYSE RPM   reported second quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents in the quarter  missing the consensus mark of 66 cents by 21 2   Also  the reported figure declined 8 8  from the year ago figure of 57 cents Net sales of  1 36 billion in the quarter lagged the consensus mark of  1 39 billion by 2 2   Nevertheless  the reported figure increased 3 6  year over year  mainly attributable to strong organic growth of 3  along with acquisition growth of 2 6  RPM International Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    However  strong sales growth continues to be offset by rising raw material costs  In addition  freight  labor and energy costs  along with the adverse effect of transactional foreign exchange added to the woes  Consequently  the company provided tepid view for its fiscal third quarter earnings Following unimpressive second quarter performance and dismal fiscal third quarter earnings guidance  RPM s shares declined 4 8  on Friday s trading session Operating HighlightsGross margin of 39 5  decreased 240 basis points  bps  year over year in the fiscal second quarter  owing to higher raw material and freight costs Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  in the reported quarter came in at  126 million  Adjusted EBIT margin of 9 2  also declined 80 bps year over year Segment DetailsThe company has three reportable segments   Industrial  Specialty and Consumer Industrial segment  contributing 52 7  to net sales   Sales in the segment increased 2 1  to  718 million  given strong performance across the businesses providing corrosion control coatings  as well as concrete admixture and repair products  However  second wettest autumn in the United States partially offset the positives  primarily in the commercial roofing business Organic sales growth contributed 3 3   while acquisitions added 1 5   Foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2 7  Consumer segment  31 7    Sales improved 4 1  to  432 6 million during the quarter  owing to 2 8  organic sales growth  Acquisitions contributed 2 9   whereas foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 1 6   Organic growth was primarily driven by higher pricing  along with new product introductions in sealants and adhesives business  However  extremely wet weather negatively affected the segment s performance during the reported quarter Specialty segment  15 6    Sales increased 7 6  to  212 million on the back of 2 3  organic sales growth and 6 1  acquisition growth during the said quarter  However  foreign currency translation impacted sales by 0 8   The segment gained from wood coatings  powdered coatings and fluorescent colorants businesses  along with the benefits from the acquisition of Nudura in September 2018 Balance SheetAs of Nov 30  2018  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  226 9 million compared with  244 4 million at fiscal 2018 end   Long term debt  excluding current maturities  at the end of fiscal second quarter was  1 92 billion compared with  2 18 billion at fiscal 2018 end In the first half of fiscal 2019  the company had cash from operations of  148 3 million compared with  115 2 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 Third Quarter of Fiscal 2019 ViewThe company expects revenues to grow in low to mid single digit range during the fiscal third quarter Moreover  it anticipates lower earnings for the fiscal third quarter due to raw material cost challenges and three non operating items  To be more precise  the company projects tax rate of approximately 26   a negative impact from unrealized gains and losses on equity securities of  5  6 million  and the absence of long term incentive compensation during the said quarter  Resultantly  for the fiscal third

10026,231541,SHW,Top Stock Reports For JPMorgan  Coca Cola  Comcast   United Technologies ,opinion,"Thursday  April 26  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 17 major stocks  including JPMorgan  JPM   Coca Cola  KO   Comcast  CMCSA  and United Technologies  UTX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
JPMorgan s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry over the past six months  up  8 1  vs   3    This price performance is backed by impressive earnings surprise history  with the company surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  Its first quarter 2018 results reflect improved revenues and lower credit cost  
The bank s efforts to expand into new markets  higher interest rates and rising loan demand will likely continue to benefit its financials  Also  lower tax rates will aid profitability in the quarters ahead  However  fee income growth challenges  mainly due to a slowdown in capital market activities and dismal mortgage banking performance  remains a major concern for the company  Also  litigation hassles are a major concern 
 You can   
Shares of Coca Cola have outperformed the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry in the last year    1 4  vs   2    Coca Cola started 2018 on a solid note  beating expectations on both counts in the first quarter  Apart from a notably rise in soda volumes  it gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts  
Organic sales grew 5   led by price mix growth of 1  and concentrate sales growth of 4   Currency also had a 2  positive impact on revenues  Again  lower SG A expenses  down 24 2    higher gross margin  up 270 bps  and higher operating margin  up 600 bps  helped it come up with better earnings  up 8    However  total sales decreased 16   marking the 12th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues  
Although the top line has yet to show sustained improvement  the Zacks analyst likes the strategic efforts to make its portfolio that of a total beverage company with improved marketing and innovation  focus on driving revenues by improved price mix  digital focus and productivity initiatives toward driving margins 
 You can   
Comcast s shares have underperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry in the last three months  losing  18 4  vs   16 3   However  Comcast s first quarter results benefited from increasing number of high speed internet subscribers and incremental revenues from the broadcasting of Winter Olympics and Super Bowl  
The company expects to continue investments on Theme Parks  which also reported impressive top line growth in the quarter  Comcast submitted a firm bid for Sky Communications  The acquisition is likely to provide synergies worth  500 million  
Meanwhile  the Zacks analyst thinks the nationwide rollout of the DOCSIS 3 1 technology and the completion of the nationwide rollout of Comcast s wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand will boost subscriber base going forward  Moreover  partnerships with the likes of Charter and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  are positives  
However  the company continues to lose voice and video subscribers due to cord cutting and stiff competition  Additionally  high debt level is a headwind 
 You can   
Shares of United Technologies have gained  2  in the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has lost  11 7  over the same period  United Technologies  first quarter 2018 earnings trumped expectations and rose 19 6  year over year  
The Zacks analyst thinks the impressive growth can be attributed to solid performances across the segments  Also  the company issued a bullish guidance for 2018 on healthy demand trends and is likely to deliver sustainable earnings growth in future with the Rockwell merger  
Meanwhile  United Technologies remains focused on four key priorities  flawless execution  innovation  structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation to fuel its growth engine  However  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the company s bottom line growth  
In addition  a disruption in deliveries from suppliers  capacity constraints  production disruptions  price changes or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on the company s ability to meet delivery schedules

10045,231560,SHW,Forget Blockchain  Invest In Old School Winners Instead,opinion," 0     Warren Buffett Thoughts On Cyptocurrency 4     Emerging Technology  Boom or Bust 8     Buffett s 3 Ways The Market Could Keep Rising 11     How To Play The Market Like Buffett 15     Tracey s Top Picks  Old School Winners 22     Episode Roundup  Welcome to Episode  77 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
Recently  Warren Buffett gave an interview on CNBC where anchor Becky Quick asked him about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies 
He answered that he didn t own any  wasn t short any and would never have a position in them  Buffett then went on to say that they will come to a  bad ending  but he didn t know when or how it would happen 
As you can imagine  he immediately came under attack from those in the crypto community for being out of touch  too old  and ignorant 
It s nearly the identical response dot commers had to his comments in the late 1990s 
Picking Winners in Emerging Technologies
When a new technology bursts on the scene  there are always dozens of competitors  After all  it s seen as a gold rush and some people will get rich off of what is new 
In the 1800s  there were hundreds of railroads in the United States  But now  there are less than 10 big commercial railroad companies 
Similarly  there were thousands of automobile manufacturers and hundreds of domestic airlines when cars and airplanes came on the scene in the early 1900s 
But  again  today  the  winners  have won the contest  There are only a handful of big names in those industries  They are the survivors 
With cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology  it s so new  there s no way of knowing who the winners may be  Buffett s strategy  then  is to simply avoid those emerging technologies until winners can be determined 
Investing in the Old School Winners
Why not invest in those that have become the winners in the older industries 
These companies  some of whom have survived for nearly two hundred years  are clearly doing something right 
1       General Electric   NYSE GE   is one of the original Dow Industrial components  Becky Quick asked Buffett about GE in their interview but he wouldn t say  due to compliance issues  if he was buying now that shares have plunged  Is it even cheap enough  It still has a forward P E of 18 3 
2      Masco   NYSE MAS   makes plumbing parts like faucets  paints  cabinets and countertops  Founded in 1929  it now has a  14 billion market cap  Earnings are expected to rise 18  in 2018 after jumping about 29  in 2017 
3      Fortune Brands Home   Security   NYSE FBHS   makes cabinets and plumbing  including the Moen brand  but it also makes doors and security devices such as padlocks by Master Lock  With a  10 billion market cap  it s expected to see double digit earnings growth in both 2017 and 2018 
4      Sherwin Williams   NYSE SHW   recently acquired Valspar and is now one of the largest paint manufacturers in the world  Founded in 1866 in Cleveland  it s still producing double digit earnings growth all of these years later with analysts expecting earnings to pop 25 5  in 2018 
5      Deere   Company   NYSE DE   traces its roots all the way back to 1837 in Moline  Illinois  This agriculture and construction equipment giant has had a few tough years as farmers cut back on their equipment spending but is turning it around with fiscal 2018 earnings expected to jump 22  
Sometimes  for investors  the tried and true is just as attractive as the shiny and new 
What else should you know about why Buffett is avoiding bitcoin and thinks the market isn t over valued

10051,231566,SHW,Top Stock Reports For Amgen  FedEx   Thermo Fisher ,opinion,"Thursday  March 22  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Amgen  AMGN   FedEx  FDX  and Thermo Fisher  TMO   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Amgen s shares have gained  9 4  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry  which has declined  3 3  over the same period  Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Kyprolis   are performing well  Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline and expects approval and launch of migraine candidate  Aimovig this year  
Amgen s restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient  Lower taxes and share buybacks should provide some bottom line support in 2018  However  Amgen has some challenges in store  given slowdown in sales of mature drugs like Enbrel  Aranesp and Neulasta  which are facing an array of branded and generic competitors  
Volume growth of new drugs may not be enough to offset the lost sales due to the decline in mature brands  While Neupogen is already facing U S  biosimilar competition  Neulasta  Epogen and Sensipar could start facing the same this year  Meanwhile  uptake of key new drug  Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated FedEx have outperformed the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry and rival United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  in the last year  The company has gained  31 6  while the industry it belongs to and UPS have rallied  13  and  1 9   respectively  in the same period  
Ushering in further good news  FedEx outperformed in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 driven by increased package volumes and higher base rates  The company s Ground unit performed very impressively in the quarter  
The Zacks analyst thinks strong e commerce growth is a huge positive for the company  The new tax law is also encouraging  It was primarily responsible for the company s bullish earnings outlook for fiscal 2018 
Efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are also noteworthy  An uptick in such shareholder friendly activities cannot be ruled out  in the light of the savings induced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  High costs are  however  hurting the bottom line 
 You can   
Buy rated Thermo Fisher s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Instruments industry over the last three months   11 9  vs   9 8    Post a promising fourth quarter show by Thermo Fisher  the Zacks analyst is encouraged by the company s solid international performance with strong growth in the Asia Pacific and the emerging markets  
Also  a series of product launches along with major progress in precision medicine initiatives benefited the company s performance  Thermo Fisher s FEI acquisition has already started to boost analytical instruments portfolio  Also in 2017  the company deployed  7 8 billion on strategic acquisitions  adding leading biopharma contract development and manufacturing services through Patheon  
On the flip side  in the reported quarter  the company s business segments were impacted by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix  Also  competitive headwinds and rising operating costs continue to pose a threat

5 Top High Yield Aristocrat Stocks to Buy

	Summer months in the stock market through June are known to be notorious for sluggish price movements  Last year  Brexit affected the markets while Greece s debt crisis had rattled the global market in the year before  And prior to that  investors had to bear the brunt of Fed scaling back its stimulus program or a downgrade of America s credit rating or early signs that the investment banking giant Lehman Bros was on the brink of a collapse 

	This time around  if the Congress fails to pass the much anticipated tax reforms  the markets might be in trouble  Fed could also pose a problem for the markets if economic conditions don t start looking up  Moreover  even if the markets have gained strength on the back of strong earnings growth  it is at a high valuation level  This could restrict the markets from moving further north in the near term 

	Lest we forget  financials had already taken a hit after two of the largest U S  banks signaled at a trading slowdown  while drop in oil prices and FBI Director Comey to testify about President Trump s confrontations could lead to a market sell off  With such uncertainty around the corner  investing in dividend aristocrats seems to be prudent  These stocks provide higher returns at lower risks  which are undoubtedly the  holy grail  of investing 

June is Notorious for Sluggish Price Action

	The equity market in June is on average flattish  while it is also the fourth worst month in terms of the S P 500 s performance  While September is historically the worst month  August has been the second followed by February 

	Over the last 50 years  the benchmark index has recorded an average return of 0 11  during the month of June  The returns have been fairly evenly split between gains and losses  with the average June advance being 2 39 and the average loss 2 79   However  the average gain in June is the second lowest in all the 12 months 

Stock Market s Summer Concerns

	The market isn t void of risks this June  Following are possible sources of trouble that investors should look out for 

Trump Trade Deflates

	Trump terminated and removed FBI Director Comey on May 9  a development that few saw coming  This decision made equity strategists emphasize that the days of Trump trade in the market isn t anymore  For now  investors should refrain from betting on any quick legislation around trade  budget  healthcare or infrastructure 

	According to Michael Arone  Chief Investment Strategist at State Street Global Advisors   Investors are realizing that the fiscal policy agenda is being pushed out farther on the horizon   Trump s pro business tax  regulation and infrastructural polices are anyhow taking longer to translate into action than investors had hoped 

Fed Rate Hike Amid Soft Economy

	The Federal Reserve s Beige Books said that the economy is still growing at a  modest or moderate  pace  appearing to support a June rate increase  Minutes from the Federal Reserve s May 2 3 meeting also showed that officials believe that an interest rate hike is in the cards  soon  

	U S  GDP growth  in the meanwhile  was revised up to 1 2  for the first three months of the year  Despite the uptick  most of Wall Street wasn t in a celebratory mood as it is still a disappointing outcome  mainly caused by a slowdown in consumer spending and inventories  Analysts noted that data doesn t signal at a strong rebound in the second quarter and that the Fed had made up its mind about monetary policy long before the GDP figures were released 

Upbeat Earnings Performance  Stretched Valuations

	Earnings growth  did  scale to the highest level in over five years during the first quarter  It was also driven across various sectors and not concentrated in one area  But  we shouldn t forget that U S  equities have rallied sharply since last November  making them substantially more expensive when compared to profits 

	Such equities are very stretched in terms of most valuation measures  which could lead up to a stock market bubble  After all  a highly valued stock market is more likely to result in lower returns 

Financial and Energy Sectors Bleed

	Two major U S  banks  J P  Morgan Chase and Bank of America  NYSE BAC   expressed caution over weakening trading in the second quarter  which eventually had a negative impact on the broader financial sector  J P  Morgan s second quarter trading is so far down about 15  compared with a year ago  while Bank of America s second quarter trading revenue is expected to be down slightly from a year ago 

	Energy shares  in the meantime  continued their downtrend with U S  crude oil prices dipping below  48 and settling 2 7  lower at  48 32 a barrel  Investors doubt that the extended production caps by major producers and the summer driving season in the U S  won t do enough to reduce concerns about global supplies 

Buy 5 Best Dividend Aristocrats for Better Returns

	With so many concerns on investors  minds  dividend paying stocks are tempting options at the moment  These stocks have tremendous financial strength and are immune to market vagaries  while stocks that pay dividends are willing to reward shareholders with cash payments  This is a sign that management is shareholder friendly 

	But  why dividend aristocrats  This is because this category of stocks outperforms other dividend payers on better quality business  They have also raked in solid risk adjusted returns this year  with the S P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index rallying 3 4  

	We have  thus  selected five dividend aristocrats to boost your returns  Such stocks also possess a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks gain further this year as well  You can see

Johnson   Johnson shares have gained  8 9  over the last year  widely outperforming the large cap pharma space  down  1 1    J J reported mixed Q1 results  beating on earnings but missing on sales  This was the second consecutive sales miss for J J due to a slowdown in pharmaceutical product sales

Also  the potential Actelion buyout  though expensive  will bolster J J s long term growth  However  in 2017  growth in J J s Pharma segment is expected to suffer as key growth drivers have slowed down due to competition   You can  
Shares of Schlumberger underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry over the last one year  losing  6 4  vs  the sector s  4 3  decline  The Zacks analyst likes the continuous and effective cost management initiatives of the company  The Schlumberger Cameron merger will support technology driven growth  going forward  The company s focus on international markets also deserves appreciation 
Moreover  Schlumberger s first quarter earnings were in line with expectations  This may be attributed to improvement in directional drilling works in North America  However  the bottom line decreased substantially on a year over year basis owing to slowdown of drilling works in the international market  Moreover  Schlumberger projected 2017 to be a challenging year for business outside North America   You can  
Honeywell shares have outperformed the diversified operations industry gaining  12 1  vs   2 1  in the year to date period  Moreover  Honeywell reported solid first quarter 2017 results  The Zacks analyst like the company s continuing efforts on increasing its presence in high growth regions  Additionally it is building a robust pipeline of new products and has regularly fine tuned its portfolio to focus on core businesses 
Diligent focus on working capital management  free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positive attributes  However  Honeywell expects a tepid demand pattern for its business jets and mobile scanners in 2017 due to sluggish global growth  volatility in crude oil prices and a tempered Chinese economy  High R D expenditure to fend competition and stay ahead of technological obsolescence contracts margin and reduces bottom line growth   You can

10182,231697,SHW,5 Top High Yield Dividend Aristocrats To Buy In June,opinion,Summer months in the stock market through June are known to be notorious for sluggish price movements  Last year  Brexit affected the markets while Greece s debt crisis had rattled the global market in the year before  And prior to that  investors had to bear the brunt of Fed scaling back its stimulus program or a downgrade of America s credit rating or early signs that the investment banking giant Lehman Bros was on the brink of a collapse This time around  if the Congress fails to pass the much anticipated tax reforms  the markets might be in trouble  Fed could also pose a problem for the markets if economic conditions don t start looking up  Moreover  even if the markets have gained strength on the back of strong earnings growth  it is at a high valuation level  This could restrict the markets from moving further north in the near term Lest we forget  financials had already taken a hit after two of the largest U S  banks signaled at a trading slowdown  while drop in oil prices and FBI Director Comey to testify about President Trump s confrontations could lead to a market sell off  With such uncertainty around the corner  investing in dividend aristocrats seems to be prudent  These stocks provide higher returns at lower risks  which are undoubtedly the  holy grail  of investing June is Notorious for Sluggish Price ActionThe equity market in June is on average flattish  while it is also the fourth worst month in terms of the S P 500 s performance  While September is historically the worst month  August has been the second followed by February Over the last 50 years  the benchmark index has recorded an average return of 0 11  during the month of June  The returns have been fairly evenly split between gains and losses  with the average June advance being 2 39 and the average loss 2 79   However  the average gain in June is the second lowest in all the 12 months  Take a look at the table on the S P 500 s average monthly returns over the past 50 years   Stock Market s Summer ConcernsThe market isn t void of risks this June  Following are possible sources of trouble that investors should look out for Trump Trade DeflatesTrump terminated and removed FBI Director Comey on May 9  a development that few saw coming  This decision made equity strategists emphasize that the days of Trump trade in the market isn t anymore  For now  investors should refrain from betting on any quick legislation around trade  budget  healthcare or infrastructure According to Michael Arone  Chief Investment Strategist at State Street Global Advisors   Investors are realizing that the fiscal policy agenda is being pushed out farther on the horizon   Trump s pro business tax  regulation and infrastructural polices are anyhow taking longer to translate into action than investors had hoped Fed Rate Hike Amid Soft EconomyThe Federal Reserve s Beige Books said that the economy is still growing at a  modest or moderate  pace  appearing to support a June rate increase  Minutes from the Federal Reserve s May 2 3 meeting also showed that officials believe that an interest rate hike is in the cards  soon  U S  GDP growth  in the meanwhile  was revised up to 1 2  for the first three months of the year  Despite the uptick  most of Wall Street wasn t in a celebratory mood as it is still a disappointing outcome  mainly caused by a slowdown in consumer spending and inventories  Analysts noted that data doesn t signal at a strong rebound in the second quarter and that the Fed had made up its mind about monetary policy long before the GDP figures were released Upbeat Earnings Performance  Stretched ValuationsEarnings growth  did  scale to the highest level in over five years during the first quarter  It was also driven across various sectors and not concentrated in one area  But  we shouldn t forget that U S  equities have rallied sharply since last November  making them substantially more expensive when compared to profits Such equities are very stretched in terms of most valuation measures  which could lead up to a stock market bubble  After all  a highly valued stock market is more likely to result in lower returns Financial and Energy Sectors BleedTwo major U S  banks  J P  Morgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   and Bank of America   NYSE BAC   expressed caution over weakening trading in the second quarter  which eventually had a negative impact on the broader financial sector  J P  Morgan s second quarter trading is so far down about 15  compared with a year ago  while Bank of America s second quarter trading revenue is expected to be down slightly from a year ago Energy shares  in the meantime  continued their downtrend with U S  crude oil prices dipping below  48 and settling 2 7  lower at  48 32 a barrel  Investors doubt that the extended production caps by major producers and the summer driving season in the U S  won t do enough to reduce concerns about global supplies Buy 5 Best Dividend Aristocrats for Better ReturnsWith so many concerns on investors  minds  dividend paying stocks are tempting options at the moment  These stocks have tremendous financial strength and are immune to market vagaries  while stocks that pay dividends are willing to reward shareholders with cash payments   This is a sign that management is shareholder

10234,231749,SHW,Sherwin Williams  SHW  Misses Q2 Earnings  Sales Estimates ,opinion,"The Sherwin Williams Company s   NYSE SHW   earnings  excluding costs related to the proposed acquisition of Valspar   NYSE VAL   and gains from reduction in income tax provision  were  4 06 per share in second quarter 2016  Adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 17  Reported earnings climbed to  3 99 per share from  3 70 a year ago 
Improved operating results of the Paint Stores and Global Finishes Groups led to the increase in earnings  However  currency translation rate changes decreased earnings by 2 cents per share in the quarter 
Sherwin Williams  whose well known brands include Dutch Boy  Minwax and Krylon  recorded net sales of  3 219 5 million in the second quarter  marking a 2 8  year over year rise  Revenues  however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 276 million Increased paint sales volumes in Sherwin Williams  Paint Stores Group led to higher sales in the quarter  partly offset by unfavorable currency translation  Currency swings had an unfavorable effect of 1 5  on consolidated net sales  
Segment Review
The Paint Stores Group unit registered net sales of  2 11 billion in the reported quarter  up 6 2  year over year  The improvement was driven by increased architectural paint sales volume across all end markets  Net store sales from stores  open for more than 12 calendar months  rose 5 2  from the prior year quarter 
Net sales of the Consumer Group unit fell 2 6  to  477 5 million  mainly due to the initial shipments of HGTV HOME products by Sherwin Williams to Lowe s stores a year ago  The segment s profits reduced due to lower sales and increased SG A spending  partly neutralized by improved operating efficiencies 
Net sales from the Global Finishes Group segment were down 1 3  to  499 2 million in the quarter  mainly due to unfavorable currency impact that hurt sales by 2 6   Segment profits enhanced year over year  owing to a fall in costs of raw materials and good cost control  which were partly offset by unfavorable currency translations 
Latin America Coatings Group s net sales declined 11 2  to  133 3 million  mainly due to unfavorable currency translation and less volume  partly mitigated by a higher selling price  Unfavorable currency translation affected sales by 16 4  in the quarter  Segment profit decreased owing to increasing raw material costs and an unfavorable currency translation rate 
Financials and Shareholder Returns
Sherwin Williams made no open market purchases of its common stock in the six month period ending Jun 30  2016  As of Jun 30  2016  the company had  402 7 million cash in hand that will be used to finance the Valspar acquisition 
Outlook
Sherwin Williams  which is among the leading paint companies  along with PPG Industries Inc    NYSE PPG   and Akzo Nobel NV   OTC AKZOY    expects consolidated net sales to increase a low to mid single digit percentage in third quarter 2016  compared with last year s third quarter  The company anticipates earnings per share in third quarter 2016 to be in the range of  4 10  4 30 per share  Third quarter earnings per share include costs related to the planned acquisition of Valspar of around 20 cents per share and an increase in earnings per share of about 10 cents related to the decrease in the income tax provision   
For 2016  the company expects consolidated net sales to increase by a low single digit percentage compared with 2015  It raised its earnings per share guidance for 2016 to the range of  11 65  11 85 per share  compared to  11 16 earned in 2015  The full year guidance include costs related to the expected buyout of Valspar totaling about  1 30 per share and an increase in earnings of about 45 cents per share related to the reduction in the income tax provision SHERWIN WILLIAM Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

10235,231750,SHW,What Will Happen To Stocks When Interest Rates Rise  Part 1,opinion,"Introduction
Interest rates have been in a free fall for the better part of the past two decades  Moreover  the yield on the 10 year US Treasury  which is the flagship interest rate benchmark  has mostly been below 2  since the beginning of 2012  The 10 year Treasury note did reach 3  by the end of 2013 but has promptly fallen ever since to its current level of 1 59 percent 
In contrast  the stock market as measured by the S P 500 hovers at an all time high  Moreover  after the stock market bottomed in February 2009 as a result of the Great Recession  stock market investors have enjoyed a strong bull market that is now almost halfway into its 8th year running  Interestingly  as it relates to the thesis of this article  the stock market had one of its best performances in 2013 in spite of the 10 year Treasury note rising from 1 78  to 3 04  by the end of the year  To be clear  in direct conflict with conventional wisdom  both the stock market and interest rates rose dramatically in 2013 
Conventional wisdom has historically suggested that there exists an inverse relationship between interest rates and stock valuations  The logic goes something like this  When interest rates fall  fixed income investments become less competitive because of their lower yields  and therefore  stocks become more attractive as a result  Conversely  when interest rates rise  fixed income investments become more competitive because of their higher yields  and therefore  stocks become less attractive as a result 
Personally  I ve always considered this argument to be rational  even logical and sound  It seems to make good sense  because prudent and logically thinking investors should always be asking a rational question before investing in a stock  Could I get a safer and better return if I invested in something else  Since the 10 year Treasury note is considered one of the safest investments of all  it makes further sense to compare your return expectations on a stock with the theoretically risk free return of the 10 year Treasury note 
In Wall Street parlance this is often referred to as the  risk premium   also known as the  equity risk premium   Since investing in a stock involves greater risk  you should logically expect to earn a higher rate of return when investing in it  In other words  it is only rational to expect a higher rate of return that compensates you for the risk you are taking  Consequently  fixed income truly does become more competitive when interest rates are higher 
However  as logical as this is  it is only truly relevant when both markets are behaving within normal ranges  In economics the qualifying Latin term is  ceteris paribus  which loosely translates as all other things remaining equal or remaining the same  Unfortunately  the real world is often not so accommodating  All things do not remain equal or the same  therefore  other exogenous variables or factors can    and will    often come into play  As a result  the logical model between interest rates and stock values described above doesn t always work out as expected  Interestingly  this exception to the rule has been the norm for most of the past couple of decades   as this article will illustrate 
Interest Rates and Stock Values Since 1997
As previously stated  I have always considered the theoretical inverse relationship between stock values and interest rates as being a logical assumption  Consequently  I even developed a graph as a component of the F A S T  Graphs  research tool that measured a stock s P E ratio in relation to the interest rate of a 10 year Treasury note  When I first developed this graph  I expected to see this inverse relationship neatly at work  When interest rates were falling  I expected to see P E ratios moving in the opposite direction    and vice versa 
When I initially entered the industry in 1970  the inverse relationship between interest rates and the P E ratio of the stock market worked perfectly up until approximately calendar year 2000  Later I will provide a graphic illustrating how perfectly the P E ratio versus interest rate inverse relationship worked for much of my career  However  since calendar year 2000  both interest rates and the P E ratio of the S P 500 moved in lockstep with each other  Interest rates continued to fall and the P E ratio of the S P 500 also fell in the face of lower interest rates 
The following  PE Interest Rates  correlated graph clearly illustrates this fact  The dark blue line plots the year end P E ratio of the S P 500 each year and the red line plots the interest rate of the 10 year Treasury bond  Clearly we see both falling in almost perfect lockstep with each other  This is a direct contradiction of what I expected based on the logic presented previously  Consequently  this raises the question  what could have caused both P E ratios and interest rates to move in tandem since 2000 

The answer becomes clear when you evaluate the level of the market s  the S P 500  valuation in calendar year 2000  At the beginning of 2000  the P E ratio of the S P 500 was 28 8  which is approximately double a more normal P E ratio of 14 to 16  Consequently  this aberrantly high valuation for the S P 500 was a headwind that even falling interest rates could not overcome  The P E ratio of the S P 500 had nowhere to go but down from these lofty heights  This is a classic example of one of the exogenous factors I referenced above  Simply stated  falling interest rates did not have the expected effect on stock valuations that logic theoretically dictated 

As indicated earlier  I stated that the inverse relationship between interest rates and stock valuations performed generally as expected for most of my career  The following excerpt of a longer term graph  which I will present later  illustrates my point  The red line on the graph is interest rates  and the black line is the P E ratio of the S P 500  From approximately 1966 to 1982 interest rates fell and the P E ratio of the S P 500 rose as the model suggested  All was well with financial logic and modeling 
Then from 1982 to 2000 interest rates advanced strongly  and the P E ratio of the S P 500 dropped as a result   and as expected  Once again  all was well with financial logic and modeling  However  since calendar year 2000 the model appears broken  Interest rates continued to drop to record lows  and the P E ratio of the S P 500 also dropped along with interest rates  Clearly  during this period of time all things were not equal or the same 

As promised  here is the entire graph illustrating the relationship of the P E ratio of the S P 500 to interest rates going back to 1881  What I believe this extremely long term graph truly tells us is that there is some validity to the notion that P E ratios and interest rates will move inversely  However  this long term graph also illustrates that this logical relationship is not perfectly correlated  There are times when other factors will have an impact 

Consequently  I have concluded that the model suggesting that P E ratios and interest rates will move inversely remains a rational assumption  However  evidence also suggests that other important factors come into play and can have a significant effect on our expectations  Therefore  I would suggest not putting too much emphasis on any one metric or factor  including interest rates 
The Inspiration for This Article
I was inspired to write this article because of a question I received from a regular reader in the comment section of my most previous article   This question comment represents one of many I have received or have seen in my articles and in other articles written by other authors  I believe it speaks loudly to the thesis of this article  as well as part 2 of this series which will follow next  Moreover  I believe that both the question comment and my response nicely summarizes the thesis of what I m writing about here  Here is the question comment 
 It seems we are now in an abnormal period with interest rates quite low and even negative in many countries  This means many companies are borrowing at low rates and using these funds to buy back shares and thus increase EPS and in turn cause PE Ratios to decline  On the other hand whenever a company buys back shares it means less market shares are available since the prior owners of the bought back shares now have more cash to invest and thus tend to drive up PE ratios  This may seem trivial however in the WSJ of 7 13 they showed buybacks were  161 39B or a rate of  645B per year  It would seem this additional  645B would be invested somewhere and with fixed income rates so low it would seem to be the stock market tending to push PE Ratios higher 
My question is do you consider this low interest rate environment we are in  and it seems to be ongoing  when making investment decisions and specifically pertaining to PE Ratios  
Here is my response 
 Thanks for the question regarding my views on interest rates and their impact on P E ratios  First of all  I want to make a distinction between calculations attempting to determine the intrinsic value of a business versus the valuation that the market may place on a stock from time to time 
The former is all about attempting to establish a value of the business based on the company s earnings yield  A P E ratio of 15 represents an earnings yield of approximately 6 67   This essentially tells you how much yield you would be getting from the company s earnings power as an investor  Importantly  this calculation is independent of interest rates  Additionally  this type of calculation is attempting to determine how sound or attractive an investment in any given company might be 
In contrast  the valuation that the market may apply at any given time is an entirely different matter altogether  There is a notion that P E ratios will trend higher when interest rates are lower and vice versa  The logic behind this is based on the idea that bonds and other fixed income instruments become less competitive with stocks when rates are lower and more competitive when rates are higher  Therefore  the logic suggests that P E ratios will be higher during periods of low interest rates and vice versa 
Interestingly  I developed a graph to analyze the relationship between P E ratios and interest rates which is only available to premium subscribers to F A S T  Graphs   I developed this graph specifically based on that notion  However and here s the interesting part  as interest rates have fallen over the last few decades  P E ratios have actually fallen in tandem  The reason for this is because stock valuations were extremely high during the timeframe mid 1990s through the early 2000 s  Consequently  P E ratios fell over time in spite of the fact that interest rates were getting lower 
Additionally  the high P E ratios during the timeframe mid 1990s through the early 2000 s were occurring in spite of the fact that interest rates were high at the time  Consequently  the P E ratio interest rate relationship also belied logic at that time  My point being that interest rates are but one factor that might have an effect on how the market values businesses  However  it is only one of many other important factors 
Consequently  I prefer evaluating the value of a business based on the specific fundamental metrics that the business possesses and or is producing  In other words  calculating the intrinsic value of a business based on fundamentals independent of exogenous factors such as interest rates etc  
There are a couple of important takeaways from my response that I would like to focus the reader s attention on  The first is the point I made that valuations were aberrantly high during the timeframe mid 90s to early 2000 s which was also a period of peaking interest rates  In other words  stock valuations were very high even though interest rates were also very high 
The next takeaway is the fact that both stock valuations and interest rates dropped in tandem from 2000 to current time  However  even though that has occurred  current stock valuations in general are nevertheless currently abnormally high  Yes  they have fallen from their peaks in 2000  yet I believe the market is still moderately overvalued  although not as overvalued as it was in calendar year 2000 
The P E Ratio versus Interest Rates on Several Prominent Dividend Aristocrats
For additional insights  or perhaps additional confusion  I offer the following  PE Interest Rates  graphs on several prominent Dividend Aristocrats since 1997  What I believe these graphs illustrate is the reality that there is not a direct impact on valuations based solely on interest rates  Additionally  I believe these graphs illustrate that excessive overvaluation during the irrational exuberance timeframe  which culminated in calendar year 2000  had a greater impact on stock valuations than interest rates did

Summary and Conclusions
When I have money available for investment in common stocks  my primary focus is always on the specific financial health and valuation of the individual business I am considering  My principal questions are how strong is the business  past  present and future  and more importantly  is it currently available at an attractive valuation based on its fundamental merits  This is often referred to as a bottom up approach to investing  This is in contrast to a top down approach that attempts to focus on macro factors instead of micro factors 
My experience has taught me that the strongest companies with the best management teams figure out how to perform under all economic environments to include interest rates  My favorite companies demonstrate profitability to include dividend growth whether we are in a booming economy or recession  I do not invest in the economy  instead  I strive to invest in the best companies I can find when their valuations are sound  or better yet  when they are undervalued 
Therefore  when I am investing in best of breed companies at sound valuations  I m attracted to the fact that these companies have proven strong and successful regardless of the economic environment  To me  this speaks volumes about the quality of the companies and the skills of their management teams  Since I don t intend on directly running these companies  I look for companies where I can have confidence that management will be able to navigate the ever changing economic landscape and climate 
Nevertheless  in part 2  I will turn my attention to interest rates and their potential effects on the general economy  To me there is a significant distinction between the economic impacts of changes in interest rates in contrast to how it might affect the valuations of the individual companies I am specifically invested in  Prudence suggests that it is more difficult for a company to grow during challenging economic environments 
Therefore  I feel it is only prudent to evaluate what effect future economic conditions might have on my specific investments  However  I am confident that fairly valued companies will fare better going into challenging economic environments than overvalued companies will  This is only one of many reasons that I am so focused on investing only when fair valuation or undervaluation is manifest

10243,231758,SHW,The Week Ahead  Should Investors React To The Oil Price Rally ,opinion,"This week s economic calendar is pretty light  Market participants will be looking to an early getaway for the long weekend  While there will be plenty of entertaining FedSpeak  I expect a different topic to be at the fore  Pundits will be asking 
Should investors react to the oil price rally  
Last Week
The news was pretty good  but the stock market was not 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted that the punditry would be asking whether it was  springtime for housing   That was the recurring topic as housing news was reported on several different days and garnered plenty of discussion  Competition came from the Fed Minutes  some dramatic earnings reports  and the election race 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short  He has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis and several other charts providing long term perspective 

The News 
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic and market news  on balance  was pretty good 
The Good
Housing starts increased to a 1 172 annual rate  beating expectations  Calculated Risk has a   I am especially interested in single family building permits  a good leading indicator  Bob Dieli s monthly economic report always updates this chart 

Existing home sales were up 5 45 million  SAAR   the top of the Calculated Risk range for a solid report   

Note that January and February are usually the slowest months of the year and March and April are the beginning of the  selling season   This is a solid start to the year 


Jobless claims down ticked to 278K  in line with estimates and below the 300K level that some have been citing   The four week moving average was up slightly  
Industrial production rose by 0 7    has a good report  noting that this interrupts the downtrend since November  2014  He also points out the effect on the Atlanta Fed s GDP forecast for Q2  now up to 2 8 
Sentiment remains very negative  Urban Carmel summarizes asset allocations and economic skepticism  Ben Eisen of the WSJ   including the fund flows in the chart below  Schwab s   She notes only negative questions from both investors and advisors   all almost bordering on Armageddon  

The Bad
The Philly Fed index    1 8 on the diffusion index  Employment improved dramatically  but remained marginally negative  The outlook fell a bit but remained strongly positive  There was little market reaction 
Fed minutes showed more chance for a June rate increase  Our go to Fed expert    sees a June hike as a bit less than 50 50 but July as quite possible  The Fed remains more confident about the economy than most market participants 
LA port traffic declined   uses a rolling twelve month average to control for seasonality  The decline was 0 7  for inbound traffic and 0 8  for outbound   opines that this raises recession concerns 
Rail traffic  moves deeper into contraction    looks at a variety of rolling averages  including some analysis that adjusts for the declining coal shipments 
The Ugly
State and local pension funds  Chicago provides an example  A decision of the Illinois Supreme Court struck down an  overhaul  of the system  adding  11 5 billion to the deficit  now  18 6 billion  The fund covers 70 000 workers and in the absence of any changes  will run out of money in ten years    
Noteworthy
Try this financial literacy quiz designed by economists from Wharton and George Washington     I am confident that WTWA readers will do well  Keep in mind that less than 1 3 of the population could get all three questions right 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  This week s award goes jointly to  and  of the Bonddad Blog and xe com  Both take on the frequent current scary articles about the  flattening  yield curve  citing the yield difference between the ten year and two year notes  That spread is currently 0 94 percentage points  Those on a mission often cherry pick the part of the curve to analyze  and cry alarm whenever it gets a little smaller 
Epstein points out that until the curve actually inverts  a spread of less than zero  there is not a reliable recession indicator 

NDD has a great article with plenty of charts  He calls out the  doomers  with this commentary and chart 

In the last week or so there have been a spate of articles   from the usual Doomer sources but also from some semi respectable sites like Business Insider vans an investment adviser or two  see    to the effect that the yield curve is flattening and OMG RECESSION    Here s a typical Doomer graph   that draws a trend line that ignores the 1970s and neglects to mention that 2 of the 4 inversions even within the time specified don t fit 


I wish that more publications would recognize the Silver Bullet winners and writers like them  It is difficult to call out weak and biased posts  There is little reward for good and courageous analysis 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have a modest week for economic data  I highlight the most important items  helping us all to focus 
The  A  List
New home sales  T   Continuing strength in housing 
Durable goods  Th   Important April data  Continuing recent strength 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
Michigan sentiment  F   Best for job growth and prospective spending  Strength continuing 
The  B  List
Pending home sales  Th   Unlikely to match last month  Not as important as new sales  but a read on the market 
GDP second estimate for Q1  F   This will get attention  but it is old news by now with Q2 more than half over 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
There is plenty of FedSpeak  including a Friday appearance by Chair Yellen  Things will be slowing down by Friday as some slip away early for a long weekend marking the unofficial start of summer 
Next Week s Theme
It is a pretty light economic calendar  In addition to the daily dose of analysis by pseudo experts on the Fed  I expect to see some serious discussion about energy prices  
Will the oil rally continue  What does that imply for investors and traders  
Voting a tentative  No  is   who cites technical resistance and concludes as follows 

Will the oil rally stop here  We have no idea   but we wouldn t be surprised to see the rally get clogged up  at least temporarily 


 is also cautious but more bullish  mostly citing fundamentals  Their free edition includes this analysis 

Oil prices bounced around this week  flirting with  50 per barrel but stopping short of that key threshold  The major supply outages in Nigeria  now at 900 000 barrels per day  and Canada  more than 1 million barrels per day  continue to put upward pressure on oil prices as they are erasing the supply overhang  Still  much of that will be temporary  The EIA poured a bit of cold water on the rally this week  reporting a surprise uptick in oil stocks  At the same time  U S  production continues to slowly erode  The markets are more confident than at any point in recent weeks that prices won t crash back into the  30s  but more movement to the upside is not a given 

Their premium edition  which requires a subscription  is headlined   They cover a wide range of considerations  but include key questions  When might we expect Nigerian supply to rebound  Most investors would find their analysis quite helpful 

  The Niger Delta Avengers have  pipelines and platforms in Nigeria  knocking 800 000 barrels per day offline    Between 2006 and 2009 Nigeria suffered a similar level of attacks and outages  and a sweeping amnesty policy helped bring an end to the violence  The new President Muhammadu Buhari has taken a tougher line  ending patronage that existed in security contracts for many militia members  a move that has contributed to the resurgence in pipeline attacks    Nigeria s cash reserves are running low as its economy slows  Reserves have plunged from  49 billion in 2013 to  27 billion recently    Eni  NYSE E  suffered the latest attack this week  Fellow oil majors Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  have also seen their infrastructure taken out from explosions    Nigeria s oil production is at its lowest level since the 1980s  The attacks show no sign of letting up  and as of now the Nigerian government is unwilling to back down

Insight for Traders

Top Trading Advice
Dr  Brett Steenbarger has important advice about   He writes 

Markets move higher  markets move lower  The question worth continually posing is   Is the market getting stronger or weaker   This is a meaningful question because a market that moves higher can be getting weaker and a market that moves lower can be getting stronger

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read  it would be this   and not just because he has some kind words about WTWA  but thanks   As a psychologist and trading coach he sees things missed by others and explains them very well  I share many of his themes  but often cannot communicate them as well  People need to be open to new ideas and unemotional in executing the plan 
Few can meet these tests 
Stock Ideas
 has a timely post on cyclical stocks  He shows how to use his tools to analyze valuation in this difficult sector  When can these stocks be right for dividend oriented  conservative investors  Emerson Electric  NYSE EMR  is his illustration  If you agree with our experts that a recession is not imminent  cyclical stocks are a good place to shop 
How about Kroger  NYSE KR    makes this a good example of how to search for a good stock   find an interesting sector  a cheap stock  and a catalyst 
Retailers that might profit from the  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  effect      Hint  they need to change their business model 
Marc Gerstein has some   Marc always uses some science in his method  Here he identifies desired characteristics  develops a screen  and looks for a catalyst  It is another article that goes beyond simply delivering stock ideas  although it does that   Stock screening meets Peter Lynch 
How about solar  If energy prices improve  solar stocks do as well   has an interesting argument favoring First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  over some alternatives 
Outlook
Why is it so attractive to be negative on your investments  One good answer lies in  of volatility and how it can take investors off course  It is so easy to think about an account in terms of how far we are from the past high  In fact  that is the condition over 87  of the time  Each year includes a lot of big moves that seem small when you later look at the long term stock chart  He uses 1998 as a year of major gains  but only if you were able to ride out the major swings  I like this chart showing time spend below the prior high 

Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read AR every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in   There are always several great choices worth reading  but my favorite this week is from   He suggests that a good financial advisor helps clients by turning off the news spigot   If you do not use a financial advisor  I recommend that you turn it off anyway  You might make an exception for WTWA  

There s a valuable role for us to play as real financial advisers  that of the human curator  Do our clients really need to spend hours sorting through their feeds and trying to decode the headlines or could we be doing that for them  What should they be paying attention to 


For instance  one friend shared with me that when he turned off the financial news spigot  he calculated that he saved two to three hours every night  Do the math and it ends up being a savings of 40 or so days each year 

Value Stocks 
Time to buy again  They are  and that seemed to be the story last week 
Watch out for  
Boeing  NYSE BA    that demand for fuel efficient aircraft has declined 
Bonds and fund redemptions  If the ten year note increases one percentage point  to something like 2 8   you will immediately lose 9  on your investment  It would take a few years to make that up  even if rates moved no higher 
Investment big shots using a platform to talk their book  Are they really there to help you  This is an  of recommendations at the recent SALT conference  which was breathlessly covered in the media  Most of the topics would require a lot of research  but the Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW  recommendation  You can t buy paint online  caught my attention  It took about five seconds to discover the error of this assertion 
13F filings  Here is one example that highlights stocks from David Einhorn  This  and nearly everything written about 13F reports is misleading  This  headlining George Soros is especially misleading    for the second time  but no one cares  We can think of it as our secret 
Final Thoughts
Knowing economics helps to understand energy pricing  but the payoff for that knowledge has been delayed  In my most popular article ever on Seeking Alpha  I noted a few basic facts about energy including the relatively small gap between supply and demand  We are now observing the closing of that gap  It could  and will  continue in one of three ways 
Reductions in supply through economic forces  U S  producers responded  but most others have not   so far at least 
Increases in demand through a growing economy  This is happening with record miles driven in the U S  and many new consumers worldwide 
External shocks  through weather  disasters  or war 
The same economic effects may well push against a price increase  The reduction in rig counts  for example  seems to have paused for the first time in eight weeks   has one of their great charts using data from the primary source on drilling activity  the Baker Hughes weekly report 


Even if  50 barrel represents an intermediate high for oil prices there are important favorable consequences 
The savings to the consumer  compared to recent years  remains large 
The fears about failing companies and job losses  exaggerated and localized  will be less of a story  
The concern about banks failing due to oil company bankruptcies will be reduced 
Current oil prices may represent a sweet spot both for the energy sector and the overall stock market ",2016-05-22,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-how-should-investors-react-to-the-oil-price-200131298,200131298

10245,231760,SHW,Sherwin Williams Stock Has Risen Eighty  Thousand  Percent ,opinion,"I m sure most of you have heard the expression  like watching paint dry   which suggests something that is insufferably boring  Well  Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW   a paint company  appropriately enough  has a really boring stock  but it s the kind of  boring  that makes people incredibly rich 

Just take a good  long look at that stock  It has several interesting features 

It has been an insanely consistent performer  year after year  decade after decade
The stock has gone up over 80 000  since 1979  That s the kind of return in which your uncle gives you a thousand bucks of stock as a graduation gift  and you buy a house with it later 
I tried to look for the most severe drawdown I could  and it was something like 25  during the housing collapse  This is a paint company  and  umm  houses are kind of important to that industry   for Pete s sake  and that s the worst they got damaged  Absolutely amazing 

Of course  when one looks at this stock  as I am right now  one thinks   well  it s too late   And maybe it is  But I suspect in 2004  and 1997  and 1988  and 1983  and any other year you could name  the stock looked  too late  then  too 
A lot of stocks look like this these days       astonishing performers  but terrifyingly lofty  I think my time would be better spent on a time machine than charts  since one or two positions like this under your belt could mean you never have to work again ",2016-05-29,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eighty.-thousand.-percent-200132749,200132749

10274,231789,SHW,5 Stocks That Crushed Apple,opinion,"Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  has busted out to new all time highs this year and shares are already up 15 8  year to date  It is  once again  Wall Street s darling  And rightly so  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  is expected to grow earnings another 30  this year and has a forward P E of just 15 
It s fitting that exuberance has returned to the shares just in time for the NASDAQ to break out to new all time highs  But recently there have been a lot of stories on social media from people who are claiming they bought shares 5 or 10 years ago and are now rich  This comes on the heels of news reports covering political advisor David Axelrod s new book  which apparently recounts President Obama s reaction in 2007 after Steve Jobs showed him the iPhone before it was released to the public 
 If it were legal   Obama supposedly said   I would buy a boatload of Apple stock  This thing is going to be really big   The book isn t actually out yet  but this comment created a stir  Some reporters actually did a mock calculation of how much money the President would have made if he HAD invested in 2007  Without a doubt  if you had bought Apple shares  NASDAQ AAPL O  8 years ago you d be doing really well for yourself  It has been a great investment 
The Myth of the One Great Investment
But this storyline plays into one of the great investing myths  That mythology says that if you only would have bought the hottest  most dynamic company  10  20 or even 30 years ago  you would have been rich  It is the great myth of buying  the one   And everyone seemingly knows someone who has an uncle who DID just that so the mythology lives on 
Investors therefore spend endless time and effort attempting to find this one unicorn company  After all  wasn t it obvious when Apple came out with the iPhone that it was going to make billions  Yet  in reality  Apple hasn t even been one of the top performing stocks over the last 5 years but you wouldn t know it from the stories people tell  It always comes back to Apple 
Look Beyond the Glamour Names
But money can be made by investing in all sorts of companies in many different industries  What if I told you you could have bought a pizza restaurant chain that has been around since 1960 and more than doubled Apple s return over the last 5 years  Don t be blinded by the glamorous  popular names  Look for companies with solid fundamentals  such as double digit earnings growth  and an attractive valuation 
Yes  Apple may still fall on your list of top companies  But don t rule out lesser known companies like a rural retailer  It is serving a niche market that you may never have thought about  If you had invested in these less popular options 5 years ago  you would be crushing the Apple return over the same period today 
5 Stocks that Crushed Apple the Last 5 Years

10275,231790,SHW,Fed s Patience Send Bulls Charging,opinion,"U S  stocks found support once again last week and rallied on strong volume  Of course  the main catalyst was the FOMC policy statement on Wednesday that maintained its dovish language with a pledge of considerable time before raising the fed funds rate and adding that it would be patient as it begins the process of normalizing monetary policy  The result was yet another classic V bottom  Ho  ho  ho  Say hello to Santa Claus 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
For the week  the S P 500 had a total return of  3 4   led by a huge  9 7  bounce in beleaguered Energy sector  Basic Materials also looked strong with a  5 0  rally  For the year  the S P 500 is up nearly  12  through Friday  And then on Monday of this week  the S P 500 logged a new closing high  although the intraday high from December 5 still stands  Last Thursday s big move resulted in a 421 point gain for the Dow Jones Industrials  which was its best one day performance in three years  and the 709 points totaled on Wednesday and Thursday was its best two day performance since 2008 
With Santa lurking on the horizon  bears have run for cover from the charging bulls  Moreover  Fundstrat reported that 71  of active fund managers are trailing their respective benchmarks  which would be the worst such percentage since 1998  So  they needed to do some catch up in accumulating U S  equities  Notably  1998 closed with a similar end of year rally  Also  this is the time of year in which many companies announce increases to their dividend payments  And don t forget  this year s IPO market has been the busiest since the crazy days of 2000  with 273 new IPOs  compared with 406 in 2000  and  85 billion raised  vs   97 billion in 2000  
Crude oil has fallen  48  below the June highs  so it s not surprising that the Energy sector led last week s big rally  At current levels  there is more upside potential than further downside and a solid long term risk reward profile  And given the surge in insider buying  company executives seem to agree  Nevertheless  some prominent London hedge funds have been adding to their short positions in European companies with the highest sensitivity to falling oil prices  so not everyone thinks the bottom is in 
In desperate response to plunging oil revenues and the resultant plunging ruble from capital flight  Russian president Putin jacked rates by  6 5  up to 17   thus providing the intense pressure that economic sanctions could not   And the timing of President Obama s move to normalize relations with Cuba probably was related  
Nominal GDP is up  4 0  over the past year  The Conference Board Leading Economic Index has shown steady improvement and gaining momentum all year  And as we complete Q3 earnings season and look ahead to Q4 reports  sell side analysts are anticipating EPS of  29 92 for the S P 500 companies  which is an increase of  5 5  from Q4 2013  and total 2014 EPS growth is expected to come in at  7 5   compared with  4 5  for 2013  This would be the best earnings growth since 2011 s  14 3  
With a patient and friendly Fed providing ongoing tailwinds  strong GDP growth should continue into 2015 and beyond  which should propel equities to further heights  although the future for long term bond prices is not so clear  Although the near term will likely provide a flattening yield curve  eventually economic health will demand higher long term rates and a steeper yield curve 
While 2015 appears to be shaping up similarly to 2014  i e   lower equity correlations  higher volatility  and modest increase in U S  equities  some observers are suggesting investors gain greater exposure to less directional equity strategies  such as long short  long hedged strategies  and market neutral  Also  many believe that given the dominance in large caps this year  we will need to see outperformance from small caps  and perhaps emerging markets 
Sabrient s annual Baker s Dozen portfolio of 13 top picks for the year is up about  22  since its January 13 launch through Friday s close  while the S P 500 is up  16  over the same timeframe  Top performers include Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  and NXP Semiconductors NV  NXPI   Baker s Dozen represents a sector diversified group of stocks based on our Growth At a Reasonable Price  GARP  quant model and confirmed by a rigorous forensic accounting review by our subsidiary Gradient Analytics to help us avoid the landmines  It is packaged as a unit investment trust  UIT  by First Trust Portfolios  note  the new 2015 Baker s Dozen portfolio will launch on January 14  
Sabrient also publishes a handful of thematic indexes that are tracked by various ETFs  Year to date  while the S P 500 is up about  11 8   the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF  NYSE KNOW  is up  17 6   the Guggenheim Defensive Equity ETF  NYSE DEF  is up  13 3   and the Guggenheim Insider Sentiment ETF  NYSE NFO  is up  5 7   flat performance for second half of year caused it to lag  
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY  closed Friday at 206 52  and then on Monday this week it hit a new closing high of 207 47   As I suggested it might  the SPY found solid support last week and stabilized while working off its severely overbought technical condition and reconfirming bullish conviction  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic all have reversed and look strong for further upside  Support levels include the 20 day simple moving average near 205  the 50 day SMA at 201  the 100 day SMA at 199  the bottom of the bullish rising channel around 198  and the 200 day SMA at 195  Overhead resistance resides at current levels  new highs   followed by the top of the bullish rising channel around 210 

I am still hopeful that last week s technical pullback was what the market needed in order to avoid a more dramatic downside event in early January 
Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
 Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  The rankings continue to remain stable  as Technology and Healthcare stay at the top  Technology ranks first with a robust Outlook score of 90  Tech stocks display the best return ratios  a good forward long term growth rate  a reasonably good forward P E  and decent support among insiders  buying activity   Healthcare scores a 75 and displays good sell side analyst support  recent upward revisions to earnings estimates   a strong forward long term growth rate  solid insider sentiment  buying activity   and good return ratios  although its forward P E is on the high side  Financial remains in third with a score of 66  and it displays the best  lowest  forward P E  Rounding out the top six are Utilities  Consumer Services Discretionary  and Industrial  Notably  stocks within the Consumer Services Discretionary  a k a   Cyclicals  sector held up well during the recent market weakness and the sector continues to get the greatest support from both analysts and insiders while boasting the highest forward long term growth rate 
2  Energy continues to hold the bottom spot  primarily due to Wall Street analysts continuing to revise downward their earnings expectations and reduce the forward long term growth rate  Also  insiders have slowed their open market buying activity  and with last week s price recovery  the forward P E is higher  worse   Joining Energy in the bottom two again is Telecom  which generally scores poorly across the board in most factors in the Outlook model 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy suddenly surged to the top with a score of 60  based on last week s strong performance during the market s huge rally  Basic Materials is close behind at 59  Consumer Services Discretionary scores the lowest at 48  The top bottom spread is only 12 points  which still reflects high sector correlations during particularly strong market days  i e   highly correlated risk on action  But it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide  risk on  mentality 
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities again displays the highest score of 63 this week  as one would expect for this traditionally defensive sector  Utilities stocks have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  and it is followed closely by Consumer Services Discretionary  somewhat surprisingly   and then Healthcare and Consumer Goods Staples  Basic Materials displays the lowest score of 41  followed by Energy  The top bottom spread is a wide 22 points  although it is tighter than last week s 29   reflecting low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  In other words  certain sectors are holding up relatively well while others are selling off  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Technology displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed closely by Healthcare  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities and Healthcare are the clear leaders  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Basic Materials is the worst  indicating general investor avoidance 
6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still look bullish to me  particularly given the continued strength in Consumer Services Discretionary  Five of the top six sectors are economically sensitive  or in the case of Healthcare  all weather   and they also display generally strong Bull scores  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   continues to indicate a bullish bias this week  and it suggests holding Healthcare  Basic Materials  and  new surprise   Utilities  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based trend following standpoint because SPY is above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages   
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Healthcare  Basic Materials  and Utilities sectors include iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB   PowerShares DWA Basic Materials Momentum Portfolio  NYSE PYZ   and Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF  Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index  NYSE FUTY   
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Healthcare  Basic Materials  and Utilities sectors include United Therapeutics  NASDAQ UTHR  C R  Bard  NYSE BCR   LyondellBasell Industries  NYSE LYB   The Sherwin Williams Company  SHW   Pinnacle West Capital  NYSE PNW   and Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  except for the Utilities stocks  which are not covered by EQR   We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you prefer to maintain a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology  Healthcare  and Financial  in that order  And if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Healthcare  and  surprise   Consumer Services Discretionary  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  Some readers have been asking for more specifics on how to trade our sector rotation strategy based solely on what I discuss in my weekly newsletter  Thus  I feel compelled to remind you that I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio ",2014-12-23,Scott Martindale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fed’s-patience-send-bulls-charging-236607,236607
10277,231792,SHW,S P 500 Sector ETF Primer  Here s All You Need To Know,opinion,"It s pretty easy to understand the appeal of indexing  particularly after a year like 2014   beat their respective benchmark last year  And those few that did beat their benchmarks did so by a pitiful margin of just 1 8  on average 
Even worse  many fund managers are really just closet indexers  There is too much career risk in going against the grain  so most large fund managers tend to buy the same stocks and sink or swim together  So   why pay steep fees to active managers for underperformance when you can buy an index mutual fund or ETF with expense ratios of 0 1  or even lower in some cases 
But indexing doesn t have to mean dumping your nest egg into an S P 500 ETF like the SPDR S P 500 ETF Trust  ARCA SPY  and taking whatever the market gives you  Performance can vary wildly by sector  and if you can add value by allocating to individual sector funds  it makes all the sense in the world to try  For example  just by virtue of being out of the worst performing sectors   energy in 2014 and utilities year to date in 2015   you could have beaten the S P 500 by a few percentage points 
Let s do a deep dive into each of the nine Select Sector SPDR ETFs  We ll go over what each has to offer   and what it doesn t 
Technology Select Sector SPDR 
I ll start with the Technology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK   as technology is the biggest component of the S P 500 by a pretty wide margin  Tech stocks make up more than 18  of the S P 500 
Unfortunately   and surprisingly  given the perception of technology as a growth sector   the Technology Select Sector SPDR has the second worst performance of all nine sectors since the inception of the Select Sector ETFs in 1998  Only the financial sector ETF had worse performance   and just barely 
Over the past 16 years  XLK has managed to generate annual returns of just 3 3   This is a true testament to how overvalued the tech sector was in the late 1990s  though a contrarian might consider this a bullish sign for returns going forward 
When you buy XLK  you re getting access to the familiar names in consumer electronics  computing and business services  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  is the biggest holding  at 18  of the portfolio  which is befitting a company with a market cap of  740 billion  But Microsoft Corporation  NASDAQ MSFT   Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  and Google Inc  NASDAQ GOOGL   NASDAQ GOOG  also feature prominently in the top 10 holdings  If you want Big Tech  you re getting it in XLK 
But what you re not getting is exposure to exciting new technology  Outside of Facebook  social media is hardly represented at all  and some of the biggest holdings are slow growing  old tech  companies like Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ   International Business Machines Corp   NYSE IBM  and Cisco Systems Inc   NASDAQ CSCO  
XLK charges 0 15   or  15 annually for every  10 000 invested  in expenses  The same can be said about the rest of these Select Sector SPDR ETFs 
Energy Select Sector SPDR
Next up is the proverbial red headed stepchild of the past year  the Energy Select Sector SPDR  ARCA XLE   As the price of crude oil has collapsed in the past year  so have the share prices of most energy stocks  The Energy Select Sector SPDR is the only sector ETF of the nine to be in negative territory over the past 12 months  down about 8   It s also the worst performing sector of the past five years  with annual returns of less than 4  
Interestingly   and indicative of how cheap and unloved energy stocks were during the 1990s tech boom   the Energy Select SPDR ETF is the best performing sector since the inception of the Select Sector ETFs in 1998  with returns just shy of 10  per year 
When you buy XLE  you get the oil majors  Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  and Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  make up 16  and 13  of the portfolio  respectively  But you also get quality oil field servicers like Schlumberger Limited  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL   which make up 7 2  and 2 8  of the portfolio  respectively  and pipeline operators like Kinder Morgan Inc  NYSE KMI  and Williams Companies Inc  NYSE WMB   which make up another 4 4  and 3  of the portfolio  respectively 
What you don t get  unfortunately  are the high dividend yields you might expect from an ETF dominated by payout champs like Exxon Mobil  Chevron  Kinder Morgan and Williams  XLE sports a dividend yield of just 2 4   This is due to the prevalence of low yielding exploration and servicing companies that dominate the sector once you get past the top 10 holdings 
Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR 
The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF  ARCA XLY  has been a real standout performer among the Select Sector ETFs  and one of the most consistent  It s leading the pack year to date with returns of about 5 3   and its returns over the past three  five and 10 years  as well as since inception  place it near the top over each time period 
The strong performance is all the more remarkable given that it has covered a period of time that saw two deep recessions  two major wars and the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression  There was simply no stopping American consumers from swiping their credit cards 
When you buy XLY  you re getting some of the major corporate names you might expect  including theme park operator and TV and movie studio Walt Disney Co  NYSE DIS   which is the largest holding at 7  of the portfolio  You also get some of the larger retail chains like Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD   Lowe s Companies  Inc  NYSE LOW  and Target Corporation  NYSE TGT  and more frivolous places to drop a few quick bucks like Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX  and Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc  NYSE CMG  
But you also get some less intuitive fit  There are consumer staples esque stocks  such as discount chain Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   You ll also find automakers General Motors  NYSE GM  and Ford  NYSE F   media giants Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  and Time Warner  NYSE TWX   and Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   a company that is as much a tech stock as it is a retailer 
Stocks that you might think of as true  discretionaries   like high end jewelry and fashion  don t make up a significant part of the portfolio at all  XLY is full of high quality names you come across in your daily life  most of which can fairly be considered  consumer discretionary   But given the mismatched collection of companies that fill out the ETF  it is by no means a pure play 
Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR 
Next up is the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  ARCA XLP   XLY s ugly stepsister 
I m joking  of course  The staples ETF is more conservative than the discretionaries ETF and most of its holdings less flashy  but it is full of names we all know and love  Procter   Gamble Co  NYSE PG    the ultimate seller of disposable sundries   is the largest holding at 12 5  of the portfolio  The Coca Cola Co  NYSE KO   Wal Mart Stores  Inc  NYSE WMT   Philip Morris International  NYSE PM  and CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  also make up a good slice of the portfolio 
There are a few head scratchers here  I m not sure why Target and Dollar Tree are  discretionaries  while Walmart is a  staple   I also find it odd that a luxury grocer like Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM   or a whiskey maker like Brown Forman Corporation  NYSE BFb  are considered staples   I mean  I suppose you could argue Jack Daniel s and organic pomegranate farmed by the hard working indigenous famers of Kerplackistan are essential to life   But for the most part  the holdings of XLP make sense 
Yet despite XLP s conservative portfolio   and despite the fact that its loaded with some of the highest yielding stocks on the market  such as tobacco stocks   XLP yields only a modest 2 4  in dividends  If you re looking for yield  you re better off poaching some of XLP s higher yielding holdings than holding the ETF outright 
Financial Select Sector SPDR 
The worst performing sector ETF of the past 10 years and since the 1998 inception of the Select Sector SPDRs is  of course  the Financial Select Sector SPDR  ARCA XLF   Over the past 10 years  it returned 0 14  per year  Since inception  it managed to eke out 2 6  per year 
Given that the worst financial crisis since 1907 centered around this sector  it s remarkable that its returns are positive at all 
Interestingly   and indicative of how far the global banking giants have fallen   the largest holding in this ETF isn t a bank at all  It s  s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc  NYSE BRKb   which is considered an insurance company by Standard   Poor s  Berkshire Hathaway makes up just shy of 9  of the portfolio 
Following quickly behind is one of Berkshire Hathaway s largest long term holdings  Wells Fargo   Co  NYSE WFC   And of course  following Wells Fargo are some of its less prudent competitors  JP Morgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC  and Citigroup Inc  NYSE C   Most of the rest of the portfolio is made up of smaller banks  asset managers and brokerage houses 
For the time being  XLF also has a decent sized exposure to REITs  at about 12  of the portfolio  This is absurd  as there is no practical reason why a shopping mall landlord like Simon Property Group Inc  NYSE SPG  should ever be in the same sector ETF as Goldman Sachs Group Inc  NYSE GS  
Luckily  this anomaly won t be around for much longer  Standard   Poor s is giving REITs their own standalone sector  and presumably the State Street Select Sector SPDR ETFs will follow suit   The SPDR ETFs do deviate from time to time  For example  telecom and technology  which S P breaks into two sectors  share a single SPDR ETF  
Health Care Select Sector SPDR
Next up is the Health Care Select Sector SPDR  ARCA XLV   The Health Care ETF has been one of the very best performers  generating annualized 28 1  returns over the past three years and 8 5  annualized returns since the inception of the SPDR series in 1998  28 1  annualized returns are the stuff of 1990s dot com memory  yet came from one of the S P 500 s more conservative sectors 
Call it the Obamacare trade 
What you get with XLV is a who s who list of big pharmaceutical companies like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  and Merck   Co  NYSE MRK   You also get exposure to the bigger and more established biotech names  like Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   and Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   and to health insurance companies 
What you are distinctly not getting is a good dividend payer  The days when the health sector was considered a high yield sector are over  XLV is one of the lowest yielding sector funds with a dividend yield of just 1 3  
Industrials Select Sector SPDR
Next we get to the Industrials Select Sector SPDR  ARCA XLI   Despite being considered a cyclical sector  the industrials have managed to put up consistent and respectable returns over the life of the SPDR series  Over the past three   five  and 10 year periods  XLI generated returns of 18   17 1  and 7 8   respectively 
The holdings here are going to include household names like General Electric Company  NYSE GE    a company that is thankfully getting back to its industrial roots and leaving its experimentation as a bank in the past 
3M Co  NYSE MMM   Boeing Co  NYSE BA  and Lockheed Martin Corporation  NYSE LMT  also make the top 10  as you might expect  But XLI also has quite a few stocks that you might not think of as  industrials   per se  including airlines like Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  and parcel companies like United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  
And somewhat bizarrely  white collar headhunting firm Robert Half International  NYSE RHI  makes the list as well 
Don t expect much in the way of dividends with this ETF  At 1 8   its yield is about in line with the broader S P 500 
Materials Select Sector SPDR
Next on the list is the Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF  ARCA XLB   XLB s performance over its life has been quite good  roughly doubling the return of the S P 500 since inception in 1998 
This sector ETF is not at all what it sounds like  When you hear  materials   you expect a portfolio full of mining companies  But the materials sector ETF is more diverse than that  Chemical companies EI Du Pont De Nemours And Co  NYSE DD    which most know better as DuPont   and Dow Chemical Co  NYSE DOW  are the first and third largest holdings  at 11 5  and 8 9  of the portfolio  respectively  Agribusiness giant Monsanto Company  NYSE MON  fills in the gap at No  2  with 9 5  of the portfolio 
Paper products company International Paper Co  NYSE IP  and paint seller Sherwin Williams Co  NYSE SHW  also make the top ten holdings  The largest mining company in the portfolio  Freeport McMoRan Inc  NYSE FCX    makes up only 3  of the portfolio 
In XLB  you get a solid portfolio of global industrial companies  You distinctly do not get a collection of volatile mines at risk of copper price swings 
Utilities Select Sector SPDR
And finally  we get to the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLU    The utilities sector was one of the real standouts of the last year  up about 16   And for calendar year 2014  the utilities sector was the strongest performer of all sectors  due in no small part to the massive decline in bond yields 
As the most  bond like  of all sectors  utilities tend to move with bond yields  This was a disaster in 2013  the year of the  taper tantrum   And it s shaping up to be a disaster this year  as the utilities sector is the only S P 500 sector currently in the red year to date  XLU is down more than 6  since the start of the year 
If you re looking for a portfolio of boring  regulated basic utility companies like Duke Energy Corp  NYSE DUK  or Dominion Resources  Inc   NYSE D   then XLU is the ETF for you 
But if you re specifically hunting for high yield  you might want to keep looking  After the run XLU had  its dividend yield has fallen all the way to just 3 3

10285,231800,SHW,Chemical Industry Stock Outlook  Improving Trends ,opinion,"The chemical industry had a bumpy ride in 2013 as a weak European economy  effects of sequestration in the U S  along with certain industry specific challenges led to subdued demand for chemicals for most of the year  Nevertheless  the December quarter showed signs of life with improving trends across key industries  raising hopes of a recovery  Although the quarter showed continued recovery across commercial construction and electronics end markets  the industry is not out of the woods  Questions about the emerging markets and a still challenging economic backdrop in Europe remain roadblocks  But the industry is expected to fare relatively better in 2014  aided by a shale gas boom in the U S   healthy Chinese demand and significant capital investment  Chemical makers are ratcheting up investment on shale gas linked projects to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies which is expected to boost capacity and export in 2014 and beyond  Strength across agriculture and automotive markets and healthy demand in emerging geographies represent tailwinds for the industry  Strong agricultural market fundamentals in Latin America and a gradual revival in the housing market bode well for recovery prospects this year 
Industry at a Glance
Chemicals are used to make consumer goods and are also used in the agriculture  manufacturing  construction and service industries  In fact  the chemical industry    a roughly  5 trillion global business    itself consumes 26  of its own output  Major industrial consumers include rubber and plastic  textiles  apparel  petroleum refining  pulp  paper and primary metals  The chemical industry is among the biggest industries in the U S   a roughly  770 billion enterprise  It is cyclical by nature and heavily linked to the overall condition of the U S  and world economies  The chemical industry touches 96  of manufactured goods  making the manufacturing industry the biggest consumer of chemical products  The U S  chemical industry represents more than 15  of the global chemical output and employs nearly 800 000 people  It constitutes roughly 12  of the nation s exports  aggregating  188 billion annually  Roughly 6 million additional jobs are backed by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry  The U S  chemical industry supports around 25  of the nation s gross domestic product  GDP  Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  the chemical industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  which had a 3 1  share of total earnings for the S P 500 in 2013  We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit    The way to look at the complete list of 260  industries is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower  is positive  the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  177 and higher  is negative  We have three chemicals related industries  Chemical Plastics  Chemical Diversified and Chemical Specialty  The Chemical Plastics industry currently retains a Zacks Industry Rank  10  placing it in the top 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  Both Chemical Diversified and Chemical Specialty industries lie in the middle one third with a Zacks Industry Rank  164 and  172  respectively  Looking at the exact location of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the chemical industry as a whole is positive to neutral 
Sector Level Earnings Trends
Looking at the overall results of the broader Basic Materials sector  earnings shot up 20 7  in the fourth quarter 2013  due mostly to easy comparisons    a marked improvement from a 2 2  rise in the third  Total revenues were up 1 5  in the fourth quarter versus a 1 1  rise a quarter ago  The sector racked up an earnings beat ratio  the percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  of 66 7  and revenue beat ratio of 54 2  in the fourth quarter  The earnings picture for the first quarter shows broad based weakness  Basic Materials is among the major sectors that are expected to

increase  Revenues are forecast to expand 2 4   For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our latest  Earnings Trends  Key Feedstock Price Trends The chemical industry uses oil  naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs  According to chemical giant BASF SE  BASF NS   the price of Brent crude oil averaged  109 per barrel in 2013  below 2012 average of  112  Brent crude prices touched a nine month high of  119 in Feb 2013  triggered by geopolitical tension in the Middle East  exacerbated by Iran s nuclear program  Prices eased to below  100 in Apr 2013 on weak demand outlook for oil  Brent crude has hovered between a high of  112 and a low of  104 so far this year  averaging at around  108  The price of the other key raw material  naphtha  which is produced from oil  ranged between  985 per metric ton and  820 per metric ton in 2013  based on the BASF report  Naphtha prices averaged  902 last year  lower than the 2012 average of  937  The average annual price of natural gas in the U S  was  3 73 per million British thermal units  mmbtu  in 2013  higher than  2 75 in 2012 Chemical Recovery Gathering Steam The chemical industry is poised for a recovery this year and the next  The American Chemistry Council  ACC   an industry trade group  foresees national chemical output  excluding pharma  to rise 2 5  in 2014  up from a 1 6  increase in 2013  and further improve to a 3 5  gain next year  Growth will be backed by strong agricultural market fundamentals  healthy demand from light vehicles market and a recovery in the housing market manifested by increase in building permits and a steady pick up in home prices  U S  chemical exports are expected to rise 6 6  this year and 7 6  in 2015  leading to continued generation of trade surplus  Trade in chemicals is expected to rise with a recovery in global manufacturing activities  On the global front  ACC sees production to move up 3 8  in 2014 and 4 1  in 2015 with healthy gains expected across North America and emerging markets  The ACC expects strong capital spending in the coming years  stemming from new investments in petrochemicals and derivatives  It envisions U S  capital spending to reach  61 2 billion by 2018  The shale gas boom is expected to drive investment on plants and equipment in the U S  The ACC expects U S  chemical revenues to surpass  1 trillion and the industry to rake in record trade surpluses by 2018  partly boosted by significant share gas driven chemical capacity  According to the European Chemical Industry Council  CEFIC   which represents the European chemicals industry  chemical output was flat year over year in Europe in 2013  modestly better than an expected 0 5  decline  Weak demand across automotive and construction markets remain as overhang  contributing to fragile recovery  Nevertheless  CEFIC expects recovery in the European chemicals industry to continue at a sluggish pace and sees a 1  rise in output in 2014  aided by an uptick in exports OPPORTUNITIES Shale Boom Driving Chemical Investment According to the ACC  emerging market growth and favorable oil to gas price ratios resulting from abundant shale gas production are driving U S  chemical exports  A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets  including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and healthy demand from the emerging markets  Affordable natural gas and ethane  derived from shale gas  offer U S  producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive  oil based feedstock  New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are boosting shale production  bringing down prices of ethane in the process  Leveraging the abundant natural gas supply and cost advantage  chemical companies are investing billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  that produce ethylene from ethane  The U S  has emerged as an attractive investment location and chemical makers are aggressively expanding capacity in the country  A recent ACC report indicated that potential domestic chemical investment related to share gas has reached as high as  100 billion  more than 50  of which are from firms outside of the U S  Already 148 projects    backed by Federal government support    have been announced by chemical makers to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies  These projects may lead to  81 billion in new chemical industry output annually and 637 000 permanent new jobs by 2023  Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years Agriculture  A Compelling Opportunity Major chemical makers are increasingly shifting focus on businesses that cater to agriculture and nutrition markets in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand and input costs pressure  In particular  agriculture is emerging as a lucrative market as evident from recent trends  A healthy start in the North American growing season  strong planting activity by growers across North and Latin America  solid order book and healthy supply of seeds and crop protection products represent driving factors Strategic Actions Mergers and acquisitions offer chemical companies another means to shore up growth in a still challenging economic scenario  These companies remain focused on exploring growth opportunities in the fast growing emerging markets  particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America  Moreover  cost cutting measures implemented by chemical companies including plant closures and headcount reduction should yield industry wide margin improvements  Cash flows derived through these actions can be used for growth Recovery in Chinese Demand China  a major market  is expected to see a recovery in 2014  Government stimulus actions coupled with efforts to stem inflation appear to bear fruit and exports to the U S  and other key markets are regaining momentum  An improved demand outlook for China augurs well for the chemical industry this year Stocks We Like Chemical stocks that we like include The Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW   PPG Industries Inc   NYSE PPG   Methanex Corp   MEOH O   DuPont   NYSE DD   Eastman Chemical Company  NYSE EMN  and Celanese Corp   CE   Dow and DuPont  in particular  are witnessing strong momentum in agriculture  driven by higher demand for crop protection products WEAKNESSES Macro Headwinds Persistent weakness in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near term uncertainty  Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand  Given the industry s sensitivity to the global economy  any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical companies  In addition  weakness still persists in commercial construction  which is among the key end use markets  Demand from some of the major manufacturing industries remains below the historic levels Pricing  FX Pressure Commodity prices  though subsiding of late  still remain a concern for many of the U S  chemical producers  Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy  given the competitive pressures at play  As a result  margins for a number of producers may be under pressure  In addition  chemical companies generate a major chunk of their revenues outside the U S   and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations  Currency exchange translation remains a headwind for these companies A Still Cloudy Agrichemical Space Agricultural chemicals and fertilizer makers face challenges following the exit of world s largest potash maker Uralkali Group from one of the biggest potash cartels    the Belarus Potash Company  BPC     that influence potash pricing by controlling the production and supply  Uralkali s Board decided to end export sales through BPC and direct all potash export through its Switzerland based trade arm Uralkali Trading  This game changing move has put pressure on pricing  Moreover  demand for potash and phosphate remains somewhat weak in India  a key import market  Indian government s move to trim potash subsidy levels coupled with local currency devaluation contributing to lower demand for the nutrient in that country Stocks Warrant Caution We hold a bearish view on Air Products and Chemicals Inc   NYSE APD  and The Sherwin Williams Company  NYSE SHW   We also steer clear of companies in the agricultural chemical space  Companies that fit the bill

 After several lackluster quarterly earnings reports  Google hit it out of the park on Thursday  Given the strength of the move  Google looks to now be the large  open ended growth story that must be involved in every portfolio discussion 
Google announced strong results and its stock responded in kind  In the hours that followed  it gained nearly a Benjamin  going from  580 to  673  This  65 billion increase in market value was the second highest single day gain of all time  eclipsed only by Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  at the peak of the Bubble in 2000 
Google helped their cause with the debut of CFO Ruth Porat  who was able to speak Wall Street s language  Former CFO  Patrick Pichette   super competent by all accounts   spoke French  The words Porat whispered into investors  ears were that  1  Google is focused on making money on mobile  and  2  The company is showing discipline  The hyperbolic positive reaction to Ms  Porat  who joined Google from Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  on May 26  was as much for the promises of tomorrow as the performance of the past  Google s quest for world domination has been fueled by a vision for a digital empire that is in many ways borderless  Give us your tired  your poor  your huddled masses  but also your smartphones  your apps  your cars  your homes  and your data  Much of Google s success has been driven by the creation of  open  systems that derive value from the access and participation of third parties  Launched in 2007  Google s open mobile operating system  Android  has become a dominant global platform  powering over 78  of smartphones shipped in 2015  Android documentation and technical specifications are widely available to the public and it has become the operating system of choice for technology companies and developers seeking ready made  low cost  and customizable software  Today  Android powers everything from smartphones to wearable devices  televisions  and cars

 There were some other interesting earnings tidbits that came out last week 
  Lower fuel prices helped CSX to a beat  Investors jumped on board CSX Corp   NYSE CSX   after the largest railroad operator on the U S  east coast reported second quarter profits ahead of estimates  The Jacksonville  Florida based company reported profits of  553m  or 56 cents a share  compared with  529m  or 53 cents a share  in the year ago period  Sales fell 6 percent to  3 06bn  Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 53 cents a share on sales of  3 1bn  writes Mamta Badkar  The company said lower fuel prices and savings from efficiency initiatives resulted in a 9 percent drop in expenses and resulted in a record operating income of  1bn for the quarter 
  Schlumberger s comments were notable for all oil service stocks   As we enter the second half of the year  our visibility still remains limited  In terms of oil supply  the first signs of flattening North America production have appeared  while OPEC marketed supply has been increased once again  Non NAM  non OPEC production weakened in the first half of the year  driven by falls in Brazil and Mexico  with further softening expected as lower investment levels start to take full effect  The latest supply data  together with a strong outlook for global oil demand  point to a tightening of the global supply demand balance  even with additional supply from Iran  E P investment in North America is now expected to fall by more than 35  in 2015  driven by lower land activity and increased pricing pressure  We believe that the North American rig count may now be touching the bottom  and that a slow increase in both land drilling and completion activity could occur in the second half of the year  
  BB T  NYSE BBT  Bank noted that the home purchase market is really picking up   look  purchase activity is really picking up  new home construction is up substantially and new home purchases is up  we re seeing a shift toward high percentage of purchases versus refis  So I think  you can think about it in terms of the steady up  not dramatic up  steady to up  
  Not all banks had good things to say  especially if you have a big energy lending book  Comerica  CMA  Inc  s second quarter earnings missed expectations on Friday  as the Dallas based bank set aside more money for potential credit losses in the energy industry and said it expects to continue doing so for the rest of the year  The bank s shares dropped more than 6   Falling oil and gas prices have pinched the energy industry over the past year  and many industry observers have predicted the trouble would soon trickle down to banks that lend to companies in the sector 



Energy price troubles are not only affecting some stocks and bonds  but look at the Canadian dollar about to test 6 year lows and now 25  off the 2011 highs  Canadian hockey players finally enjoying the benefit of getting paid in U S  dollars while having their expenses in Canadian dollars  You should also grab the forex benefit and line up that fall trip to Vancouver Island or Montreal 



 China went all in on attempting to calm fears about its Equity market last week  800LB GORILLA  China has created what amounts to a state run margin trader with  483 billion of firepower  its latest effort to end a stock market rout that threatens to drag down economic growth and erode confidence in President Xi Jinping s government   China Securities Finance Corp  can access as much as 3 trillion yuan of borrowed funds from sources including the central bank and commercial lenders   The money may be used to buy shares and provide liquidity to brokerages 

 And China still has some very big fans  like Hugh Hendry of Eclectica   China is very  very much like the Europe of 2012   said Hendry  46   There is a textbook response  Banks can do alchemy  They can take that bad paper and use it as collateral and you get free money to put back into the economy   Hendry said the ingredients were in place for a  longer term bull market  in China as an erosion in company margins reverses   The mystery is why it is so distrusted by us  by the investor community   he said

 Meanwhile  European economic data points continue to mend  European car sales growth accelerated to the fastest pace in 5 1 2 years in June  as Volkswagen AG  XETRA VOWG   PSA Peugeot Citroen and Ford Motor Co   NYSE F  attracted customers with new models and the region s economy expanded  Registrations rose 15 percent to 1 41 million autos from 1 23 million a year earlier  the Brussels based European Automobile Manufacturers  Association  or ACEA  said Thursday in a statement  The jump was the biggest since a 16 percent surge in December 2009  when governments in the region offered incentives on trade ins of older cars to help the industry recover from the global recession 
The economy of the 19 countries using the euro is in its longest stretch of growth since the 2008 worldwide credit crunch  while unemployment in the U K  is at close to a seven year low  The ACEA more than doubled its 2015 regional car market expansion forecast a week ago 

Barron s is looking for further good news out of Europe  Europe is getting a leg up from macroeconomic factors  In addition to persistently weak oil prices  the euro is retreating in value once again  as the monetary policies of the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve diverge  Friday  the euro traded at  1 084  down 2 3  on the week  As the timing of an anticipated Fed interest rate hike nears the Fed is expected to act later this year the dollar is likely to strengthen further against the common currency  A weaker euro is good news for euro zone manufacturers  as it makes their goods cheaper when denominated in other currencies 
Trade data also are encouraging  Euro zone exports were up 5  in the first five months of 2015  compared with the same period a year earlier  Even the International Monetary Fund seems upbeat on the euroarea s prospects  In a July report  it confirmed its projections for 1 5  growth this year in gross domestic product  and 1 7  growth in 2016  At the same time  it reined in forecasts for U S  growth 

 Another reminder that Europe is out of favor Proportion of buy ratings for European stocks well below average   good sign that we could be far from the top 



Over in Japan  Fat Sumo Wrestlers are Out  Ripped Samurai Warriors are In 
Last year  the Japan Exchange Group  TOKYO 8697  launched the Nikkei 400  which selects companies based not merely on size  but on factors such as return on equity  operating profit  and corporate governance  The brainchild of Abe s party  the 400 is called by some the shame index  Not making it in is the corporate equivalent of failing the yearly belly fat test  Consider Amada Holdings  TOKYO 6113   a cash stuffed toolmaker that missed the cut  It promptly announced that it would begin paying out half its profit as dividends and put the other half toward stock buybacks while pursuing acquisitions  Reducing cash drives return on equity higher  all else held equal  Amada also said it would hire outsiders for its board  It hasn t made it into the 400 yet  but its shares are up 22  this year 
Japan s massive pension funds have slashed investments in bonds  sharply increased stock holdings  and signaled that they  too  will use factors like return on equity and corporate governance to guide their selections  Last year  Japan introduced a new stewardship code to give shareholders more say  Just last month  new corporate governance rules went into effect that prompt companies to hire more independent directors and cut down on cross shareholdings  the practice of companies holding stock in one another for the purpose of stifling dissent  rather than pursuing returns  Ahead of the new rules  about 60  of Japanese companies last year sold down their cross holdings 
Also last year  58  raised their dividends  putting payments at a record  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  expects 69  to hike payouts this year  It notes that companies that have raised payments as a percentage of profits or announced new buyback plans have been rewarded with market beating stock performance

 And then there is the gold commodity asset class  which continues to lose its shine 
Many people may have bought gold for the wrong reasons  because of its glittering 18 7  average annual return between 2002 and 2011  because of its purportedly magical inflation fighting properties  because it is supposed to shine in the darkest of days  But gold s long term returns are muted  it isn t a panacea for inflation  and it does well in response to unexpected crises but not long simmering troubles like the Greek situation  And you will put lightning in a bottle before you figure out what gold is really worth 
With greenhorns in gold starting to figure all this out  the price has gotten tarnished  It is time to call owning gold what it is  an act of faith  As the Epistle to the Hebrews defined it forevermore   Faith is the substance of things hoped for  the evidence of things not seen   Own gold if you feel you must  but admit honestly that you are relying on hope and imagination 
Recognize  too  that gold bugs the people who believe in owning the yellow metal no matter what often resemble the subjects of a laboratory experiment on the psychology of cognitive dissonance 

 Great chart reminding that gold s weakness is the U S  dollar s strength 



 Byron Wien s  Smartest Man  in Europe suggests focusing on innovation to find outperformance 
 It is not easy to make money these days  In the past  if you had the right asset allocation  you could do well for institutional investors  Now most asset classes are fully valued  The bond market is expensive  equities are not cheap anywhere  gold is dead  other commodities are in bear markets  the emerging markets are generally not attractive  China is dangerous  and Europe and Japan are reasonably fully priced  As I said last year  the only way to make serious money is by carefully investing in innovation  You can make a modest return in equities in the major markets   I agree with you that the U S  market will end the year higher than it is now  But if you want to make real money investing  you will have to do it by picking stocks in technology and biotechnology  and I would emphasize the latter  

 There is going to have to be a whole lot more innovative companies to invest in if Calpers is going to make its 30 year goal of 7 5  yr 
The California Public Employees  Retirement System  the largest pension in the U S   said it earned 2 4 percent last fiscal year  below its target rate as financial market turbulence depressed stock and bond returns  The  300 billion fund earned 1 percent on public equity holdings and 1 3 percent in fixed income investments  said Ted Eliopoulos  chief investment officer  Real estate returned 13 5 percent  while private equity gained 8 9 percent  Calpers must average at least 7 5 percent a year to match its assumed rate of return or turn to taxpayers to make up the difference  Calpers is among pensions under pressure to boost investment returns  as their unfunded liabilities tripled to almost  2 trillion from 2004 through 2013  according to Moody s Investors Service

 Business travelers now using Uber more than Taxis  Next up  Car Rentals 
Today  expense software company Certify released its latest data on how business travelers are spending money  Their report found that for the first time  travelers used Uber more than traditional taxis  Uber accounted for 55 percent of ground transportation receipts submitted by employees versus 43 percent for taxis   About 1 percent of receipts were for Lyft rides and another 1 percent for other ride hailing services   That s a reversal from last quarter  when Uber had 46 percent of the receipts versus 53 percent for taxis  The spike in Uber use is also taking a chunk out of the rental car business  according to the report  In the second quarter of 2014  55 percent of people rented a car while traveling on business  that figure dropped by 10 percent during the same period this year

Aflac  Supplemental Health Insurance No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Aflac is the global leader in supplemental health insurance  The company is well known in the United States  but actually generates just 25  of its premiums from the United States  The remaining 75  are generated in the land of the rising sun   Japan 
60 years ago brothers John  Paul  and William Amos founded Aflac in Columbus  Georgia  Aflac stands for   American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus  That s quite a strange name for such a Japanese centric company  Aflac   and hasn t looked back since 
Aflac has paid increasing dividends for 32 consecutive years  The company s stock currently has a 2 7  dividend yield  In addition  the company regularly repurchases significant amounts of shares  In 2015 alone  Aflac plans to repurchase  1 3 billion of its outstanding shares  That s a tremendous amount of cash to return to shareholders in one year for a company with a market cap of around  25 billion 
Over the last decade  Aflac has compounded its earnings per share at 12 6  a year  This is excellent growth for an established business  Aflac has managed to compound its earnings by using cash generated from its insurance operations to repurchase shares  The company s supplemental policies are very profitable  Aflac typically maintains a  of around 85    meaning that 15  of its premium income goes straight to the bottom line  This does not even factor in additional investment income from the company s large  
Aflac is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of just 9 7  This is far too low for such a profitable insurance company  Fears of Japan s faltering economy slowing growth have long hampered Aflac s valuation multiples  The company s combination of excellent earnings per share growth  a very shareholder friendly management  strong competitive advantage  and compelling valuation make Aflac a long time favorite 
AbbVie  Biopharmaceutical No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
AbbVie was created in 2013 when Abbott Laboratories spun off much of its pharmaceutical business 
You may be wondering   how can AbbVie be a Dividend Aristocrat if it was created 2 years ago   AbbVie was created in recent history  but the company s parent company  Abbott Laboratories  has paid increasing dividends  AbbVie inherited Abbott Laboratories  dividend history  AbbVie has paid increasing dividends each year since its creation in 2013 
A  spin off  gives the idea that a business is small  This is not true in AbbVie s case  AbbVie currently has a market cap over  97 billion   nearly 4 times as large as the well known business analyzed above 
AbbVie currently has a forward price to earnings ratio of just 11 8 and a healthy 3 5  dividend yield  The company looks cheap at first glance  Yet  AbbVie has the  of any Dividend Aristocrat 
That s because just one product      of the company s sales  That product is Humira  Humira is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis  plaquie psoriasis  Crohn s disease  ulcerative colitis  and other similar ailments  There s nothing wrong with running a concentrated business  Except for one thing   Humira s patents begin expiring at the end of 2016  This could spell trouble for AbbVie 
Now it should be clear why AbbVie is far riskier than its low price to earnings ratio and large market cap would otherwise indicate  Despite its shareholder friendly management which offers sizeable dividend payments and a no fee DRIP plan  AbbVie does not offer the level of safety that Dividend Aristocrat investors have come to expect 
Abbott Laboratories  Emerging Market Health Care No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Abbott Laboratories is one of the largest and most respected health care corporations in the world  The company is well diversified  Abbott manufactures and sells the following 
Medical devices
Nutrition products
Diagnostic equipment
Generic pharmaceuticals
The company s most well known brands to consumers are  Similac  Ensure  and Pedialyte  Abbott Laboratories is not a new company  It was founded in 1888 in Chicago Illinois by Dr  Wallace Abbott  Dr  Abbott helped popularize pills  which he called dosimetric granules  He typically produced morphine  codeine  quinine  and strychnine dosimetric granules 
Abbott Laboratories has a long history of rewarding shareholders as well  The company has paid increasing dividends for 43 consecutive years  excluding the effects of spin offs   Abbott Laboratories currently offers investors a 2 2  dividend yield  The company has a payout ratio of just 31 2   making future dividend growth exceptionally likely 
The global population is growing  Emerging markets are seeing rapid growth in per capita GDP  Abbott Laboratories is well aware of these trends  The company has positioned itself to take advantage of emerging market growth  Abbott Laboratories now generates 100  of its generic pharmaceutical revenues in emerging markets  The company saw constant currency sales grow 10 8  in   The company will very likely reward shareholders with solid growth for decades to come as it continues to play long term demographic trends 
Abbott Laboratories is a high quality business trading at a fair price  The company is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio  using adjusted earnings  of 18 6  The company has a shareholder friendly management and a long growth runway 
HCP  Inc  Health Care REIT No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
HCP  Inc  operates a portfolio of approximately 1 200 health care properties in the US and British Isles 
The company is best known for its senior housing and post acute skilled care facilities  Together  these two types of facilities account for about two thirds of HCP  Inc s income 
HCP  Inc  was founded in 1985 and has increased its dividend payments every single year  The company is a member of a select group of stocks that has a dividend yield over 5  and 25 or more consecutive years of dividend increases    HCP  Inc stock currently has a 6 2  dividend yield 
Over the last decade HCP  Inc  has grown its dividend payments at just 3  a year   only about 1 percentage point faster than inflation   Funds from operations per share  however  have grown at 5 8  a year 
As a REIT  HCP  Inc is required to pay out nearly all of its profits as dividends  Slowly reducing the payout ratio gives the company room to continue raising dividend payments if earnings fall somewhat 
Despite mediocre growth  investors can expect solid total returns from HCP  Inc  Expected total returns are between 9  and 12  a year from dividends   6   and growth  3  to 6   
Continued growth will come from two macroeconomic trends 
Aging population in the U S  and U K 
Greater health care expenditures as a percentage of GDP in the U S  and U K 
In the final anlaysis  HCP  Inc  is a high quality business with above average expected total returns  The company appears to be fairly valued or slightly undervalued given its current dividend yield of 6 3   HCP  Inc s dividend yield has fluctuated between 4 5  and 7 5  over the last decade 
Emerson Electric  Industrial Manufacturing No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Emerson Electric is a large diversified manufacturer  The company has more than 230 manufacturing facilities and over 130 000 employees spread around the world  The company currently has a market cap of nearly  30 billion  Emerson Electric is truly a global business  The company generates less than 50  of its revenue in the United States and Canada 
  in 1890  in St  Louis  Missouri  Emerson Electric was originally an electric motor and fan manufacturer  Scotland born brothers Charles and Alexander Meston founded the company  with financial help from judge and lawyer  and company namesake  John Wesley Emerson 
Emerson Electric not only has a long corporate history   it also has a long history of rewarding shareholders with rising dividends  The company has paid increasing dividends for an amazing 57 consecutive years  This makes Emerson Electric a member of the exclusive Dividend Kings   stocks with 50  consecutive years of dividend increases   
Over the last decade  Emerson Electric has compounded its earnings per share at 4 9  a year  The company currently has a dividend yield of 4 1   A compound growth rate of around 5  is not spectacular   it is mediocre at best 
What makes Emerson Electric a compelling investment is its low valuation  The company is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of just 12 6  With a  4  dividend yield and a  5  compound growth rate  investors can expect total returns of around 9  a year from Emerson Electric   before valuation multiple changes 
Hormel  Packaged Food No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Hormel Foods sells much more than packaged meat products   shows the company s impressive portfolio of well known brands 
Hormel Foods is one year younger than Emerson Electric   by George Hormel  of the company s namesake  in Austin  Minnesota  Today  Austin Minnesota has a population of just under 25 000  Hormel Foods employees nearly as many people as the town in which it started  Hormel Foods has approximately  
The company has done more than grow its employee count  Hormel has paid increasing dividends for 49 consecutive years  In 2016  the company will become a Dividend King 
The company is not done growing yet  Hormel Foods recently   The company has compounded earnings per share at 10 5  a year over the last decade  Growth has been very consistent for Hormel Foods  The company has increased earnings per share in 27 out of its last 30 years 
Going forward  Hormel should continue to grow its earnings per share quickly I expect the company s earnings per share to grow at between 9  and 11  a year over the next several years  This growth combined with the company s 1 6  dividend yield gives investors an expected total return of 10 6  to 12 6  a year 
The downside to Hormel Foods is its current high valuation  The company is trading for a price to earnings ratio of 24 8  This is well above the S P 500 s price to earnings ratio of 19 9  and significantly above Hormel Food s historical average price to earnings ratio  Patient investors should wait for a better entry point into this high quality branded food business 
EcoLab  Clean Soultions No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Like Hormel Foods  EcoLab was founded in Minnesota  EcoLab  in Saint Paul  Minnesota in 1923  Merritt Osborn founded the company when he invented a new carpet spot cleaner  EcoLab stands for Economics Laboratory   reflecting its original mission to save customers time  labor  and money 
Today  EcoLab is a diversified global business with a  32 1 billion market cap  The company manufactures and sells a variety of cleaning and treatment products and services used in warewashing  restaurant scale dish washing   food and beverages  pulp and paper  laundry  housekeeping  and oil and gas 
EcoLab has managed to grow its earnings per share at an impressive 13 6  a year over the last decade  The company will experience somewhat slower growth as its oil and gas servicing segment falters due to low oil prices  Still  the company has very favorable long term growth prospects 
EcoLab has paid increasing dividends every year since 1985  While this is an impressive streak  the company s dividend yield is much less impressive  EcoLab has a payout ratio of 30 6  and a dividend yield of just 1 2   The company does not provide much in the way of current income 
Additionally  EcoLab is trading at a lofty price to earnings multiple of 26 8  The company s high price to earnings multiple combined with a low dividend yield makes now a poor time to initiate a position in EcoLab 
Despite this  EcoLab is a high quality business that has great long term growth prospects as efficiency and safety become increasingly important in the world  Enterprising investors will keep an eye out for a significant drop in EcoLab s share price to initiate a position in this high quality business 
ExxonMobil  Oil Giant No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
ExxonMobil is the largest publicly traded oil and gas corporation in the United States based on its  
The company has a long corporate history that dates back to John Rockefeller s Standard Oil  Based on its industry leading size and history  ExxonMobil is the corporate successor to Standard Oil 
ExxonMobil has increased its dividend payments each year for 33 consecutive years  The company currently has a 4 0  dividend yield  Which is extremely unusual for ExxonMobil 
Low oil prices have caused ExxonMobil stock to fall more than 20  in the last year  ExxonMobil is trading near dividend yield highs not seen in over a decade  Now is historically the best time to buy ExxonMobil  for dividend investors  in the last 10 years 
With that said  ExxonMobil has not delivered much growth over the last decade  The company has realized earnings per share growth of just 3 4  a year over this time period  When oil prices rise  however  so will ExxonMobil s earnings 
Over the long run  ExxonMobil s growth prospects are positive  Global energy demand will increase as the worldwide population rises and more people are lifted out of poverty  More people with more money means more demand for energy   and oil 
As discussed above  now is a historically excellent time to buy into this blue chip industry leading oil giant   
Oil prices are volatile  they rise and fall  There s no reason to believe that this time is different and we are stuck with permanently low oil prices  When oil prices rise  ExxonMobil share holders will likely see significant capital gains 
Genuine Parts Company  Auto Care No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Genuine Parts Company is not a household name  United States based investors are likely more familiar with Genuine Parts Company s automotive segment  NAPA Auto Parts 
In addition to NAPA Auto Parts  Genuine Parts Company also owns industrial parts distributor Motion Industries  office products distributor SP Richards  and electrical electronic materials distributor EIS 
Genuine Parts Company was founded in 1928 and now has a market cap of  12 6 billion  The company has expanded outside North America  Genuine Parts Company now owns Repco   another auto parts company   which has operations in Australia and New Zealand 
The company has a long history of dividend payments as well  In fact  Genuine Parts has increased its dividend payments for 59 consecutive years   one of the longest active streaks of any business  With a payout ratio of 51 1  and positive growth prospects  the company s dividend streak will very likely continue far into the future 
Genuine Parts Company has compounded earnings per share at about 7  a year over the last decade  The company s long term goal is to deliver earnings per share growth of 7  to 10  a year  I believe the company will continue to deliver growth of around 7  a year  at the low end of management s estimates  This growth combined with the company s current dividend yield of 3 0  gives investors total expected returns of around 10  a year 
With expected total returns of 10  a year  Genuine Parts Company should outperform the S P 500 over the long run  The company is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 17 9  For comparison  the S P 500 is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 19 9  Based on this  Genuine Parts Company appears slightly undervalued relative to the S P 500 
Illinois Tool Works  Diversified Manufacturing No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Don t let the Illinois in Illinois Tool Works fool you  the company is a global business  Illinois Tool Works generates about 50  of its revenue in the US and 50  internationally 
The company was founded in 1912 and has grown reach a market cap of  30 billion with 51 000 employees in 26 countries  The company was  in Chicago  The company operates in 7 distinct business units 
Automotive OEM
T M Electronics
Food Equipment
Polymers   Fluid
Welding
Construction Products
Specialty Products
Illinois Tool Works is diversified both geographically and through its 7 business units  This diversification has allowed the company to grow consistently  Shareholders have benefited greatly from Illinois Tool Works  consistent growth  Case in point  the company has paid increasing dividends for 52 consecutive years 
Over the last decade Illinois Tool Works has compounded its earnings per share at 6 7  a year  Much of the company s growth comes from share repurchases  Over the last decade  diluted weighted shares outstanding have decreased at a rate of 4 2  a year  Illinois Tool Work s management aims for revenue growth of 2  to 3  a year   which is in line with historical averages  The company will likely continue to compound earnings per share at around 7  a year  This growth combined with the company s current dividend yield of 2 7  gives investors expected total returns of 9 7  a year 
Illinois Tool Works is an exceptionally shareholder friendly company as evidenced by its large share repurchases and long streak of dividend increases  The company s expected total returns are slightly higher than  of 9 1  a year  Despite this  Illinois Tool Works is trading for a price to earnings ratio of just 16 6   versus 19 9 for the S P 500  As a result  I believe Illinois Tool Works to be somewhat undervalued at current prices relative to the S P 500 
Johnson   Johnson  Global Health Care Giant No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Johnson   Johnson is perhaps the most stable business in the world based on its almost impossible streak of adjusted earnings per share increases  Johnson   Johnson has increased its adjusted earnings per share for 31 consecutive years  I know of no other business that can match this impressive feat
In addition to its long streak of earnings per share growth  Johnson   Johnson has also increased its dividends per share for 52 consecutive years 
Johnson   Johnson was founded in 1886 in New Brunswick  New Jersey by the three Johnson brothers  Robert Wood Johnson  James Wood Johnson  and Edward Mead Johnson  The company has been wildly successful since then  Johnson   Johnson now has a market cap of well over  250 billion 
The company operates in 3 large segments 
Consumer
Pharma
Medical Devices
The company s pharma segment is actually its largest  followed by medical devices and then consumer  Investors are probably most familiar with the company s portfolio of high quality consumer brands which includes  Motrin  Tylenol  Benadryl  Zyrtec  Band Aid  Listerine  Aveeno  Neutrogina  and Johnson s 
The pharmaceutical segment s key drugs are  Zytiga for prostate cancer  Remicade for Crohn s disease and Ulcerative Colitis  Invega Sustenna for schizophrenia  Olysio for Hepatitis  Stelara for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis  and Simponi for rheumatoid arthritis 
The company s medical devices segment generates 85  of sales from products with  1 or  2 market share position 
Johnson   Johnson has grown earnings per share at 6 1  a year over the last decade  The company currently has a 3 2  dividend yield  If Johnson   Johnson maintains its average growth rate over the last decade  investors can expect total returns of around 9  a year   with very little risk due to the company s diversification and high quality brands 
The company is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 16 4  Like many of the stocks in this article  Johnson   Johnson appears somewhat undervalued relative to the S P 500 given its expected total returns and high marks for safety 
3M  Large Cap Diversified Manufacturing No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
3M was founded in 1902 in Two Harbors  Minnesota  The  3 M s  stand for Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company 
Today  3M has a market cap of nearly  88 billion and generates more than  30 billion in sales a year  The company employs over 80 000 people  For comparison  Tow Harbors Minnesota  where the company was originally founded  has a total population of under 4 000 
3M is a very shareholder friendly company  Not only does the company offer investors a no fee DRIP  it has also paid increasing dividends for 56 consecutive years  3M has managed to increase its dividend payments every year for more than 5 decades thanks to its diversified approach to business 
The company operates in 5 segments  Each segment is listed below 
Industrial
Health Care
Safety   Graphics
Electronics   Energy
Consumer
Investors are probably most familiar with the company s consumer segment  The consumer segment includes well known brands like  Filtrete  Command  and Post It  among others 
Over the last decade  3M has compounded earnings per share at 6 9  a year  The company s long term growth goal is 9  to 11  earnings per share growth per year  It is unlikely that 3M s management can boost its earnings per share growth 2  to 4   I expect growth closer in line to the company s historical average of around 7  a year  This growth combined with the company s current dividend yield of 2 9  gives investors expected total returns of about 10  a year 
3M is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 18 4  The company is likely trading at fair value or is just slightly undervalued  3M is an extremely high quality and shareholder friendly business trading at a fair price 
Sherwin Williams  Coatings No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Sherwin Williams sells branded coating products under many well known brands  including  Sherwin Williams  Dutch Boy  Krylon  Minwax  and Thompson s Water Seal  among others  The company is the largest producer of paints in the United States 
The company currently generates the bulk of its revenue and profits in the United States  but is expanding in Latin America  Europe  and Asia 
Sherwin Williams was founded in 1866 in Cleveland  Ohio by Henry Sherwin and Edward Williams  hence the name Sherwin Williams   The company has grown tremendously since that time and now has a market cap of  23 5 billion 
Dividends have increased each year for Sherwin Williams investors since 1979  The company s long dividend streak shows the stability and slow rate of change in the coatings industry 
The paint industry may not strike investors as fast growing  but Sherwin Williams has delivered earnings per share growth of 11 6  a year over the last decade  Nearly 4  of this growth is a result of share repurchases  Operating margins have also improved over the last decade from 12 5  in 2014 to 13 8  in 2014  The paint industry is consolidating  resulting in higher margins for the largest players 
Investors should expect continued growth from Sherwin Williams as long as the economy stays out of recession  Sherwin Williams earnings per share were virtually flat from 2006 through 2011 when the economy was sputtering  or just beginning to recover   The company grows rapidly during times of prosperity  but shows little to no growth during recessions 
Sherwin Williams is currently trading for a rich valuation multiple of 25 6  Investors are clearly impressed with the company s rapid earnings growth in recent years  With another global downturn looming and an above average price to earnings ratio  now is not the best time to start a position in Sherwin Williams stock 
McGraw Hill Financial  Financial Data No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
The S P 500 is constantly mentioned in finance and investing circles  McGraw Hill Financial owns the Standard   Poor s  S P  name  McGraw Hill Financial is one of the global leaders in financial ratings and research 
The company  back to 1917 when the McGraw Publishing Company and the Hill Publishing Company merged  hence the name McGraw Hill   In 2012  McGraw Hill Financial sold its publishing division to Apollo Global to focus on its more profitable financial division 
Since the divestiture  the company has rewarded shareholders through share repurchases  rising dividends  and strong growth both organically and through acquisitions  Excluding the effects of spin offs  McGraw Hill Financial has paid increasing dividends to its shareholders for 42 consecutive years 
McGraw Hill Financial is expected to grow its earnings per share at around 10  a year over the next several years  The company s growth will come from two primary sources 
First  the company enters into licensing agreements with ETFs to use its well known index names  like S P 500 or S P Dividend Aristocrats   ETFs are expected to continue stealing market share from actively managed mutual funds   because they offer investors lower expense ratios  As long as investors keep piling cash into the market  ETF assets should rise   as should McGraw Hill Financial s profits 
Second  the company generates revenue by rating corporate and government debt  Interest rates are being kept artificially low through central bank policies meant to stimulate growth  Low interest rates encourage debt issuance   a net positive for McGraw Hill Financial 
As long as interest rates remain low and the market stay out of recession  McGraw Hill will likely realize double digit earnings per share growth  Bear markets cause investors to pull out of stocks  at exactly the wrong time    which reduces McGraw Hill Financial s profits 
The best time to pick up shares of McGraw Hill Financial will be when we have a combination of a bear market and high interest rates  This will cause the company s earnings to fall and result in an excellent opportunity to buy the company at a bargain  Now  however  is not that time 
Nucor  Steel No Fee DRIP Dividend Aristocrat
Nucor revolutionized the steel industry  The company has not laid off an employee due to work shortages in over 30 years  Additionally  the company pioneered  pay for performance  in the steel industry  Workers at Nucor tend to be highly motivated  and highly compensated  relative to their peers at other companies 
The story of Nucor steel really begins in 1965     Iverson s unique approach to business  rewarding and incentivizing employees exceptionally well  lead to rapid growth  30 years later  in 1995   Iverson stepped down as CEO 
To be blunt  Nucor has not performed well since 2008  In 2008  the company had earnings per share of  6 01  In full fiscal 2014  the company had earnings per share of just  2 22  The company is struggling to compete with low priced international steel manufactures who are subsidized by their respective governments  In addition  the recent slow down in emerging markets has impacted the company 
Despite declines in recent years  Nucor has an impressive dividend streak  The company has paid rising dividends every year since 1973  Declining earnings have caused the company s payout ratio to rise significantly  however  Nucor currently has a payout ratio of 73  
It is difficult to envision Nucor reclaiming its once rapid growth  The company s best days are likely behind it  I believe Nucor to be one of the riskiest Dividend Aristocrats  The company s qualitative risks are near that of AbbVie 
While it s not impossible the company turns around  there are certainly safer investments to be made  Uncertainty surrounding Nucor has made the stock fairly cheap  The company is trading for a forward price to earnings ratio of 13 5  While this is lower than many of the high quality businesses on this list  Nucor s lack of safety makes it a riskier investment than most other Dividend Aristocrats

10291,231806,SHW,Everything Going Right For Sherwin Williams Now   So Wait To Buy,opinion,"Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW  was founded in 1866  The company has steadily grown since then through consolidating the United States coatings industry  Today  Sherwin Williams has a market cap of  22 3 billion 
Sherwin Williams operates in 4 groups  The percentage of total profit each group has generated through the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 is listed below 
Paint Stores Group  68 6  of company profits 
Consumers Group  19 1  of company profits 
Global Finishes Group  10 8  of company profits 
Latin America Coatings Group  1 5  of company profits 
The Paint Stores Group is by far the most important group for Sherwin Williams  The Paint Stores Group operates the company s 4 025 exclusive paint stores in the United States  Canada  and the Caribbean 
The Consumer Group sells the company s products through various retailers in North America and Europe 
The Global Finishes Group sells a wide range of coating products for the following industries  industrial  marine  and automotive 
The Latin America Coatings Group generated just 1 5  of company profits through the first half of fiscal 2015  This Group sells coatings and finishes throughout Latin America 
Profit growth for each Group through the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 as compared to the first 6 months if fiscal 2014 is shown below 
Paint Stores Group profits up 16 8 
Consumers Group profits up 18 2 
Global Finishes Group profits down 5 1 
Latin America Coatings Group profits down 13 5 
On a constant currency basis  the Global Finishes Group profits would be up around 2 2   and the Latin America Coatings Group profits would be up about 2 1  
Even so  Sherwin Williams North American operations are growing rapidly  while international operations are showing only very modest growth on a constant currency basis 
Sherwin Williams strong competitive advantages are geographically concentrated in North America 
Sherwin Williams  Competitive Advantages
Sherwin Williams is the third largest global coatings company 

While that s impressive  it also understates the company s dominance in North America  Sherwin Williams  store count in the United States absolutely dwarfs its competitors  Over the last year alone  Sherwin Williams has added 97 new stores in the United States  While all of its competitors combined have added 27 stores 

Sherwin Williams is the undisputed leader in the United States paint industry  The company s strength in the United States comes from its tremendous store count  excellent distribution network in North America  and well known brands 
Sherwin Williams strongest brands are shown in the image below 

In fiscal 2014  Sherwin Williams spent  299 million on advertising  or 2 7  of total sales  The company s large size and already established brands allows Sherwin Williams to spend a relatively small percentage of total sales on advertising to maintain its brand strength 
Sherwin Williams is the industry leader in the slow changing United States coatings industry  Paint is an industry that sees incremental change  but is unlikely to experience any breathtakingly rapid innovation that would threaten to unseat Sherwin Williams  This fact should appeal to long term investors 
Growth and Total Returns
Sherwin Williams has grown both dividends and earnings per share at a compound rate of 11 6  a year over the last decade 
Much of this growth has come recently  In 2011  Sherwin Williams had earnings per share of  4 14  The company had earnings per share of  8 78 in fiscal 2014   more than doubling earnings per share in just 3 years 
The primary growth sources from 2011 through 2014 are shown below 
Net profit margin increased 56   from 5 0  to 7 8  
Revenue increased 27 
Share count decreased 9 
As you can see  much of the company s recent rapid growth is a result of tremendous margin improvements  Revenue has been growing at a good clip  but the real growth driver has been margin increases 
The question is  What is causing margins to soar 
Lower input costs are the primary driver of higher margins for Sherwin Williams 
The two primary input costs for paint are oil and titanium dioxide  As is well known  oil prices have fallen precipitously over the last few years since highs in 2011  Metal prices have also fallen significantly since 2011  This has resulted in rising margins for Sherwin Williams 
Another tailwind for the company  this one since 2009  is the resurgence of the United States housing industry brought around by ultra low interest rates and a recovering economy 
Together  these two trends have created the perfect condition for Sherwin Williams to grow its earnings 
Oil prices will not stay low forever  When they rise  Sherwin Williams and its competitors will see margins fall 
This does not take away from Sherwin Williams strong competitive advantages and market leading position in the United States  however 
Over a full economic cycle  Sherwin Williams should realize earnings per share growth of between 8  and 12  a year  The company currently has a dividend yield of 1 1   Shareholders of Sherwin Williams can expect total returns of about 9  to 13  a year going forward 
Recession Performance
Sherwin Williams business model is reliant upon the housing industry  When construction and housing are increasing  Sherwin Williams thrives  The company sees falling earnings when the construction and housing industries falter 
The company s earnings per share through the Great Recession and subsequent recovery are shown below to illustrate this point 
2007 earnings per share of  4 70  high earnings mark at the time 
2008 earnings per share of  4 00  decline due to start of recessions 
2009 earnings per share of  3 78  recession low 
2010 earnings per share of  4 21  partial recovery from recession 
2011 earnings per share of  4 14  high oil prices reduce margins 
2012 earnings per share of  6 02  new earnings high 
As you can see  it took Sherwin Williams 3 full years to recover from 2009 recession lows  The company did remain profitable throughout  however  Recessions impact Sherwin Williams profitability  but they do not put the company s dividend in any real danger  
Valuation and Final Thoughts
Everything is going right for Sherwin Williams right now  This means it is the wrong time to buy the stock  Sherwin Williams had a dividend yield of well above 2  for much of 2008 through 2010  The company is currently about twice as expensive as it was during its slow growth period 
Patient shareholders should wait until Sherwin Williams stock offers investors yields above 2  before entering into a position in the stock  This won t happen until one or both of the following occur  oil prices jump higher  or the housing and construction industries decline significantly 
Due to its current low dividend yield and relatively high valuation  Sherwin Williams does not rank particularly high using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing 
Still  Sherwin Williams is a very high quality businesses with a long dividend history and strong competitive advantage in a slow changing industry  The company makes an excellent long term holding in a dividend growth portfolio   now is just not the time to initiate or add to a position in the stock ",2015-10-11,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-aristocrats-part-2-of-52:-sherwin-williams-267738,267738
10292,231807,SHW,PGG Industries  Global Leader Of Coatings Industry,opinion,"PPG Industries  N PPG  is the global leader in the coatings industry  The company s two largest competitors are 

Fellow Dividend Aristocrat Sherwin Williams  N SHW 
Amsterdam headquartered Akzo Nobel  OTC AKZOY 

Together  the 10 largest coatings companies control over 50  of the industry globally  The coatings industry is quickly consolidating as the largest players acquire smaller players 
This trend has picked up in recent years  as low oil and metal prices have reduced input costs for paint  creating higher margins  and more cash flows  for PPG Industries 
PPG Industries was founded in 1883 when Captain John Ford and John Pictairn started Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company  Today  PPG Industries has a market cap of  25 9 billion and has paid increasing dividends for 43 consecutive years 
The company splits its operations into 3 segments  The percentage of total income through the first 6 months of fiscal 2015 for each segment is shown below 

Performance Coatings generates 54 1  of company income
Industrial Coatings generates 40 5  of company income
Glass generates 5 4  of company income

The Glass segment is by far the company s smallest  It supplies flat glass and continuous strand fiber glass products to its customers 
The Industrial Coatings segment is one of PPG Industries  two large segments  It provides coatings  finishes  adhesives  and sealants primarily for the industrial  packaging  and automotive industries 
PPG Industries largest segment is its Performance Coatings segment  The segment provides coatings  finishes  adhesives  and sealants for the aerospace  marine  and architectural industries 
Competitive Advantage
With its 4  decade streak of continuously rising dividends  PPG Industries clearly has a strong and durable competitive advantage 
The paint industry has very favorable economics  It has high margins and requires little capital investment  it generates a lot of cash 
PPG Industries has the highest margins in the industry of any major player 

Through the first 6 months of 2015  the Performance Coatings segment has an operating margin of 14 5   while the Industrial Coatings segment had an 18 3  operating margin  The Performance Coating segment generates the majority of its sales from lower margin  as compared to specialty purpose paints  architectural paint sales 
The company generates high margins through its large specialty purpose coatings sales  About 60  of revenue will come from specialty purpose coatings for PPG Industries in 2015 

Growth Potential
PPG Industries does not have high margins by accident  The company s management has been systematically and purposefully selling lower margin business units and acquiring higher margin coatings businesses 
Recent divestitures include 

Sale of commodity chemical business to Georgia Gulf Corporation in 2013 for  900 million
Sale of sunlens business to Esillor International  OTC ESLOY  in 2014 for  1 7 billion

PPG Industries currently generates 94 6  of its income from the coatings industry  The company still owns its lower margin Glass segment  I would not be in the slightest bit surprised if PPG Industries were to divest this segment as well in the future to focus exclusively on coatings 
With its significant cash flows and industry leading size  PPG Industries is well positioned to continue consolidating the global coatings industry 
The company has completed 2 large acquisitions in the last 2 years 

In 2013 PPG Industries acquired Akzo Nobel s North American coatings business for  1 05 billion 
In 2014 PPG Industries acquired Comex s Latin America business for  2 3 billion 

These are the company s two largest recent acquisitions  PPG Industries has engaged in many other smaller acquisitions over the last 18 years 

You will notice that all acquisitions since 2008 have focused exclusively on the coatings industry 
Going forward  PPG Industries growth plans revolve around continued acquisitions in the coatings industry  The company can also grow its architectural coatings sales organically by building out its North American stores 
Sherwin Williams has over 4 000 stores in North America  while PPG Industries has less than 1 000 stores globally  The company has a substantial long term growth runway ahead by slowly building out its company owned stores 
Over the last decade  PPG Industries has compounded earnings per share at 9 8  a year  Income oriented investors have likely been less enthusiastic about the company s above average earnings per share growth  The company has compounded dividends at just 3 9  a year over the last decade   far lower than earnings per share growth 
With a  largely justified  continued focus on acquisitions  I expect PPG to continue increasing its dividends slower than overall earnings per share growth as the company tries to keep as much cash on hand as possible to fund further acquisitions  This means further declines in the company s payout ratio 
PPG Industries management s target is to return around 40  of cash flows to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  The company currently has a payout ratio of around just 25   down from  50  in 2005   Over the past decade  the company has returned about as much cash to shareholders through share repurchases as through dividends 
I expect the dividend payout ratio to hover around 20  to 25  for PPG Industries over the next few years  and for the company to return 15  to 25  of cash to shareholders through share repurchases 
PPG Industries currently has a dividend yield of 1 5   I expect the company to grow earnings per share at between 9  and 11  a year over a full economic cycle  in line with historical growth  Together  growth and dividends give PPG Industries an expected total return of between 10 5  and 12 5  a year 
With its low yield and low historical dividend growth rate  PPG Industries has a long dividend payback period of 34 years  using 3 9  dividend growth rate  
Valuation and Final Thoughts 
Over the last decade  PPG Industries  average price to earnings ratio is just 12 6  The business has undergone significant changes since that time   switching from lower margin businesses to the higher margin coatings industry 
To get a better idea of fair value for the company  consider rival Sherwin Williams  historical average price to earnings ratio of 17 5  This is a better fair earnings multiple for PPG Industries than its own historical average 
PPG Industries is trading for a price to earnings ratio of 16 8  using adjusted earnings   The company is likely currently fairly valued  or very slightly undervalued  
Investors who cannot wait to get exposure to the paint industry should consider PPG Industries at current prices 
The company s low dividend yield and low dividend growth make this company an unappealing investment for income seeking dividend growth investors 
Patient investors looking for exposure to the coatings industry should purchase this Dividend Aristocrat and PPG rival when it reaches fair or undervalued territory ",2015-10-12,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-aristocrats-part-3-of-52:-ppg-industries-267776,267776

10294,231809,SHW,Is The Fed Trying To Create Another Housing Boom  ,opinion,Low interest rates certainly make housing an attractive asset class  After all  the 30 year fixed mortgage in the United States is around 3 50 percent  the 15 year fixed mortgage rate is 2 94 percent  These are all time low mortgage rates and many investors and potential home owners are trying to take advantage of these attractive interest rates  The Federal Reserve is also buying approximately  40 billion worth of mortgage backed securities to help inflate the housing sector As many of you know  in 2002 the Federal Reserve Bank cut the fed funds interest rate down to 1 00 percent  This rate cut by the central bank helped to bring mortgage rates down from 8 0 percent  2000  to roughly 5 8 percent in 2003 and 2004  This move by the central bank was done to stimulate the stock and housing market from the technology bubble and the 9 11 tragedy  which sent the country into a severe recession Well  the low interest rates worked for a while causing the United States to have a five year economic rebound  People in the United States went crazy buying and selling homes  Banks were lending money to anyone that could sign their name on the dotted line  No documented income loans soared as the house became the greatest investment to man  I remember going to a street carnival and seeing the real estate booth with more people around it than the cotton candy stand  That was a sure sign of a top in housing  but it lasted longer than anyone could believe  Unfortunately  as we all know this housing bubble lead to the greatest credit crisis since the Great Depression  The stock markets plunged and many leading investment firms such as Lehman Brothers  Bear Stearns  Washington Mutual  Wachovia  Merrill Lynch  Countrywide  and countless other firms either failed or were bought for pennies on the dollar  The taxpayer had to bai lout most large banks and financial institutions  so theoretically the entire financial system as we know of failed Now the Federal Reserve  U S  central bank  has lowered the fed funds interest rate down to zero percent  The rate has been this way since December 2008  The central banks have also implemented three quantitative easing programs  bond buying programs  since that time in order to inflate stock markets and to add liquidity to the financial system  In all fairness  the major stock indexes have mostly recovered all of the losses from the decline in 2008  Unfortunately  we all know that you can print money forever  and inflation is usually a byproduct of this so called  stimulus  The housing market has been rebounding  Traders can simply look at a chart of the leading housing stocks and see how the sector has been a major winner since October 2011  Leading housing stocks such as Toll Brothers Inc  TOL   Lennar Corp  LEN   D R Horton Inc  DHI   and KB Home  KBH  have been some of the strongest stocks in the market recently  If this important and leading stock sector starts to give up its gains and go into correction  it will be a sign that the major stock indexes will probably start to falter The Federal Reserve is certainly trying to cause another housing boom  This will generally help companies such as Home Depot Inc  HD   Lowe s Cos  LOW   Sherwin Williams Co  SHW   Mohawk Industries Inc  MHK  and many others  Clearly  the central bank is definitely trying to keep the housing market strong  More construction workers will be needed and this added workforce trickles down to other sectors  just as it did in 2003 through 2007 Is there another housing bubble developing  No  there does not seem to be a housing bubble taking place this time around because the banks are doing their job  they are now only lending to qualified borrowers  Unfortunately  it takes a crisis for these financial institutions to do their job  So another housing bubble is unlikely  but a commodity and stock bubble is certainly more probable down the road ,2013-01-22,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-fed-trying-to-create-another-housing-boom-151912,151912
10295,231810,SHW,Newsflash  The Dividend Aristocrats Found The Lost Decade,opinion,Introduction There are many people who continue to hold a jaundiced view of stocks because they were traumatized by the last two recessions  Precipitous drops in equity prices drove them to distrust stocks and stock markets  However  I believe that most of the negative sentiment is a function of what I would describe as vague ideas about what really happened  A lot has to do with many investors failing to recognize  or make the important distinctions  that were the true causes of our last two market crashes  The first market collapse  late summer 2000  was first a function of significant overvaluation  especially regarding the technology sector  followed by the mild recession of 2001  The second market collapse was the result of a greedy and fraudulently induced  and consequently  more serious recession dubbed the great recession of 2008  Therefore  at least in my opinion  the two huge drops in stock values were not really the result of a weak economy  as many people think  The first was the result of an extremely inefficiently behaving stock market  and the second  the result of a greedy financial sector induced by poor government policy  Nevertheless  these two major catastrophic events have shaken the confidence of many investors  What bothers me about this is how it is driving people away from investing in our country s finest companies at precisely the time when I believe that it makes more sense to do so than it has in many years  Most importantly  the conditions that existed when these two market collapses occurred no longer exist  Nevertheless  investors and pundits alike  continue to look for reasons why a market collapse will soon reoccur  Their views are based on a pessimistic view of equities  and I believe an exaggerated view of the risk profile of stocks that was caused by the trauma  Personally  I abhor pessimism  because I believe it is both an erroneous and dangerous mindset for investors to possess  In a   I mistakenly titled my introduction  pessimism is for losers  and therefore  inadvertently offended many readers  Although I accept the responsibility that it was my fault for penning such a provocative statement  the offended readers misunderstood my intent  I was not calling pessimistic people losers  I was attempting to articulate that a pessimistic attitude can create unnecessary losses  Furthermore  many readers also mistook my words to mean that I was a  perma Bull  that was in denial that a future market collapse could even occur  That is not what an optimistic attitude is actually about  An optimistic attitude is about understanding and believing that even though a recession or market collapse can occur  both will inevitably end  Therefore  both our equity markets and our economy will prosper and grow once again  it s only a matter of time  But the real problem is that pessimists are most likely to sell at the bottom of the market and as a result realize unnecessary losses  Market bottoms have always represented great buying opportunities  that only an optimist is capable of exploiting  More simply stated  people usually sell their equities when the risk of owning them is the lowest and the opportunity for gain the highest  In other words  selling into the bottom of the market instead of buying into it as the optimist does  Since 2000 Dividend Aristocrats Outperformed the S P 500 I have come to learn that Dividend Growth investors  which have also been disparagingly referred to as Dividend Zealots  are among the most optimistic investors in the universe  And in many ways  perhaps the most misunderstood  Dividend Growth investors often state that they are not concerned with drops in the price of their stocks  but only that their dividends grow  For some reason  this offends certain people who apparently feel that this makes Dividend Growth investors arrogant and or even ignorant  What these detractors misunderstand in my judgment  is that the average Dividend Growth investor does not worry about short term volatility because they do not intend to sell  Dividend Growth investors buy in order to hold quality dividend paying companies for the long run  that have long histories of increasing their dividends every year  There are two popular sources of identifying the consistent dividend achiever  They are the lists of Dividend Champions  Contenders and Challengers provided by David Fish found   and perhaps the more widely known Standard   Poor s Corp s Dividend Aristocrats  Both the Dividend Champions and Dividend Aristocrats are comprised of companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years  Since there are fewer names on the Dividend Aristocrats than there are the Dividend Champions  51 versus 103   I took the easy route and calculated the returns of the Dividend Aristocrats since calendar year 2000  Although we are now into our 13th year  thus going three years beyond the so called  Lost Decade   the evidence of rebounding stock values is profoundly obvious  Not only did all but three of the Dividend Aristocrats dramatically outperform the S P 500  they also provided very strong returns  that on balance  out stripped inflation and even taxation  I was motivated to run this study because of a comment that one reader made on my article  link provided above  as follows   The average S P 500 index fund is down roughly 28  since 1 1 2000  after adjusting for inflation  Add in dividends and that gets investors to nearly the breakeven point  Subtract the funds taxes from Gains and dividends  and investors are back to a loss   The same commenter also expressed the same sentiment in another comment to another reader as follows   it is likely that nearly all the dividend buy  and  hold Bulls have lost money relative to year 2000  after adjusting for inflation and taxes   Although the first comment above is accurate regarding the S P 500 as inflation was approximately 28   by my calculation inflation was actually 32 3    his second comment is inaccurate where his view is biased by his first comment  In truth  at least regarding the Dividend Aristocrats who increased their dividend every year for 25 straight years  all the dividend buy and hold bulls that held them would have trounced the S P  inflation and taxes  The following tables generated by the  research tool reviews the performance of the Dividend Aristocrats since December 31  1999  Astoundingly  only 3 of the 51 Dividend Aristocrats underperformed the S P 500  Furthermore  only 7 of the 51 companies would have failed to generate the 3  compounded annual return necessary to combat inflation and taxes  Moreover  the majority of the Dividend Aristocrats have lavishly rewarded their dividend buy and hold bulls  optimists   As you review the list  note that every company from Procter   Gamble  PG  and above outperformed the S P 500  inflation and taxes  Table One  Top 15 Dividend Aristocrats Since 1999 Our first table lists the top 15 Dividend Aristocrats in order of highest performing to the lowest  Sherwin Williams  SHW   the best performer averaged over 16  returns per annum  with Becton Dickinson   Co   BDX  rounding out the top 15 by averaging a 10 1  compounded annual return  As you review the records of these first 15 Dividend Aristocrats  keep in mind that this is during one of the worst 13 year periods of price performance in stock market history  For added perspective and insight and just following this first table  I provide the complete earnings and price driven F A S T  Graphs   plus performance tables on these two Dividend Aristocrats Sherwin Williams Co There are at least two very interesting takeaways that the 13 year earnings and price correlated graph on Sherwin Williams reveals  First of all  Sherwin Williams was not overvalued at the beginning of calendar year 2000  This validates a point that I ve often written about that states that in every market  whether bull or bear  the scrutinizing investor can always find good stocks at fair value to invest in  Second  I would like to point out that I believe that Sherwin Williams is currently significantly overvalued  which greatly contributes to its outperformance There was no  Lost Decade  for shareholders of Sherwin Williams Company since 1999  Not only did they receive significant long term capital appreciation  they were rewarded by strong growth in their dividend income  Finally  what follows is a napkin calculation of Sherwin Williams  return after inflation and taxes  576 154 38 capital appreciation   33  inflation    386 203    56 287 of total dividends paid   15  tax    47 844    329 916 total cash return  The figure needed to beat inflation is approximately  133 000  Becton Dickinson   Co   BDX Becton Dickinson is also interesting in at least two ways  First  it represents another example of a company that was fairly valued at the beginning of calendar year 2000  However  it was overvalued in 2008  which contributed to their large drop in stock price during the great recession  But even though they have not returned to their previous high price of  93 24 in 2008  fair value at that time was approximately somewhere between  65  70 per share  In other words  Becton Dickinson,2013-02-02,Chuck

10300,231815,SHW,5 Reasons Why This Will Remain A Traders  Market ,opinion,1  Every central bank in the world is pumping money into the financial system  The Federal Reserve started this so called zero interest rate policy for the too big to fail banks in December 2008  They have also started their third round of bond purchases called QE 3  quantitative easing  in September 2012  This is where the Fed buys U S  Treasuries and mortgage backed securities  Currently  the Federal Reserve is buying  85 billion a month of these securities with no end of purchasing in sight  Where do they get the money for all of this  They print it  Other central banks such as the Bank of Japan  and the Bank of England and most other central banks have followed the plan by the Federal Reserve  So if the stock market falls  the central banks will just print more money and put it into the financial system  One day this will likely create another massive bubble  but they will worry about that when it happens 2  Many stocks are reporting poor earnings so these equities will usually decline sharply and lead to another buying opportunity  The key here is to understand the technical support levels  This has been evident in equities such as International Business Machines  IBM   FedEx Corporation  FDX   Caterpillar Inc  CAT   Intuit Inc  INTU   and others  In other words  the  buy the dip  mentality is embedded in the institutional traders  viewpoint right now 3  Short trade setups are appearing everywhere  Many stocks have fallen despite all of the central bank money printing  Stocks such as Apple Inc  AAPL   EMC Corporation  EMC   and others have declined sharply recently  If you understand the technical chart patterns you can find many short trades in the market 4  The bond market has not rolled over yet as many so called experts have predicted  When the bond market shows strength it is telling stock traders that trouble could be lurking  Now please understand  the central banks are buying a lot of bonds so the bond market could be somewhat distorted  Either way  if there is a major sell off in stocks  money will pour into the bond market despite the low yields  This tells us that the stock market will be volatile and continue to provide countless trading opportunities in 2013 5  The housing market and housing stocks have been very strong since October 2011  Yes  countless private equity firms are buying single family real estate and renting out the properties  Many individuals now want to rent a home instead of owning a home  You can see that this is the opposite thinking from 2006 when people would do anything to own a home  This single family home buying by the private equity firms is certainly boosting the housing market  This is obviously part of the master plan by the Federal Reserve  After all  many construction jobs have been created with all of these home purchases by private equity groups  It is also important to note  many home owners feel better psychologically when they see their home values rise  Remember  a home is usually the largest purchase that a family will make in their life time  Stocks such as Home Depot Inc  HD   Lowe s Companies Inc  LOW   Sherwin Williams Company  SHW   and others have benefited greatly from the uptick in the housing market  As long as the consumer is spending money this stock market can hold up for a while  Right now  this market remains a great trading environment  so take advantage of it while it lasts ,2013-04-30,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-reasons-why-this-will-remain-a-traders'-market-164956,164956

10302,231817,SHW,Chemical Industry Stock Outlook  Continued Recovery  Challenges Remain,opinion,"The chemical industry had a bumpy ride in 2013 as a weak European economy  effects of sequestration in the U S  along with certain industry specific challenges led to subdued demand for chemicals for most of the year  Nevertheless  the December quarter showed signs of life with improving trends across key industries  raising hopes of a recovery  Although the quarter showed continued recovery across commercial construction and electronics end markets  the industry is not out of the woods  Questions about the emerging markets and a still challenging economic backdrop in Europe remain roadblocks  But the industry is expected to fare relatively better in 2014  aided by a shale gas boom in the U S   healthy Chinese demand and significant capital investment  Chemical makers are ratcheting up investment on shale gas linked projects to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies which is expected to boost capacity and export in 2014 and beyond  Strength across agriculture and automotive markets and healthy demand in emerging geographies represent tailwinds for the industry  Strong agricultural market fundamentals in Latin America and a gradual revival in the housing market bode well for recovery prospects this year

Chemical Recovery Gathering Steam
The chemical industry is poised for a recovery this year and the next  The American Chemistry Council  ACC   an industry trade group  foresees national chemical output  excluding pharma  to rise 2 5  in 2014  up from a 1 6  increase in 2013  and further improve to a 3 5  gain next year  Growth will be backed by strong agricultural market fundamentals  healthy demand from light vehicles market and a recovery in the housing market manifested by increase in building permits and a steady pick up in home prices  U S  chemical exports are expected to rise 6 6  this year and 7 6  in 2015  leading to continued generation of trade surplus  Trade in chemicals is expected to rise with a recovery in global manufacturing activities  On the global front  ACC sees production to move up 3 8  in 2014 and 4 1  in 2015 with healthy gains expected across North America and emerging markets  The ACC expects strong capital spending in the coming years  stemming from new investments in petrochemicals and derivatives  It envisions U S  capital spending to reach  61 2 billion by 2018  The shale gas boom is expected to drive investment on plants and equipment in the U S  The ACC expects U S  chemical revenues to surpass  1 trillion and the industry to rake in record trade surpluses by 2018  partly boosted by significant share gas driven chemical capacity  According to the European Chemical Industry Council  CEFIC   which represents the European chemicals industry  chemical output was flat year over year in Europe in 2013  modestly better than an expected 0 5  decline  Weak demand across automotive and construction markets remain as overhang  contributing to fragile recovery  Nevertheless  CEFIC expects recovery in the European chemicals industry to continue at a sluggish pace and sees a 1  rise in output in 2014  aided by an uptick in exports 
OPPORTUNITIES
Shale Boom Driving Chemical Investment
According to the ACC  emerging market growth and favorable oil to gas price ratios resulting from abundant shale gas production are driving U S  chemical exports  A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets  including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and healthy demand from the emerging markets  Affordable natural gas and ethane  derived from shale gas  offer U S  producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive  oil based feedstock  New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are boosting shale production  bringing down prices of ethane in the process  Leveraging the abundant natural gas supply and cost advantage  chemical companies are investing billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  that produce ethylene from ethane  The U S  has emerged as an attractive investment location and chemical makers are aggressively expanding capacity in the country  A recent ACC report indicated that potential domestic chemical investment related to share gas has reached as high as  100 billion  more than 50  of which are from firms outside of the U S  Already 148 projects    backed by Federal government support    have been announced by chemical makers to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies  These projects may lead to  81 billion in new chemical industry output annually and 637 000 permanent new jobs by 2023  Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years 
Agriculture  A Compelling Opportunity
Major chemical makers are increasingly shifting focus on businesses that cater to agriculture and nutrition markets in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand and input costs pressure  In particular  agriculture is emerging as a lucrative market as evident from recent trends  A healthy start in the North American growing season  strong planting activity by growers across North and Latin America  solid order book and healthy supply of seeds and crop protection products represent driving factors 
Strategic Actions
Mergers and acquisitions offer chemical companies another means to shore up growth in a still challenging economic scenario  These companies remain focused on exploring growth opportunities in the fast growing emerging markets  particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America  Moreover  cost cutting measures implemented by chemical companies including plant closures and headcount reduction should yield industry wide margin improvements  Cash flows derived through these actions can be used for growth 
Recovery in Chinese Demand
China  a major market  is expected to see a recovery in 2014  Government stimulus actions coupled with efforts to stem inflation appear to bear fruit and exports to the U S  and other key markets are regaining momentum  An improved demand outlook for China augurs well for the chemical industry this year 
Stocks We Like
Chemical stocks that we like include The Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW   PPG Industries Inc   NYSE PPG   Methanex Corp   MEOH O   DuPont  NYSE DD   Eastman Chemical Company  NYSE EMN  and Celanese Corp   CE   Dow and DuPont  in particular  are witnessing strong momentum in agriculture  driven by higher demand for crop protection products 
WEAKNESSES
Macro Headwinds
 Persistent weakness in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near term uncertainty  Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand  Given the industry s sensitivity to the global economy  any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical companies  In addition  weakness still persists in commercial construction  which is among the key end use markets  Demand from some of the major manufacturing industries remains below the historic levels 
Pricing  FX Pressure
Commodity prices  though subsiding of late  still remain a concern for many of the U S  chemical producers  Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy  given the competitive pressures at play  As a result  margins for a number of producers may be under pressure  In addition  chemical companies generate a major chunk of their revenues outside the U S   and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations  Currency exchange translation remains a headwind for these companies 
A Still Cloudy Agrichemical Space
Agricultural chemicals and fertilizer makers face challenges following the exit of world s largest potash maker Uralkali Group from one of the biggest potash cartels    the Belarus Potash Company  BPC     that influence potash pricing by controlling the production and supply  Uralkali s Board decided to end export sales through BPC and direct all potash export through its Switzerland based trade arm Uralkali Trading  This game changing move has put pressure on pricing  Moreover  demand for potash and phosphate remains somewhat weak in India  a key import market  Indian government s move to trim potash subsidy levels coupled with local currency devaluation contributing to lower demand for the nutrient in that country 
Stocks Warrant Caution
We hold a bearish view on Air Products and Chemicals Inc   NYSE APD  and The Sherwin Williams Company  NYSE SHW   We also steer clear of companies in the agricultural chemical space  Companies that fit the bill include Potash Corporation  NYSE POT   Agrium Inc   NYSE AGU  and CF Industries Holdings Inc  NYSE CF  ",2014-04-13,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/chemical-industry-stock-outlook:-continued-recovery,-challenges-remain-209434",209434
10311,231826,SHW,SHW  A Dividend Aristocrat Painting High Returns,opinion,"Sherwin Williams  N SHW  has annually increased dividends since 1979 and outperformed the market by nearly 14  per year over the last decade 
Watching paint dry has been quite rewarding with coatings producer SHW  but past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results 
As we review SHW for potential inclusion in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  we will be paying close attention to the factors that have contributed to the company s historical success and assess the likelihood of these factors persisting far into the future Business OverviewSHW has been in business since 1866 and is the largest producer of paints and coatings in the United States  80  of its revenue  and third largest worldwide  The company primarily serves the needs of architectural and industrial painting contractors and do it yourself homeowners through a network of more than 4 000 company operated retail stores  but it also sells some industrial coatings  automotive finishes  and protective and marine coatings  around 20  of sales in 2014  Business AnalysisSHW s biggest competitive advantage is its controlled distribution model  The company operates over 4 000 retail stores  about as many as Home Depot  N HD  and Lowe s  N LOW  combined and four times as many as PPG 
Controlled distribution accounts for 75  of SHW s total sales and provides the company with greater control over its brand image  in store product experience  pricing  customer relationships  and inventory 
The majority of SHW s customers are contractors  and many of them prefer to deal with dedicated paint specialists rather than working with big box stores like Home Depot  SHW can offer the best range and quality of paints  and its higher quality paints are more valued by contractors  which tend to be less price sensitive than consumers  Contractors know that SHW s paints can help them complete jobs faster because of their higher quality  e g  faster dry time  less coats required  etc    which means more money in their pockets 
SHW is also likely to have a convenient location for contractors almost anywhere around the country   more than 90  of the U S  population lives within a 50 mile radius of a SHW store  As contractors continue taking market share from do it yourself consumers  SHW s business should continue to benefit 
As a result of SHW s large network of stores  long operating history  strong brands  and direct in store relationships with customers  it has built up number one brands in architectural paint  stain   protective finish  aerosol paint  auto specialty paint  painting tools  and wood sealers 
In addition to strong pricing power  SHW s margins also benefit from the company s vertical integration  Big box retailers must pay wholesale prices for their paint inventory  but SHW produces its own coatings  resulting in higher profits  The business also requires little capital  helping SHW consistently generate excellent free cash flow Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Growing free cash flow is a sign of a very healthy business and tends to reward shareholders over long periods of time  SHW is no exception  As seen below  the stock compounded by 21 1  per year from 2006 through 2015  nearly tripling the market s 7 4  annual return over this time period Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Management has created substantial value for shareholders  but can the company s next decade of life come close to matching its last  The bar has certainly been set high 
The company s next goal is to hit 5 000 stores in North America  which would be about a 25  increase from where the company ended 2014  Management insists this is not the end goal but rather a milestone along the way of SHW s long term growth path 
Given the high level of fragmentation in the paint market  we believe SHW will have opportunities to continue its expansion  but the company is likely much closer to a saturation point  at least in the U S   than it was 10 years ago  As we mentioned earlier  SHW s store count is already substantially higher than Home Depot  Lowe s  and PPG  N PPG   and its stores are close to almost all of the country s population 
SHW has also invested in Latin America for international volume growth and continues expanding its product offering through R D  acquisitions  and organic distribution growth  e g  its first ever architectural paint program in Lowe s stores nationwide under the HGTV HOME by Sherwin Williams label rolled out over the last year  
We think SHW s growth outlook looks good over the next 3 5 years  but we are less sure beyond then due to the company s relatively large store base and geographical concentration in the U S  market Sherwin Williams  Key RisksAs we alluded to above  we believe the biggest risk to SHW s long term future is market saturation in the U S  The company has significantly more stores than its next largest peers and a strong presence in most regions already 
Investors appear to be giving management the benefit of the doubt given the stock s current earnings multiple  20x   If SHW finds fewer opportunities for profitable store growth than it currently expects  the stock will be in trouble  The company also has less exposure to faster growing international markets  so it is especially dependent on U S  growth opportunities 
Additionally  SHW s market seemingly has few barriers to entry   no one can stop Home Depot or other competitors from building new stores in a location and pressuring prices   but the company s brands  reputation  and specialization  controlled channel model  help mitigate risk from new competition 
Finally  the state of the housing market and trends in raw material costs  e g  oil based materials and titanium dioxide  could impact SHW s business results over the near term  but we don t expect either issue to impair the company s long term outlook  Dividend Analysis  Sherwin WilliamsWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
SHW s Dividend Safety Score of 96 suggests that the company s dividend payment is safer than 97  of all other dividend paying stocks in the market  As seen below  SHW s payout ratios have remained low and steady over the last decade  providing plenty of cushion and room for growth  Even if SHW s earnings cut in half  its payout ratio would only increase to around 50  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Looking the cyclicality of SHW s business  we can see that sales growth has remained within a relatively tight band over the last decade  SHW s revenue fell by just 11  during the financial crisis  and its free cash flow per share actually grew  The company s stock outperformed the S P 500 by over 40  in 2008  too  Despite its exposure to the housing market  SHW s business held up fairly well because homeowners continued to use paint for affordable redecorating projects and the company had numerous opportunities to plant new store locations Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Despite selling a commodity  paint   SHW s strong branding  vertical integration  and economies of scale have enabled it to generate outstanding returns on invested capital over the last decade  High returns create economic value and help the company compound its earnings faster by squeezing more out of every dollar of capital reinvested back into the business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
SHW s balance sheet looks alright  Its cash balance is lower than we like to see at  206 million compared to debt of  1 9 billion and dividend payments last year of  215 million  but the company s dependable free cash flow generation helps alleviate these concerns Source  Simply Safe DividendsDividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
SHW s dividend growth prospects are excellent   the company has a Dividend Growth Score of 97  The company is a dividend aristocrat that recorded its 37th consecutive dividend increase in 2015  and SHW plans on hiking the annual dividend by 25  in 2016 
As seen below  SHW s dividend growth rate has accelerated over the last decade  increasing from 12 6  per year over its last 10 fiscal years to about 20  per year over the last three years  We anticipate double digit dividend growth continuing for many years given SHW s strong underlying earnings growth and its low payout ratios Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationSHW trades at 20x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 1 1   which is in line with its five year average yield  Investors clearly believe SHW has compelling long term earnings growth prospects by assigning this paint producer a 20x multiple 
We like the business and believe it is very durable  but we are less sure of management s long term store growth expectations  If SHW runs into market saturation sooner than expected in the U S  and moderates its store expansion pace  things could get ugly as the stock re rates to account for less growth 
For now  we will remain on the sidelines and look to revisit the stock closer to  215 per share  To deliver an exceptional total return  SHW needs to continue growing earnings close to 10  per year 
While such growth is certainly possible and the company has proven many wrong over the last decade  we believe that SHW s high earnings multiple leaves less margin of safety ConclusionSHW is a blue chip dividend stock with a bright future and strong staying power  However  even the best businesses can make poor investments depending on the market s implied expectations 
For now  we believe there are other more attractive dividend stocks that offer a higher initial yield  above average growth prospects  and somewhat lower expectations  We will keep watching SHW for a better price ",2016-02-08,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/shw:-a-dividend-aristocrat-painting-high-returns-383727,383727

The stock has been a juggernaut since lifting out of the dust of the 2009 low  Running higher to the peak at the start of 2015 it was up over over 450   But since that peak around 295 it has floundered  Veteran investors know that stocks don t just go straight up forever  they take pauses and retrace along the way  It would make perfect sense if this was happening in Sherwin Williams over the last year 


The chart above shows the price action in Sherwin Williams over that time period using weekly data  And it tells an interesting story  The consolidation with a pullback to point A and bounce then pullback to a higher low at C is tracing out a bearish Deep Crab harmonic  Reading the word bearish you might think this a stock set up to fail  But this pattern suggest that a move over point B has no real reason to stop going higher until at least  340  At that point you can start to look for a Potential Reversal 
But getting over point B is not a given  Point B at  280 has been an important level for this stock since the start of 2015  First it acted as support  until May and then resistance  This is the third time at that resistance  The momentum indicators are positive and support more upside  but just turning bullish  The Bollinger Bands  are turning higher too  So there is support for a move higher  Keep a watch for that break to be able to paint your account green

10316,231831,SHW,The Market Has Been Like Watching Paint Dry,opinion,It has been sooooo slow the last few days  The S P 500 SPDR  SPY  has traded in a 1pt range for 4 days  It is like watching paint dry  Which got me thinking  What has been going on with that market darling in the  Paint space  Sherwin Williams  SHW  headquartered about 5 miles down the road  As seen in the chart below  the 12 month uptrend from last September is leveling now with a narrow consolidation area between 141 50 and 145 50  The Relative Strength Index  RSI  rolling lower suggests a downturn and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator  MACD  running negative agrees  But the RSI is still in bullish territory so this could work itself out over time and then move back higher Sherwin Williams  SHW Alerts to buy the break of the channel higher or short the break lower seem the best preparations  Look for about a  4 initial move either way once it is broken  Seems like the market makers are not using Sherwin Williams paint  But looking deep into the sector  to the other paint name Valspar  VAL  points to the action  It broke a double top higher last week  consolidated and is moving higher again The target from the initial break takes it to 62 30 so there is still plenty of upside to it and with volume increasing  the RSI bullish and rising and the MACD increasing  all looks good  Use the 55 70 area as a stop and maybe instead of watching paint dry you will be painting the town red  Valspar  VAL Disclaimer  The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2012-09-13,Gregory W.

10317,231832,SHW,If You Want A Strong Economy Cut The Short Term Capital Gains Rate ,opinion,The big debate from the politicians is whether they should allow the Bush tax cuts to expire  Right now  the United States and most of the world is still trying to recover from the worst recession in the past 100 years  What better way is there to stimulate the economy than to cut the short term capital gains rate  Many people that are struggling in the United States can t afford to hold a stock or an investment for more than a year to even qualify for a long term capital gain or Bush tax cut  They would much rather take a risk in the near term and have a smaller tax bill for that gain  if they are able to even achieve a profit  Think about it  at this time  short term capital gains are being taxed as ordinary income  A single person who takes a risk and makes some money gets slammed by income tax on the investment  average 30 0 percent or more   How is this an incentive to invest in the near term Many people that are willing to take on risk need their money now in order to do it again  For example  the real estate market has been coming back a little recently  There are many people that used to  flip  homes  In other words  they would buy a property  fix it up and then try to sell it for a profit  This type of venture requires a lot risk  A person who does this for a living or as a secondary income really never knows what type of problems they would encounter until they really examine the home closely  These people buy supplies from stores such as Home Depot Inc  HD   Lowes Cos Inc  LOW   Sherwin Williams Co  SHW   Mohawk Industries Inc  MHK   and Cemex SAB de CV  ADR   CX  to name a few companies  These home flippers are stimulating the economy right now  Many companies are going to benefit from this type of business activity  This is not the same as some person buying a stock like General Electric Company  GE  and holding it for forty years collecting a small dividend  The buy and hold type of investing does very little for the economy  especially in the near term   Next  the Federal Reserve should allow fed funds rate  overnight lending rate to the four large banks  to be traded and not dictated  As some of you may already know  the fed funds rate is basically zero percent for the four large banks such as J P  Morgan Chases   Co  JPM   Citigroup Inc  C   Wells Fargo   Co Inc  WFC   and Bank of America Corp  BAC   It has been this way since December 2008  and this is the reason why you do not receive much interest on your savings account  The average bank is offering interest of 0 10 percent on a savings account  This is peanuts and it definitely hurts the savers in this country  Why should someone who saves their money be punished because the central bankers are trying to force risk taking on the people  Again  the solution is to simply cut the short term capital gains rate and the people in the country will certainly take on more risk if they see it is beneficial or worth it to them ,2012-11-06,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/if-you-want-a-strong-economy-cut-the-short-term-capital-gains-rate-142405,142405
10318,231833,SHW,Sherwin Williams Paints A Picture Of Overvaluation,opinion,Sherwin Williams Co  SHW  reports earnings tomorrow July 19  2012  The Board of Directors have already declared a regular   39 per share dividend  Analysts are expecting Sherwin Williams Co to have a strong year  However  a quick glance at the earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  on Sherwin Williams Co  see below  paints a striking picture of overvaluation even considering the high earnings expectations for this fiscal year  Therefore  investors should be wary should Sherwin Williams miss their estimates  As the nation s largest specialty retailer of paint and painting supplies  Sherwin Williams is dedicated to supporting do it yourselfers with exceptional products  resources to make confident color selections and expert  personalized service that s focused on unique project needs  Sherwin Williams is committed to environmental responsibility in both manufacturing processes and finished products  and in 2011  earned the EPA Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award  Sherwin Williams products can only be found at its more than 3 400 neighborhood stores across North America   Earnings Determine Market Price   The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  Sherwin Williams Co   Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 1998  Performance Table Sherwin Williams CoThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 11 1  capital appreciation  long term shareholders of Sherwin Williams Co  assuming an initial investment of  100 000  would have received an additional  45 951 00 in dividends that increased their total return from 11 1  to 11 8  per annum versus 3 7  invested in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as high as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Sherwin Williams Co is 1 47 which is historically high  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 17 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Sherwin Williams Co s long term earnings growth at 13 1   Sherwin Williams Co has medium long term debt at 30  of capital  Sherwin Williams Co is currently trading at a P E of 23  which is above the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Sherwin Williams Co s True Worth  valuation would be  177 94 at the end of 2017  which would be a 7 5  annual rate of return from the current price Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows   All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Sherwin Williams Co to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Sherwin Williams Co s expected earnings would be 6 1 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component SummaryThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus

10399,231914,SHW,Is PowerShares DWA Industrials Momentum Portfolio  PRN  A Hot ETF Right Now ,opinion,"The PowerShares DWA Industrials Momentum Portfolio  PRN  made its debut on 10 12 2006  and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U S  equity market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market  or a specific segment of the market  and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy 
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes  as they replicate market returns in a low cost  convenient  and transparent way 
But  there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds  these funds track non cap weighted strategies  and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market 
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk return performance  based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics 
This area offers many different investment choices  such as simplest equal weighting  fundamental weighting and volatility momentum based weighting methodologies  however  not all of these strategies can deliver superior results 
Fund Sponsor   Index
The fund is managed by Invesco Powershares  and has been able to amass over  114 83 M  which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs  This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the DWA Industrials Technical Leaders Index before fees and expenses 
The DWA Industrials Technical Leaders Index identifies companies that are showing relative strength and are composed of at least 30 common stocks from a universe of approximately 3 000 common stocks traded on US exchanges 
Cost   Other Expenses
When considering an ETF s total return  expense ratios are an important factor  And  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 60   making it on par with most peer products in the space 
PRN s 12 month trailing dividend yield is 0 60  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Most ETFs are very transparent products  and disclose their holdings on a daily basis  ETFs also offer diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  though it s still important for investors to research a fund s holdings 
Representing 72 10  of the portfolio  the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector  Information Technology and Materials round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Jb Hunt Transport Services Inc  JBHT  accounts for about 4 87  of total assets  followed by Ametek Inc  AME  and Sherwin Williams Co the  SHW  
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 38 53  of PRN s total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about  0 85  so far this year and is up roughly 14 48  in the last one year  as of 05 30 2018   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  53 19 and  64 80 
The ETF has a beta of 1 23 and standard deviation of 15 27  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium choice in the space  With about 42 holdings  it has more concentrated exposure than peers 
Alternatives
PowerShares DWA Industrials Momentum Portfolio is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market  There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well 
Vanguard Industrials ETF  VIS  tracks MSCI US Investable Market Industrials 25 50 Index and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLI  tracks Industrial Select Sector Index  Vanguard Industrials ETF has  3 76 B in assets  Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund has  12 90 B  VIS has an expense ratio of 0 10  and XLI charges 0 13

10400,231915,SHW,Sector ETF Week In Review,opinion,"Summary
Short term sector performance is changing from a late cycle orientation to a more bullish alignment 
Longer term performance is still late cycle 
I take a deeper look at the basic materials sector 
Just to set this week s column up  over the last few months  we ve seen the sector performance take on a decidedly late cycle orientation  with healthcare  utilities  and consumer staples outperforming other sectors  Let s see if that s still the case  shall we 

It has been forever   I mean forever   since basic materials were at the top of the list  That is a beginning of the expansion orientation  not late  financials are late cycle  but energy isn t  nor are industrials  In fact  staples  healthcare  and utilities were in the lower half of the performance table this week 
We see the same situation developing on the one month performance chart 

Industrial are leading the pack  Healthcare is still second  but basic materials are now number three followed by the energy sector and consumer discretionary  In fact  staples and utilities are again in the bottom half of the table 
And we re even seeing some changes in the three month performance table 

Here we still see a late cycle orientation  with healthcare  staples  and utilities occupying the 1st  2nd  and 4th slot  This is to be expected  it takes longer for shorter term changes to filter through into the longer term performance statistics 

The 10 week performance graph still has a late cycle orientation  staples and healthcare are still leading  Financials are also improving  But now we see industrials making a move  while basic materials took a hard turn to the north  Utilities are now weakening 
So what s going on here  Let s start by looking at the daily chart for the XLBs 

Prices were moving sideways right above the 200 day EMA since mid April  They ve bounced off that technically important line four times since the mid spring  It shouldn t be surprising that the sector hasn t been able to maintain any upside momentum  Basic materials usually rally at the beginning of an expansion as traders buy the shares in anticipation that manufacturers will start to increase their production as the economy expands  The trade war between the U S  and  well  everybody  is also hurting  Over the last week  prices jumped  gapping higher mid week  They are now in the lower 60s  an area of technical resistance 
Within the 10 largest XLB holdings  we re seeing come solid rallies 

Six charts  Air Products  upper left   APD   Ecolab  ECL   top row  second from right   International Paper  second row  far left   IP   PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   second row  far right   Praxair  NYSE PX   bottom row  left  and Sherwin Williams  bottom row  right   SHW  have short  or longer term uptrends  Freeport McMoRan  top row  far right   FCX  has printed a short term rally 
This isn t a value play  the larger issues that are doing well are already expensive 

It is possible  however  that somewhat attractive dividend yields are at least partially driving this trade 

Two issues are over 3   three others have yields over 2  
So is this the beginning of a new trend or the nothing more than a short term development  I tend to think the latter  According to Markit s PMI indexes  the global manufacturing sector has been doing well for the last 18 24 months  the US manufacturing sector has been doing well for the same length of time   if that development was the cause of the rally  then the XLBs would have moved higher sooner  This looks to me like nothing more than a short term bump 
Disclosure  I we have no positions in any stocks mentioned  and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours

10401,231916,SHW,An Extended Oversold Period Ends With Important Footnotes,opinion,"AT40   21 4  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs    ends an 11 day oversold period that followed a 4 day oversold period AT200   32 0  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAs VIX   19 3 Short term Trading Call  bullish
Commentary AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   closed at X   The move ended a very extended 11 day oversold period that followed a one day respite from a 4 day oversold period  Thursday was the kind of day I wanted for a punch out of oversold conditions  it even quickly invalidated a small bearish divergence  The rally in the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    the NASDAQ  and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  were all strong enough to close at their intraday highs and surpass the previous day s intraday highs  The volatility index  the VIX  even cooperated by falling below 20 and presumably starts the end of wild swings in the market 
The S P 500  SPY  gained 1 1  in a move that confirmed the breakout from the lower Bollinger Band  BB  downtrend channel  
The NASDAQ gained 1 8  in a move that confirmed the breakout from the lower Bollinger Band  BB  downtrend channel  It closed right at downtrending 20DMA resistance 


The Invesco QQQ Trust  QQQ  gained 1 3  as it closed right at converged resistance from the 20 and 200DMAs 


The volatility index  the VIX  looks like it confirmed a double top  I earlier expected one final surge in volatility before the next implosion 
I thought my footnote on the action would be the wildcard of Friday s jobs report  However  a poorly received earnings report from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  in the after hours has the potential for sending the market right back into oversold territory  Whatever happens Friday  attention should quickly turn to the midterm elections on Tuesday  No matter the results  I am anticipating a volatility implosion as the market settles into incrementally lower uncertainty  If volatility remains high  then I will have to re evaluate my expectations for a relatively benign end to the year 
Perhaps an even more important footnote is the relative performance of AT40 versus AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  AT40 ended the oversold period at a slightly higher level than it ended the prior oversold period  However  AT200 ended this oversold period significantly lower  32 0  versus 39 6   This disparity flags longer term technical damage in the stock market  the rebound out of oversold conditions left behind a small group of stocks  These laggards will hurt breadth as the rally proceeds and could provide the seed for the next market topping action  As usual  I will take this process one step at a time 
Thursday was another day to mainly focus discipline on holding my long positions and looking for more buying opportunities from the shopping list  I snuck into ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  on the small pullback from the open  I am in accumulation mode for SSO shares  I added to my Walmart  NYSE WMT  call options  I launched another short Rio Tinto  LON RIO  versus long BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd ADR  NYSE BHP  pairs trade this time with a bullish bias  I even purchased a call spread on Red Hat Inc  NYSE RHT  to play the post IBM  NYSE IBM  deal discount  However  I missed out on getting back into Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   I blinked and the call options I targeted increased by almost 4x as the stock gained a whopping 6 0  by the close  President Trump s claim that he would get a  great deal  with China helped ignite the fire 
CHART REVIEWS
iQIYI Inc  NASDAQ IQ  In the wake of earnings on Wednesday  IQ fell to a near 6 month low  The stock looked ready to set an all time low  Then came along President Trump claiming he would make a  good deal  with China and that sent China related stocks off to the races  IQ gained a whopping 13 4  and left behind what looks like an abandoned baby bottom  Note that the primary downtrend from the 20DMA is still well intact  and IQ needs to break out from the lower Bollinger Band downtrend 
Iqiyi  IQ  immediately reversed all its post earnings loss with a 13 4  surge 
Vulcan Materials Company  NYSE VMC  VMC is one of the kinds of stock charts I love to see coming out of an oversold period  At the depth of the sell off and directly ahead of earnings  VMC dropped to a near 2 year low  The stock gapped up and ripped higher the next day in response to earnings  The move was like a definitive repudiation of the negativity going into earnings  VMC also received tailwinds with the general market bounce out of oversold conditions and buyers kept the momentum going  This stock is now a buy on the dip with a stop below that near 2 year low 
Vulcan Materials Corporation  VMC  printed an extremely sharp V in the wake of its earnings  Steeply downtrending 50DMA looms overhead as resistance 
Sherwin Williams Company  NYSE SHW  SHW is similar to VMC but a little less dramatic and a bullish move in a different order  SHW reported earnings and dropped to its 2018 low at the depths of the market sell off  Fast forward to the run up out of oversold conditions  and SHW has already erased its post earnings loss  The stock is a buy with a stop below the post earnings low  SHW of course still has plenty of overhead resistance to work through 

Sherwin Williams Company  SHW  reversed its post earnings loss this week in a move that seems to confirm a bottom 
iShares US Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  Housing stocks in general had a great day with home builders receiving a major bid  ITB moved out of the rotation with growth stocks and rallied alongside the market for a 3 1  gain  The rally pushed ITB above its downtrending 20DMA for the first time in a month and a half 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  confirmed a breakout from a short period of wide ranging consolidation  The 3 1  gain looks like it signaled a bottom 
Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  TOL did not participate in the big home builder rally on Thursday  but the stock made its big move on October 30th  A massive 9 2  one day gain sliced right through 20DMA resistance  Now TOL is stalled at 50DMA resistance  Earnings are still a month away so the resolution of this technical test could be a key tell for the prospects of home builders maintaining a solid start to their seasonally strong period 

Toll Brothers  TOL  is one of the first home builders facing a major overhead test  It is not a good sign that the stock stalled at 50DMA resistance over two days of rallies in the market 
Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLI  Last week  XLI broke down dramatically through its 2018 lows  The bounce out of oversold conditions took the index right back to those prior lows  This is an important juncture for industrial stocks  For good measure  I added to my hedge on bullishness with more Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  puts 
The Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLI  gained 1 8  in a move that recovered the previous 2018 low

10417,231932,SHW,Sherwin Williams  SHW  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Sherwin Williams  SHW  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 08 billion  up 2 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sherwin Williams 
For Sherwin Williams  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Sherwin Williams will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sherwin Williams would post earnings of  3 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 54  delivering a surprise of  0 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sherwin Williams appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sherwinwilliams-shw-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200407221,200407221

The company s expanding international business provides diversification  Its group disability and other businesses are expected to perform well  led by personalized and affordable solutions  Its growing membership has aided revenue growth 
Along with top line growth  Cigna has been able to maintain bottom line profitability as well  Its strong capital position enables investment in business  An increase in leverage might pose financial risks  Rise in operating expenses may weigh on margins

Shares of Buy ranked EOG Resources have declined  21  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Oil   Gas E P Industry  which has slumped  33 5  over the same period  EOG Resources holds premium acreages in the Permian  Bakken and Eagle Ford shale plays  among others  where it has identified 9 500 premium undrilled wells that could lend access to 9 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves 
In the Eagle Ford alone  EOG Resources has identified 2 300 locations that will drive the firm s oil production  The Zacks analyst likes the fact that the company has been focused on consistently returning cash to shareholders  
Taking into account the latest quarterly dividend hike  the upstream energy player has managed to hike dividend payments by almost 72  since 2017  Notably  the upstream energy firm recently reported strong first quarter 2019 earnings  thanks to higher oil equivalent production volumes  Moreover  the company emphasizes on reducing cash operating expenses and expects to lower costs through 2019  thereby boosting its bottom line

The Zacks analyst likes the fact that as a major U S  defense contractor  Northrop Grumman continues to enjoy a strong position in the Air Force  Space   Cyber Security programs  In a bid to boost its growth trajectory  Northrop Grumman completed the acquisition of rocket maker Orbital ATK for  9 2 billion last year  Increasing international opportunities are expected to boost the company s margin growth  
Currently  the company is getting ready to move into full rate production for Triton  However  it continues to incur high operating expenses on account of increasing product costs  This may disappoint investors

10447,231962,SHW,Why Earnings Season Could Be Great For Sherwin Williams  SHW ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The Sherwin Williams Company   NYSE SHW   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Sherwin Williams is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up to date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SHW in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  6 51 per share for SHW  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 46 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SHW  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  0 77  heading into earnings season The Sherwin Williams Company Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that SHW has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Sherwin Williams  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market  Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ,2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-earnings-season-could-be-great-for-sherwinwilliams-shw-200475646,200475646
10448,231963,SHW,Nearly 25  Of S P 500 Firms Report This Week,opinion," Monday Market Open  So far  red hasn t colored October the way it did last year  but the hunt for an elusive 3000 in the S P 500 Index  SPX  continues after the market couldn t get its head above that particular wave last week  

The next five days are packed on the earnings beat  with about a quarter of S P 500 companies due to report  So far  things have gone pretty well  but it s still early  A little more than 14  of S P 500 companies have reported through Friday  FactSet data shows  Of those  81  posted earnings that beat third party consensus expectations 
So that means we ll be 40  done with earnings by the end of this week  giving investors a decent feel for how Q3 went  The season started with analysts expecting a 4  year over year earnings drop  but maybe things won t turn out so badly  We ll have to wait and see 
Remember  though  that it s important to not get carried away so early in the game  If analysts are right  this would be the third straight quarter of earnings declines  It s hard for the  P  to go up in price to earnings when the E is going down 
When it comes to earnings reports  consider keeping a close eye on revenue  and not just on earnings per share  Keep in mind that companies can make adjustments around EPS to have them look more palatable  Revenue isn t something they can tinker with  It s either there or it s not 
Despite all the negative talk going into the season  it seems like market participants are relatively happy so far with the early showing  You can arguably see that in the S P 500 Index s  SPX  ability to stay in the neighborhood of 3000 despite some pullback on Friday  Last week  the SPX rose 0 5  and the small cap Russell 2000 led all indices with a 1 5  gain 
Earnings season really takes off  literally  this week with several major airlines reporting along with However  today is a bit light on the earnings calendar  The biggie this morning was energy company Halliburton  NYSE HAL   but tomorrow is when the fun really starts with LMT  McDonald s  NYSE MCD   Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   and United Technologies  UTX  all before the open 
HAL  by the way  saw shares essentially go unchanged in pre market trading as earnings met expectations but revenue came up a bit short 

Two traditional caution signs for the stock market Treasury yields and volatility remained in check at the end of last week  The Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  stayed under 15  which is well under highs of 20 seen earlier this month  In addition  10 year Treasury yields are barely nudging  stuck roughly at the mid point of recent highs and lows at 1 75   We ll see if either of these markers start to provide more direction as the week continues 
Straight Ahead  Fed And Brexit
Beyond the immediate prospect of earnings  two big events start to loom large as the month rolls along  By the end of next week  we could know the final score for Brexit and we ll definitely have new word from the Fed  Until then  the market could be nervous and unlikely to break out of its long term range as investors await the outcomes Confused about Brexit and how it might affect things  You re not alone  We ve never had anything like it before  so there s no playbook here  That s one reason it s hard to tell if the market is pricing in anything big one way or the other  Events over the weekend  with prospects of another delay  didn t really do much to blow the clouds away  It seems like anything  including a  no deal Brexit   remains possible with the Oct  31 deadline just 10 days away The other thing that s a lot less foreign to investors but also could keep the market in check is next week s Fed meeting  Odds of another 25 basis point rate cut  the third since July  rose to 92  this morning up from 73  a week ago according to the Fed funds futures market  So that s not really in much doubt  What could be interesting is to see how the Fed comes out of that meeting looking ahead to December  The China trade situation also keeps chugging along  and like Brexit  is still hard to predict  With earnings front and center this week  it s possible the constant flow of headlines and tweets around trade might take a back seat  That said  you never know when something big might pop up and volatility might flare 
Old Week Ended On Amber Note
Friday was one of those days that could fool you if you don t pay close attention  The Dow Jones Industrial Average   DJI  fell nearly 1  as more controversy about Dow components Boeing  NYSE BA  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  weighed heavily  The much broader SPX fell less than 0 4   and is probably a better way to judge how the day turned out 
Entering the new week  the SPX remains about 14 points under 3000  a level it peaked over briefly last week but hasn t closed above in more than a month  The all time intraday high of just under 3028 recorded back on July 26 hasn t been tested in any meaningful way since mid September  While it s not necessarily out of the question  it would be pretty surprising to see that happen in the next two weeks  considering confusion over the status of  phase one  of a China trade deal  plus Brexit and the Fed coming up 
Judging by the mild gains in stock futures before Monday s open  it seems like investors are wading cautiously into the week hoping for the best 




FIGURE 1  LET S STICK TOGETHER  Both S P 500 Industrials  SIXI candlestick  and Technology sector stocks  IXT purple line  have traded pretty much in sync over the last three months  Companies from these two sectors dominate the earnings calendar this week  so we ll see if any divergence develops  Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results   

Earnings Spread Wings  If last week was all about the banks  this week it s all over the place as far as earnings  There s arguably no one sector that stands out  though you could argue Technology has a place at the front of the line with Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Intel  NASDAQ INTC  on the calendar  The Industrial sector comes into focus in a big way with LMT tomorrow and BA and CAT on Wednesday  and don t forget the consumer when we get a look at McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   We can get a sense of air travel demand with Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV    American AIrlines  NASDAQ AAL    and Alaska Air  ALK  all on the docket  Then there s the chance for a back door look at housing  so to speak  with Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW  on Tuesday  Paint sales often point toward how many people are doing home renovation projects and how many contractors and home builders are spreading coats on new homes  
Early Results Appear to Confirm Two Trends  There was so much nervousness coming into earnings season about what the results might bring  but there is some happiness that results so far have been pretty good  What the results to date have really done is two things  Show that the Financials are incredibly resilient  and confirm that the consumer is ridiculously healthy  Whether the next few weeks continue to send the same message is anyone s guess  but that s why the market opens every day 
Some of the earnings calls to consider paying close attention to this week  besides BA which should be interesting for the 737 MAX update include  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  and Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Both of those could give insight into the China tariff situation  and INTC also offers a look into the chip sector  where stocks have been on a roll but demand concerns haven t gone away 
Leadership Matters  Friday s sad news about the death of Oracle  NYSE ORCL  co CEO Mark Hurd just a month after he d taken a medical leave reminds investors not only how unpredictable life can be  but also why it s not a good idea to pick a stock based only on the company s leadership  If you admire a certain CEO  you can t always be sure he or she will be there for the long run  For anyone buying an individual stock and intending to hold it a while  it s important to choose based on the underlying company and industry fundamentals  as well as the entire executive team rather than one person 
Sometimes the death of a key executive can hurt a stock  though it s unclear if ORCL s losses Friday were related to Hurd s death or part of a broader market selloff  However  if you own a stock and the CEO dies  that doesn t necessarily mean it s time to sell  Think back to the death of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  co founder and CEO Steve Jobs in 2011  At the time  a lot of people worried the company wouldn t be the same and the stock wouldn t recover  Instead  shares of AAPL have almost quadrupled since then  That doesn t mean there s any way to predict the same for ORCL  only a reminder that it s not all about an individual

10492,232007,SHW,Looking Ahead At 2020 3 Drivers Of A Likely Wall Street Rally,opinion,Wall Street is on the verge of completing a fabulous 2019 after a pathetic 2018  This year  the U S  economy and stock market touched several milestones  In March  Wall Street bull run completed 10 years  Historically  this is the longest bull run of the U S  stock markets  In July  the U S  economy entered the historically longest 11th year of expansion  All three major stock indexes reached several fresh highs However  the question is  will this dream run continue in 2020  Though experts are divided on their opinion  here we give three reasons as to why the Wall Street rally may continue next year Stable Economy and Corporate Profit to Support Higher Stock ValuationThe three major stock indexes   the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite   gained 22   28 5  and 34 8   respectively  with just a day of trading left for this year  Many industry experts have said that it will be difficult to sustain this level of valuation in 2020 However  a stable U S  economy is likely to be a cushion for the country s stocks  The U S  GDP growth is over 2  despite being its in the 126th month of expansion and completing a calendar decade without recession for the first time in history  Strong consumer spending  which constitutes 70  of the GDP  a strong labor market  historically low level of unemployment  steady growth of wage rate will bolster investors  sentiments    The two major drawbacks were weak business spending and lower corporate profit  However  these were the fallout of a lingering trade conflict and tariff war with China  A possible interim trade deal with China in early January is expected to boost business confidence and profits Scrapping of proposed tariffs  rollback of some tariffs imposed earlier and an agreement on intellectual property disputes along with strong enforcement provisions and a substantial hike in agricultural imports by China will pave the way for growth  Our current consensus estimate indicates an acceleration in earnings growth from 2020 and beyond Fed to Support U S  Economic ExpansionThe Federal Reserve  which was largely blamed for the stock market rout in December 2018 due to its ultra hawkish stance  quickly corrected itself in 2019  After remaining quite in the first half of 2019  the central bank reduced the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in three equal trenches after the trade talk broke abruptly in May and government yield curve inverted in August fearing an impending recession Fed s timey intervention not only boosted the economy and raised investors  confidence  it also helped the sagging U S  housing market to recover with a low mortgage rate  Moreover  the central bank has adopted quantitative easing program through accelerating the growth of its balance sheet The Fed chair has reiterated his commitment to do whatever needed to support economic expansion and not raise interest rate until the inflation rate  which is currently at just 1 6   crosses the Fed s target level of 2     Globally U S  Stock Markets Are the Best  The U S  stock markets are the best destination for investors  During the post recession era  overall returns of U S  stocks were nearly four times higher than the rest of the world  After successfully recovering from the great recession  Wall Street recovered overwhelmingly from the trade related assault of 2018 The gigantic size of the U S  economy has given it a clear upper hand over emerging markets  Furthermore  geopolitical conflicts are not going to harm United States as much as the rest of the world  Technological innovation and superiority has always been a strong pillar of U S  economic strength    Wall Street witnessed a broad based rally in 2019  In addition to the three major stock indexes  which predominantly constituted of large cap stocks  the S P 400 mid cap index soared 24 3  so far this year  The Russell 2000 Index   the benchmark index for small cap stocks   jumped 22 7  and the S P 600 small cap index surged 20  The likely signing of phase one trade deal between the United States and China is expected to boost global economy  which will bolster U S  exports  Oil prices are likely to rise owing to higher demand and the United States will be the major beneficiary of higher oil prices  The government yield curve is currently firmly northbound and bond market induced recessionary fear is overblown    How to Pick the Right StocksAt this stage  several stocks are available which looks attractive for future growth  However  selecting three criteria will make the task easy  First  select large cap  market cap more than  50 billion  stocks which has stable business model and are regular dividend  income stream  payers Second  these stocks have skyrocketed in 2019 and still have strong upside left reflected by a long term  3 5 years  growth rate of above 7   Third  each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and has a  of A or B  You can see  Five stocks have fulfilled our selection criteria  Here are those  Target Corp    NYSE TGT    Costco Wholesale Corp    NASDAQ COST    The Sherwin Williams Co    NYSE SHW    Raytheon Co    NYSE RTN   and Northrop Grumman Corp    NYSE NOC   The chart below shows price performance of five stocks in the past year Zacks Top 10

10523,232038,SHW, Do Not Sell My Info   U S  retailers rush to comply with California privacy law,news,"By Nandita Bose WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  retailers including Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc will add  Do Not Sell My Info  links to their websites and signage in stores starting Jan  1  allowing California shoppers to understand for the first time what personal and other data the retailers collect  sources said  Others like  Home Depot   NYSE HD  will allow shoppers not just in California but around the country to access such information online  At its California stores  Home Depot will add signs  offer QR codes so shoppers can look up information using their mobile devices and train store employees to answer questions  Large U S retailers are rushing to comply with a new law  the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA   which becomes effective at the start of 2020 and is one of the most significant regulations overseeing the data collection practices of U S  companies  It lets shoppers opt out of allowing retailers and other companies to sell personal data to third parties  In addition to retailers  the law affects a broad swath of firms including social media platforms such as Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Alphabet s Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   advertisers  app developers  mobile service providers and streaming TV services  and is likely to overhaul the way companies benefit from the use of personal information   The law follows Europe s controversial General Data Protection Regulation  which set a new standard for how companies collect  store and use personal data  The European law gave companies years to comply while CCPA has given them a few months  Draft regulations around the law were released in October  Retailers did not anticipate having to add signs in their stores  which are required by the regulations but were not part of the original statute  Requiring signs in stores is not an effective use of retailers  dollars  said Nicholas Ahrens  a vice president at the Retail Industry Leaders Association  who leads its tech policy  A Walmart source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the company is  working through a lot of ambiguities in the law  for example  the language around loyalty programs and if retail companies can offer them going forward   There is also lack of clarity on what constitutes  sale  of information  retail lobbyists and attorneys advising retailers said  Walmart spokesman Dan Toporek said the retailer supports efforts that gives customers control of their information   Home Depot spokeswoman Sara Gorman said the California law introduces new requirements but does not change the company s  deliberate approach to customer data and privacy    Target   NYSE TGT  spokeswoman Jessica Carlson said a  Do Not Sell  button on its website  will be visible to all U S  shoppers and California residents will have access to information outlined under the new law  Target already allows its shoppers to opt out of

Sherwin Williams  NYSE SHW   which sells paints and coatings   have already begun adding links on their websites in California  Reuters has found  The company did not respond to requests for comment  Both Walmart and Amazon have ramped up investments in drawing out  data maps  in the past few months  which lets them collate the extent of personal information collected by different business units  where and how this information is stored  what they do with it and who it is shared with  sources said  A Walmart source said the company s different business teams including technology  marketing  advertising  payments and security are investing resources in auditing and making decisions on how to respond to requests from customers to see their data or those who ask for it to be deleted  An economic impact assessment prepared for the California Attorney General s  office by an independent research firm found compliance with the regulations will cost businesses between  467 million and  16 5 billion between 2020 and 2030  Industry estimates peg initial compliance costs at over  50 billion  The California Attorney General recently told Reuters in an interview that privacy law enforcement will look kindly on those that demonstrate an effort to comply  But sources told Reuters they expect plaintiff attorneys to bring lawsuits in the new year against a range of businesses that may fail to meet the law s requirements  Many companies affected by the law have lobbied extensively for a federal privacy bill that might override the law in California  But their efforts have so far made little progress

That concludes our review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and the full year So let me turn the call over to John Morikis  who will make some general comments and provide our outlook for fiscal year 2020  John John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jim  Good morning  everyone  Thanks for joining us  I d like to make just a few additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 before moving on to our outlook for 2020  We ended the year on a strong note  growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 21  compared to last year s fourth quarter  In terms of the full year  we delivered another year of excellent results for our shareholders  Sales grew by 2 1  to a record  17 9 billion  Adjusted gross margin improved to 45 1   reflecting our pricing efforts and moderation of raw material inflation  Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14  to a record  21 12 per share  Adjusted EBITDA increased  235 million to a record  3 1 billion or 17 1  of sales  Net operating cash increased  378 million to a record  2 32 billion or 13  of sales  Return on net assets employed increased to 15 1  on core profit before tax Total shareholder return for the year was 49 7   and we returned approximately  1 2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks  an increase of 28  over the prior year  We reduced our debt by  660 million  and we ended the year with net debt to EBITDA below 3x  Before moving on to my comments on our segments  I d like to take a moment to provide an update on the integration of valspar  Well  there s so much to be accomplished  particularly outside the U S  I want to thank our teams for their tremendous hard work today and bringing our two businesses together  and for increasing the value we are and will be able to deliver to our customers and to our shareholders Since the beginning of 2017  Sherwin Williams has generated  6 1 billion in net operating cash or 12 2  of sales  We ve used that cash to invest approximately  800 million back into the business  reduced debt by nearly  3 billion and returned approximately  2 5 billion to shareholders including  1 1 billion in dividends and  1 4 billion in share buybacks  We will no longer be calling out synergies related to the Valspar acquisition as it becomes more difficult to distinguish between acquisition synergies and our ongoing continuous improvements initiatives  We exit 2019 having a benefit of about  315 million from synergies in the P L  including about  75 million that was realized in 2019  We ve identified approximately another  100 million in opportunity  largely related to our supply chain optimization efforts in Europe and Asia  As previously communicated  we expect to realize a small portion of this benefit in 2020  with the majority being realized in 2021 and 2022 as projects are completed Let me now turn to just a few comments on our operating segments  all of which contributed to our record performance in 2019  Within the Americas Group  full year sales increased 5 7  against the prior year comparison of 5 6   Residential Repaint remained our strongest customer segment  up by double digit percentage year over year  This is the sixth year in a row we ve grown Residential Repaint at a double digit level  All other segments grew in the mid single digit range for the year  Full year segment profit dollars and margin also improved year over year  We continue to invest in innovation and service  introducing 27 new products  our ninth consecutive year of double digit product introductions  We opened 94 new paint stores in the Americas Group this year and closed 32 To be clear  we opened 84 net new stores and added 150 new sales territories in the U S  and Canada  Of the 32 stores we closed  26 were in Latin America and were related to changing market dynamics  In the Consumer segment  we generated growth with our largest retail partners in North America  though full year segment sales decreased due to lower than expected sales in Asia and Australia and the impact of the Guardsman divestiture  Adjusted segment margin improved to 17 5   driven by synergies  operating efficiencies  pricing  moderating raw material costs  and lower acquisition related amortization expense  Performance Coatings Group sales for the year were variable by geography and end market and were impacted by unfavorable currency translation rate changes  Growth in North America and Latin America was more than offset by softness in Europe and Asia  Mid single digit growth in our packaging and coil lines was offset by softness in other product lines  most notably  industrial wood Adjusted segment margin increased to 14 1  from 12 9  in the prior year  Pricing  synergies and good cost control drove the improvement  Turning to our 2020 outlook  We currently see a similar environment to last year  with North America architectural demand remaining solid and industrial demand remaining variable by geography and end market  We have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses  and I remain highly confident in our ability to provide customers with solutions based on innovation  value added service  and differentiated distribution  We enter 2020 well positioned and focused on what we can control  For the first quarter of 2020  we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by 2  to 5  compared to the first quarter of 2019  We expect the Americas Group to be at or above the high end of that range  We expect Consumer Brands to be flat or slightly up  excluding the impact of the Ace business we exited in 2019  and we expect Performance Coatings to be up by low single digits For the full year 2020  we expect net sales to increase by 2  to 4   with segment performance similar to what I described for the first quarter  On an earnings per share basis  we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude Valspar acquisition costs and onetime items  On this basis  and given our sales outlook  we expect adjusted 2020 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of  22 70 to  23 50 per share  an increase of approximately 9 4  at the midpoint compared to the  21 12 reported in 2019 on a comparable basis  This adjusted 2020 guidance excludes approximately  2 79 per share for acquisition related expense  The Regulation G reconciliation table in our press release illustrates these moving parts  We expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low 20  range One key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw materials basket in 2020 will be flat compared to 2019  assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions  We expect the basket to be lower year over year in the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the second quarter  with year over year costs flattening out or slightly increasing in the back half of the year  A few additional data points may be helpful for modeling purposes  We ll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers  These investments include new stores and reps  capacity and productivity improvements  systems and product innovation in both our architectural and industrial businesses  We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel These investments are embedded in our full year guidance  We expect capital expenditures to be approximately  320 million  which is about 1 7  of anticipated sales  Note that this estimate does not include any expenditure related to our previously announced headquarters and R D center project  We expect to provide you with an update on this project in the near future  Depreciation should be  275 million  and amortization will be about  310 million Historically  we have targeted dividends of about 30  of prior year GAAP earnings  Next month at our Board of Directors  meetings  we ll recommend a quarterly dividend increase of 18 6  to  1 34 per share  up from  1 13 last year  We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases  We ll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy  Before moving on to your questions  let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of Wednesday  June 3  on your calendars  That will be the day we ll host our annual financial community presentation at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York The program will include presentations by several members of our leadership team  We ll host our customary Q A session  followed by a reception and lunch  Again  that date is Wednesday  June 3  We ll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in April With that  I d like to thank you for joining us this morning  and we ll be happy to take your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse  Please proceed with your question Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you  Can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations for U S  housing and the consequence of architectural volumes outlook  just given some more constructive data  Just in terms of what you re hearing from the Americas Group heads and their customers  do you expect broader volume participation this year  Or just what are the key puts and takes  Thanks James R  Jaye    Senior Vice President Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsThank you  Sure  Chris  Good morning  It s Jim  What we always talk about when we have this question is we look at our sentiment from our 4 500 store managers and our 3 000 sales reps  and they continue to be very optimistic about what they re seeing as we end the year and as we head into 2020  As we ve talked about this in the past  from a big picture perspective  certainly  we believe that the continuing household formations in that 1 3 million range annually will support what s going on as we go forward  But as you point out  Chris  the more recent data is encouraging  We re seeing strengthening in single and multifamily permits  starts  and completions at the year end And really  the three month trailing average for all of those was up double digits  We were at the builder show that just happened  And I would tell you  optimism at that builder show among our customers was very positive  And you have other things out there that are supportive as well  The mortgage rate remains very reasonable and some of the recent reports by some of the national homebuilders are also talking about strong orders  So I think we feel very good about where housing is headed from a macro perspective Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerChris  this is Al  I d just like to add on to that comment by saying  as you look at how our North America paint stores group unfolded throughout the year  our second half was stronger than our first half  And even as you look at what TAG performed  we re at 4 8   you look at our same store sales  up 4 6   To put that in perspective  architectural gallons were high single digits in the quarter because as you    as a reminder  we did not go out with price in our fourth quarter  And historically  as we ve seen momentum in our second half and in our fourth quarter  that translates to growth in our first half  So that s what makes us feel pretty good about the paint stores in architectural in North America Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  And just a quick follow up  You previously discussed potentially getting your margins in consumer performance back up to    toward  let s say  20  was targeted  But can you just simply update us on your conviction and your ability to do this  And just also highlight to the investment community any key non raw material levers you can continue to pull to potentially make this happen in each segment Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Chris  We re not coming off our numbers  I am confident in our ability to hit those financial targets we laid out for 2020  As I talked about on the June Investor Day  I confirm that we ll hit those targets but on a lag  And I think  throughout 2019  we made significant progress and are on the right path to attaining those goals  And we ve even attained some of those goals already  If you look at our core gross margin at 45 1  for the year  it s at the low end of the targeted range that I had laid out at 45  to 48   And you look at our strong net operating cash  And if I looked at net operating cash at 13  less capex  you get a little over 11  net operating cash less capex  which is the target that we have laid out  So I am very confident in our ability on Performance Coatings and Consumer Brands to expand their margins to that mid  to high teens  low 20s  and they made good progress this year Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Please proceed with your question Stephen Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey hi  you just mentioned that the same store sales metric in the fourth quarter was mostly volume in TAG just because you lapped the year ago price  And Jim  you mentioned the strongest region was the southeast  where in October  they were really underwater in that region  So can you just comment on where you think backlog is in architectural paint contractors  And where do you think this could drive same store sales in 2020 John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Steve  I think we re feeling really good about the market and the feedback that we re getting from our customers  As you ve just mentioned  there is a backlog  Part of it  I think  has to do with labor  We continue to believe that backlog  if you will  in labor supports our model and helps build loyalty to what it is that we re trying to do for our customers  which is driving the technology and services that help them to be more successful  And we ve got a lot of new products that we re launching going into this year  a lot of services that we re introducing  all directly pointed at trying to help those customers to attack those So to your question  we think  geographically  it s pretty solid  There s no pockets that I ve been in yet or    nor that we ve heard from our teams  where people are feeling softness  There s a general consensus that contractors are feeling very good  could do more if they had more labor  And we want to be there to help support them accomplish their goals Stephen Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAnd John  did you anticipate that changing some of the acquired brands to the Sherwin brand would impact the outlook for sales for those products John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I d like Al to talk to it from a financial perspective  but absolutely  In fact  I would say we re feeling really good about the fact that we ve gotten here as fast as we have  As we entered into the integration  we re always listening to our customers and always listening to our employees  and the fact that our customers  the retention of both our customers and our employees is so high in allowing us to move aggressively in this brand consolidation gives us really a great sense of pride of the speed and execution that we re moving in Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  and Steve  I would just add  this is not indicative of the underlying businesses  If you look at healthy businesses  operating margins are expanding  and we saw that in Consumer Brands and in our Performance Coatings Groups this year  And as John talked about in his opening remarks  I mean  we generated strong cash flow over the period  end of  17 through  19  And we ll continue to do that  We saw strong cash flow in 2019  So as a reminder  we looked at this Valspar acquisition over the long term  It s hard when you re going into an acquisition to predict timing of when certain events happen  But as John said  improving our operating efficiencies by consolidating brands  that s only going to help us going forward Stephen Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Steve OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan  Please proceed with your question Jeff Zekauskas    JPMorgan    AnalystThanks very much  Can you talk about business conditions in China and in Europe  And maybe your offshore operations generally in 2019  how much did they grow in revenue terms  Or how much did they shrink  And whether business conditions in China in the first quarter of 2020 are very different than what they were in the fourth quarter of 2019 John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerRight  Well  I think  specifically to China  I d say that the environment that we find ourselves in some of our business has been a challenge  If you look at our industrial wood  for example  with the tariffs and generally a weaker economy  it s had an impact on our business  We ve had pockets of strength in Southeast Asia  particularly in the cabinets area wood  So I d say from a wood perspective  it s been the most challenging  That said  if you look at our packaging business as an example  we had a terrific run there in Asia  actually  across the globe in packaging  Our coil business in Asia was positive  We had some pressure in our general industrial business there  Our automotive business is pretty small  Jeff  in Asia  but it was positive  So I d say a mixed bag there  Clearly  some pressure  but our market share there is such that it gives us terrific opportunity for growth  and that s where we re headed Jeff Zekauskas    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  And then just a small question  You talked about most of the growth in the stores business in the fourth quarter coming from volume  But in previous quarters  it seemed that price was a larger element  Did you simply annualize your price increases or was there some competitive activity that led to a lower price benefit  Or was there a mix effect  Why was price a smaller component in the fourth quarter John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  There was virtually no price in the quarter  and it was because last year  2018  the price increase went in the 1st of October  Jeff  In this year  we rolled it in January 1  So the fourth quarter was exposed from a pricings perspective  And I d just point out  as Al mentioned  so when we look at the architectural gallons in that fourth quarter up the high single digits  it was a really good quarter for our team in our TAG business Jeff Zekauskas    JPMorgan    AnalystThanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird  Please proceed with your question Ghansham Panjabi    Baird    AnalystGuys  good morning  Can you help us with the margins on the Americas Group segment  Did that play out the way you thought it would during the fourth quarter  During the third quarter  you had a nice year over year acceleration in margins  I think it was up 120 basis points  4Q was closer to 70 basis points  and that was also in a very healthy increase in sales  What were the offsets there Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So Ghansham  the way I look at    I start with the flow through  When you look at flow through in TAG in the fourth quarter  and it was over 33   so we saw nice leverage on our gallon increased  As John talked about in his opening remarks about investments and additional opportunities  and we have taken a long term strategic view of the market  And aside from just new stores and new reps that we talked about  John talked about expanding our digital platform that I think    and we believe will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace  And we re expanding and investing in that tool to get better aligned with our customer to offer better services to make them more efficient  Ultimately  as we ve talked about  we want to drive higher top line growth for them and profitability  So we started that really coming in third quarter and fourth quarter  and you ll see us continue investing at the next year John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Ghansham  I think when we were together  actually  we talked a little bit about some of the investments we were making on that digital  And we re really proud to be announcing that we ll be rolling this out nationally at the end of the first quarter  We think this is the start of a    we have a number of products in the pipeline here  but the start of a process that we ve been really investing in  And to Al s point  we re cranking that up  And the idea here is increasing that loyalty and the contractors leaning on us to be more efficient in what it is that they re trying to do  We talked early about labor  And this    the launch of this digital platform will help them run a more efficient business  It s not just external though  We re also investing internally  We didn t talk about this last year  We ve made it through one year now with our sales reps now having had iPads for one year We think that s improving the productivity of our sales organization to be more responsive to our customers  This year  we ve just announced to our team  we re rolling out iPads into our stores to make them more productive and more efficient and more responsive to the needs of our customers  So we are investing  We re investing in this business  We have great confidence of our position right now  And quite frankly  we see some competitive opportunities that we want to take advantage of  So we re putting our foot on the gas here Ghansham Panjabi    Baird    AnalystOkay  And then just for my second question on the Performance Coatings segment  Even with the industrial markets having been weaker for everybody  including you  the margins were still up year over year  Was there any residual price catch up or any significant mix benefit from businesses like packaging that drove the margin expansion apart from just synergy flow through Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Ghansham  that s a very astute point  As packaging and coil sales have expanded faster than the rest of the businesses  we do see some lift in the margin on that  Yes  as we ve talked about in the past  our industrial business took the brunt of the run up in raw materials in  17 and  18  We ve been chasing that for the last few years  It doesn t come in uniformly like our paint stores group  So yes  we saw some pricing flow through in our fourth quarter  And then the other thing I would say is  as we are investing in growth opportunities  we are also laser focused on controlling and managing our costs where our businesses and or regions aren t performing to where you expect them to perform or seeing a path to a set target  So we re controlling our costs and consolidating operations as well  So you can expect that to continue as we go forward  as we continue to invest in other areas Ghansham Panjabi    Baird    AnalystThanks so much Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystYes  thanks for taking my question  With regard to    in the release  you had laid out some acquisition related costs still in 2020  kind of to the tune of what looks to be  300 million to  350 million or so  I guess what is that still being spent on  And I guess how much of it is    how much should we be thinking about as actually a cash hit  And then  I guess  tied to that  how are you thinking about cash conversion as we look to 2020  Because it obviously took a big step up in  19  but curious how or where we go from here Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  John  I m glad you brought that up because it s important that for an apples to apples comparison  we wanted to call out acquisition related costs  And the amortization depreciation year over year is very similar  Embedded in that number is about  30 million in additional integration costs  And we wanted to include that in our guidance in the Reg G table  but we re not going to be laying that out going forward  That breaks out  just so for modeling purposes  a little more back half versus front half loaded  But this gets us in the next phase  Like John talked about  synergies is part of our continuous improvement process  We re going to get back to integration activities  it s just part of our normal operating process  As far as cash flow  John  you ve followed us for a very long time  13   that s always the new high watermark  And as I talked about in our Investor Day and earlier  net operating cash less capex  we re targeting 11   and we expect to continue to hit that target as we go forward John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  And then just a quick follow up  With regard to the pipeline that you re seeing from your customers  it sounds like the residential side is pretty solid  Can you speak to the non resi side and what you re seeing there John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  it s very good  If you look at the commercial side  property management  I d say  John  trying not to get ahead of myself here  but we re feeling really good  I was just    came back from our national sales meeting  We had 8 500 of our closest friends together talking about just that  And very bullish environment  very positive  And if you go from the commercial to property management into healthcare  I mean  there s a general feeling that our customers are really excited about what s ahead for 2020  So we re really looking forward to this year John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  thanks very much for the call John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thank you  john OperatorThank you  Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGood morning  Just curious on the paint store side  was there any change in the quarter  I know that you put up an 8  comp in Q3  and that would imply like a 6  volume and you did a 5 3  here  So it doesn t appear that way  I m just curious if you noticed an improvement in Q4 or a deceleration  And do you expect kind of similar kind of mid  single digit volume growth in 2020 John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Ron  I d say the largest impact that we had was our Protective   Marine business that runs through our TAG business  The Architectural business  as we mentioned  was up high single digits  We talked about the fact that we ve had another double digit increase in Residential Repaint and just talked about some of the other segments and the confidence that we have there  If you look at those indicators that we often cite  spray equipment  nonpaint items  everything points in the right direction  So high single digit architectural gallons going through impacted by the P M business  And the P M business  through our stores  was largely impacted by oil and gas  which was under pressure  And we had some timing of some big projects likely not going to be starting out until the beginning of the second quarter  So we saw a little bit of softness in P M in the fourth quarter  probably going to see a little bit in the first quarter  But again  the pipeline that we re looking at here is really solid Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  And Arun  I would just add to that  The price increase that we went out with in our North America stores on January 1 was 3  to 4   We expect an effective rate of just below 2   And as John laid out in the opening remarks  we expect paints    our TAG organization to be at the high end of our 2  to 4   So you think 4  to 6   If there s less than 2  in price  the rest is volume Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  That s very helpful  And then just as a quick follow up on PCG  obviously  there s macro pressures and regional variability  as you said  Do you think that is kind of tilted to the downside  just given the coronavirus  Or maybe you can just offer your thoughts on where we are potentially destocking wise or    especially in Europe and Asia  is there any potential for stability there as we move through 2020 John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think we look at the comparisons of 2019 to 2020  and we have higher expectations moving forward  It might be helpful  Or maybe I could just talk about each of the segments just briefly  If we look at our auto  and maybe I ll just do it for a number of the regions rather than just the two  because I m sure there s some more questions there  On auto  we d say North America  we feel really good  Probably the best I felt in the time I ve been CEO or COO  Collision shop business here is very strong  I think we re in a really strong position  and we re going to take advantage of that going forward  Europe  I d say we had a little bit of softness in our auto business in Europe  Asia  as I mentioned earlier  it s a small business  up mid single digits  In Latin America  we have a leadership position  It was impacted primarily by currency  We had a good quarter in auto in Latin America  Packaging  clearly  the non BPA is giving us a terrific opportunity  We believe that s an ongoing transition with plenty of opportunity for us ahead And so we re investing in this business  We re investing in technology and in capacity and really trying to stay aligned with our customers  We ve got great partners that we re trying to support  And if you look at this  this was a double digit quarter for them  North America was strong double digits  To your question about Europe and Asia  Europe was up  but Asia was up really  really strong double digits  And there  our business in packaging is growing  both in beverage and in food  In coil  new business wins really across the region  North America throughout everyone  We did have a little bit of softness in comparison in Europe  But this is a team that s really hitting on all cylinders  and we re working hard  So those are the ones that are really performing quite well  GI  Asia  we felt some impact there in our general industrial  largely in the heavy equipment and ag equipment  But we have a good pipeline of projects and good    really good people there We expect to really see some improvement in our performance in this business  Industrial wood  I talked about earlier  China  a lot of pressure  Feeling good about Southeast Asia  Europe was another area of pressure as well  So among all the businesses  I would say the one we re feeling the most pressure in would be the industrial wood  And then Protective   Marine  I talked about largely running through our North American business through our TAG  But if I look at our smaller businesses  albeit Asia is a very small business  it was up strong double digits for us  Europe  down slightly as we had some pressure and some comparisons to some business there  Latin America was up slightly as well  So that kind of captures all the regions  all the businesses  Arun  Hopefully  satisfied some other questions with that response Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners  Please proceed with your question Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystYes  good morning  I was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on capital deployment  You ve made some nice progress again on the balance sheet  John  just wondering if you would foresee any material change in the balance of acquisition activity versus repurchases as you look ahead into 2020  John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the M A activity is something that we re really focused on  We think it s an important part of our future  although we don t feel as though we have a gun to our head  We ve got    the challenge for us right now  quite frankly  internally is prioritization of the opportunities  So we re very active  And I would say  to answer your question  you should see us deploying more cash into M A  I don t think you re going to see the transformational type of acquisition that Valspar was  but we re working business by business to understand region by region where it is there are opportunities  I want to clearly point out that we are not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere We are absolutely determined to invest where we can return    generate a return of share for our shareholders  And each of our businesses have developed a really good strategy that they re executing  and any of those M A opportunities include the right to win in those markets  So we re not going to be there  We re not deploying cash in commodity areas  and we re not deploying cash for the sake of saying that we can be somewhere  We re there to make money Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystUnderstood  That s helpful  My second question relates to raw materials  It sounds like you anticipate some relief to start the year  Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to the individual categories like pigment and petrochemicals  etc  And then with regard to resins  in particular  just wondering if you could comment on your degree of internal integration versus external purchases of resins and how that s evolved in recent years  if it has James R  Jaye    Senior Vice President Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsSure  Sure  Kevin  Glad to answer that  As John said in his comments  and you re right  our outlook for this year is that the overall basket will be flat compared to 2019  And that s assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks  no supply disruptions  It will be lower year over year in the first quarter  It will be a lesser extent in the second quarter and then sort of flatten out  maybe increase in the back half  If you remember  we had our highest rate of inflation in 2019  it was in the first quarter which moderated through the year  So our full year outlook  that s our best estimate at this time  The visibility  once you get a couple of quarters out  is a little bit murkier  When you get to the specific categories  Kevin  we expect the petrochemical basket to be in line with our overall raw material outlook  probably a tailwind in the first quarter  maybe into the second quarter before flattening and again increasing in the back half We re seeing right now key feedstocks  propylene  ethylene are down year over year as we enter 2020  And other key materials like epoxy  for example  more on our industrial side  are also down year over year  From a TiO2 perspective  right now  what we re seeing is relatively stable moving into 2020  based on the current demand environment that we re in  So that s kind of a big picture look at it from a resin internalization standpoint  I ll let Al take that one Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Kevin  I don t think our strategy has changed  We ve picked up a nice business with EPS as part of the Valspar acquisition  We ve got to even invest in more assets to internalize resins  but it s a balance  We look at where we can make the most from a    not just    not a cost necessarily  but from a differentiation standpoint  And we have  as we ve talked about  a number of projects in the pipeline across each of the segments to continue to drive what I d call continuous improvement opportunities  You saw some of that benefit in our Consumer Brands group this year and helping their margin expansion  and you should expect that going forward John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Kevin  if I could  I d just like to add just one other component that was just slightly touched on by Al on the proprietary development of technology  We re looking at this opportunity to serve our customers  particularly the painting contractor who s looking to maximize productivity  And we re combining the asset that you re asking about in a way I think that s really unique for Sherwin  We re trying to position ourselves to provide solutions and technology to help those customers to be more productive  I mentioned earlier the number of products that we are introducing  And here  I d just like to take the opportunity to talk about three of those because I think it highlights what Al just talked about from a resin capability standpoint  And I ll be very brief on this  But this gives us the opportunity to develop products that really help our customers in a unique way  We re introducing a product this year called Flex Temp that provides a contractor the ability to get out earlier  colder temperatures and stay out longer in hotter temperatures It actually has a spread of ability to be applied from 35 degrees Fahrenheit up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit  with no change in viscosity  terrific uniform application  And so it extends the ability of these painting contractors to be out  So when we talk about labor and the challenges of getting caught up  we re looking at ways to make them more productive  We re introducing a new product called Emerald Rain Refresh that  again  same platform of technology  proprietary  We ll hold on to this  No one else will have it  But this is a product that not only optimizes applications so that you have more productivity from painters with less experience  This is a product that when it rains or it is hosed down  it looks like it was just painted So after every rain  the home or commercial building  to look as if it was just painted  brand new clean  So these painters that have applied this in the commercialization process have just been really raving about it  And the last one  just to be brief again  we re introducing a new extension on our Emerald line  which is our top of the line product  This will be the finest paint that we ve produced yet  outstanding hiding  great applications  So again  painters with limited experience  We re making limited experienced painters  better painters  Best application  better touch up  all with this idea that if we re developing resins and products for them  the loyalty to Sherwin increases Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystThank you so much John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Kevin OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Anthony Walker    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  guys  This is Anthony Walker on for Bob  Maybe just two quick ones  Can you talk about the performance of the international businesses within the consumer segment  which you acquired through the Valspar transaction  In the past  you ve talked about potential strategic or rationalization opportunities there  assuming the businesses continued to underperform  How should we think about the timing and the opportunity there John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think    let me just walk through the three areas there just briefly  First  Asia  I d say the business is certainly going through a transition  We ve talked about the fact that this Walroom brand was predominantly focused on interior wood  So we re shifting that strategy  as much of that business internally  and region is now shifting to a shop or factory applied application  And so the teams are developing a strategy and executing pieces of it to pursue and reposition the brand there  Again  a small piece of the business  but we think this is an important one  Future opportunity here is terrific  We re gaining    we re making some progress in the quarter  We started to see a positive trend in Asia  So I d say that one is trending the right way Europe  we made significant progress this past year  Sales were positive in mid single digits  Operating profit improved to a low double digit percentage  So feeling that we are pointing in the right direction there  Australia is a bird of another color  We ve got some challenges there  And quite frankly  we re not performing as needed  We have plans and teams executing on this  This is one that you should expect us to get closer to and see some improvement or making some tough changes Anthony Walker    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  And then just one on the price increase that you announced for the Paint Stores Group  How should we think about that flowing through the results in the year  Will we start to see that show up in the first quarter in full  And then how should we also think about the magnitude of what I assume are labor  freight and distribution expenses as sort of tempting to offset Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  The pricing will roll out on a similar cadence to past price increases  You ll see some of that for sure in the first quarter  And then as it takes hold over the next six months  we ll get full effectiveness as it flows through all of our customers  When you look at our cost basket that we ve talked about  merit increases are higher than what they ve been in the past  healthcare benefits continue to rise  and as we ve absorbed those over the past number of years  But this price increase is not unprecedented to cover costs other than raw materials  And if you go back in the first quarter of 2014  we went out a price increase to cover those costs  Because as you can imagine  it s a compounding  If you don t get it in the first year and it compounds over three or four years  it gets to be pretty steep  So that s kind of why this justification with this price increase John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  We re not getting thank you notes from our customers  obviously  But many of them are facing similar situations  So the fact that we waited until January 1 gave our customers an opportunity to kind of recalibrate as they re bidding going forward in the new year  And secondly  the fact that they re experiencing the same thing  I think  has helped in the execution as well OperatorThank you  We ll move on to our next question  which comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities  Please proceed with your question Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    AnalystHi  good afternoon  They might be wondering if you could give us an update on the progress at Lowe s  And maybe just more broadly speaking  your expectations for DIY in the first half of  19  It seems like with refinancing activity having picked up and the easy weather comps and the store resets and the training that s been going on at Lowe s  that maybe that business could be stronger  yet you guys provided guidance that suggests that consumer is more flattish for the full year John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So a piece of that  just a reminder  as we have the ACE business that s coming out  So that s a piece of the go forward forecast  Mike  But I would describe our opportunity at Lowe s quite simply as we think we re moving the ball in the right direction  but we re never satisfied  And we re investing  I mentioned earlier in my remarks about that we re stepping up our investments in the home center channel  Obviously  they would be a big part of that  We see that there are opportunities in both the consumer side and the professional side  those pros that paint  we think it s a terrific opportunity for us to help our customer On the consumer side  we have a lot of opportunities to help convert shoppers into customers  And we made a big commitment to this relationship  and we want to see this thing through  And the opportunity here is to help execute and that s on all fronts  So I don t think you should ever expect us to say that we re done  This is a business that we re looking at just aggressively as we do our own stores business  We think there s opportunities  and we re committed to helping our customer win Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerMike  I would just add to that  that we have talked about this in the past that embedded in our Consumer Brands segment is our retail channel that has been under pressure consistently  And as Lowe s has performed better  they certainly are taking share from that segment  And then we re trying to be realistic  When we look outside the U S   we re trying not to build    although optimistic  trying not to build a hockey stick to our sales guidance  And    but rest assured  we expect more out of those teams outside the U S Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    AnalystAll right  And then I wanted to also ask about the ColorSnap consultation brand and how that s contributing to paint store sales growth  How much of North America do you have covered with the ColorSnap offering at this point  I m just trying to get a sense of kind of what stage we re in with that rollout and how much more it could contribute John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  we re pretty early in it  There was an opportunity  And again  this goes back to helping our customers  Mike  you really hit on something here  because this has worked out quite well for us  not so much just for the consumer  but our residential repaint contractors are leaning on us to help accelerate the selling process for them  And as we employ this as well as the digital ColorSnap  which is an AI application that s new and continuing to    we continue to enhance the previous platform  it allows our customers to accelerate through their process of closing business  This is the professional painting contractor to a homeowner  So I would suspect that you re going to see that as a component  one of many items that we are going to continue to leverage and add service and productivity that helps build loyalty to the painting contractor  But it s still got a lot of opportunity across the country  A lot Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  We ll move on to our next question  which comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed with your question David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you  Good morning  John  can you discuss your plans for store openings and any closings in 2020  And any impact on the cadence of store openings from either your digital strategy or how you re trying to service some of your larger customers going forward John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we expect to continue in that range of 80 to 100 stores  We    I don t know that it s changed in any way from a store cadence  We d like to see a smoother rollout of the stores rolling in  I ve been trying to fix that since I ran that business 15 years ago  But I d say that we feel really good about it  I also want to thank our teams because I think we re getting    continuing to get better at it  The stores that we re opening and we re cranking up faster  and the impact is better  Some of that has to do with the quality of people in the stores as well as the systems that we re adding to those  So I d say you should expect us to continue to add in those stores at a similar rate to what we ve had Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  David  I d just add  When you look at TAG and we closed 32 stores in the year  26 of those stores were in Latin America  We have talked about the pressure we ve been under Latin America  As you know  we take a rigorous and consistent view of our portfolio of businesses  brands  customer programs and other investments  And as we ve not been able to see a line of sight to above average growth either in sales  operating margins  cash  we ve had to take action  We re not exiting those markets  but pushing those sales through what I would call more of a dealer network which is a little less asset intensive  And I think you ll see some of that continue here in our first half David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystVery good  And John  just lastly  what s your sense on the pool of available painters in both the quantity as well as the quality in 2020 John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLet s say  it s under pressure  Our customers  as I mentioned earlier  would like to move faster  and there are a number of wonderful painters and many people entering in the industry that are learning as they go  And as I mentioned  as I ran through those products briefly  We re taking that into consideration as we re building products and helping our customers to improve their efficiency  So I d say they re both under pressure  People that typically enter into the trades  we re working with those professionals to help train those employees  but there s a pressure in finding them David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from P J  Juvekar with Citi  Please proceed with your question P J  Juvekar    Citi    AnalystYes  hi  Good morning or good afternoon Plastic  single use plastics  are coming under pressure  So it s bags and bottles  I was wondering if as bottles come under pressure  would some of the food and beverage stuff move to cans  And would that become an opportunity for you on interior or exterior coatings of the cans John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  The answer is yes  We would welcome that transition  and we want to work to support our customers to do that  As I mentioned earlier  the progress that we re making in our packaging business in both food and beverage has been fantastic  and more of that transitioning into our packaging and customers  business is terrific  And that s why we talk a lot about this in our stores business  But even on the packaging side  we re really determined to help our customers through technology to help speed up lines  to help minimize    not damaged  but trying to buy imperfections in the coatings  But the idea here is  as we help them become more efficient in driving efficiencies into their plant  the better supplier we are  So we re really focused on making them better P J  Juvekar    Citi    AnalystOkay  And then my second question is now that your leverage is below your target of 3x  what is your willingness to look at M A  what size  And would 2020 be the year that you come back into the market for M A Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerP J   we have consistently are looking for acquisitions of any size  I mean I think you re right  As you look at our debt to EBITDA ratio under three in 2020  I don t expect to pay down debt  And as our EBITDA grows  you ll see us drive that target down toward the two to 2 5 long term target that I have  But yes  we are actively looking for acquisitions  But as John mentioned earlier  we re taking a disciplined approach to that  And I d say  we raised the dividend 18   We ll keep capex below 2   But absent those M A  absent any acquisitions  we re going to buy back our stock this year John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  But I think to your point though  our COO  David Sewell  got his teams really leaning forward in this area  looking for those opportunities  not only just simply from the opportunity  but from the strategic value that can be gained from it P J  Juvekar    Citi    AnalystThank you John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  PJ OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley  Please proceed with your question Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you  All I ve got left on my list is  Al  can you just    the tax rate stepping up this year  is that just sort of your starting point  And then you see how the year plays out and what things your team comes up with  Or do you    how should we be thinking about the higher tax rate Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Vincent  That    I m always looking at the tax rate  It s a function of how many options and how our legal entity consolidations flow through to help that tax rate  So I started at the low 20  range and then I expect our tax guys to develop plans and continue with the programs that are going to continue to drive that down Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks very much Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays  Please proceed with your question Duffy Fischer    Barclays    AnalystYeah  Good morning  Just one for me  Volumetrically  how fast did the North American architectural market grow last year  do you guys think James R  Jaye    Senior Vice President Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsWe haven t seen official data yet on that  Duffy  If I go back to probably the most recent data we have is 2018  gallon growth was a little over 2   I want to say it s probably similar in 2019 and probably at a similar level in 2020  sort of that low single digit level  if I would guess Duffy Fischer    Barclays    AnalystThanks  guys James R  Jaye    Senior Vice President Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsYou bet OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman   Associates  Please proceed with your question Justin Speer    Zelman   Associates    AnalystThank you guys  I just wanted to unpack that  if you could help maybe further unpack the nature of those SG A investments  And how you think they ll unfold from a percentage of revenue standpoint Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Justin  we re not going to go down the P L by line on the guidance  I think what we ve consistently done is grow our store count  grow our rep count  and then these additional investments are going to come through pretty evenly throughout the year  And we re not going to quantify them because it s like any other review that we do  We want to see how the first half unfolds  how volumes look and it may give us an opportunity to accelerate in the back half of the year like we did this year  So I think it depends  but they re in our guidance and we ll continue to manage those accordingly John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say  Justin  we are planning on sharing a number of these with you during our financial community presentation on that June 3 date  where we ll give you some idea from    in some of these areas  the digital  I think you ll be really impressed with  And to the extent that we re comfortable in sharing  obviously  we don t want to point specifically for competitive reasons to what we re doing  But as much as we can  as things roll out  we ll share what we ve done  but not what we re going to do Justin Speer    Zelman   Associates    AnalystOkay  And I guess  maybe because I m sure you pilot  I know you piloted a number of these different programs  But just curious how the    there s like a response rate in terms of growth improvement to the model  Or is it just a stickiness in this widening of the moat  bringing the customer closer  the relationship is good  But does it change the growth algorithm or the amount of gallons that flow through  all else equal John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  we re doing this for growth  We absolutely believe it improves the stickiness  the moat    any metaphor we want to use  but we are growing our business  and we re going to do it profitably  And we think that the more solutions that we bring to our customers to help make them more profitable  the more likely we re going to continue to be their supplier  And so we re really focused on not just one lever  one silver bullet  but a number of these that will enhance their ability to be successful  And as a result  we become a better supplier to them Justin Speer    Zelman   Associates    AnalystAnd my last question is just on the consumer business  Just how much mix benefit from that transition in ACE will you    are you thinking or estimating for your 2020 targets there Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  What we talked about is the ACE business  that private label business was about  100 million a year  considerably below the average of our consumer operating margin  We didn t lay that out and we re not going to  but you should expect margin improvement because of that Justin Speer    Zelman   Associates    AnalystThank you  gentlemen OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital  Please proceed with your question  We ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo  Please proceed with your question Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    AnalystHi  good afternoon  guys  Thanks for taking my questions  First  just wanted to make sure I m understanding this clearly on your TAG in paint stores demand outlook for 2020  The full year guide  I think it implies that volumes grow pretty much in line with 2019  maybe at a bit of a slower pace even  When I m listening to you all  you re very optimistic on the architectural volume side  Seems like that market is even accelerating  which would imply that Protective   Marine in that non res market might even be decelerating versus 2019  Just trying to understand how you all are thinking about that  And if you can walk me through the parts John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Truman  I d say you re right in sensing our confidence in the architectural side  having just finished the quarter in the mid single    or I m sorry  high single digits  gives us confidence moving forward  On the Protective   Marine side that runs through there  we ve got the fourth quarter and likely the first quarter right now that we re seeing is likely a little softer than we would have liked to see  but feeling pretty good about it going forward  So I think we re trying to be just in line with what our customers are telling us  and we feel pretty good about the number that we put out here Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Truman  the other comment I would make is  as I mentioned earlier  if you look at the way the year unfolded for paint stores in North America  we had a strong second half versus the first half  even a 9   8   7  TAG increase in the third quarter  which is a large quarter and a very good result in a large quarter like that  So I think when we get through our second quarter and see how the year is unfolding  we can give you an update then Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  OK  And then final question for me just on the raw materials basket  Can you just discuss what kind of tailwinds you actually saw in the fourth quarter from an overall basket perspective  And then just remind us what you ended up seeing in 2019 as a whole James R  Jaye    Senior Vice President Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsYes  Truman  Costs for the broad basket that we buy  I would say  moderated slightly in the fourth quarter  19 from third quarter of  19  So it kind of played out as we thought  Fourth quarter 2019 was also lower year over year  The year over year decrease in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by lower cost for resins  solvents  And we don t provide specific dollars on the savings of the raw materials  but you can see the positive trend  I think  reflected in our year over year gross margin improvement Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  thank you James R  Jaye    Senior Vice President Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsSure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G Research  Please proceed with your question Rosemarie Morbelli    G Research    AnalystThank you  Good afternoon  everyone  John  I was wondering if you could give us a little more on the impairment charges  I am assuming that the bulk of it is the woods coatings in China  but you also mentioned one impairment taken in the Consumer Brands category  Is that ACE  Or a little color on which product lines you are more or less eliminating as there is no growth and those for which you are going to change the brand name John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Rosemary  I would not classify it as no growth  I would characterize it in GI and in automotive  As we ve put in  implemented our systems  our legacy systems  we ve gotten customers to move to a new label and that has helped us optimize or streamline our operations  That s the biggest impact  Another example would be in Australia  We re under pressure that we talked about earlier about driving operating margin and cash flow improvement  And one way to do that is reduce the number of brands you re trying to support  And so in that area  we also move from    remove focus  if you will  on one brand and driving it more through the Wattyl brand And again  that s going to help us in the midterm here to reduce our costs and keep investing in labels and merchandising and different things like that  So the Walroom brand in China has been under pressure  John talked about that transition certainly from    to factory applied coatings  That is an impact  And as that transition continues to move and expand  we re not expecting or anticipating any other impairments going forward Rosemarie Morbelli    G Research    AnalystOkay  And then the goal was very optimistic  Your projections of 2  to 4  on the revenue line is stronger or higher than it was  2019 versus 2018  And yet  if I look at your EPS projections at the midpoint  it is up 9  versus up 14  in  19 over  14  if I have those numbers right  So I am wondering  what are the offsets Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Rosemarie  I d say that we re    if you re comparing last year to the go forward  as I talked about the price increase that we went out with and being effective under 2   that s below what we really realized through the first three quarters of last year  Our raw material moderation isn t as strong as what we saw in 2019  And these investments that we talked about  even though we re seeing slower in our second half of  19 on Performance Coatings  we continue to invest back in this    in our businesses that we think are going to provide growth opportunities in the future  not only the new stores and the new reps that we even accelerated in the back half  but this digital program that John laid out  And then some other    our home center channel that    so yes  we re continuing those investments in 2020 John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt may not have an immediate feedback or a payback  but we re running this company longer term than just one quarter  And we absolutely believe these are the right investments to make  And so we re moving forward aggressively  taking advantage  as I said  of not only the market  but we really think there s some competitive opportunities out here that we want to take advantage of Rosemarie Morbelli    G Research    AnalystOkay  So nothing really special  just going forward and investing where you need to John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerInvesting where we need to  skinnying back where we can  But leaning forward  we think that we ve described it internally  Rosemarie  as a coil  We feel we re cranking this coil down  and we expect it to respond given the investments that we have in a very positive way Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Rosemarie  we don t expect the market to be this way  But if you go back to 2007   08 and  09  when we added 260 new stores  when we came out of that  you look at our market share growth  not only on the 3 year  but the 5 year and the 10 year compounded average growth rates  we think we re well above market growth and that s the attitude we re taking  We look at it long term and expect  as John mentioned  that coil to grow market share faster than what we ve done in the past Rosemarie Morbelli    G Research    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence  Please proceed with your question Christopher Perrella    Bloomberg Intelligence    AnalystHi guys  quick ones on Lat Am volume  Has that flattened out for you at this point and you re looking for inflection in 2020  And then just a little color on consumer pricing  Do you expect to get about half of what you get in the TAG group for 2020 Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Chris  I would say  for Latin America  our volumes have  I would say  improved as the year has gone on  But where you re seeing it is as we continue to see the devaluation  we re continually    that team is continually having to go out with price  60  of our raw materials are dollar denominated  so every deflation we see in Brazil  as an example  we re constantly chasing with price  So the biggest portion of our impact right now is price  But some of the things that we re doing on streamlining sales organizations and focus on the right segments and customer segment will help drive growth in the future John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  We re just not waiting for the market  We re not waiting for currency  We re trying to do    we mentioned earlier  control the things we can control  And our Mexico sales were up high single digits  clearly offset by Argentina and Brazil and some of the other regions  As Al mentioned  we re trying to be very aggressive in Brazil  The store reduction is an example of that  But we re looking to drive more profitable sales to the most efficient channels down there Allen J  Mistysyn    Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  And Chris  the second question on price  Yes  In Performance Coatings  we do still have opportunities for price in certain businesses and regions  And as you remember   17 and  18  we saw the big run up in raw materials  Our industrial businesses were impacted the most  Although raws have moderated  and our expectation is in 2020  they re not back to where they were at the beginning of 2017  So we re continuing to need price  We ve expanded our margins  but we expect and I feel confident that we ll get to the high teens and low 20s  And recovering those raw material costs plus the incremental freight cost  plus the merit increases and healthcare that I talked about on TAG  those are affecting our Performance Coatings Group  and we re having to offset those  So yes  we re going to continue with price Christopher Perrella    Bloomberg Intelligence    AnalystThank you John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Chris OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research  Please proceed with your question Chris Bottiglieri    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  guys  thanks for the question  First of all  I want to kind of follow up on your comment earlier on the auto business  looking the best that it s been in your tenure  A little surprising to hear  I mean are you starting to see like accident frequency inflect or total loss rates come down  Or is it more so just competitive dynamics where you feel like you re taking share from the channel John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCompetitive dynamics  we re taking share  I think the market    there s been some compression  we think  and we ve talked about that openly with safer cars and safer attributes that are going into these vehicles  which are absolutely critical  So we re doing it by the technology that we re bringing and the services that we re bringing  The combination of Valspar and Sherwin together  we have a new improved system that we think has been very well received by the marketplace  And we re really working hard to serve those customers in a way to help their throughput through those facilities Chris Bottiglieri    Wolfe Research    AnalystGot you  That s helpful  And then one other question on coronavirus  I just want to think there are like potential impacts  maybe like a more of an indirect impact  Recognize you don t have high exposure to like Chinese TiO2  But are there any impacts to that market that could manifest in the global supply chain if the work stop continues  Or any other like feedstock or inputs that  again  if we continue to see more business shutdowns and extended holiday that could maybe have an impact on your business  Curious how you think about that James R  Jaye    Senior Vice President Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsYes  Chris  Let me start just by saying  first  when we look at this  the health and safety of our employees is  1  obviously  And so we re monitoring that very carefully and the recommendations that are out there  We ve suspended travel to and from China in the short term  And we re limiting some travel inside the country to business critical  So we re doing that  But I think we re working closely with our teams there  our customers  our suppliers  Haven t seen  to this point  any negative impact  and we ll continue to monitor that closely  I think it s just too early to see John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNow we ve got some very good leadership on the ground there  Jason Wu and his team are keeping us fully abreast  And I d say right now  from a procurement standpoint  we re staying close  So there s a couple of dynamics  There s a raw material piece of it and there s also the point that Jim just mentioned about  trying to make sure we re doing everything we can to protect our employees and work with our customers  There s a whole lot of people trying to do everything possible to do that  But there s a lot of uncertainty  and we ll react as it unfolds Chris Bottiglieri    Wolfe Research    AnalystGot you  Really helpful  Thank you John G  Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet OperatorLadies and gentlemen  this concludes our question and answer session  So I d like to turn the floor back over to Mr  Jaye for any additional concluding comments James R  Jaye    Senior Vice President Investor Relations   Corporate CommunicationsThank you

to  55 2 million in 2018  Full year segment profit was  379 1 million  including a charge of  117 million related to trademark impairment compared to full year segment profit of  452 1 million in 2018  Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit by  7 1 million in the year  Acquisition related amortization expense decreased full year segment profit by  215 5 million in 2019  compared to  215 8 million in 2018  Fourth quarter performance coating group segment margin was negative 0 6  or 9   excluding the  117 million trademark impairment charge  compared to 8 7  last year  Excluding acquisition related amortization expense and the trademark impairment charge  fourth quarter segment margin increased to 13 4  from 13 1   Full year segment margin was 7 5  or 9 8   excluding the trademark impairment charge  compared to 8 8  last year  Excluding acquisition related amortization expense and the trademark impairment charge  full year segment margin increased to 14 1  from 12 9   That concludes our review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and the full year  So let me turn the call over to John Morikis  who will make some general comments and provide our outlook for fiscal year 2020  John  John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Jim  Good morning  everyone  Thanks for joining us  I d like to make just a few additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 before moving on to our outlook for 2020  We ended the year on a strong note  growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 21  compared to last year s fourth quarter  In terms of the full year  we delivered another year of excellent results for our shareholders  Sales grew by 2 1  to a record  17 9 billion  Adjusted gross margin improved to 45 1   reflecting our pricing efforts and moderation of raw material inflation  Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14  to a record  21 12 per share  Adjusted EBITDA increased  235 million to a record  3 1 billion or 17 1  of sales  Net operating cash increased  378 million to a record  2 32 billion or 13  of sales  Return on net assets employed increased to 15 1  on core profit before tax  Total shareholder return for the year was 49 7   and we returned approximately  1 2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks  an increase of 28  over the prior year  We reduced our debt by  660 million  and we ended the year with net debt to EBITDA below three times  Before moving on to my comments on our segments  I d like to take a moment to provide an update on the integration of Valspar  While there s still much to be accomplished  particularly outside the U S   I wanted to thank our teams for their tremendous hard work to date in bringing our two businesses together and for increasing the value we are and will be able to deliver to our customers and to our shareholders  Since the beginning of 2017  Sherwin Williams has generated  6 1 billion in net operating cash or 12 2  of sales  We ve used that cash to invest approximately  800 million back into the business  reduced debt by nearly  3 billion and returned approximately  2 5 billion to shareholders  including  1 1 billion in dividends and  1 4 billion in share buybacks  We will no longer be calling out synergies related to the Valspar acquisition as it becomes more difficult to distinguish between acquisition synergies and our ongoing continuous improvements initiatives  We exit 2019 having a benefit of about  315 million from synergies in the P L  including about  75 million that was realized in 2019  We ve identified approximately another  100 million in opportunity  largely related to our supply chain optimization efforts in Europe and Asia  As previously communicated  we expect to realize a small portion of this benefit in 2020 with the majority being realized in 2021 and 2022 as projects are completed  Let me now turn to just a few comments on our operating segments  all of which contributed to our record performance in 2019  Within the Americas group  full year sales increased 5 7  against the prior year comparison of 5 6   Residential repaint remained our strongest customer segment  up by double digit percentage year over year  This is the sixth year in a row we ve grown residential repaint at a double digit level  All other segments grew in the mid single digit range for the year  Full year segment profit dollars and margin also improved year over year  We continue to invest in innovation and service  introducing 27 new products  our ninth consecutive year of double digit product introductions  We opened 94 new paint stores in the Americas group this year and closed 32  To be clear  we opened 84 net new stores and added 150 new sales territories in the U S  and Canada  Of the 32 stores we closed  26 were in Latin America and were related to changing market dynamics  In the consumer segment  we generated growth with our largest retail partners in North America  though full year segment sales decreased due to lower than expected sales in Asia and Australia and the impact of the Guardsman divestiture  Adjusted segment margin improved to 17 5   driven by synergies  operating efficiencies  pricing  moderating raw material costs and lower acquisition related amortization expense  Performance coatings group sales for the year were variable by geography and end market and were impacted by unfavorable currency translation rate changes  Growth in North America and Latin America was more than offset by softness in Europe and Asia  Mid single digit growth in our packaging and coil lines was offset by softness in other product lines  most notably industrial wood  Adjusted segment margin increased to 14 1  from 12 9  in the prior year  Pricing  synergies and good cost control drove the improvement  Turning to our 2020 outlook  We currently see a similar environment to last year with North America architectural demand remaining solid and industrial demand remaining variable by geography and end market  We have many opportunities to grow share in all of our businesses  and I remain highly confident in our ability to provide customers with solutions based on innovation  value added service and differentiated distribution  We enter 2020 well positioned and focused on what we can control  For the first quarter of 2020  we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase by 2  to 5  compared to the first quarter of 2019  We expect the Americas group to be at or above the high end of that range  We expect consumer brands to be flat or slightly up  excluding the impact of the Ace business we exited in 2019  and we expect performance coatings to be up by low single digits  For the full year 2020  we expect net sales to increase by 2  to 4  with segment performance similar to what I described for the first quarter  On an earnings per share basis  we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude Valspar acquisition costs and onetime items  On this basis and given our sales outlook  we expect adjusted 2020 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of  22 70 to  23 50 per share  an increase of approximately 9 4   at the midpoint  compared to the  21 12 reported in 2019 on a comparable basis  This adjusted 2020 guidance excludes approximately  2 79 per share for acquisition related expense  The Regulation G reconciliation table in our press release illustrates these moving parts  We expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low 20  range  One key assumption embedded in our outlook is that the market rate of inflation for our raw materials basket in 2020 will be flat compared to 2019  assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions  We expect the basket to be lower year over year in the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the second quarter with year over year costs flattening out or slightly increasing in the back half of the year  A few additional data points may be helpful for modeling purposes  We ll continue to make investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers  These investments include new stores and reps  capacity and productivity improvements  systems and product innovation in both our architectural and industrial businesses  We also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform and the home center channel  These investments are embedded in our full year guidance  We expect capital expenditures to be approximately  320 million  which is about 1 7  of anticipated sales  Note that this estimate does not include any expenditure related to our previously announced headquarters and R D center project  We expect to provide you with an update on this project in the near future  Depreciation should be  275 million  and amortization will be about  310 million  Historically  we have targeted dividends of about 30  of prior year GAAP earnings  Next month at our board of directors  meetings  we ll recommend a quarterly dividend increase of 18 6  to  1 34 per share  up from  1 13 last year  We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases  We ll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy  Before moving on to your questions  let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of Wednesday  June 3  on your calendars  That will be the day we ll host our annual financial community presentation at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York  The program will include presentations by several members of our leadership team  We ll host our customary Q A session  followed by a reception and lunch  Again  that date is Wednesday  June 3  We ll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in April  With that  I d like to thank you for joining us this morning  and we ll be happy to take your questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Our first question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse  Please proceed with your question Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    Analyst Thank you  Can you just talk a little bit more about your expectations for U S  housing and the consequence of architectural volumes outlook  just given some more constructive data  Just in terms of what you re hearing from the Americas group heads and their customers  do you expect broader volume participation this year  Or just what are the key puts and takes Jim Jaye    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations Sure  Chris  Good morning  It s Jim  What we always talk about when we have this question is we look at our sentiment from our 4 500 store managers and our 3 000 sales reps  and they continue to be very optimistic about what they re seeing as we end the year and as we head into 2020  As we ve talked about this in the past  from a big picture perspective  certainly  we believe that the continuing household formations in that 1 3 million range annually will support what s going on as we go forward  But as you point out  Chris  the more recent data is encouraging  We re seeing strengthening in single and multifamily permits  starts and completions at the year end  And really  the three month trailing average for all of those was up double digits  We were at the builder show that just happened  And I would tell you  optimism at that builder show among our customers was very positive  and you have other things out there that are supportive as well  The mortgage rate remains very reasonable  and some of the recent reports by some of the national homebuilders are also talking about strong orders  So I think we feel very good about where housing is headed from a macro perspective Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Hey  Chris  This is Al  I d just like to add on to that comment by saying  as you look at how our North America paint stores group unfolded throughout the year  our second half was stronger than our first half  And even as you look at what TAG performed  we re at 4 8   You look at our same store sales  up 4 6   To put that in perspective  architectural gallons were high single digits in the quarter because as you    as a reminder  we did not go out with price in our fourth quarter  And historically  as we ve seen momentum in our second half and in our fourth quarter  that translates to growth in our first half  So that s what makes us feel pretty good about the paint stores in architectural in North America Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    Analyst Great  And just a quick follow up  You previously discussed potentially getting your margins in consumer performance back up to    toward  let s say  20  was targeted  But can you just simply update us on your conviction and your ability to do this and just also highlight to the investment community any key non raw material levers you can continue to pull to potentially make this happen in each segment Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Chris  We re not coming off our numbers  I am confident in our ability to hit those financial targets we laid out for 2020  As I talked about on the June investor day  I confirm that we ll hit those targets but on a lag  And I think  throughout 2019  we made significant progress and are on the right path to attaining those goals  and we ve even attained some of those goals already  If you look at our core gross margin at 45 1  for the year  it s at the low end of the targeted range that I had laid out at 45  to 48   and you look at our strong net operating cash  And if I looked at net operating cash at 13  less capex  you get a little over 11  net operating cash  less capex  which is the target that we have laid out  So I am very confident in our ability on performance coatings and consumer brands to expand their margins to that mid  to high teens  low 20s  and they made good progress this year Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Please proceed with your question Stephen Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Hey  Al  You just mentioned that the same store sales metric in the fourth quarter was mostly volume in TAG  just because you lapped the year ago price  And  Jim  you mentioned the strongest region was the southeast  where  in October  they were really underwater in that region  So can you just comment on where you think backlog is in architectural paint contractors  And where do you think this could drive same store sales in 2020 John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  Steve  I think we re feeling really good about the market and the feedback that we re getting from our customers  As you ve just mentioned  there is a backlog  Part of it  I think  has to do with labor  We continue to believe that backlog  if you will  in labor supports our model and helps build loyalty to what it is that we re trying to do for our customers  which is driving the technology and services that help them to be more successful  And we ve got a lot of new products that we re launching going into this year  a lot of services that we re introducing  all directly pointed at trying to help those customers to attack those  So to your question  we think  geographically  it s pretty solid  There s no pockets that I ve been in yet nor that we ve heard from our teams where people are feeling softness  There s a general consensus that contractors are feeling very good  could do more if they had more labor  and we want to be there to help support them accomplish their goals Stephen Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst And  John  did you anticipate that changing some of the acquired brands to the Sherwin brand would impact the outlook for sales for those products John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I d like Al to talk to it from a financial perspective  but absolutely  In fact  I would say we re feeling really good about the fact that we ve gotten here as fast as we have  As we entered into the integration  we re always listening to our customers and always listening to our employees  And the fact that our customers  the retention of both our customers and our employees is so high in allowing us to move aggressively in this brand consolidation gives us really a great sense of pride of the speed and execution that we re moving in Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  And  Steve  I would just add  this is not indicative of the underlying businesses  If you look at healthy businesses  operating margins are expanding  and we saw that in consumer brands and in our performance coatings groups this year  And as John talked about in his opening remarks  I mean  we generated strong cash flow over the period  end of  17 through  19  and we ll continue to do that  We saw strong cash flow in 2019  So as a reminder  we looked at this Valspar acquisition over the long term  It s hard when you re going into an acquisition to predict timing of when certain events happen  But  as John said  improving our operating efficiencies by consolidating brands  that s only going to help us going forward  Thanks  Steve OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan  Please proceed with your question Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thanks very much  Can you talk about business conditions in China and in Europe  And maybe your offshore operations generally in 2019  how much did they grow in revenue terms  Or how much did they shrink and whether business conditions in China in the first quarter of 2020 are very different than what they were in the fourth quarter of 2019 John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Right  Well  I think  specifically to China  I d say that the environment that we find ourselves in some of our business has been a challenge  If you look at our industrial wood  for example  with the tariffs and generally a weaker economy  it s had an impact on our business  We ve had pockets of strengths in Southeast Asia  particularly in the cabinets area wood  So I d say from a wood perspective  it s been the most challenging  That said  if you look at our packaging business  as an example  we had a terrific run there in Asia  actually across the globe in packaging  Our coil business in Asia was positive  We had some pressure in our general industrial business there  Our automotive business is pretty small  Jeff  in Asia  but it was positive  So I d say a mixed bag there  Clearly  some pressure  but our market share there is such that it gives us terrific opportunity for growth  and that s where we re headed Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  And then just a small question  You talked about most of the growth in the stores business in the fourth quarter coming from volume  But in previous quarters  it seemed that price was a larger element  Did you simply annualize your price increases  Or was there some competitive activity that led to a lower price benefit  Or was there a mix effect  Why was price a smaller component in the fourth quarter John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  There was virtually no price in the quarter  and it was because last year  2018  the price increase went in the first of October  Jeff  In this year  we rolled it in January 1  so the fourth quarter was exposed from a pricings perspective  And I d just point out  as Al mentioned  so when we look at the architectural gallons in that fourth quarter  up the high single digits  it was a really good quarter for our team in our TAG business Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird  Please proceed with your question Ghansham Panjabi    Baird    Analyst Hey  guys  Good morning  Can you help us with the margins on the Americas group segment  Did that play out the way you thought it would during the fourth quarter  During the third quarter  you had a nice year over year acceleration in margins  I think it was up 120 basis points  4Q was closer to 70 basis points  and that was also in a very healthy increase in sales  What were the offsets there Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So  Ghansham  the way I look at    I start with the flow through  When you look at flow through in TAG in the fourth quarter  and it was over 33   so we saw nice leverage on our gallon increased  As John talked about in his opening remarks about investments and additional opportunities  and we have taken a long term strategic view of the market  And aside from just new stores and new reps that we talked about  John talked about expanding our digital platform that I think    and we believe will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace  And we re expanding and investing in that tool to get better aligned with our customer to offer better services to make them more efficient  Ultimately  as we ve talked about  we want to drive higher top line growth for them and profitability  So we started that really coming in third quarter and fourth quarter  and you ll see us continue investing at the next year John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Ghansham  I think when we were together  actually  we talked a little bit about some of the investments we were making on that digital  And we re really proud to be announcing that we ll be rolling this out nationally at the end of the first quarter  We think this is the start of a    we have a number of products in the pipeline here  but the start of a process that we ve been really investing in  And to Al s point  we re cranking that up  And the idea here is increasing that loyalty and the contractors leaning on us to be more efficient in what it is that they re trying to do  We talked early about labor  and the launch of this digital platform will help them run a more efficient business  It s not just external  though  We re also investing internally  We didn t talk about this last year  We ve made it through one year now with our sales reps now having had iPads for one year  We think that s improving the productivity of our sales organization to be more responsive to our customers  This year  we ve just announced to our team we re rolling out iPads into our stores to make them more productive and more efficient and more responsive to the needs of our customers  So we are investing  We re investing in this business  We have great confidence of our position right now  And quite frankly  we see some competitive opportunities that we want to take advantage of  so we re putting our foot on the gas here Ghansham Panjabi    Baird    Analyst OK  And then just for my second question on the performance coatings segment  Even with the industrial markets having been weaker for everybody  including you  the margins were still up year over year  Was there any residual price catch up or any significant mix benefit from businesses like packaging that drove the margin expansion apart from just synergy flow through Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Ghansham  That s a very astute point  As packaging and coil sales have expanded faster than the rest of the businesses  we do see some lift in the margin on that  Yes  as we ve talked about in the past  our industrial business took the brunt of the run up in raw materials in  17 and  18  We ve been chasing that for the last few years  It doesn t come in uniformly like our paint stores group  So yes  we saw some pricing flow through in our fourth quarter  And then the other thing I would say is  as we are investing in growth opportunities  we are also laser focused on controlling and managing our costs where our businesses and or regions aren t performing to where you expect them to perform or seeing a path to a set target  So we re controlling our costs and consolidating operations as well  So you can expect that to continue as we go forward as we continue to invest in other areas Ghansham Panjabi    Baird    Analyst Got it  Thanks so much Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Ghansham OperatorThank you  Our next question is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Yes  Thanks for taking my question  With regard to    in the release  you had laid out some acquisition related costs still in 2020  kind of to the tune of what looks to be  300 million to  350 million or so  I guess  what is that still being spent on  And I guess  how much of it is    how much should we be thinking about as actually a cash hit  And then  I guess  tied to that  how are you thinking about cash conversion as we look to 2020  Because it obviously took a big step up in  19 but curious how or where we go from here Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  John  I m glad you brought that up because it s important that for an apples to apples comparison  we wanted to call out acquisition related costs  And the amortization depreciation year over year is very similar  Embedded in that number is about  30 million in additional integration costs  And we wanted to include that in our guidance in the Reg G table  but we re not going to be laying that out going forward  That breaks out  just so for modeling purposes  a little more back half versus front half loaded  But this gets us in the next phase  Like John talked about  synergies is part of our continuous improvement process  We re going to get back to integration activities  It s just part of our normal operating process  As far as cash flow  John  you ve followed us for a very long time  13   that s always the new high watermark  And as I talked about in our investor day and earlier  net operating cash  less capex  we re targeting 11   and we expect to continue to hit that target as we go forward John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Got it  And then just a quick follow up  With regard to the pipeline that you re seeing from your customers  it sounds like the residential side is pretty solid  Can you speak to the non resi side and what you re seeing there John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  it s very good  If you look at the commercial side  property management  I d say  John  trying not to get ahead of myself here  but we re feeling really good  I just came back from our national sales meeting  We had 8 500 of our closest friends  together  talking about just that and very bullish environment  very positive  And if you go from the commercial to property management into healthcare  I mean  there s a general feeling that our customers are really excited about what s ahead for 2020  So we re really looking forward to this year John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Great  Thanks very much for the call OperatorThank you  Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Good morning  Just curious on the paint store side  was there any change in the quarter  I know that you put up an 8  comp in Q3  and that would imply like a 6  volume  and you did a 5 3  here  So it doesn t appear that way  I m just curious if you noticed an improvement in Q4 or a deceleration  And do you expect kind of similar kind of mid single digit volume growth in 2020 John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Arun  I d say the largest impact that we had was our protective and marine business that runs through our TAG business  The architectural business  as we mentioned  was up high single digits  We talked about the fact that we ve had another double digit increase in residential repaint and just talked about some of the other segments and the confidence that we have there  If you look at those indicators that we often cite  spray equipment  non paint items  everything points in the right direction  So high single digit architectural gallons going through impacted by the P M business  And the P M business  through our stores  was largely impacted by oil and gas which was under pressure  And we had some timing of some big projects likely not going to be starting out until the beginning of the second quarter  So we saw a little bit of softness in P M in the fourth quarter  probably going to see a little bit in the first quarter  But again  the pipeline that we re looking at here is really solid Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  And  Arun  I would just add to that  The price increase that we went out with in our North America stores on January 1 was 3  to 4   We expect an effective rate of just below 2   And as John laid out in the opening remarks  we expect paints    our TAG organization to be at the high end of our 2  to 4   so you think 4  to 6   If there s less than 2  in price  the rest is volume Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Great  That s very helpful  And then just as a quick follow up on PCG  obviously  there s macro pressures and regional variability  as you said  Do you think that is kind of tilted to the downside  just given the coronavirus  Or maybe you can just offer your thoughts on where we are potentially destocking wise or    especially in Europe and Asia  is there any potential for stability there as we move through 2020 John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I think we look at the comparisons of 2019 to 2020  and we have higher expectations moving forward  It might be helpful  Or maybe I could just talk about each of the segments just briefly  If we look at our auto  and maybe I ll just do it for a number of the regions  rather than just the two  because I m sure there s some more questions there  On auto  we d say North America  we feel really good  probably the best I felt in the time I ve been CEO or COO  Collision shop business here is very strong  I think we re in a really strong position  and we re going to take advantage of that going forward  Europe  I d say we had a little bit of softness in our auto business in Europe  Asia  as I mentioned earlier  it s a small business  up mid single digits  In Latin America  we have a leadership position  It was impacted primarily by currency  We had a good quarter in auto in Latin America  Packaging  clearly  the non BPA is giving us a terrific opportunity  We believe that s an ongoing transition with plenty of opportunity for us ahead  and so we re investing in this business  We re investing in technology and in capacity and really trying to stay aligned with our customers  We ve got great partners that we re trying to support  And if you look at this  this was a double digit quarter for them  North America was strong double digits  To your question about Europe and Asia  Europe was up  but Asia was up really  really strong double digits  And there  our business in packaging is growing  both in beverage and in food  In coil  new business wins really across the region  North America throughout everyone  We did have a little bit of softness in comparison in Europe  But this is a team that s really hitting on all cylinders  and we re working hard  So those are the ones that are really performing quite well  GI  Asia  we felt some impact there in our general industrial  largely in the heavy equipment and ag equipment  But we have a good pipeline of projects and good    really good people there  We expect to really see some improvement in our performance in this business  Industrial wood  I talked about earlier  China  a lot of pressure  Feeling good about Southeast Asia  Europe was another area of pressure as well  So among all the businesses  I would say the one we re feeling the most pressure in would be the industrial wood  And then protective and marine  I talked about largely running through our North American business through our TAG  But if I look at our smaller businesses  albeit Asia is a very small business  it was up strong double digits for us  Europe  down slightly  as we had some pressure and some comparisons to some business there  Latin America was up slightly as well  So that kind of captures all the regions  all the businesses  Arun  Hopefully satisfied some other questions with that response Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Great  great  Thanks John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Arun OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners  Please proceed with your question Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    Analyst Yes  Good morning  I was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on capital deployment  You ve made some nice progress again on the balance sheet  John  just wondering if you would foresee any material change in the balance of acquisition activity versus repurchases as you look ahead into 2020 John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think the M A activity is something that we re really focused on  We think it s an important part of our future  although we don t feel as though we have a gun to our head  We ve got    the challenge for us right now  quite frankly  internally  is prioritization of the opportunities  so we re very active  And I would say  to answer your question  you should see us deploying more cash into M A  I don t think you re going to see the transformational type of acquisition that Valspar was  but we re working business by business to understand region by region where it is there are opportunities  I want to clearly point out that we are not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere  We are absolutely determined to invest where we can return    generate a return of share for our shareholders  And each of our businesses have developed a really good strategy that they re executing  and any of those M A opportunities include the right to win in those markets  So we re not going to be there  We re not deploying cash in commodity areas  and we re not deploying cash for the sake of saying that we can be somewhere  We re there to make money Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    Analyst Understood  That s helpful  My second question relates to raw materials  It sounds like you anticipate some relief to start the year  Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to the individual categories like pigment and petrochemicals  etc  And then with regard to resins  in particular  just wondering if you could comment on your degree of internal integration versus external purchases of resins and how that s evolved in recent years  if it has Jim Jaye    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations Sure  Sure  Kevin  Glad to answer that  As John said in his comments  and you re right  our outlook for this year is that the overall basket will be flat compared to 2019  and that s assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks  no supply disruptions  It will be lower year over year in the first quarter  It will be a lesser extent in the second quarter and then sort of flatten out  maybe increase in the back half  If you remember  we had our highest rate of inflation in 2019  It was in the first quarter which moderated through the year  So our full year outlook  that s our best estimate at this time  The visibility  once you get a couple of quarters out  is a little bit murkier  When you get to the specific categories  Kevin  we expect the petrochemical basket to be in line with our overall raw material outlook  probably a tailwind in the first quarter  maybe into the second quarter before flattening and again increasing in the back half  We re seeing right now key feedstocks  propylene  ethylene are down year over year as we enter 2020  And other key materials  like epoxy  for example  more on our industrial side  are also down year over year  From a TiO2 perspective  right now  what we re seeing is relatively stable moving into 2020 based on the current demand environment that we re in  So that s kind of a big picture look at it from a resin internalization standpoint  I ll let Al take that one Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Kevin  I don t think our strategy has changed  We ve picked up a nice business with EPS as part of the Valspar acquisition  We ve got to even invest in more assets to internalize resins  but it s a balance  We look at where we can make the most from a    not just    not a cost necessarily but from a differentiation standpoint  And we have  as we ve talked about  a number of projects in the pipeline across each of the segments to continue to drive what I d call continuous improvement opportunities  You saw some of that benefit in our consumer brands group this year and helping their margin expansion  and you should expect that going forward John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Kevin  if I could  I d just like to add just one other component that was just slightly touched on by Al on the proprietary development of technology  We re looking at this opportunity to serve our customers  particularly the painting contractor who s looking to maximize productivity  And we re combining the asset that you re asking about in a way  I think  that s really unique for Sherwin  We re trying to position ourselves to provide solutions and technology to help those customers to be more productive  I mentioned earlier the number of products that we are introducing  And here  I d just like to take the opportunity to talk about three of those because I think it highlights what Al just talked about from a resin capability standpoint  and I ll be very brief on this  But this gives us the opportunity to develop products that really help our customers in a unique way  We re introducing a product this year called Flex Temp that provides a contractor the ability to get out earlier  colder temperatures and stay out longer in hotter temperatures  It actually has a spreadability to be applied from 35 degrees Fahrenheit up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit with no change in viscosity  terrific uniform application  And so it extends the ability of these painting contractors to be out  So when we talk about labor and the challenges of getting caught up  we re looking at ways to make them more productive  We re introducing a new product called Emerald Rain Refresh that  again  same platform of technology  proprietary  We ll hold on to this  No one else will have it  But this is a product that not only optimizes applications so that you have more productivity from painters with less experience  This is a product that when it rains or it is hosed down  it looks like it was just painted  So after every rain  the home or commercial building looks as if it was just painted  brand new clean  So these painters that have applied this in the commercialization process have just been really raving about it  And the last one  just to be brief again  we re introducing a new extension on our Emerald line  which is our top of the line product  This will be the finest paint that we ve produced yet  outstanding hiding  great applications  So again  painters with limited experience  we re making limited experienced painters  better painters  best application  better touch up  all with this idea that if we re developing resins and products for them  the loyalty to Sherwin increases Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    Analyst Thank you so much John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Kevin OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Anthony Walker    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Hi  guys  This is Anthony Walker on for Bob  Maybe just two quick ones  Can you talk about the performance of the international businesses within the consumer segment which you acquired through the Valspar transaction  In the past  you ve talked about potential strategic or rationalization opportunities there  assuming the businesses continued to underperform  How should we think about the timing and the opportunity there John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I think    let me just walk through the three areas there just briefly  First  Asia  I d say the business is certainly going through a transition  We ve talked about the fact that this Huarun brand was predominantly focused on interior wood  So we re shifting that strategy  as much of that business internally  and region is now shifting to a shop or factory applied application  And so the teams are developing a strategy and executing pieces of it to pursue and reposition the brand there  Again  a small piece of the business  but we think this is an important one  Future opportunity here is terrific  We re gaining    we re making some progress in the quarter  We started to see a positive trend in Asia  So I d say that one is trending the right way  Europe  we made significant progress this past year  Sales were positive in mid single digits  Operating profit improved to a low double digit percentage  So feeling that we are pointing in the right direction there  Australia is a bird of another color  We ve got some challenges there  and quite frankly  we re not performing as needed  We have plans and teams executing on this  This is one that you should expect us to get closer to and see some improvement or making some tough changes Anthony Walker    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Great  And then just one on the price increase that you announced for the paint stores group  How should we think about that flowing through the results in the year  Will we start to see that show up in the first quarter in full  And then how should we also think about the magnitude of what I assume are labor  freight and distribution expenses as sort of tempting to offset Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  The pricing will roll out on a similar cadence to past price increases  You ll see some of that  for sure  in the first quarter  And then as it takes hold over the next six months  we ll get full effectiveness as it flows through all of our customers  When you look at our cost basket that we ve talked about  merit increases are higher than what they ve been in the past  Health care benefits continue to rise and as we ve absorbed those over the past number of years  But this price increase is not unprecedented to cover costs  other than raw materials  And if you go back in the first quarter of 2014  we went out a price increase to cover those costs  Because as you can imagine  it s compounding  If you don t get it in the first year and it compounds over three or four years  it gets to be pretty steep  So that s kind of why this justification with this price increase John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  We re not getting thank you notes from our customers  obviously  but many of them are facing similar situations  So the fact that we waited until January 1 gave our customers an opportunity to kind of recalibrate as they re bidding going forward in the new year  And secondly  the fact that they re experiencing the same thing  I think  has helped in the execution as well OperatorThank you  We ll move on to our next question  which comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities  Please proceed with your question Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    Analyst Good afternoon John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey  Mike Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    Analyst Wondering if you could give us an update on the progress at Lowe s  And maybe just more broadly speaking  your expectations for DIY in the first half of  19  It seems like with refinancing activity having picked up and the easy weather comps and the store resets and the training that s been going on at Lowe s that maybe that business could be stronger  yet you guys provided guidance that suggests that consumer is more flattish for the full year John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So a piece of that  just a reminder  as we have the ACE business that s coming out  So that s a piece of the go forward forecast  Mike  But I would describe our opportunity at Lowe s quite simply as we think we re moving the ball in the right direction  But we re never satisfied  and we re investing  I mentioned earlier in my remarks about that we re stepping up our investments in the home center channel  Obviously  they would be a big part of that  We see that there are opportunities in both the consumer side and the professional side  those pros that paint  We think it s a terrific opportunity for us to help our customer  On the consumer side  we have a lot of opportunities to help convert shoppers into customers  And we made a big commitment to this relationship  and we want to see this thing through  And the opportunity here is to help execute  and that s on all fronts  So I don t think you should ever expect us to say that we re done  This is a business that we re looking at just aggressively as we do our own stores business  We think there s opportunities  and we re committed to helping our customer win Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Mike  I would just add to that that we have talked about this in the past that embedded in our consumer brands segment is our retail channel that has been under pressure consistently  And as Lowe s has performed better  they certainly are taking share from that segment  and then we re trying to be realistic  When we look outside the U S   we re trying not to build    although optimistic  trying not to build a hockey stick to our sales guidance  And    but rest assured  we expect more out of those teams outside the U S Mike Harrison    Seaport Global Securities    Analyst All right  And then I wanted to also ask about the ColorSnap consultation brand and how that s contributing to paint store sales growth  How much of North America do you have covered with the ColorSnap offering at this point  I m just trying to get a sense of kind of what stage we re in with that rollout and how much more it could contribute John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes   We re pretty early in it  There was an opportunity  And again  this goes back to helping our customers  Mike  you really hit on something here  because this has worked out quite well for us  not so much just for the consumer  But our residential repaint contractors are leaning on us to help accelerate the selling process for them  And as we employ this  as well as the digital ColorSnap  which is an AI application that s new and continuing    we continue to enhance the previous platform  it allows our customers to accelerate through their process of closing business  This is the professional painting contractor to a homeowner  so I would suspect that you re going to see that as a component  one of many items that we are going to continue to leverage and add service and productivity that helps build loyalty to the painting contractor  But it s still got a lot of opportunity across the country  a lot  Thank you  Mike OperatorThank you  We ll move on to our next question  which comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed with your question David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Thank you  Good morning  John  Can you discuss your plans for store openings and any closings in 2020  And any impact on the cadence of store openings from either your digital strategy or how you re trying to service some of your larger customers going forward John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  we expect to continue in that range of 80 to 100 stores  I don t know that it s changed in any way from a store cadence  We d like to see a smoother rollout of the stores rolling in  I ve been trying to fix that since I ran that business 15 years ago  but I d say that we feel really good about it  I also want to thank our teams because I think we re getting    continuing to get better at it  The stores that we re opening and we re cranking up faster  and the impact is better  Some of that has to do with the quality of people in the stores as well as the systems that we re adding to those  So I d say you should expect us to continue to add in those stores at a similar rate to what we ve had Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  David  I d just add  When you look at TAG  and we closed 32 stores in the year  26 of those stores were in Latin America  We have talked about the pressure we ve been under Latin America  As you know  we take a rigorous and consistent view of our portfolio of businesses  brands  customer programs and other investments  And as we ve not been able to see a line of sight to above average growth  either in sales  operating margins  cash  we ve had to take action  We re not exiting those markets but pushing those sales through what I would call more of a dealer network  which is a little less asset intensive  And I think you ll see some of that continue here in our first half David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Very good  And  John  just lastly  what s your sense on the pool of available painters in both the quantity as well as the quality in 2020 John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Let s say it s under pressure  Our customers  as I mentioned earlier  would like to move faster  and there are a number of wonderful painters and many people entering in the industry that are learning as they go  and as I mentioned  as I ran through those products briefly  We re taking that into consideration as we re building products and helping our customers to improve their efficiency  So I d say they re both under pressure  People that typically enter into the trades  we re working with those professionals to help train those employees  but there s a pressure in finding them David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Thank you John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from P J  Juvekar with Citi  Please proceed with your question P J  Juvekar    Citi    Analyst Yes  Hi  Good morning  Plastic  single use plastics  are coming under pressure  so it s bags and bottles  I was wondering if as bottles come under pressure  would some of the food and beverage stuff move to cans  And would that become an opportunity for you on interior or exterior coatings of the cans John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  The answer is yes  We would welcome that transition  and we want to work to support our customers to do that  As I mentioned earlier  the progress that we re making in our packaging business in both food and beverage has been fantastic  and more of that transitioning into our packaging and customers  business is terrific  And that s why we talk a lot about this in our stores business  But even on the packaging side  we re really determined to help our customers through technology to help speed up lines  to help minimize    not damaged  but trying to buy imperfections in the coatings  But the idea here is  as we help them become more efficient in driving efficiencies into their plant  the better supplier we are  So we re really focused on making them better P J  Juvekar    Citi    Analyst OK  And then my second question is now that your leverage is below your target of three times  what is your willingness to look at M A  what size  And would 2020 be the year that you come back into the market for M A Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer P J   we consistently are looking for acquisitions of any size  I mean  I think you re right  As you look at our debt to EBITDA ratio under three in 2020  I don t expect to pay down debt  And as our EBITDA grows  you ll see us drive that target down toward the two to 2 5 long term target that I have  But yes  we are actively looking for acquisitions  But as John mentioned earlier  we re taking a disciplined approach to that  And I d say  we raised the dividend 18   We ll keep capex below 2   But absent those M A  absent any acquisitions  we re going to buy back our stock this year John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  But I think to your point  though  our COO  David Sewell  got his teams really leaning forward in this area  looking for those opportunities  not only just simply from the opportunity  but from the strategic value that can be gained from it P J  Juvekar    Citi    Analyst Thank you John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  P J OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley  Please proceed with your question Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    Analyst All I ve got left on my list is  Al  can you just    the tax rate stepping up this year  is that just sort of your starting point  And then you see how the year plays out and what things your team comes up with  Or do you    how should we be thinking about the higher tax rate Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Vincent  I m always looking at the tax rate  It s a function of how many options and how our legal entity consolidations flow through to help that tax rate  So I started at the low 20  range  and then I expect our tax guys to develop plans and continue with the programs that are going to continue to drive that down Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thanks very much Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays  Please proceed with your question Duffy Fischer    Barclays    Analyst Yes  Good morning  Just one for me  Volumetrically  how fast did the North American architectural market grow last year do you guys think Jim Jaye    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations We haven t seen official data yet on that  Duffy  If I go back to probably the most recent data we have is 2018  Gallon growth was a little over 2   I want to say it s probably similar in 2019 and probably at a similar level in 2020  sort of that low single digit level  if I would guess Duffy Fischer    Barclays    Analyst Thanks  guys Jim Jaye    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations You bet OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman   Associates  Please proceed with your question Justin Speer    Zelman and Associates    Analyst Thank you  guys  I just wanted to unpack that if you could help maybe further unpack the nature of those SG A investments and how you think they ll unfold from a percentage of revenue standpoint Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Justin  we re not going to go down the P L by line on the guidance  I think what we ve consistently done is grow our store count  grow our rep count  and then these additional investments are going to come through pretty evenly throughout the year  And we re not going to quantify them because it s like any other review that we do  We want to see how the first half unfolds  how volumes look  And it may give us an opportunity to accelerate in the back half of the year like we did this year  so I think it depends  But they re in our guidance  and we ll continue to manage those accordingly John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I would say  Justin  we are planning on sharing a number of these with you during our financial community presentation on that June 3 date  where we ll give you some idea from    in some of these areas  the digital  I think you ll be really impressed with  And to the extent that we re comfortable in sharing  obviously  we don t want to point specifically for competitive reasons to what we re doing  But as much as we can  as things roll out  we ll share what we ve done but not what we re going to do Justin Speer    Zelman and Associates    Analyst OK  And I guess  maybe because I m sure you pilot  I know you piloted a number of these different programs  But just curious how the    there s like a response rate in terms of growth improvement to the model  Or is it just a stickiness in this widening of the moat  bringing the customer closer  the relationship is good  But does it change the growth algorithm or the amount of gallons that flow through  all else equal John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  We re doing this for growth  We absolutely believe it improves the stickiness  the moat    any metaphor we want to use  But we are growing our business  and we re going to do it profitably  And we think that the more solutions that we bring to our customers to help make them more profitable  the more likely we re going to continue to be their supplier  And so we re really focused on not just one lever  one silver bullet  but a number of these that will enhance their ability to be successful  And as a result  we become a better supplier to them Justin Speer    Zelman and Associates    Analyst And my last question is just on the consumer business  Just how much mix benefit from that transition in ACE will you    are you thinking or estimating for your 2020 targets there Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  What we talked about is the ACE business  that private label business was about  100 million a year  considerably below the average of our consumer operating margin  We didn t lay that out  and we re not going to  But you should expect margin improvement because of that Justin Speer    Zelman and Associates    Analyst Thank you  gentlemen Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Justin  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital  Please proceed with your question  We ll move on to our next question which comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo  Please proceed with your question Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    Analyst Hi  Good afternoon  guys  Thanks for taking my questions  First  just wanted to make sure I m understanding this clearly on your TAG in paint stores demand outlook for 2020  the full year guide  I think it implies that volumes grow pretty much in line with 2019  maybe at a bit of a slower pace even  When I m listening to you all  you re very optimistic on the architectural volume side  Seems like that market is even accelerating  which would imply that protective and marine in that non res market might even be decelerating versus 2019  Just trying to understand how you all are thinking about that and if you can walk me through the parts John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Truman  I d say you re right in sensing our confidence in the architectural side  Having just finished the quarter in the mid single    or I m sorry  high single digits gives us confidence moving forward  On the protective and marine side that runs through there  we ve got the fourth quarter and likely the first quarter right now that we re seeing is likely a little softer than we would have liked to see but feeling pretty good about it going forward  So I think we re trying to be just in line with what our customers are telling us  and we feel pretty good about the number that we put out here Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Truman  the other comment I would make is  as I mentioned earlier  if you look at the way the year unfolded for paint stores in North America  we had a strong second half versus the first half  even a 9   8   7  TAG increase in the third quarter  which is a large quarter and a very good result in a large quarter like that  So I think when we get through our second quarter and see how the year is unfolding  we can give you an update then Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    Analyst OK  OK  And then final question for me just on the raw materials basket  Can you just discuss what kind of tailwinds you actually saw in the fourth quarter from an overall basket perspective  And then just remind us what you ended up seeing in 2019 as a whole Jim Jaye    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations Yes  Truman  Costs for the broad basket that we buy  I would say  moderated slightly in the fourth quarter  19 from third quarter of  19  So it kind of played out as we thought  Fourth quarter 2019 was also lower year over year  The year over year decrease in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by lower cost for resins  solvents  And we don t provide specific dollars on the savings of the raw materials  But you can see the positive trend  I think  reflected in our year over year gross margin improvement Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    Analyst OK  Thank you Jim Jaye    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations Sure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G Research  Please proceed with your question Rosemarie Morbelli    G research    Analyst Thank you  Good afternoon  everyone  John  I was wondering if you could give us a little more on the impairment charges  I am assuming that the bulk of it is the woods coatings in China  but you also mentioned one impairment taken in the consumer brands category  Is that ACE  Or a little color on which product lines you are  more or less  eliminating as there is no growth and those for which you are going to change the brand name John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Rosemarie  I would not classify it as no growth  I would characterize it in GI and in automotive  As we ve put in  implemented our systems  our legacy systems  we ve gotten customers to move to a new label  and that has helped us optimize or streamline our operations  That s the biggest impact  Another example would be in Australia  We re under pressure that we talked about earlier about driving operating margin and cash flow improvement  and one way to do that is reduce the number of brands you re trying to support  And so in that area  we also move from    remove focus  if you will  on one brand and driving it more through the Wattyl brand  And again  that s going to help us in the midterm here to reduce our costs and keep investing in labels and merchandising and different things like that  So the Huarun brand in China has been under pressure  John talked about that transition certainly from    to factory applied coatings  That is an impact  And as that transition continues to move and expand  we re not expecting or anticipating any other impairments going forward Rosemarie Morbelli    G research    Analyst OK  And then the goal was very optimistic  Your projections of 2  to 4  on the revenue line is stronger or higher than it was  2019 versus 2018  And yet  if I look at your EPS projections at the midpoint  it is up 9  versus up 14  in  19 over 14  if I have those numbers right  So I am wondering  what are the offsets Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Rosemarie  I d say that we re    if you re comparing last year to the go forward  as I talked about the price increase that we went out with and being effective under 2   that s below what we really realized through the first three quarters of last year  Our raw material moderation isn t as strong as what we saw in 2019  And these investments that we talked about  even though we re seeing slower in our second half of  19 on performance coatings  we continue to invest back in this    in our businesses that we think are going to provide growth opportunities in the future  not only the new stores and the new reps that we even accelerated in the back half but this digital program that John laid out  And then some other    our home center channel that    so yes  we re continuing those investments in 2020 John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It may not have an immediate feedback or a payback  but we re running this company longer term than just one quarter  And we absolutely believe these are the right investments to make  And so we re moving forward aggressively  taking advantage  as I said  of not only the market  but we really think there s some competitive opportunities out here that we want to take advantage of Rosemarie Morbelli    G research    Analyst OK  So nothing really special just going forward and investing where you need to John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Investing where we need to  skinnying back where we can  But leaning forward  we think that we ve described it internally  Rosemarie  as a coil  We feel we re cranking this coil down  and we expect it to respond given the investments that we have in a very positive way Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer And  Rosemarie  we don t expect the market to be this way  But if you go back to 2007   08 and  09 when we added 260 new stores  when we came out of that  you look at our market share growth  not only on the three year  but the five year and the 10 year compounded average growth rates  we think we re well above market growth  and that s the attitude we re taking  We look at it long term and expect  as John mentioned  that coil to grow market share faster than what we ve done in the past Rosemarie Morbelli    G research    Analyst All right  Looking forward to that clearly deploying  Thank you Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence  Please proceed with your question Christopher Perrella    Bloomberg Intelligence    Analyst Hi  guys  Quick ones on Lat Am volume  Has that flattened out for you at this point and you re looking for inflection in 2020  And then just a little color on consumer pricing  Do you expect to get about half of what you get in the TAG group for 2020 Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Chris  I would say  for Latin America  our volumes have  I would say  improved as the year has gone on  But where you re seeing it is as we continue to see the devaluation  we re continually    that team is continually having to go out with price  60  of our raw materials are dollar denominated  so every deflation we see in Brazil  as an example  we re constantly chasing with price  So the biggest portion of our impact right now is price  but some of the things that we re doing on streamlining sales organizations and focus on the right segments and customer segment will help drive growth in the future John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes  We re just not waiting for the market  We re not waiting for currency  We re trying to do    we mentioned earlier  control the things we can control  And our Mexico sales were up high single digits  clearly offset by Argentina and Brazil and some of the other regions  As Al mentioned  we re trying to be very aggressive in Brazil  The store reduction is an example of that  But we re looking to drive more profitable sales to the most efficient channels down there Al Mistysyn    Chief Financial Officer Yes  And  Chris  the second question on price  Yes  In performance coatings  we do still have opportunities for price in certain businesses and regions  And as you remember   17 and  18  we saw the big run up in raw materials  Our industrial businesses were impacted the most  Although raws have moderated and our expectation is in 2020  they re not back to where they were at the beginning of 2017  So we re continuing to need price  We ve expanded our margins  but we expect and I feel confident that we ll get to the high teens and low 20s  And recovering those raw material costs  plus the incremental freight cost  plus the merit increases and healthcare that I talked about on TAG  those are affecting our performance coatings group  and we re having to offset those  So yes  we re going to continue with price John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Chris OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research  Please proceed with your question Chris Bottiglieri    Wolfe Research    Analyst Hey  guys  Thanks for taking the question  First of all  I want to kind of follow up on your comment earlier on the auto business  looking the best that it s been in your tenure  a little surprising to hear  I mean  are you starting to see like accident frequency inflect or total loss rates come down  Or is it more so just competitive dynamics where you feel like you re taking share from the channel John Morikis    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Competitive dynamics  we re taking share  I think the market    there s been some compression  we think  and we ve talked about that openly with safer cars and safer attributes that are going into these vehicles  which are absolutely critical  So we re doing it by the technology that we re bringing and the services that we re bringing  The combination of Valspar and Sherwin together  we have a new improved system that we think has been very well received by the marketplace  And we re really working hard to serve those customers in a way to help their throughput through those facilities Chris Bottiglieri    Wolfe Research    Analyst Got you  That s helpful  And then one other question on coronavirus  I just want to think there are like potential impacts  maybe like more of an indirect impact  Recognize you don t have high exposure to like Chinese TiO2  But are there any impacts to that market that could manifest in the global supply chain if the work stop continues  Or any other like feedstock or inputs that  again  if we continue to see more business shutdowns and extended holiday that could maybe have an impact on your business  Curious how you think about that Jim Jaye    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations Yes  Chris  Let me start just by saying  first  when we look at this  the health and safety of our employees is No  1  obviously  And so we re monitoring that very carefully and the recommendations that are out there  We ve suspended travel to and from China in the short term  and we re limiting some travel inside the country to business critical  So we re doing that  But I think we re working closely with our teams there  our customers  our suppliers  Haven t seen  to this point  any negative impact  and we ll continue to monitor that closely  I think it s just too early to see John Morikis    Chairman

opening bell The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2 9  in the last reported quarter  It has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters  while missing in the other two  The company has a trailing four quarter positive earnings surprise of 1 3   on average The company s fourth quarter results are expected to reflect benefits from a favorable demand environment in North America  However  soft industrial demand in non domestic markets might have made a negative impact on the quarterly performance Sherwin Williams  shares have rallied 47 2  in the past year compared with the  s 47 5  growth Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement What to ExpectIn October 2019  the company stated that it expects consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter to increase by low single digit percentage on a year over year basis  Sherwin Williams expects to witness favorable demand and solid backlogs from its North American professional painting contractor customers  The company sees growth in the Americas Group segment to be in mid to high single digit range Moreover  the company expects sales in the Consumer Brands Group to be flat to up slightly in the to be reported quarter  The Performance Coatings Group sales are expected to be down low single digits due to highly variable industrial demand by region and end market For 2019  Sherwin Williams also raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of  20 90  21 30 following strong third quarter performance  This marks an increase of around 14  at the midpoint compared with adjusted earnings of  18 53 reported in 2018  Notably  the projection excludes costs and non operating items related to the Valspar acquisition The company s raw material costs likely moderated in the fourth quarter compared with third quarter levels  This is based on the company s assumption that there were no supply disruptions and petrochemical feedstocks remained stable The company s fourth quarter results are also likely to have gained from sustained strength in architectural paint markets in North America  Benefits of cost control and productivity improvement initiatives are also expected to reflect on margin However  softer industrial demand in non domestic markets is likely to have hurt sales in its Performance Coatings Group unit in the fourth quarter

quarter s figure The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the Americas Group segment is currently pegged at  2 413 million  which suggests expected growth of 7 1  year over year The Zacks
