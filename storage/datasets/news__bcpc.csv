21065,242580,BCPC,False Breakout Just Another Tease  But Fundamental Rankings Are Bullish,opinion,"Rather than a Great Rotation from bonds into equities  the rotation instead has been from growth into value  Among the ten U S  business sectors  uber defensive sector Utilities is still the clear leader year to date  up more than  10   followed by Energy and Healthcare  Healthcare and Materials were the leaders last week  Consumer Services Discretionary remains the clear laggard YTD  Moreover  rather than bond prices falling  the 10 year Treasury yield has fallen even further to 2 52   further indicating a flight to safety 
Of the 470 companies from the S P 500 that have reported so far  nearly 70  have beaten estimates and 10  have met estimates  Defensive sectors Utilities and Telecom have shown the strongest Q1 earnings growth 
Although the strong U S  economic fundamentals theoretically should be pushing interest rates up  macro and technical drivers have prevented it  Of course  this is good news and the best of both worlds  as low interest rates  without massive stimulus programs  and improving fundamentals bode well for economic growth and corporate earnings growth    as well as stock prices 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed last week at 12 44  It continues to creep downward  and remains firmly below the 15 threshold  indicating investor complacency about risk in their stock holdings 
ConvergEx reports that average sector correlations for the 10 business sectors of the S P 500 have been averaging 79  recently  which is much lower than the 95  correlations displayed during the height of the risk on risk off days of the past few years  Top performing Utilities is a low 21   while emerging markets clocks in at just 38  
It seems like an opportune time for Sabrient to launch this year s Forward Looking Value portfolio next month 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 188 05  which is right about where it closed the previous week  and the week before that  Overhead resistance at 190 proved too strong  and price remains smack dab in the middle of the long standing rising bullish channel  After briefly showing a desire to break out and display a triple top buy signal  it turned out to be a false breakout  SPY has now returned back to its neutral sideways channel between roughly 187 and 189  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic remain in neutral  still giving no indication of direction  However  Bollinger  Bands have suddenly pinched together  which generally indicates that a strong directional move is imminent 

There is still a gap up from April 16 around 184 that has not been filled and continues to act as a magnet  Strong support continues to be provided by the 50 day simple moving average  which now coincides with the lower Bollinger Band  After that is the 100 day SMA  followed by gap support at 184  Below that is the bottom of the long standing uptrend  currently near 181   followed by round number support at 180  and then the 200 day SMA  near 178  
Notably  the iShares Russell 2000 small cap fund   ARCA IWM  remains below the 200 day simple moving average  and the index is struggling to hold round number support at 1100  On the other hand  the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund  ARCA EEM  is well above its 200 day SMA and is rapidly approaching the breakeven level year to date 
Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The  Outlook Score  employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a  Bull Score  and  Bear Score  for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well   safe havens   when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial   NYSE IYF   Technology   NYSE IYW   Industrial   NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods   NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities s  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   The Outlook scores are mostly the same this week  Technology remains in first place with a robust Outlook score of 93    anything above 90 is quite impressive  Industrial stays in second place with a 63  providing a bit more of a gap above third place Utilities at 55  Technology generally displays solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a reasonable forward P E  the highest return ratios  and positive sentiment among Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates   along with improving insider sentiment  buying activity   Industrial displays a good forward long term growth rate  solid return ratios  and strong sentiment among sell side analysts  Financial and Energy once again round out the top five 
2   Telecommunications stay in the cellar with an Outlook score of 0 again  as it scores at the bottom in every factor in the model  It is joined in the bottom two once again by Consumer Services Discretionary with a score of 22 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Industrial and Basic Materials share the lead at 59  while Utilities is the laggard with a 47  In fact  Utilities is the only sector scoring below 50 this week  The top bottom spread is only 12 points  reflecting relatively high sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities continues hold up well  scoring 78  which means that stocks within this defensive sector have been the preferred  safe havens  on weak market days  Energy is second at 62  Consumer Services scores the lowest at 47  The top bottom spread is a highly robust 31 points  reflecting extremely low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology displays by far the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed by Utilities  Telecom is the worst  followed by Consumer Services  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities is the clear leader  corroborated by its strong performance this year  as well   followed by Energy  which actually displays the best balance between its Bull and Bear scores  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Consumer Services scores by far the lowest  indicating general investor avoidance during extreme conditions  and this has been corroborated by its underperformance so far this year 
6   Overall  I would have to interpret this week s Outlook rankings as slightly more bullish than last week    even though the rankings haven t changed much and I called them neutral last week  Four of the top five sectors also display high Bull scores  the exception is Utilities   and Industrial has pulled away from a tightly packed middle group of the next five sectors  indicating additional bullish conviction 
These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Industrial sectors are relatively undervalued  while Consumer Services and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look   
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  Industrial  and Basic Materials in the prevailing bullish climate   In this particular model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is still above its 50 day simple moving average while also remaining above its 200 day SMA  
Other ETFs that are ranked high by our algorithm from the Technology  Industrial  and Materials sectors include PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductor ETF  NYSE PSI   SPDR S P Transportation ETF Trust  NYSE XTN   and PowerShares S P Small Cap Materials Portfolio  NASDAQ PSCM  
For an  enhanced  sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Technology  Industrial  and Materials  some long ideas include SanDisk Corp  NASDAQ SNDK   Open Table  NASDAQ OPEN   Alaska Air Group  NYSE ALK   United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   Balchem  NASDAQ BCPC   and Westlake Chemical  NYSE WLK   All are ranked highly in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top quintile of our   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found it quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you are more comfortable with a neutral bias  the model suggests holding Technology  Industrial  and Utilities  On the other hand  if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Energy  and Consumer Goods Staples

21066,242581,BCPC,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Balchem Corporation,opinion,Balchem Corporation   NASDAQ BCPC   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for BCPC broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 5 7  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for BCPC stock If that wasn t enough  BCPC isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come Consider that in the last 30 days  1 estimate has been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for BCPC  You can see  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-12-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert-balchem-corporation-200367685,200367685

investment decisions as lack of information creates chances of misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  usually portrays higher investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely holds some value Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t like to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks Needless to say  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Impact on Stock PriceThe price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price
