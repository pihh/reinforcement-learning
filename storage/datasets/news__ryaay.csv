29785,251300,RYAAY,StockBeat   Boeing Slips as Doubts Fly in Over Credit Rating,news,"Investing com   Boeing slid on Monday on worries that the ongoing 737 MAX crisis will likely continue to burn a hole in the aircraft maker s coffers leaving its credit rating vulnerable to a cut  
Analysts at Standard   Poor s warned that it may cut its credit rating for Boeing  NYSE BA  as the ongoing crisis with its 737 MAX fleet  which has remained grounded for months following two fatal crashes  could cause the company s financial position to deteriorate in the months ahead  causing its ratio of cash flow to debt to reach a level that usually triggers a downgrade  
Boeing  NYSE BA  slipped 1 2  to  340 87 at 1 52 pm ET  17 52 GMT   The decline subtracted nearly 28 points from the Dow  The 737 MAX woes have cut Boeing s stock return this year from 38  before the grounding to less than 6   
The update comes after the company earlier in the day detailed plans to raise funds through a six part bond offering later this year  with rival credit rating agency Fitch Ratings also flagging concerns about the Boeing s rising debt owing to the ongoing 737 crisis  
Boeing s debt could rise above  24 billion before the end of the year  as a result of working capital build up related to the 737 MAX grounding  but this will begin to decline once deliveries resume   Fitch Ratings said
The bond offering is expected to put any possible stock buybacks on the back burner  analysts said  
The negative day for Boeing comes a week after the company recorded its biggest quarterly loss and said it expects its 737 MAX jets to return to service by early in the fourth quarter  But the company warned it could further cut or suspend production of its bestselling planes on further delays 
Ryanair Holdings  NASDAQ RYAAY   the Irish budget airline  said it has cut its growth targets in half for next year  scrapped 30 000 planned flights and could close bases and cut jobs if the return of the 737 MAX is delayed into next year

 We believe there is still significant risk associated with the MAX  return to service  RTS and headline risk as Boeing navigates the re certification process   Stifel said in a note last week

29841,251356,RYAAY,Buy These Stocks As Oil Slips To Lowest Since Aramco Attacks,opinion,Oil prices slumped more than 2  on Sep 24  touching the lowest level since the attacks on Saudi Arabia s key oil production facilities  This has been primarily led by President Trump s disturbing rhetoric in relation to the trade conflict with China Trump accused China of manipulating its currency and stealing intellectual property  in a U N  speech  He specified that he won t accept a  bad deal  in trade talks with China  It s worth pointing out that China is the world s largest importer of oil and also the second largest crude user  The United States  in the meanwhile  is the largest consumer of oil Such developments are working against the oil market  especially  after oil rallied last week following a crippling attack on Saudi oil installations  The coordinated drone strikes on key Saudi oil facilities have removed nearly 5  of global supplies U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the attack was a  state on state act of war  by Iran  but the United States is still committed toward finding a diplomatic solution with Iran  U S  Secretary of Defense Mark Esper added that the United States will send troops to Saudi Arabia but that would be  defensive in nature   U S  treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that  the United States will continue its maximum pressure campaign against Iran s repressive regime  which attempts to achieve its revolutionary agenda through regional aggression while squandering the country s oil proceeds  The coordinated drone strikes affected the world s largest oil procession plant  In fact  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that almost 5 7 million barrels a day of crude oil and gas have been affected Nonetheless  oil prices extended losses after industry data showed unanticipated buildup in U S  crude stockpiles  The American Petroleum Institute said that U S  crude inventories rose 1 4 million barrels last week  way more than analysts  estimate of 200 000 barrel drawdown But  the drop in crude oil prices has been a blessing for aviation and refinery companies  Here s why  Aviation  Refiners Poised to GainAviation stocks traditionally have an inverse relationship with the movement of oil prices  So  it isn t surprising that shares of aviation firms are rising after the sharp drop in oil  As fuel costs form a major part of the operating costs for aviation firms  a rise in oil prices eats into profit margins Refineries also stand to gain from the drop in crude oil prices  Refineries buy crude oil as their raw materials  So  refineries  net cash flow declines if crude oil prices rise  Meanwhile  their net cash flow increases when crude oil prices fall 4 Solid PicksWe have  thus

Treasury yields  dollar climb on upbeat nonfarm payroll data
Oil firms on OPEC supply cuts  Venezuela sanctions

Key Events
Equities in Europe and futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 slipped lower this morning  though U S  contracts later managed to crawl back above neutral levels amid a general lack of market drivers 
The STOXX Europe 600 wiped out Fridays  gains after the open even after Shell  LON RDSa  and BP  LON BP  edged higher as Brent prices advanced for the fifth straight day  Rio Tinto  LON RIO  and BHP  LON BHPB   conversely  fell after a stock downgrade by JPMorgan 
During the earlier Asian session  equities firmed amid thin volume as the region heads into Lunar New Year holidays following a robust U S  employment report on Friday as well as positive statements  over the weekend  from the U S  Administration on trade negotiations with China 
Chinese markets will remain closed all week in observance of the holiday  Hong Kong s Hang Seng closed at midday  up 0 21 percent  South Korea s KOSPI  which ended broadly flat   0 06 percent   will be closed on Thursday  Australia s S P ASX 200 gained 0 48 percent and Japan s Nikkei rose 0 46 percent  boosted by the weakest yen levels since December 28 
Global Financial Affairs
On Friday  U S  stocks extended gains thanks to robust labor figures  where moderate wage growth did not threaten an inflation spike  A rise in broader prices would impact the Fed s recent shift in interest rates outlook  after Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank will be  patient  and wait for data to make an informed decision on monetary policy  as well as  flexible  with unloading its spreadsheet 

Positive employment data boosted the yield on 10 year Treasurys  which had dropped over four straight session on the sudden shift in the Fed s rate outlook  Yields today extended the rebound  approaching the 2 7 percent level 

Upbeat nonfarm payrolls also pushed the dollar higher  The greenback is now advancing for the third day  after it slipped below the 200 DMA intraday on Thursday  The rebound came upon the potential neckline of a H S top 

Meanwhile  oil prices moderately extended gains  as bullish traders support the advance from the  52 levels  helped by OPEC supply cuts in January as well as U S  sanctions against Venezuela  Technically  the price completed a H S bottom on Friday  However  with just a 1 65 percent penetration of the neckline  there is a reasonable chance of a bull trap 
Over the weekend  U S  President Donald Trump told CBS that trade talks with Beijing are  doing very well  and sounded confident an agreement with North Korea was on the horizon  After a busy few days that included dovish Federal Reserve comments and U S  China trade talks in Washington  there s a notable lack of drivers for markets on Monday  also due to Asian holidays  Investors may look to corporate earnings results which have so far been a mixed bag for direction 
As to U S  equities  we have been bearish on the S P 500 for quite some time  but have recently turned less assertive  The Fed s tightening pace was the one single headwind that we consistently focused on for stock trend predictions  after historic central bank accommodation resulted in the longest bull market on record  We did say that should the tightening risk be removed  it would turn into a tailwind  last week s and last month s market performance confirmed this thesis  However  we do still think that the market has overstated the Fed s dovish tilt  and this begs for a meaningful downward correction  in the short term 
Furthermore  we are also concerned that the market is misinterpreting the Fed s and particularly Chair Jerome Powell s statements altogether  Powell repeatedly said that the Fed is markedly data dependent  and since there is a lack of available data due to the partial government shutdown  the Fed cannot adequately fine tune its policy path at present  We would argue that this doesn t represent a policy shift  as the market keeps claiming  It rather marks a pause on policy decisions  To clarify  we don t know what the data will show when it becomes available  and it may very well support what the market already thinks  even if prematurely and therefore erroneously  in our opinion  On the other hand  the market might be shocked right back to the brink of a bear market  should it learn that it priced in a dovish turn that never occurred  Not only would it then return to the pre Christmas levels  but it would price in yet more rate hikes  falling squarely into a full on bear market 
Overall  U S  shares are up in the short term and down in the medium term  The medium term would reverse if it posts an ascending series of peak and trough prices  Till then  we will maintain our bearish stance

highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Theresa May Gets Cabinet Vote on Brexit Deal  Winners   LosersSpeculation over deal or no deal  series of cabinet resignations and a no confidence vote finally compelled U K  Prime Minister Theresa May and her cabinet to approve a Brexit deal with the European Union  EU   It was undoubtedly a hard fought victory as the cabinet was split  with some of the ministers opposing the agreement Bitter battles and possibility of further market gyrations  however  lie ahead  After all  the draft will now head to a Brussels summit where it will get the approval of EU leaders before getting back to the House of Commons  likely by the end of this year  The U K  is set to leave the EU on Mar 29  2019 Nonetheless  breaking the impasse with her cabinet members was a big step forward  and the pound s recent rally reflects that  The pound traded at  1 3054 versus the U S  dollar on Nov 14  up 0 6  from its level late Tuesday  It has been quite a volatile trading session for the pound  which was at an intraday low of  1 2879 before climbing to the  1 30 mark  Meanwhile  the ICE  NYSE ICE  Dollar Index  which measures the U S  currency against a basket of six major rivals  slipped 0 2  at 96 80 However  the pound strength against the U S  dollar hasn t gone down well with U K  s large caps  like oil majors and pharmaceutical bigwigs  as it makes their exports more expensive  The FTSE 100 is also down  as its combined revenue is either earned in dollars or dollar linked currencies Meanwhile  firms that generate most of their revenues domestically and are more influenced by the U K  s current two year high economic growth are the biggest beneficiaries Here s a summary of some of the sectors and stocks in the United Kingdom that are gaining and losing from May s withdrawal pact with the EU  Banks See Mixed OutcomeFollowing the Brexit breakthrough  FTSE s gauge of U K  bank stocks fell nearly 1  in early trading  but a closer look will give you a different story  International players like Barclays Plc saw its shares lose 1 6  due to currency impact Meanwhile  domestically focused institutions like Lloyds Banking Group plc should now breathe a sigh of relief  After all  such banks would have been affected the most in case of any economic downturn owing to a no Brexit deal Newer firms like Metro Bank Plc and Virgin Money owner CYBG Plc  in the meantime  saw their shares move north as they vie with international players Home Builders GainRumors about the Brexit deal has been weighing on homebuilder stocks for quite some time now  But  now firms that build houses are among the best performers in the U K   predominantly due to the Brexit breakthrough This has surely helped outweigh concerns that have been plaguing homebuilders like lack of affordability and the inability to save for a deposit Drop in Oil Prices Saves AirlinesThe International Air Transport Association had expected Brexit to be a big setback for airlines  Needless to say  it will affect landing rights  pilot licenses and the trade of aircraft parts across borders But  the recent slump in oil prices helped British airlines stay afloat and defy Brexit  Oil recently saw its deepest plunge in more than three years in the international market  as fears of oversupply and a weakening demand outlook weighed on the market  Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc  which provides scheduled passenger airline services in Ireland  the United Kingdom  and Other European countries  gained 0 3  Retailers   Car Parts Manufacturers Rev UpThe prospect of the U K  crashing out of the EU without a deal and a subsequent drop in pound may have resulted in higher inflation  This in turn could have squeezed the real wage and reduced consumer spending  something that doesn t bode well with retailers  A weaker pound  by the way  also leads to higher import cost for retailers Thus  the Brexit deal helped retailers like Next Plc gain ground at a time when they are grappling with the encroachment of online retailers like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Carmakers like Peugeot Sa and Citroen producer PSA Group  in the meantime  have urged both the United Kingdom and EU to seal a deal to prevent production disruption  This breakthrough now will surely help carmakers in the near term Food Makers Rejoice  Media Sector Bleeds   U K  imports almost half of what it consumes  And most of the food and agricultural products are imported from the EU  Thus  lack of a smooth deal would have led to an increase in agricultural import prices  and eat into the margins of producers and grocers Thanks to the Brexit deal  suppliers of ingredients and pre prepared food such as Kerry Group plc will now have a better profit margin  The same cannot be said about media and telecom giants  Meanwhile  Britain s biggest free to air commercial broadcaster  ITV  LON ITV  Plc has cautioned that revenues will start to fall  irrespective of a good or bad Brexit deal

29993,251508,RYAAY,Easy Jet Produced Encouraging Number  Bitcoin Below  4 500,opinion,"U S and European markets are poised to decline on Tuesday after weaknesses have been shown in some of the biggest technology companies  The tech wreck is on  The heavy hitters of the technology sectors  FANG stocks got hammered yesterday and most of them entered in a bear market territory  The S P 500 is down nearly  8  from it s peak  Companies like NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  stock is down more than 50  from their peak taking the title of worst stock out of the tech sector 
One can always blame the current sell due to the ongoing trade war tensions between the U S and China  But the fact is that investors need to re adjust their gauges and expect small profits  The time for the low interest environment and the element of quantitative easing program providing an extra push for the stock markets is over now  Now  it is more about sinking the reality  and realising that most of the factors that could have squeezed out any potential from the stock markets are limited 
As for the currency market  sterling is still vulnerable as Theresa May is battling against all obstacles while keeping hold of her position  It is more likely that Pound may remain volatile in the midst of this chaos 
 The crypto king is being hit hard and it is under tremendous selling pressure  Bitcoin broke the 5000 mark yesterday for the first time  breaking another psychological level  The break of  6000 was bad as it is and now a violation of the 5000 mark is further evidence that bulls are not supporting the price  The next biggest support level is at  4 000  One can only pray that the price doesn t violate this critical level because a break of this would open the floor towards the 3 000 level 
Roman Ziemian  founder of FutureNet Foundation told that the technology is the future and there is no doubt that Bitcoin has proven a powerful concept  He believes in the technology and he thinks there a number of good projects out there which has serious potential 
Fundamentally speaking  the current sell off is once again triggered due to the regulatory pressure  The SEC reminded the crypto world that it has the final say over anything which smells like security  The department issued civil penalties against two cryptocurrency companies because they failed to register initial coin offerings as securities 
EasyJet PLC  LON EZJ  topped street expectations and produced full year revenue of  5 90 billion ahead of estimates of  5 85 billion  The full year dividend per share came in at 58 6p  this was also ahead of the estimates of 59 9p  What is more encouraging for Easy Jet is that it has improved it s revenue per share to GBP 61 94  The firm still needs to improve it s full year cost per seat structure  currently  the cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency is  4 8   Having said this  the full year capacity has improved and it is sitting at 9 8  
The fact is that the competition is extremely tough and the company s competitor  Ryanair Holdings PLC ADR  NASDAQ RYAAY  is leaving no stone unturned to sustain it s No 1 place for being the low cost airline  The challenge for these low cost airlines is to stay away from the scenarios of strikes as they don t only cause chaos for the passengers but they also leave a dent on the headline number  One area of interest for Easy Jet investors remains the acquisition of the troubled Italian airline  Alitalia ",2018-11-20,Naeem Aslam,https://www.investing.com/analysis/easy-jet-produced-encouraging-number--bitcoin-below-4500-200360881,200360881
30008,251523,RYAAY,Stocks Roar On Hopes Of Trade Deal  Ryanair And Netflix To Watch,opinion,"European markets and US futures are trading sharply higher today building on the optimism around the US China trade talks  We have seen significant increase in the numbers of investors who have added risk assets in their portfolio on the back of this  Just to put things in perspective  the S P 500 broke its 50 day moving average  a signal that bulls are back in the race and perhaps a bottom is in place as long as we do not move this critical moving average  This all happened after a report which mentioned that the US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has proposed easing Chinese tariffs  Although  the Treasury didn t confirm this but the market has bought this for now and if this turns out to be a junk  the selloff would be intense 
Another way of looking at the risk on trade is to focus on the global equity market and this shows that the global equities are on track to record four consecutive weeks of gain  something which we have not experienced since July last year  I think investors are also confident because of the recent prints of the US economic data such as the   ecl 236   Philadelphia s factory index   which bounced strongly back during the month of January  this is after recording three months of losses  Moreover the upbeat tone from the Chicago s Fed president also supported the current momentum who has shown no signs of any immediate concern about the US economy 
One of the asset which has taken no time to show the direct reaction because of the possibility of a deal to occur between the US and China is oil  It has extended its third week of gains and the WTI has moved towards the 53 mark  Of course  the move is based on the hopes that improving trade relations between the two biggest economies of the world would only improve the demand for oil because there is no doubt that the Chinese economy has suffered because of the trade war as well as the US economy  The resistance level which we are watching is the high of December  sits at 54 77  The support is at 47 53 
In terms of stocks  it is all about Ryanair  NASDAQ RYAAY  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  today and investors are going to keep a close eye on these two stocks which could feel the heat because of the feeble fundamentals  Ryanair has done a downward adjustment to its full year profit guidance  due to the lower winter fares  Given that the earnings are expected to fall to 7 percent which is a lot lower than the previous number of 2 percent  investor are going to react adversely  Adding to their qualm  the company s has also cut its full year profit to 1 billion euros to 1 1 billion 
If you want to keep your investors happy  you need to make sure that you are running your affairs correctly  You cannot just afford battles with unions  or strikes as both of these effect company s growth number and most importantly you want to show that your customer service policies and the image is friendly and Ryanair really needs to get a good grip on this 
The company which made the headline in terms of burning daily cash is Netflix and investors didn t like their earning numbers at all  After hour trading session was rough  the company stock sank over 5 percent  Having said this  the volatility which we have experienced last night for the Netflix stock was still relatively on the low side because usually it has the tendency to move 15  in either side 
The company is looking to increase its membership by  1 to 2  depending what package you have   just to show how the company s outlook for the coming quarter could be improved  It added 8 84 million new subscriber in Q4 2019 which missed the estimate of 9 4 million and the increase in the subscription fee has added more doubts for its growth in the subscription number especially when the competition is extremely fierce in this space and everyone is fighting for the market growth  It also missed revenue forecast  reported  4 49 billion versus the expectations of  4 60 billion but we don t think that is such a big deal because the firm is certainly adding mammoth amount of original content ",2019-01-18,Naeem Aslam,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-roar-on-hopes-of-trade-deal-ryanair-and-netflix-to-watch-200376996,200376996
30076,251591,RYAAY,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  United Continental  Southwest Airlines  Delta Air And Ryanair,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 24  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Airlines  including United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL    Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   and Ryanair Holdings plc   NASDAQ RYAAY   Industry  Airlines  Part 3Link  The fact that the  declined 2 5  in the first quarter of the year highlights the fact the sector is not bereft of headwinds  despite positives such as increasing financial prosperity and the new tax law Let s take a look at the factors responsible for the disappointing price performance Weather Related Disruptions Rule Stocks in the airline space have been hit repeatedly by inclement weather this year  Weather related disruptions cripple airline operations  leading to multiple flights being cancelled  Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January  successive nor easters in March disrupted airline operations significantly due to multiple flight cancellations In fact  the month of March has  seen more than 10 000 flights being called off due to successive nor easters  Notably  this was the worst March in five years in terms of flight cancellations The increase in the number of flight cancellations resulted in significant revenue loss for airline operators and this is likely to dent the top line performance of carriers in the first quarter  According to the Air Travel Consumer Report unveiled by the U S  Department of Transportation  the number of cancellations increased during January 2018  In fact  the rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights increased to 3  from 2  and 1 2  in January and December 2017  respectively Public Relations Fiascoes Carriers such as United Continental Holdings  Inc  and Southwest Airlines Co  have been hurt by issues pertaining to animals on their flights In February  an unfortunate child related incident occurred on a Southwest Airlines flight  Phoenix to Portland  when a dog bit the girl on the plane  Southwest started reviewing its policy pertaining to onboard service animals  even before the occurrence of incident The dog fiasco at one of the flights of United Airlines   United Continental s subsidiary   earned the carrier rebuke from all corners  In fact  the incident which resulted in the tragic death of a black French bulldog puppy on one of its flights on Mar 12  2018  did not go unnoticed by lawmakers in the United States According to a   U S  senators John Kennedy and Catherine Cortez Masto have introduced a legislation aimed at preventing airlines from putting live animals in overhead bins  The senators have also proposed the imposition of fines on violations of the animal friendly measure  This apart  the transportation of a Kansas bound German shepherd to Japan also dented its market reputation with respect to its pet handling policy Markedly  these two mishaps were the reasons behind United Airlines  decision to suspend its pet cargo travel service  Even in 2017  United Airlines had the dubious distinction of the highest number of animal deaths on its flights The mishandling of animals has caused carriers like Delta Air Lines  Inc  to change their policy on animals on their flights  Markedly  from Mar 1  2018 the concerned passengers on Delta flights would need to furnish documents underlining passengers  need for carrying the animal on the flight  Also  the person has to provide proof related to its training and vaccinations within 48 hours before the flight Delta carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  High Costs Likely to Hurt Bottom Line in Q1Crude oil prices are on their way back up after falling sharply from  100 a barrel in 2014  to a low of  30 in 2016  Currently  oil prices are hovering around the  66 a barrel mark  Mounting tensions related to Syria contributed to the upsurge  As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies  the rise in oil prices naturally pushed up operating expenses  in turn  hurting the bottom line of carriers  With fuel costs moving northward  bottom line growth of carriers is likely to be limited in the first quarter Apart from high fuel costs  expenses on the labor front have also been increasing over the past few quarters due to the various labor deals inked by carriers  High labor costs are likely to dent the bottom line growth of most carriers in the first quarter Other Headwinds Plaguing Airlines The long standing pay related dispute between European low cost carrier  Ryanair Holdings plc  and its pilots shows no signs of ending  According to a   the European Employee Representative Council   formed in 2016 by pilots of the Irish carrier   demanded the resignation of Ryanair CEO Michael O Leary The unofficial pan European body was of the opinion that O Leary had failed to tackle the issue effectively  resulting in many pilots quitting the company  Ryanair has  however  dismissed this demand Moreover  Southwest s bleak view unveiled late last month  with respect to operating revenue per available seat miles  RASM   for first quarter also dented stocks in the space  The Dallas based carrier attributed the downbeat forecast to pricing pressure and lower than expected demand for air travel due to the timing of the spring break holidays Furthermore  the U S  Department of Transportation s  DOT  tentative decision to grant permission to five U S  based leading carriers to operate new scheduled flights to Havana has led to fears of competition intensifying among leading carriers as Havana is popular tourist spot  In fact  in a bid to attract customers  U S  carriers may face a price war Join us on Facebook

30089,251604,RYAAY,IATA Trims 2018 Airlines Profit Forecast Due To High Costs,opinion,"At its Annual General Meeting in Sydney  the International Air Transport Association   IATA   trimmed its forecast for airlines with respect to profitability for 2018  The research firm predicts that the global net profit for the industry to be  33 8 billion  This is much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of  38 4 billion  which was unveiled by the organization in December 2017 
The world s leading air transport group has attributed the downward revision of the current year profitability view mainly to the rise in oil prices  Escalating oil prices apart  labor and interest costs have also weighed on the profitability forecast 
The profitability forecast for the current year also compares unfavorably to what was achieved by airlines in 2017   38 billion    Moreover  2017 s profitability figure is much higher than the  34 5 billion that was projected in December 
We note that the 2017 figure of  38 billion was a record for airline companies  boosted by one time items  Due to this reason  IATA believes that the current year profitability forecast is an impressive one despite being lower than the year ago figure 
2018 Forecast in Details
Per IATA  bulk of the global net profits   15 billion  is expected to come from the North American region  which boasts of carriers like Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL    Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK    Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   and Hawaiian Holdings Inc    NASDAQ HA    The estimated figure is lower than  18 4 billion in 2017  The unfavorable comparison is again due to high costs 
All the above mentioned carriers  apart from Southwest  carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   However  you can see 
European Airlines  which includes the likes of Ryanair Holdings plc   NASDAQ RYAAY    are expected to be more profitable in 2018   8 6 billion  than the previous year   8 1 billion   More extensive hedging by European carriers compared to their North American counterparts have made them less vulnerable to the rise in oil prices 
Other regions  namely  Asia Pacific  Latin America and the Middle East are expected to generate post tax net profit of  8 2 billion   0 9 billion and  1 3 billion  respectively  African carriers are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2018  suffering losses to the tune of  0 1 billion 
Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4 1  in 2018 from 5  a year ago  The top line is however projected to increase 10 7  to  834 billion  The top line is likely to be boosted by higher passenger as well as cargo revenues  Strong demand for air travel has contributed to the 10 8  year over year growth in passenger revenues 
Even though  passenger air travel growth in 2018  7   is anticipated to be slower than the phenomenal 8 1  growth witnessed last year  it compares favorably to the 20 year average growth rate  5 5   
Capacity is projected to increase by 6 7  in 2018  flat year over year  According to the forecast  load factor    of seats filled by passengers  for 2016 is expected to expand 20 basis points to 81 7  due to capacity expansion being outweighed by traffic growth 
Yield and unit costs are projected to increase by 3 8  and 5 8  respectively  Unit revenue growth for 2018 is projected at 4 2   With unit costs anticipated to outpace unit revenue growth in the current year it is natural for profitability to be hampered 
The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be  7 80 per passenger in 2018 compared with  9 30 in 2017  The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27 5  to  70 per barrel this year 
The expectation is also revised upward from  60 a barrel anticipated  while revealing its expectations in December 2017  Fuel bill is likely to account for 24 2  of total costs in 2018  21 4  in 2017  
High Fuel Costs Likely to See Uptick in Airfares
In a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices  airlines are likely to increase air fares  They might pass on the increased costs to passengers to prevent profits from being dented 
In fact  American Airlines Group Inc  s   NASDAQ AAL   CEO  Doug Parker  hinted recently in Sydney that air travel might become more expensive in the long term in the event of oil prices remaining high   Some market watchers believe that fuel surcharges may be added to tickets  Capacity growth would also probably be subdued in the era of rising prices 
Disappointing Price Performance
Oil prices have been on an uptrend this year  thanks to various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East  The struggles of airline stocks chiefly due to surge in oil prices can be gauged from the fact that the has shed 12 9  of its value so far this year  whereas the S P 500 index has gained 2 2  in the same period 

Conclusion
What is worse is that oil prices are anticipated to increase further from the current level of around  65 a barrel  as envisioned by the IATA  With the organisation trimming airlines profitability forecast for the current year mainly due to the upsurge in oil prices  we expect the struggles for airline stocks to continue in the remainder of the year 
This is likely to result in an uptick in airfares  as mentioned above  However  some market watchers believe that this phase of higher fuel costs might promote capacity discipline  This a boon for carriers as woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued airlines for quite some time 
With so many possibilities in the cards  we expect investors to remain focused on updates from the space as sector participants look to devise ways to eliminate threats from rising oil prices

Another significant update from the trade association emerged recently  when it trimmed its 2018 profitability outlook for the airline industry to  33 8 billion from  38 4 billion anticipated earlier  Notably  high fuel costs were primarily responsible for the view cut  Bulk of the global profits   15 billion  are expected to come from the North American region

Meanwhile  Dallas based Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   continues to feel the pinch of the deadly accident on its flight in April  which claimed one life  Due to low ticket sales as a result of the accident apart from the spike in oil prices  this low cost carrier issued a second quarter unit revenue view  which was at the lower end of its previous forecast  Operating revenue per available seat mile  RASM  is anticipated to decline around 3  year over year  the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1 3  range  
Furthermore  JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   joined fellow carriers like American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   in revamping its policy pertaining to emotional support animals on its flights Transportation   Airline Industry 5YR   Return

Recap of the Past Week s Most Important Stories 
1  At its 74th Annual General Meeting in Sydney  Australia  the IATA stated that due to rising fuel costs and other factors like the ongoing geopolitical tensions  airline companies are expected to be less profitable in 2018 than previously anticipated  Global net profit margin is expected to contract to 4 1  in 2018 from 5  a year ago  However  the top line is projected to increase 10 7  on the back of higher passenger and cargo revenues 
Even though  passenger air travel growth in 2018  7   is anticipated to be slower than the phenomenal 8 1  growth witnessed last year  it compares favorably to the 20 year average growth rate  Read more    
Earlier in the week  IATA also released its global traffic numbers for April  Although global travel demand  measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs  increased year over year  the metric compared unfavorably to the March reading when traffic expanded 9 7    the highest growth rate in 12 months  With fuel costs on the rise  air fares are likely to increase in the remainder of the year 
On a year over year basis  traffic growth was evident in both international  4 8   and domestic  8 5   markets  which resulted in a rise in the overall figure  Total capacity   available seat kilometers or ASKs  increased 5 9  in the month  Load factor also improved 20 basis points to 82 3  owing to higher traffic growth  In fact  the reading on load factor was a record as far as the month of April was concerned 
2  At Delta  consolidated traffic  measured in revenue passenger miles  RPMs   came in at 19 69 billion  up 2 9  year over year  Consolidated capacity  or available seat miles ASMs  climbed 3 5  to 22 83 billion on a year over year basis  Read more    
Meanwhile  Delta and Korean Air extended their codeshare agreement on flights in the United States as both the companies aim to boost traffic in the highly lucrative trans Pacific market  This customer friendly move followed the launch of a joint venture partnership between the two earlier this year  A codeshare deal allows sharing of flights  which implies that a passenger has the free will to avail any flight operated by either of the companies under the agreement  irrespective of the flight number 
Delta carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   However  you can see  
3  Southwest Airlines trimmed its capacity outlooks for second quarter and full year 2018 due to increasing fuel prices  The company now anticipates second quarter available seat mile  ASM  or capacity to rise approximately 3 5   Earlier  it had called for 3 5 4  growth in the metric  Also  for the latter half of the year  ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6  year over year  lower than its earlier view of a rise in the low 7  range  read more    
4  Ireland based Ryanair Holdings plc   NASDAQ RYAAY   reported solid traffic data for May  courtesy of low air ticket prices  The carrier s traffic improved 6  year over year in the month  Load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  rose to 96  from 95  a year ago on the back of decline in air ticket prices  The impressive traffic figures came despite the carrier having to cancel more than 1 100 flights in May due to staff shortages  inclement weather and other factors 
5  From Jul 1  passengers will only be allowed to carry cats  dogs and miniature horses as emotional support animals on JetBlue flights  As part of tightening its policy  this low cost carrier will ask the relevant passengers to provide extensive documentation pertaining to the animal s health and behavior 
In addition  the person has to provide proof related to its vaccinations and other factors within 48 hours before the flight  Under the stricter rules  the concerned passenger will also have to sign a document taking full responsibility for any injury caused by the animal he she is carrying on the flight

30092,251607,RYAAY,Low Cost  Lower Profit Ryanair Or EasyJet ,opinion,"During the past couple of months  Ryanair  NASDAQ RYAAY  has been on the news for wrong reasons as it had to cancel several flights across Europe due to pilot and cabin crew strikes 
Throughout the years  a company which was overshadowed by Ryanair s success was EasyJet PLC  LON EZJ  
EasyJet is considered as the 2nd biggest airline in Europe with a market share of 6 9  after Ryanair  which holds 10 11  of the share  Due to the turmoil currently being faced by Ryanair  the company has just announced that it will have higher costs and lower profits and therefore it is expected that competitors may be taking advantage in the short medium term 
On a matter of fact  just last Friday  easyJet  LON EZJ  announced that it is expecting to deliver a Full Year 2018 headline profit before tax of between 570 to 580 million  Passenger numbers for the last 12 months are expected to be 5 4  higher at almost 85m  with total revenue per seat up 6 5  at constant currency  The firm was also optimistic on its outlook  predicting capacity to increase around 10  to roughly 105m seats over 2018 19 
Easyjet can also be considered a great source of dividend with a forecasted yield of around 5 25   Ryanair does not pay dividend     Looking at the chart below  we can notice that the price is reaching an important support level at around the area of  1 2 per share  1st Support level   We can also notice that this support level joints nicely to another support  marked in blue  that is part of a trend line formed way back in October 2016 
I am confident that this level will resist as fundamental numbers are improving and technical charts are in our favour  Furthermore  various technical oscillators are showing oversold positions thereby making it a good entry point 
Should the support level indicated not resist  another support level would be around area  1 1 
As we already said  Ryanair has been facing a lot of pressures and has now seen its price fall by 12  following cancellation of 18 000 flights and the decrease in their profit forecast  The share price continued its decline after the Civil Aviation Authority said that Ryanair had misled passenger about their rights over cancellations  It goes without saying that the PR disaster that the firm faced will surely put more cost pressures on Ryanair over the months to come 
Looking at the chart we can see that yesterday the price has opened with a gap below the previous trend line and there seems no way for stopping this 

When analysing both companies  I think it is a better off strategy going on with Easyjet rather than Ryanair as the latter will surely provide its investorswith a lot of downward pressure for the months to come

30094,251609,RYAAY,What Black Friday Means For The Airline Industry ,opinion,"It s almost that time of year again where we can be thankful for family  but also thankful for cheaper flights thanks to Black Friday deals  Over the years  full service carriers like American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL   and Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    as well as smaller airlines like WOW Air and Ryanair   NASDAQ RYAAY    have offered affordable deals for travelers  Airline companies have become a part of the e commerce craze that comes during Black Friday and Cyber Monday  with more consumers now adding flights to their online shopping cart 
What can we Expect  
In the past  consumers would usually look for discounts on electronics or clothing during Black Friday and Cyber Monday  Recently however  people are also buying flights as more airlines have been offering discounts  According to   last year about 48  of the deals on Cyber Monday were for hotels and vacation packages and 20  for airfare  Consumers saved up to 50  in a few deals  which is why airlines are offering discounts this year again 
Alaska Air   NYSE ALK   noted that at least 70  of consumers who booked a flight with them last year were solo travelers and only 25  were couples  It seems as though the demographics of the travelers booking these flights during Black Friday Cyber Monday vary throughout the years  Since these airlines have more solo travelers we would be looking towards more of the younger working class looking to book for the upcoming holidays or any business trips 
With any airline company  there will be competition  especially during this time of year  People are looking for cheap flights for the holiday season and they look to those airlines that are offering them  Even though these airlines offer these discounts to  clear stock   to fill seats on flights that otherwise may be unprofitable   according to   they still seem to have a rising amount of sales while successfully profiting from them  Consumers usually save up to 25  on flights in comparison to the actual flight price  and from last year s deals  consumers ended up saving more on international flights 
Airline Stocks 
Earlier this year  airline companies were in a downward fall  with shares decreasing  It wasn t until late June  when the NYSE Arca Airline Index saw a 10  rise  October seemed to be a pretty bad month for airline stocks  seeing as Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    American Airlines and JetBlue   NASDAQ JBLU    just to name a few  all fell  21 3    15 1  and  13 5   respectively  However  investors believe that going into 2019  these numbers will change for many major airline companies and that overall  the industry will be more profitable 
The Consumer is Always Buying Flights 
Although the industry as a whole has been struggling over the past couple of months  consumers will always be buying flights and tickets to travel no matter what  So with Black Friday Cyber Monday deals  airline companies can look towards increasing sales and overall better performance  It is apparent that not only do these sales entice more consumers to book flights  but it also allows these companies to score a lot of sales and in return make profit 
As mentioned above  the main demographic purchasing these deals are usually millennials  According to CNBC  young people between the ages of 18 to 34 would rather spend money on traveling than buy a house  Younger people want experience more than things  hence most  or even all  of their money going towards flights  So when these deals come around on Black Friday Cyber Monday  those millennials who thrive on taking spontaneous trips are the ones purchasing them 
Bottom Line 
Airlines make money  no doubt  But  they make even more when customers spend on a number of flights during Black Friday Cyber Monday deals  In a nutshell  Black Friday means better outlook for the airline industry in the upcoming year

Bitter battles and possibility of further market gyrations  however  lie ahead  After all  the draft will now head to a Brussels summit where it will get the approval of EU leaders before getting back to the House of Commons  likely by the end of this year  The U K  is set to leave the EU on Mar 29  2019 
Nonetheless  breaking the impasse with her cabinet members was a big step forward  and the pound s recent rally reflects that  The pound traded at  1 3054 versus the U S  dollar on Nov 14  up 0 6  from its level late Tuesday  It has been quite a volatile trading session for the pound  which was at an intraday low of  1 2879 before climbing to the  1 30 mark  Meanwhile  the ICE  NYSE ICE  Dollar Index  which measures the U S  currency against a basket of six major rivals  slipped 0 2  at 96 80 
However  the pound strength against the U S  dollar hasn t gone down well with U K  s large caps  like oil majors and pharmaceutical bigwigs  as it makes their exports more expensive  The FTSE 100 is also down  as its combined revenue is either earned in dollars or dollar linked currencies

totaling  130 million  to each of its employee  excluding officers  by Mar 31  2018  Meanwhile  Southwest will distribute the cash bonus on Jan 8 Apart from the huge drop in corporate tax rate  the fact that the new laws allow companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately has proved to be favorable for airlines as they will be able to invest toward capital expenditure considerably  As a result  their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions  This  in turn  will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases  among others  In this regard  Southwest announced that it will invest significantly toward fleet modernization  In fact  this low cost

30109,251624,RYAAY,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Delta Airlines  American Airlines  Ryanair Holdings  Southwest Airlines And United Continental,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 6  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Airlines  including Delta Airlines   NYSE DAL    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY    Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    Industry  Airlines  Part 3Link    There is no denying that stocks in the airline space are witnessing good times on the back of a number of tailwinds like improved unit revenues and financial prosperity  Despite the optimism  there are certain roadblocks one must be mindful of before investing in the sector  Let s delve into the details Rising Fuel Costs Hurting Bottom LineFuel costs are on the rise lately  with oil prices crossing the  60 a barrel threshold  This upsurge can be attributed to the decision of OPEC member nations and Russia to extend production cuts to the end of 2018  This upsurge  however  does not spell good news for carriers As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies  the rise in oil prices naturally pushed up operating expenses  in turn  hurting the bottom line of carriers In fact  in the last three months  oil prices have increased significantly  The fact that fuel costs are on the rise can be made out from Delta Airlines  fourth quarter earnings report  Average fuel price  adjusted  was up 20 9  year over year to  1 93 per gallon at this Atlanta  GA based carrier The scenario is unlikely to change this year  Delta  which carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   expects fuel prices  including taxes and refinery impact  between  2 05 and  2 10 per gallon in the first quarter of 2018  which is much higher than the year ago figure  You can see Moreover  the International Air Transport Association   IATA   projects that jet fuel prices will escalate around 12 5  to  73 80 per barrel in 2018  The fuel bill is likely to account for 20 5  of total costs in 2018  18 8  in 2017  Labor Related Issues   Another DragApart from the rise in fuel costs  the surge in labor expenses is hurting the bottom line of carriers  This is primarily due to deals inked by carriers with various labor groups Evidently  the improved financial health of the carriers has not gone unnoticed by their employees  who are eager to get a share of the pie  This has propelled frequent new labor deals across the airline industry Even in the ongoing fourth quarter of 2017  labor costs have limited the bottom line growth of carriers  For example  at American Airlines Group  expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 7   This was primarily due to the significantly higher pay offered to pilots by the company to operate unassigned flights during the busy winter travel period This followed the infamous scheduling glitch  which allowed pilots of the carrier to take leave during the winter holiday period  giving rise to an acute pilot shortage during the busy travel period  The crisis was finally averted after talks between the company and its pilots  union   Allied Pilots Association The surge in labor costs is augmented in IATA s forecast for 2018  According to the projection  expenses related to labor are expected to be the largest expense item for airlines this year  Labor costs are projected to account for 30 9  of total expenses  and total unit costs are expected to increase 4 3   much higher than the 1 7  increase in 2017  Moreover  issues related to labor strife have been hurting airlines quite a bit  Recently  Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings  pilots resorted to a four hour strike  This was  the first time its pilots ever struck Computer Glitches Hurting Airline OperationsAmerican Airlines is not the only carrier to suffer from a scheduling glitch  A similar issue had hurt Ryanair Holdings  According to a   the carrier had to cancel 2 000 flights  resulting in significant customer dissatisfaction Technical glitches  in fact  have been creating a nuisance for carriers  For example  in November 2017  a  disrupted operations at Southwest Airlines  Operations at British Airways were also crippled last year due to a major IT system failure  Since expenditure on technological infrastructure is significant for stocks in the airline space  their profitability might be hurt in the event of such malfunctions Capacity Related Woes   Declining AirfareWoes related to capacity overexpansion plagued airline stocks in the not so distant past  particularly 2015   These fears were re ignited when United Continental Holdings  while releasing fourth quarter results on Jan 23  stated that it expects 2018 capacity growth between 4  and 6  year over year  Moreover  similar growth in the metric is forecast for 2019 and 2020  Following the guidance  investors fear that similar actions might be taken by rivals  triggering a price war Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid 2014  despite the recent resurgence  Moreover  airfares have remained low  with the metric declining in November  Capacity over expansion is believed to be the primary reason for the decline in airfares  Low air fares are favorable for fliers but a drag on the top line of carriers due to

30111,251626,RYAAY,Is Ryanair Stock A Buy As It Reaches New High ,opinion,"Shares of Ryanair   NASDAQ RYAAY   surged to a new all time high on Monday amid what has otherwise been a rough day across much of the market  And with no major Ryanair related news to speak of  now is a great time to look at some of the company s current fundamentals and latest happenings to see why investor confidence remains sky high 
Ryanair s stock price climbed over 1  to reach a new intraday trading high of  127 59 per share in contrast to some of the biggest tech companies  including Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    and Facebook   NASDAQ FB    which caused the broader S P 500 to sink  also read    
Today s gains are also part of a much larger move that has seen the discount European airline power s stock price soar over 50  in the last year  including a 19  surge over the last 12 weeks 
Recent News 
Ryanair released its February traffic results in early March and showed solid customer growth 
Traffic grew 5  from the year ago period to reach 8 6 million customers  Ryanair also reported a 95  load factor and noted that its rolling annual traffic climbed 9  to 130 million customers 
Last week  Ryanair  that it will add Turkey to its roster of destinations as part of a larger European expansion  The country  which had experienced a decline in overall tourism  has seen a recent uptick that Ryanair hopes to capitalize on 
The discount airline company also recently rolled out a  to its German pilot issue that led to a brief strike late last year  This move could prove vital as Ryanair continues its push in Germany 
Passenger numbers at the Frankfurt airport are in fact expected to climb by as much as 6   based on a  from German airport operator Fraport  Frankfurt  which is one Europe s busiest airports  is projected to see its passenger numbers reach a high end of 68 5 million  up from 64 5 million in 2017 
The company noted that Lufthansa and Ryanair s expansion are expected to drive a large portion of this growth 
More Fundamentals 
Ryanair is expected to see its revenues jump by more than 24  this quarter to reach  1 55 billion  based on our most recent Zacks Consensus Estimates  The company is also projected to see its earnings climb by 11 5  to touch  0 29 per share 
The airline firm s full year sales are expected to hit  8 31 billion  which would mark a nearly 14  climb  Looking even further down the road  Ryanair is expected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 17 3  over the next three to five years  This extended bottom line growth projection should encourage investors as the company looks poised to boost profits while spending money to expand into new markets throughout Europe 
Bottom Line
Ryanair is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The stock is trading at a 17x earnings  which is a slight premium compared to the rest of the  Transportation   Airline  industry  This seems to be based on investor confidence for long term growth compared to airlines such as Alaska Air   NYSE ALK    Air France KLM   OTC AFLYY    and Southwest   NYSE LUV   
The company s stock price might also seem a little steep as it just reached an all time high  But comparatively  at its current price  Ryanair s Forward P E looks cheap against where it stood as recently as May of last year 
With all of that said  now might not be a bad time to scoop up Ryanair as a continued surge could be on the horizon

Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
In this episode  Tracey is joined by Zacks Harry Kougias  who spent 4 months in Greece this year and is a Greek expat  For the third time on the podcast  he shares his observations about the Greek economy 
There are signs that Greece may be turning it around economically 
The Good Signs for Greece
In July 2017  Greece held its first successful bond sale in 3 years  raising 3 billion euros 
2017 is also expected to be Greece s best for tourism ever  Over 30 million visitors are expected this year  up from 27 5 million 2016  Some islands are seeing so many tourists they ve had to put a cap on visitors 
Popular Santorini received over 600 cruise boats in 2016  On some days  nearly 20 000 cruise ship passengers would disembark  overwhelming the small island  In response  Santorini joins other popular vacation destinations like Venice and Barcelona  in restricting the number of tourists who can enter each day 
Tourism is 24  of Greece s GDP  8 in 10 new jobs were created through the tourist sector 
But even with that success  it has been an uneven recovery  Not every island is Santorini  And because tourism is so seasonal  with many places shutting down in the winter months  it s very difficult to make a living at it 
The Bad Signs for Greece
Even with tourism soaring  unemployment remains the highest in the Eurozone at 23   For young people between the ages of 18 and 24  it is much worse  Some put the number as high as 50  
The result has been a brain drain with many young people opting to move to other parts of the EU to start their careers  It means that Greece is losing the very people who it needs to spark the economy in the coming years 
Additionally  pensions continue to be cut  putting further strains on Greece s seniors 
How to Invest in Greece s Comeback
But for every pessimist  there s an optimist wondering how they can invest in Greece s comeback 
With tourism being one of the largest industries  the most obvious investments are found there 
1       The Greece ETF  is the easiest way to invest IN Greece  Shares are up 22  year to date as some investors have already bought into the turnaround story  But be careful  as the ETF carries a lot of the banks and shipping companies in its top 10 holdings 
2       Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY   is one of the low cost European airlines that offers a lot of flights to the Greek Islands  It s a way to play the tourism trade 
3       Royal Caribbean   NYSE RCL   is cashing in on the popularity of cruises worldwide  but the Mediterranean is certainly high on many lists  And as the Eurozone economy improves  more consumers will want to travel 
4       Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   is an online travel agency but it also owns HomeAway  the popular home rental company  Greeks have figured out that renting their homes to vacationers is a good way to earn some extra cash 
5       Priceline   NASDAQ PCLN   is one of the largest vacation booking companies in the world  It s off its highs and trading with a forward P E of 24 
Is Harry optimistic this year  or pessimistic  about the Greek economy and turnaround

30222,251737,RYAAY,Delta  DAL  To Call Off Guam Japan Flights On Soft Demand,opinion,"According to a report appearing in the   Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   will no longer operate flights connecting Guam and Japan from January  2018  Lackluster demand for air travel on the route has made it financially unviable for Delta  Consequently  the Atlanta  GA based carrier decided to terminate service  Following Delta s decision  United Airlines  which is owned by United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    is the sole U S   based company to operate flights on the route  Apart from United Airlines  Japan Airlines operates flights connecting the U S  island territory to Japan s Narita airport Is North Korea s Missile Threat Responsible The above route had become all the more unfriendly for air travel  thereby denting Delta s profits following North Korea s threat to attack Guam  The threat and the resultant tensions had caused low cost carrier Hong Kong Express Airways postpone flights on the Japan Guam route until next summer  North Korea has  in fact  fired couple of missiles over Japan 
In fact  Delta s decision to withdraw service deals a further blow to the already struggling tourism industry in Guam  Travellers from the Land of the Rising Sun have mostly avoided Guam  following the missile threats  This is further substantiated by the fact that Japanese cancellations accounted for most of the 7000   tours to Guam that had been called off in August  The tours were of varying nature ranging from educational trips to those for business purposes  The cancellations caused Guam s tourism sector substantial losses in August

30224,251739,RYAAY,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Delta Air Lines  United Continental Holdings  American Airlines Group  GOL Linhas And Ryanair Holdings,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 9  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Airlines  Part 2  including Delta Air Lines  NYSE   NYSE DAL        United Continental Holdings  NYSE   NYSE UAL        American Airlines Group  Nasdaq   NASDAQ AAL        GOL Linhas  NYSE   NYSE GOL       and Ryanair Holdings  Nasdaq   NASDAQ RYAAY       Industry  Airlines  Part 2Link  Even though it is true that airline stocks are being confronted with multiple headwinds  all is not lost  There exist a few bright spots that still make investment in airline stocks worthwhile  Let s delve into the details Oil Still Below  55   Financial ProsperityDespite the recent rally  oil prices are still hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  a long way off the highs of mid 2014 when the commodity had traded in excess of  100 a barrel  As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies  the lower the oil prices  the better it is for sector participants  Lower oil prices imply greater financial well being for airlines by virtue of massive savings Financial prosperity is reflected in the fact that the likes of Delta Air Lines  NYSE      have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year  Carriers have also indulged in share buybacks  which is more proof of their solid financial health Riding on balance sheet strength  some carriers have shelled out impressive amounts to employees as part of their profit sharing programs  Additionally  the robust financial health of most domestic carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving the flying experience for travelers  in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space  For example  United Airlines  the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings  NYSE       announced in July the introduction of Boeing  NYSE BA  777 300ER service  the airline s latest aircraft type featuring the all new United Polaris business class seats  to additional routes Carriers are also investing substantially toward modernizing their respective fleet  For example  American Airlines Group  Nasdaq      invested  1 1 billion in a new aircraft during the second quarter of 2017  In fact  it aims to shell out  4 1 billion in the current year for the same purpose  Moreover  carriers like Delta are looking to reduce their debt levels based on their financial prosperity Bullish ReadingsThe global traffic data for July  released by the International Air Transport Association   IATA   raises optimism  Load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  touched record levels of 84 7  in July  The upside was due to the fact that traffic growth  6 8   outpaced capacity expansion  6 1   for the month  The favorable load factor reading highlights the fact that demand for air travel is strong Moreover  demand for air freight across the globe witnessed double digit growth  11 4   in July  This was  in fact  the fourth month out of five where double digit demand growth was witnessed  The reading is well above the 10 year average growth rate of 3 1   With growth in demand outpacing capacity expansion  the scenario bodes well for airline yields Traffic growth witnessed by the industry in the first half of 2017 was the highest in 12 years  Load factor also touched record levels  Additionally  at its 73rd Annual General Meeting in Cancun  Mexico  IATA stated that airline companies are expected to be more profitable in 2017 than previously expected  IATA now expects global net profit for the industry to come in at  31 4 billion  the earlier projection hinted at profits of  29 8 billion for 2017   The bulk of global profits   15 4 billion  is expected to come from the North American region Traffic data for the first half of 2017 released by the U S  Department of Transportation s Bureau of Transportation Statistics  BTS  also highlights the bullish case for carriers based in the United States  The BTS data states that a record number of passengers were transported by U S  based carriers in the period  The reading for load factor was also favorable Moreover  the busy Labor Day travel period  Aug 30 Sep 5  for U S  airlines this year further highlights that demand for air travel remains strong  This bodes well for airlines Other TailwindsHigh labor costs have been hurting bottom line growth for airlines for quite some time  Even though such costs will remain a hindrance  the good news is that the extent of their increase is expected to decline with time For example  American Airlines predicted in September that cost per available seat miles excluding fuel and special Items  the year over year growth is likely to be around 3  in the final quarter of 2017  The metric had grown by 7 6  and 6 8   respectively  in the first two quarters of 2017  The year over year growth for this measure of unit costs is likely to come down further to less than 2  in 2018 19 Latin American carriers like GOL Linhas  NYSE      are seeing better times  buoyed by an improved economy  GOL s view for full year 2017 is impressive  We expect the company s focus on capacity discipline to result in improvement in yields  going forward  GOL Linhas holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  European low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings  Nasdaq       which is being aided by its customer friendly  Always Getting Better  campaign  unveiled a busy London schedule for the summer of 2018  amid Brexit related fears  The carrier aims to transport 24 8 million customers from three London airports   Stansted  Gatwick and Luton  With the Greek economy showing signs of revival  exciting times might be in store for Ryanair as it offers multiple flights to the Greek Islands To Wrap UpThe above commentary clearly suggests that despite headwinds  there exist enough reasons to be bullish about the industry s prospects  Its solid fundamentals  suggested by its financial strength  highlight the fact that the sector should be able to overcome the current headwinds and fly high in

30240,251755,RYAAY,Will American Airlines  Pilot Fiasco Hurt Holiday Travel ,opinion,"American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   is one of the most well known names in the airline industry  However  the company has been in the news for wrong reasons of late  Pilots at the carrier will be on vacation during the busy Christmas week  thanks to a scheduling glitch 
As a result of the computer failure  the pilots  union   Allied Pilots Association  APA    estimated that approximately 15 000 flights are likely to be affected during the Dec 17  Dec 31 period  This is because they do not have assigned pilots  It is feared that flights from some of the carriers  biggest hubs like Chicago s O Hare and New York s LaGuardia airports are likely to be pilot less  thanks to this bizarre problem 
According to a Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Finance   the Trip Trade app  which is used for assigning flights to pilots  malfunctioned due to a computer glitch  As a result of the scheduling error  the system apparently showed that the requisite staffing was available at the carrier to operate the scheduled flights during the period  even though it was not actually the case 
Naturally  the news of pilot shortage at the largest U S  carrier caused panic as the travel plans during the Christmas holiday period will be thrown hay aware in the event of the forecast coming true  Consequently  some customers had to apparently contact the carrier in a bid to get assurance that their travel plans will not be hampered 
American Airlines Swings into Action
American Airlines is leaving no stone unturned to deal with this issue of pilot shortage to avoid the inconvenience likely to be caused during the holiday period  According to media reports  the carrier had taken measures like using standby pilots and offering them 150  of their normal hourly pay in order to avoid flight cancellations during the busy travel period  In December  American Airlines plans to operate 200 000 flights 
The carrier said that apart from about  a few hundred  there are pilots to operate the rest  This was probably directed to mitigate fears of travel related disruptions among its passengers  However  the above view of American Airlines differs from that of the APA which stated that  Thousands of Flights Still Unassigned   Consequently  a conflict between the carrier and the APA on the issue in the coming days cannot be ruled out 
Also  customer related issues had hurt the industry quite significantly this year  The infamous David Dao incident at United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    which earned it worldwide criticism  was one such issue  Meanwhile  measures taken by American Airlines  substantiates the fact that this carrier is certainly planning to avoid a similar fate in the coming days  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Other carriers like Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   and Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   had also been affected by customer related issues this year  You can see 
Whatever the final outcome  the measures taken by American Airlines to combat this unwarranted crisis are likely to push up labor costs even further  With fuel costs also on the rise  the bottom line is likely to be significantly hurt in the fourth quarter due to escalating operating expenses Computer Glitches not UncommonAmerican Airlines is not the only carrier to suffer from a scheduling glitch   A similar issue in September had hurt European low cost carrier  Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY    According to a   the carrier had to cancel 2 000 flights resulting in significant customer harassments 
Technical glitches  in fact  have been a great nuisance for carriers  Earlier in 2017  British Airways  the largest carrier in the UK  in terms of on fleet size   encountered a major IT system failure resulting in cancellation of flights and untold miseries to the concerned travellers  Additionally  a  recently disrupted operations at Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    Since expenditure on technological infrastructure is a major one for airlines  their profitability might be hurt in the event of such malfunctions 
Will the American Airlines Issue Hurt the Industry s Recovery Airline stocks seem to be back in favor again  after being laid low for most part of the year due to multiple headwinds ranging from the back to back hurricanes  the devastating earthquake in Mexico and high costs 
Evidently  the  had underperformed the S P 500 Index in the first nine months of the current year  While the S P 500 index gained 11 9   the industry rallied 8 8  

However  the industry seems to be limping back to normalcy as indicated by the upward share price movements at major carriers like JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU    up 15 6   and Delta  up 9 1   since the beginning of the current quarter 
Also  the Zacks Airline industry has outperformed the S P 500 Index on a quarter to date basis  While the industry rallied 7 8   the S P 500 Index has gained 5 3  in the same period 

The Zacks Industry rank of 63 carried by the 26 member Zacks Airline Industry also highlights the fact that airline stocks are back in favor  The favorable rank places the industry in the top 25  of the 250  groups enlisted  The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there have been 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017 
The improving scenario for the airline space can be well gauged from the fact that the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely  given the industry s 200  rank only a few months ago 
However  the latest customer related issue at American Airlines might prove to be a dampener  as far as the recovery of airlines is concerned  The fears are likely to turn into reality in the event of the Christmas holiday travel plans of passengers being hampered due to pilot shortage  Naturally  investors interested in the airline space are anticipated to keenly await for updates on this burning issue 5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now

On top of June gains  the industry reached a 12 year high in traffic growth at 7 9  for the first six months of the year  The industry s first half 80 7  load factor  a full flight measurement  reached an all time high 
Overall June capacity  measured in available seat kilometers  rose by 6 5   while load factor gained 1  to 81 9  
 A brighter economic picture and lower airfares are keeping demand for travel strong   IATA s CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement   But as costs rise  this stimulus of lower fares is likely to fade  And uncertainties such as Brexit need to be watched carefully  Nonetheless  we still expect 2017 to see above trend growth  
June airline demand climbed 4 4  in North America and capacity rose 4 1   while load factor grew marginally to 84 5   Travel to North American was up  but travel to and in international destinations rose far more  
European airlines traffic jumped 8 8  in June  and the region s load factor rose 1 8  to 85 9   which is the highest overall  Asia Pacific  Latin American  and African airlines  traffic all skyrocketed over 9  in June  with Africa posting the highest jump at 9 9  
With all of this increased traffic airline companies must be doing well  right 
Airlines
Delta   NYSE DAL    Air France KLM   OTC AFLYY    Lufthansa   OTC DLAKY    and Ryanair   NASDAQ RYAAY   are all currently Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  and the airline transportation industry currently ranks in the top 7  of the 256 different industries that Zacks tracks 
U K  based Ryanair rests only slightly below its 52 week and all time high  Lufthansa currently sits just  1 below its 52 week high water mark  However  the airline industry as a whole has suffered since mid July 
Some of the biggest U S  airlines  Southwest   NYSE LUV    United   NYSE UAL    and American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL    all fell less than 1  on Tuesday as part of a growing downward trend  Smaller carriers Spirit   NASDAQ SAVE    JetBlue   NASDAQ JBLU    and Hawaiian   NASDAQ HA   also dipped slightly 
The US Global Jets ETF   KL JETS    which tracks the airline industry as a whole  fell as well  Boeing   NYSE BA   stock was also dragged down slightly along with the airline companies 
July and August flight metrics won t be reported for a while  But June flight demand  traffic  and load increases have not seemed to help airlines at the moment  So for now  investors might have to see if airline companies can turn heightened demand into soaring stock prices

30285,251800,RYAAY,4 Airline Stocks To Buy Amid The Ongoing Turbulence,opinion,"The twin attacks of terror in Spain late last week hit airline stocks hard  Though the European airline stocks bore the brunt  their U S  counterparts too felt the pinch 
In fact  heavyweights like American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   fell sharply on Aug 17  following the Barcelona attacks  Both stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Twin Attacks
On Aug 17  a van went through a crowd of tourists in Barcelona  killing at least 13 and injuring many  Such an inhuman act was followed by a second attack in the coastal town of Cambrils  located approximately 120 kilometers south of Barcelona 
 the five terrorists involved in the Cambrils attacks were shot dead by the police  Both the incidents have claimed the lives of at least 14 along with 130 others severely injured  Such acts of terrorism affected airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears 
In fact  the timing of the attacks could not have been worse as the three month period between June and August has been predicted to be the busiest one for U S  carriers in terms of air travel 
According to the forecast by the Airlines for America  A4A  in May 2017  approximately 234 1 million passengers will be transported worldwide by U S  airlines in the above mentioned period  up 4  from the 2016 levels  Notably  air travel projection for summer is of 2 54 million fliers per day during the said period 
Given this backdrop  it is of little wonder that airline stocks shed value on the news of the attacks 
Buffett s Airline Exposure Trimmed
According to the 13 F filing by Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  in the second quarter  the company reduced its stakes in three major U S  carriers 
  the Omaha  NE based company reduced its stakes in Delta  American Airlines and United Continental Holdings Inc    NYSE UAL   by 4 6   3 5  and 2 6   respectively  on a sequential basis 
Moreover  the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha s investment in low cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co   remained unchanged 
In fact  Buffett is one of the most revered investors of all times and his decision to trim investments in three airline heavyweights also points at the fact that all is not well with this key sector 
High Labor Costs  Major Headwind
With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups  it is of little surprise that costs on this front are increasing  which is limiting bottom line growth 
At American Airlines  total operating expenses increased 11 1  year over year in the second quarter to  9 6 billion  Expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 12 5   Consolidated operating costs per available seat miles  CASM   excluding special items  also rose 6 8  
The scenario is expected to be similar in the third quarter as well  Delta expects non fuel unit cost  including profit sharing  to increase approximately 4   Additionally  consolidated cost per available seat miles  excluding special items and fuel  is anticipated to increase 5  at American Airlines 
Capacity Overexpansion  Major Challenge
Capacity related woes had been plaguing stocks in the airline space for quite some time  In fact  the July traffic reports of most carriers have highlighted that such issues might resurface  Major carriers like American Airlines  United Continental and JetBlue Airways Corp  have posted declines in their respective load factors  percentage of seats filled by passengers  for the same month  The downturn was due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth 
Generally  carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth  While low air fares are favorable for fliers  it is a drag on the top lines of carriers with their profits being hurt 
Other Headwinds
Carriers like United Continental  American Airlines and Spirit Airlines have been laid low by passenger related issues this year 
In fact  Spirit Airlines has issued a lackluster guidance with respect to total revenue per available seat miles  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  for the third quarter  This was mainly due to the dispute with its pilots in May leading to multiple flights cancellations  thereby causing passenger harassment  The metric is expected to decline in the band of 2  4  on a year over year basis  as well 
Moreover  technical glitches have been a great nuisance for carriers  Evidently  the likes of Delta and Southwest Airlines have seen their operations being affected by technological problems this year  Given that technological infrastructure is a key expense for airlines  the profitability of carriers might be affected in the event of such malfunctions  going forward 
Price Performance 
In view of the above headwinds  it is of little wonder that the Zacks  underperformed the broader market in the last three months  The S P 500 Index gained 1 7   as against the industry s decline of 0 6  

Some Positives Remain
According to many market watchers  the impact of the terror attacks in Spain is likely to be short term in nature  This is in keeping with the trend that market weakness resulting from such anti social incidents is usually short lived  especially when the frequency of occurrence is rapid as has been the case of late 
Notably  the recent forecast by A4A on the upcoming Labor Day travel period  Aug 30 Sep 5  has highlighted the fact that U S  carriers will make hay during the period with approximately 16 1 million passengers expected to avail services of the U S  airlines  Travel demand is projected to increase 5  on the back of low air fares and improving disposable income  The improving unit revenue scenario is another positive for airlines 
Furthermore  the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 50  out of 265 groups  carried by the 22 member Airline industry highlights the fact that there are still reasons to be positive on the sector despite some hiccups  In fact  the airline industry falls under the broader  sector  one of 16 Zacks Sectors   The favorable rank places the companies in the top 20  of the Zacks industries 
We put our X industries  all 265 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1

How to Pick Winners 
The above commentary clearly reflects that despite headwinds all is not lost for airline stocks and there exists few hidden gems in the space which investors can unearth  In fact  the stocks have the potential to generate handsome returns 
However  given the vastness of the airline space  it is by no means an easy task to identify the few bright spots  We have utilized our   to pinpoint such stocks  The Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy

30286,251801,RYAAY,C H  Robinson Hurt By Multiple Headwinds  Time To Dump ,opinion,"Shares of C H  Robinson Worldwide   NASDAQ CHRW   have struggled this year  underperforming the  it belongs to  The stock has been down 7 3  against its industry rally of 10  on a year to date basis 

 
Why the Decline 
Last month  the company reported lower than expected earnings per share in the second quarter 2017  Moreover  the bottom line decreased 22  year over year due to higher costs and lackluster performance of the truckload division 
Total operating expenses increased 8 7  year over year to  391 97 million  resulting in an operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue  of 68 3  compared with 60 7  in the year ago quarter  High costs are likely to hurt the bottom line in the near term as well 
In fact  the truckload segment performed miserably in the second quarter with segmental net revenues declining 14 3  year over year  Also revenues at the intermodal segment decreased 7 9  year over year as the presence of alternative lower cost trucks hurt Intermodal opportunities  
We remain concerned about the company s high debt levels  The company exited the second quarter of 2017 with only  273 2 million of cash and  750 million of long term debt compared with  500 million recorded at the end of 2016  Also  C H  Robinson is liable to be hurt by adverse foreign exchange movements as it operates globally 
Certainly Not a Broker Favorite
Downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism in a stock s prospects  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings has moved down 11  to 81 cents per share in the last two months due to multiple downward revisions  For full year 2017  the same descended 9  in the identical period to  3 25 per share 
Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers  it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions  In fact  the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock 
Additionally  the stock has an unattractive  of C  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores 
In Conclusion
Taking into account the above mentioned headwinds and the unfavorable readings  we advise investors to get rid of the stock at the moment  Currently  the company s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  also suggests the same

30338,251853,RYAAY,4 Airline Stocks That Outperformed The Industry In May,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that the airline stocks reported mixed results in the first quarter of 2017  Even though a fair share of sector participants came out with better than expected earnings per share  bottom line growth was negligible due to high costs  Moreover  with many airline players inking labor deals  it was of no surprise that the surge in labor costs hurt the bottom line 
Bulk of the reports was out in the month of April  Apart from the mediocre earnings performance  many airline stocks led by United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   encountered serious customer related issues  Notably  these factors led to the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of a mere 2 6  in April 
Improved Performance in May 
Despite disappointing performance in April  airline stocks gained significantly in May on the back of several positive factors  
Bullish Unit Revenue Forecasts
It is no secret that stocks in the airline space had been hurt by unit revenue issues  However  things on that front have been improving lately  The month of May also saw bullish updates on this closely watched measure 
While announcing its April traffic report last month  American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   raised its views on total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenues  for the second quarter of 2017  TRASM is projected to increase in the band of 3 5  to 5 5  on a year over year basis  old guidance had hinted at growth in 3  to 5  range  
Low cost carrier JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   followed suit and raised its second quarter forecast for the metric  The carrier expects revenue per available seat mile  RASM  for the second quarter of 2017 to grow in the band of 4 6   the previous guidance hinted at year over year growth in the band of 3 6  for the same period  
The good news does not end there  because this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  carrier also added that the outlook on RASM for the third quarter has substantially improved since the first quarter conference call in April 
Investor Friendly Measures
The month of May also saw airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   hiking their respective quarterly dividend payouts apart from announcing fresh buyback plans 
Delta raised its quarterly dividend to 30 5 cents per share  annualized  1 22 per share   representing an increase of 50 6  over the previous payout of 20 25 cents per share  annualized 81 cents per share   Additionally  the Atlanta  GA based carrier s board of directors cleared a new  5 billion share buyback program  The new share repurchase plan is expected to be completed by June 2020 
Close on the heels of Delta s quarterly dividend hike  the Dallas  TX based Southwest Airlines announced a dividend raise along with a new share repurchase program worth  2 billion 
In fact  this low cost carrier raised its cash quarterly dividend to 12 5 cents per share  50 cents per share annualized   representing an increase of 25  over the previous quarterly payout of 10 cents per share  40 cents per share annualized     
A4A s Bullish View 
The bullish view of Airlines for America   A4A     the largest airline trade association in the U S    regarding air travel for the summer season was another positive incident to have taken place in May 
The organization has predicted that the three month period  Jun1  Aug 31  will be the busiest for U S  carriers in terms of air travel  Strong demand for travel on the back of an improving economy is expected to drive passenger volumes to an all time high 
Moreover  the volume  234 1 million  is likely to be 4  higher than the year ago figure  We also note that  the air travel projection for the summer season translates into 2 54 million fliers per day  during the said period  Apart from an improving economy  consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans taking vacations  Read More    
Other Tailwinds
Late last month  members of OPEC and some non OPEC producers announced their decision to extend the current level of production cut until the first quarter of 2018  The decision disappointed investors leading to a drop in oil prices below the  50 a barrel mark  This  airline stocks as lower oil prices mean good news for airline stocks 
Moreover  in the same month it was revealed that Warren Buffett  founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   increased his stakes in American Airlines and Southwest Airlines in the first quarter of 2017 by 8  and 10   respectively  We believe that as Buffett is one of the most revered investors of all times  his continued efforts to root for airline stocks is a major positive for the sector 
Stocks that Outshined the Industry
In view of the above positives it is of little wonder that the Zacks Transportation Airline industry doubled its gain in May compared with the level in April  However  there are certain players in the space who performed even better 
We note that with a plethora of stocks present in the airline space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to pinpoint potential outperformers  This is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy

30367,251882,RYAAY,IATA Lifts 2017 Profit View On Higher Demand  5 Solid Picks,opinion,"The airline industry received encouraging news when the International Air Transport Association  IATA  increased its projection for 2017 global net profit for the industry by 5 4  to  31 4 billion  At its 73rd Annual General Meeting in Cancun  Mexico  the research firm said that despite the rising fuel prices and labor costs  airline companies are expected to be more profitable in 2017 than previously expected 
Why the Higher Forecast 
According to the revised forecast  air travel growth of 7 4  is expected in 2017  earlier forecast was 5 1    The improved demand scenario is anticipated to result in 4 1 billion passengers taking to the skies in 2017  275 million passengers more than 2016 levels   In the event of this forecast coming true  2017 would witness the highest year over year growth 
In fact  average passenger load factor    of seats filled by passengers  is projected to exceed the 2016 levels of 80 3  by 30 basis points  The increase in load factor implies that traffic growth is likely to exceed the anticipated capacity expansion in 2017 
Not only is the IATA bullish about passenger demand  it paints a rosy picture for cargos as well  According to the report  cargo demand is projected to grow 7 5  in 2017 over 2016 levels  The revised projection is well above the 4  growth expected earlier and the 3 6  realized in 2016 
The above bullish projections have led to the IATA expecting the top line to come in at  743 billion for 2017  which compares favorably with the earlier forecast of  736 billion and the 2016 figure of  705 billion 
The bulk of the global profits   15 4 billion  are expected to come from the North American region  The other regions  namely  Asia Pacific  Europe  Latin America and Middle East are expected to generate post tax net profit of  7 4 billion   7 4 billion   0 8 billion and  0 4 billion  respectively  African carriers are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2017  suffering losses to the tune of  0 1 billion 
Higher Costs Pressurizing the Bottom Line
Even though the forecast on revenues is a bullish one  the scenario is not so with respect to the bottom line  This is due to higher fuel costs and labor expenses  Average oil price for 2017 is expected to be  54 per barrel for Brent Crude  the comparable figure in 2016 was  44 6 per barrel   With most airlines including heavyweights in the US aviation space like American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   inking labor deals  it is of little surprise that labor costs are surging  IATA expects unit labor costs to increase by approximately 3  in 2017 
The research firm has also predicted that airline companies will earn  7 69 per passenger in 2017 compared with  9 1 in 2016  Global net profit margin is expected to decline to 4 2  in 2017 from 4 9  a year ago  In fact  it is due to higher costs that total net profit  despite the upward revision  is projected to come in below 2016 levels of  34 8 billion

The recent impressive performance of the stock marks a solid turnaround from the Apr 9 incident on flight 3411 at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  The well documented  passenger dragging  incident earned the company criticism from all quarters across the globe 
Turnaround Efforts Impressive
Notably  the company has left no stone unturned to restore its battered image  It has refunded to all the 70 passengers on board the infamous flight  Moreover  CEO Oscar Munoz has issued multiple apologies 
The carrier also changed its policy on crew booking to avoid repetition of the incident  United Continental announced 10 measures like limiting the use of law enforcement for safety and security issues to improve the flying experience of travellers as well  In fact  the efforts found favor with investors as reflected by the northward movement of the stock price lately 
Strong Q1 Results   A Key Catalyst
United Continental released impressive first quarter results on Apr 17  when it was still reeling from the infamous incident  In addition  the company reported better than expected earnings per share and revenues in this background  providing the much needed relief to the battered stock 
Moreover  revenues expanded 2 7  on a year over year basis  While  passenger revenues increased 2 6  to  7 174 million  cargo and other revenues increased 13 4  and 1 5   respectively  thereby boosting the top line  In fact  the carrier has a solid earnings history outshining the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters 
We are impressed by the carrier s guidance for passenger unit revenue in the second quarter 2017  While  United Continental expects the metric to increase in the band of 1  to 3   it projects pre tax margin  adjusted  in 10  12  range in the quarter  
Other Impressive Factors
Apart from the strong earnings report  United Continental s efforts to reward shareholders raise optimism  In the first quarter of 2017  the carrier bought back  313 billion of its common stock  As of Mar 31  2017  the company had  1 5 billion remaining under its current buyback program 
The carrier s April traffic report is also impressive  Consolidated traffic  measured in revenue passenger miles  increased 7 4  year over year to 17 6 billion driven by impressive results on the international as well as domestic front  Load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  increased 260 basis points to 83 1  in Apr 2017  as capacity expansion  4   was outweighed by traffic growth 
The company s expansion related efforts also raise optimism  Evidently  the company announced its decision to boost its service connecting San Francisco to other multiple destinations recently 
The above bullish factors are reflected in the company s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   implying that it is expected to outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months  You can see  
Estimate Revisions
Upward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock s prospects  United Continental scores impressively on this front as well with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter climbing 1 4  over the last seven days to  2 20 per share  Similarly  Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 14 5  to  7 19 per share for full year 2017 in the same time span 
Additionally  United Continental s trailing 12 month return on equity  ROE  supports its growth potential  The company s ROE of 30 6  also compares favorably with ROE of 29 8  for the Zacks categorized Transportation Airline industry 
Other Stocks to Consider
Apart from United Continental  investors interested in the airline space may also consider Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA    Deutsche Lufthansa   OTC DLAKY   and Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY    All three stocks possess the same bullish rank as United Continental 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 8 1  to  5 19 per share for the current year at Hawaiian Holdings over the last month

30434,251949,RYAAY,American Airlines TRASM Improves Even As Costs Woes Stay,opinion,"Shares of the Fort Worth  TX based American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   have rallied 10 3  in the last one month comfortably outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 1 4  

Let s Delve Deeper
The stock has been boosted by the improving trends with respect to unit revenues  American Airlines expects to perform well on the unit revenue front for the rest of 2017  While announcing its April traffic report last month  the carrier raised its views on total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenues  and pre tax margin  excluding special items  for the second quarter of 2017  TRASM is projected to increase in the band of 3 5  to 5 5  on a year over year basis in the second quarter  old guidance had hinted at growth in 3  to 5  range   
Notably  the company had performed well in the first quarter as well with respect to TRASM  In fact  the metric had improved 3 1  in the quarter  In fact  this was the second successive quarter in which the metric grew on a year over year basis  since the fourth quarter of 2014   Pre tax margin  excluding special items  is now expected in the range of 12  to14   old guidance  11  to 13   
Also  the company s efforts to expand are quite impressive  To this end  American Airlines purchased a minority stake in China Southern Airlines   NYSE ZNH   earlier this year  We believe the move to expand in China is a prudent one  as this country is anticipated to become the largest aviation market by 2024  Additionally  American Airlines  efforts to reward shareholders raise optimism in the stock  Attempts to modernize its fleet are encouraging as well 
Evidently  these bullish factors have contributed to the Zacks Consensus Estimate climbing 4 4  in the last month to  1 66 per share 
However  escalated costs are expected to limit bottom line growth in the second quarter of 2017 similar to the previous quarter  The recent labor deals inked by the company have resulted in a surge in labor costs  Also  the wage hike announcement for pilots and flight attendants in Apr 2017 is likely to pressurize the bottom line further   In a bid to match the industry leading levels in this respect  the carrier offered its pilots and flights attendants a pay rise to the tune of approximately 8  and 5   respectively  Apart from escalating labor costs  the increase in fuel expenses is also expected to dampen bottom line growth 
Consolidated CASM  excluding special items and fuel  for the second quarter is anticipated to increase 7   CASM  mainline  is expected to grow in the band of 6  to 8   On the regional front  it is projected to grow in the 3  to 5  range   Furthermore  American Airlines  high debt levels raise concerns 
In view of the above challenges  we would advise investors to wait for a better entry point before accumulating shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company

Reasons Behind the Outperformance
Southwest Airlines announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase program worth  2 billion at its annual meeting of shareholders  The new buyback scheme will replace another  2 billion repurchase plan which was completed recently  Simultaneously  the company increased its quarterly dividend by 25  to  0 125 per share  The new dividend will be paid on Jun 28  2017  to shareholders of record as of Jun 7 
In fact  the company has an impressive history of rewarding shareholders  Evidently  the company returned  673 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter of 2017 
We are also impressed by Southwest Airlines  employee friendly approach  In Feb 2017  the carrier paid  586 million to its employees as part of its profit sharing plan for 2016  This is the 43rd consecutive profit sharing arrangement at Southwest Airlines  In fact  the payment in 2016 equates to approximately 13 2  of each employee s earnings in the year

30543,252058,RYAAY,3 Airline Stocks To Buy Despite Ongoing Industry Turbulence,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that stocks in the airline space are undergoing troubled times  being confronted with multiple headwinds  The performance of the players in the space in the Q1 earnings season further corroborates the above statement 
Lowered Bar Facilitates Earnings Beats
Despite the headwinds  the Q1 earnings season did see quite a few airline players including heavyweights like Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   outperforming on the bottom line front  All the above mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank   3  Hold   You can see  
The conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to multiple downward revisions facilitated the earnings beats  For example  the Zacks Consensus for the first quarter of 2017 at Delta Air Lines was 57 cents per share which was much less than the year ago figure of  1 18  Naturally  the lowered bar made it easier for companies to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q1 
Higher Costs Distort Q1 Earnings Picture
Despite the fair share of earnings beat  growth on the bottom line front was hardly visible in Q1 for airlines due to high costs  For example  Q1 earnings at Delta Air Lines contracted 41 7  on a year over year basis due to higher costs  At United Continental  the bottom line declined 66 7  year over year 
With airline players constantly inking deals with various labor groups  it is of little wonder that labor costs are surging thereby hurting the bottom line  Apart from this  fuel costs too increased and resulted in bottom line contraction  For example   at American Airlines total operating expenses climbed 11 4  year over year to  9 billion primarily due to the rise in fuel costs 
Expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were also up 6 5   Consolidated operating costs per available seat miles  CASM  excluding special items  increased 7 6   Average fuel price  including taxes  increased 40 4  to  1 7 per gallon 
Increased costs are expected to hurt the bottom line of carriers in the second quarter too  United Continental expects unit costs in the second quarter to increase in the band of 4 5  on the back of higher labor costs  American Airlines  announcement to hike wages of its pilots and flight attendants to match industry leading levels are likely to limit its bottom line growth further 
Other Headwinds 
Apart from high costs  stocks in the airline space are being hurt by other issues like technical glitches and customer related issues  The passenger dragging incident at United Airlines  the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental  on Apr 9  drew criticism from multiple quarters across the globe  resulting in multiple apologies from the company 
As possible fallout of the incident  United Airlines  CEO Oscar Munoz is now no longer guaranteed to be the company s chairman in 2018  Apart from United Continental  the likes of American Airlines and Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   also grabbed headlines due to unfavourable customer  related issues  Apart from the above  weather related issues like Winter storm Stella have hurt operations at carriers significantly  thereby laying them low 
The bearish Zacks Industry rank of 189 carried by the 25 member Zacks categorized  industry also highlights the fact that airline stocks are undergoing tough times  The unfavorable rank places the industry in the bottom 26  of the 250  groups enlisted 
Price Performance
The struggles of airline stocks can be further exemplified by the chart below  showing the share prices of key airline stocks lagging the Transportation Airline industry over the last three months  While shares of Delta  American Airlines and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   have shed 4 3  3 6  and 0 2  in the period  respectively  the United Continental stock has gained a mere 0 9  in the period  The industry  on the other hand  has gained 2 4  over the last three months 

Some tailwinds Remain
Although the current overall picture is rather gloomy in the airline space  the sector is not bereft of some positives  which includes the unit revenue scenario 
In the first quarter of 2017  some carriers like American Airlines displayed growth with respect to total revenue per available seat miles  TRASM   A few others aim to return to unit revenue growth during the course of the year  For example  Delta expects passenger unit revenue to increase in the band of 1  to 3   on a year over year basis  in the second quarter  With rising oil rates  there exists the scope to raise ticket prices  thereby boosting revenues 
Moreover  the solid financial health of carriers has led to increased investments aimed at improving flying experience of passengers apart from hiking dividend payouts buybacks along with profit sharing payments  Delta recently hiked its dividend payout by over 50  apart from clearing a fresh buyback plan 
How to Pick Winners 
The above commentary clearly reflects that despite headwinds all is not lost for airline stocks and there exists few hidden gems in the space for investors to unearth  The stocks have the potential to generate handsome returns 
However  given the vastness of the airline space and with most stocks struggling  it is by no means an easy task to identify the few bright spots  We have utilized our   to pinpoint such stocks  The Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorHello and welcome to the Ryanair Q3 results conference call   Operator Instructions  Today  I m pleased to present Michael O Leary  CEO  Please go ahead with your meeting Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Good morning  ladies and gentlemen  You re all welcome to the Ryanair Q3 results conference call  You would have seen this morning  we    on the website  we listed the Q3 results press release  The slide presentation is there  There is a video MD A and also the written MD A  So I ll take all that as read and we ll shoot straight through to questions    Q A A couple of quick themes  obviously  the headline number is that the Q3 has performed strongly  That mirrors the earnings upgrade that we issued in the first or second week of January  The Q3 profit went from a loss of EUR66 million last year to a profit of EUR88 million this year  Really  most of the impact there was the stronger Christmas and New Year holiday booking period  Forward bookings remained about 1  stronger booked than they were this time last year  Strong ancillary sales continue  thanks to great work at Labs that they re doing on increased personalization and more and more customers continuing to take up optional reserved seat priority boarding services Unit costs remained particularly strong  up only 1  in the quarter  despite the fact that we expected to be operating some 20 or 30 MAX aircraft during this quarter  Without those aircraft  which were key to that cost reduction  we still delivered unit cost of up just 1  excluding fuel  which I think is the stellar performance in the quarter  particularly against our    the peer airlines in Europe  Key as well to that has been a much stronger performance  Our on time performance has significantly improved  We re typically now averaging 90   and that is translating into much lower EU 261 claims and complaints There is a couple of key issues I know will come up in the Q A  so I thought I might try and head them off first  On the MAX aircraft  we ve now accepted    we had a meeting with Boeing in Chicago two weeks ago  We now accept it s highly unlikely we will get any of the MAX aircraft in advance of the peak summer months of July and August  and therefore  we deferred the first of our MAX deliveries until September October at the earliest  Boeing s best guess now is that the MAX will be back    the grounded MAX in North America will be back flying hopefully by the end of June  early July  But it will take at least another two months for our aircraft  the MAX 200  to be approved and delivered Even when it is delivered  I think the delivery rate is going to be slower than historically  Boeing are going to slow down the production rates  They re not going to carry forward defects down to production line  which I think is the right thing to do  We ve seen a lot of delivery issues with some of our more recent aircraft  And I think Boeing s focus on quality of the aircraft is the right one  once they ve got the MAX back in service  What that means for us is obviously much slower growth in FY  21  We now expect very modest growth through December of 2020  In fact  Lauda will probably account for most of our growth this summer It also means we re going to slow down our original kind of growth expectation  which is we would grow to 200 million passengers by FY  24  That now will run one or two years later than that  depending on the timing of deliveries  But for the    kind of the back of the envelope assumption at the moment is that our deliveries will all move back by at least 12 months  We re originally supposed to take five aircraft in advance of summer   19  then 50 aircraft before summer of  20   21   22   23  It s now likely we will only get  we think  50 aircraft in advance of summer  21   22   23   24  which will mean our 200 million passenger target will now move out 12 to 24 months into FY  25 or FY  26  There is no point in wasting any further time on that issue  We won t have any further color on it until we get the final    Boeing are able to get the MAX aircraft back in the air  return to service  And we have a firm date for the delivery of the first MAX 200  then we ll sit down with Boeing  redo the schedule    delivery schedule  based on what they can achieve  and then we will update the market with our traffic growth at that time  But what it means  certainly for next    this year and next year is slower traffic growth  That s probably good for underlying yields since we are the one who deliver    we re the airline that grows most and fastest in Europe  And when we re growing slower  there s probably upward momentum on our fares and yields and less capacity pressure in Europe  particularly as you have the other failures  the Thomas Cooks  the Adrias and those  and we think there will be more to come I want to touch briefly on the Flybe rescue in the UK  which is a patent breach of state aid rules and competition rules  There are no circumstances under which the UK government should be bailing out what has been a chronically loss making airline for the last 20 years  It is now owned by a bunch of billionaires  including Branson  Delta  a venture capital company in the US  They bought it for only GBP2 million last year  And if they don t want to put their hands in their pockets and give it a GBP100  Phonetic  million  which is chump change to these guys  there is no way the UK government should be intervening and lending money to an airline that can t make money because it can t compete in the    at the regional UK airports with the Ryanairs  easyJets  Wizz  Jet2s and others  This is reminiscent of bailing out British Leyland in the  70s  It was a stupid idea in the 1970s  and it s an equally stupid idea now in the 2020s The fact that Virgin and their shareholders appear to be switching the Heathrow slots  the valuable Heathrow slots presumably at no cost into Virgin  Delta and others  while Flybe s valuable Heathrow routes are transferred to Gatwick where they have no connectivity shows that the British government is just being gamed by these billionaires  And if they had brains or balls  they d tell Branson to go and write the check himself instead of bailing it out themselves  So we will continue to viciously oppose the Flybe state aid anti competition bailout  It s a disgrace and shouldn t take place On Brexit  obviously  they    Brexit has now happened  Nothing will change until the end of December of this year  Although the mute  Phonetic  music in the background is negative  the British are talking tough about non alignment and all the rest of it  in which case  that will be a negative certainly for the airline industry and for an agreement  the continuation of the Open Skies regime  I assume  at some time by middle of the year  the British will have to talk somewhat less tough as they don t have much of a negotiating position  but it s an area that I think investors should continue to keep a wary eye on  We ll have much more clarity on it by the time we get to the end of June  which would be the kind of deadline for the British successfully concluding these genius negotiations they re proposing Lastly  coronavirus  again  I think it s useful at the moment in that it will help to temper some of the irrational exuberance that is beginning to build in the    in the airline sector on fares and yields into the summer  We should be cautious  Yes  we ve had a very good run through Q3  Q4 looks reasonably OK  although there is no Easter at the end of Q4  Into the summer  I think all the trends are generally positive  but I would say mildly positive  And I know there would be a lot of analysts out there going it will be strongly positive There is a risk at the moment that the coronavirus could spread to Europe  We ve seen even this morning some people on short haul flights between Ireland and the UK wearing bloody face masks as if it made any difference to them  And I would just be cautious  Longer term  we don t think the coronavirus will have any impact whatsoever  Our experience with the SARS and the avian bird flu five  six years ago was that actually it was mildly good for the short haul business here in Europe  More people were likely to holiday in Europe rather than traveling long haul to Asia  etc  and we would think that will play out again  But we should be wary on the short term impact Other than that  fuel continues to be slightly weaker than normal  We are very pleased to have hedged out our 90  for the next 12 months at just over  60 per barrel  That would be a very significant fuel saving  even allowing for volume growth at ETS next year of something of the order of about EUR150 million  We are beginning to hedge out into FY  22 at the moment at prices that are near around  56   57 per barrel  I would be generally of the view that fuel is likely to kind of fall further rather than rise  but that can always be overtaken by political considerations  So our focus on the moment and certainly by the time we get to the full year results in May would be to have a modest portion  30   40  of each of the four quarters of FY  22 hedged away  But I wouldn t be in any  Indecipherable  to hedge away 90  because we just need to guard against falling fuel prices Other than that  I know everybody will be on the call  please don t ask us the same two stupid questions  what the Q4 yield is going to be  we don t know  and what the summer 2020 yield is  we don t know  We think there is probably modest upside in the yield outlook at the moment  given the capacity constraints  But if there were to be any severe outbreak of coronavirus here around Europe  again  we should be cautious at the moment  If the reality turns out to be better than we expected  then it will translate directly to an improved bottom line  but I don t think    it s too early in the year for us to be forecasting a better bottom line Other than that  we will continue to manage costs closely  I know  based on the published results now  our unit costs are 24  lower on a per passenger basis than Wizz who claim to have lower cost than us  but then they re clearly mathematically challenged  And we are 44   on a per passenger basis  lower than easyJet  And we will continue to use that cost advantage to roll out the successful low fares formula across Europe where nobody else is able to compete with us Neil  anything you want to add to that before we open up for Q A Neil Sorahan    Group Chief Financial OfficerSo the only area we didn t cover was the balance sheet  which is in a very good shape  We ve returned over EUR440  Phonetic  million to shareholders through the buyback  the EUR700 million buyback  We re extending that out now to the end of July  And our key focus over the next kind of 12  18 months will be the repayment of maturing debt  We ve got about EUR1 3 billion of debt with coupons around 2  maturing  So we d strengthen up the balance sheet more  take some of the cost off the P L  and as Michael said  the cost leadership remains supreme Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerGood  Okay  right  let s go to Q A  And we re going to restrict everybody two questions please Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Roeska from Bernstein Research  Please go ahead Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerDaniel  hi Daniel Roeska    Bernstein Research    AnalystGood morning  gentlemen  Firstly  on the delay of the 200 million passenger target  how does that impact your thinking around the EUR2 billion profit goal  Is that still achievable by  24  And what would make up the shortfall  And then secondly  maybe more broadly  not specifically on your capacity  but as you mentioned earlier  slower growth translates into better fares  Once the MAX is back and we re back to normal in the sector  would you want to go back to your old high growth load active approach  Or given the slower macro environment  are you actually kind of thinking a little bit differently about growth into the next three to five years possibly this time Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Can I take the second one first  As soon as the MAX is delivered  we ll take as many of them  We ll take 50 in a year  We have no intention of moving away from our load factor active  price passive  We are the dominant    we re not dominant  but we are certainly head and shoulders above every other airline in Europe  What they    some of the analysis of this growth omits the relevant fact that actually the MAX 200s will significantly lower our unit cost going forward for the next four or five years and will widen the cost gap between us and our competition  And there is no point in having cost leadership over the competition unless you use it to take more market share and push others out of the way I ll give you an example of that  even today  with the announcement that easyJet are withdrawing more capacity from Vienna where the competition led by Lauda is getting a bit too intense for them  that is being replicated all over Europe  I d draw attention to Wizz s more recent comments where they don t like competing in Central Europe  They want to go off to further east  down into the middle east because Europe is just a market share play  If we look at the market share play  we ll be the ones taking the market share because we have lower costs The kind of lazy analysis that we should all just    Ryanair should just stop growing and we just start making out on higher fares and bigger margins is ultimately doomed to fail because you are inviting somebody else to come in with additional lower capacity and ultimately damage our margins  We will always expand capacity where that capacity will lower our unit cost because if we can lower our unit costs  it gives us a further and enabling advantage over all competition I m not overly wedded to the EUR2 billion profit forecast  It will happen sometime before or after we get 200 million passengers a year  but only in a couple of years where we have reasonably steady state fuel  The challenge we have    I mean  I think our    the steady state of this business should be about EUR10 per passenger net profit  It tends to migrate or move around the base when oil is volatile as it has been for the last two years and there was excess capacity in Europe  mainly from numbnuts like Norwegian expanding heroically and losing money hand over fist  That seems to have been reversed In recent quarters  we see Norwegian now reducing capacity by about 25   which is entirely an intelligent approach to their failed business model  But much more fundamentally  even euro could    Eurowings  Lufthansa are taking out a lot of short haul loss making capacity in the German Austrian market  and that s something we haven t seen before  The fact that they re closing the seven aircraft base in Vienna this summer  I think  is a very significant structural shift by Lufthansa  who in the past would have been willing to lose money forever in a day to eliminate competition  And they re beginning to learn you won t eliminate Lauda or Ryanair  We have no great designs on the German market  I hasten to add  but we ll expand there slowly But we will hit the EUR2 billion profit target on what year  I m not that fast  Phonetic   It will be on whatever year we have a reasonable stability on oil  And it may come sooner rather than later if capacity in Europe continues to be constrained for the next year or two  But the downside of capacity constraint and a more benign yield environment  it would mean that loss making failures like Flybe and Norwegian and others may survive another year or two  Frankly  I would prefer to have more capacity growth and see them all jump over the cliff  which would be structurally better for the industry as it migrates inexorably toward four  five major players across Europe Thanks Daniel  Next question please OperatorNext question comes from the line of Jarrod Castle from UBS  Please go ahead Jarrod Castle    UBS    AnalystThank you  Good morning Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerJared  hi Jarrod Castle    UBS    AnalystHi  I ve got  Phonetic  two  Staff relationships  can you just talk a little bit about base closures and any outstanding settlements  how the relationships are progressing  And then just secondly  obviously in the video  you alluded to obviously all these carbon taxes  How does Ryanair think about the increase in carbon taxes versus the amount of capacity going into that    into those markets versus trying to pass some of it onto your customers  So I guess  should we see you move capacity around related to that  Thanks Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Staff relations is generally very good  Eddie  Darrell and the team  I think  have done an outstanding job over the last 18 months  We now have CLAs in place in countries like Germany  Ireland  The union withdrew their    the court claim on Friday  We re in very close    we are in close dialog with the unions in the UK  with Spain and Portugal  where we re nearly    I think we re getting close to agreements there  The deals are now done in Italy  in Germany and France  Anywhere else I m   Neil Sorahan    Group Chief Financial OfficerBelgium Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerAnd Belgium  And yes  there are base closures  But this is a reality for us  It s not because    we have base closures because we have been    we re short 55 aircraft from our original plans for the summer 2020  There is no pilot shortage at the moment  nor will there be a foreseeable pilot shortage for next number of years  We are working closely with both the unions and our people at the bases that are being closed in Spain  in Germany  in Scandinavia  We re offering pilots and cabin crew transfers to other bases where we    if those bases are being closed  So it s very much a voluntary situation  If people don t want to accept a base transfer and want redundancy  then that s fine  they can have redundancy  But we re meeting our legal obligations in all those countries And I think the lack of    I wouldn t want to overplay it  Is everything fantastically warm and friendly  No  but it s very professional  We re dealing with the unions in a very professional manner  And to be fair  in most countries  I think we have moved from being what would have been a very adversarial relationship over the last 30 years into a reasonably professional    regular meeting  don t necessarily agree on everything  but we find a way through solution with all those issues  And I think you ve seen that by the absence of any further labor issues  That s not to say there may not be some outbreak of labor issues somewhere next summer or during peak periods  but as we demonstrated last year when threatened with strikes in the UK and Ireland  we will face those down  We will not change our position But given that we are now back into    I mean  I think the strongest signal I could give you there is  we re back now recruiting cadets  We had a temporary   and we ve had to kind of slow down the recruitment and training of pilots simply because of the MAX delays  But we will be one of the few airlines here that has growth coming in the next number of years with 210 MAX aircraft on order  We have promotions  recruitment    promotions to captaincy coming through  And I would have thought the employment environment as an airline for    among pilots and cabin crew has never been more favorable toward the airline  whereas in 2017  when you had the likes of Norwegian running around offering everybody stupid contract promises of long haul  787s and all the rest of it  it got very tight    the market very tight there for a period of time On the carbon taxes  I think it s something we should be wary about  Over the medium term  carbon taxes won t alter the price advantage or the cost advantage that passengers flying Ryanair have over every other airline competitor  And therefore  not unlike APD in the past or the German taxes  there is a short term impact where the airlines have to absorb some or all of the tax increase  But over the medium term  the business rights itself  And I think we ve had significant success  but I d be more optimistic in heading off a lot of carbon taxes  The new EU Commission was very strong on taxing aviation  I think governments around Europe now  particularly  those who are heavily reliant on tourism  the Spanish  the Portuguese  the Maltese  the Cypriots  the Irish  for example  are now much more nuanced in    we re not having kind of a Dutch or Belgian tax on aviation when their aviation is a tiny proportion of their GNP  whereas the more peripheral countries  certainly in Eastern Europe  the Spanish  the Portuguese  the Italians are now much more wary  well hang on  we want to see improvements in emissions and carbon reduction  but simply taxing air travel will do untold damage to their tourism industry  And Ryanair has been very much to the fore of that  And we put the environmental policies front and center  People switching to flying Ryanair are cutting their emissions by up to 50  if they re switching off legacy carriers in Europe  particularly on short haul  And I think in    even consumers are becoming more educated that actually flying on low cost carriers with high load factors and high seat density is the more environmental way to travel  Business is bad and first is worst in terms of travel when it comes to emissions  And I think that message is getting through So we certainly should be wary in the short term of carbon taxes  But maybe over the medium term  I think it will have no impact  I think it won t impact the cost or price advantage we have against every other airline in Europe  and that is a structural advantage that many analysts keep forgetting about  I don t think ultimately it will affect our growth or our profitability Jarrod Castle    UBS    AnalystThanks Michael Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Next question please OperatorNext question comes from the line of Mark Simpson from Goodbody  Please go ahead Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerMark  good morning Mark Simpson    Goodbody Stockbrokers    AnalystYeah  morning  A couple of things  I wonder if you could have an update on the capex guidance  given the stopping of further PDPs  Ancillary  obviously  we re analyzing some of the policy changes coming into    through the last quarter  Can you give us an idea of yield management success for the ancillary  What s the kind of run rate we can think about going forward once those changes have happened  And if I can sneak a last one in  you ve talked about 50 MAX as the maximum in a year  You did change your schedule on the last financial reporting accounts  where you were suggesting maybe 60 in FY  21 and 57 in  22  I m just wondering if that 50 cap you re talking about now is a reflection more of Boeing issues rather than your capacity Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks  I ll take the last two first  and then  Neil  ask you to just update on capex  The 50 MAX is more a reflection I think now of the Boeing capacity to deliver  It s also    Boeing at one stage wanted to deliver us 90 aircraft next winter  So we said  look  forget it  We re not taking that kind of growth in an airline that has sort of 550 aircraft  It s too much and we don t think it d be a safe thing to do  I think 50 is a reasonable estimate  It also kind of has kind of a practicality in that  We just rolled back our order by 12 months If you take the combination of the backlog of aircraft that Boeing have to deliver  which is about 450  500 planes  20 of those are ours  But then  their policy    the policy of the new management team is that instead of carrying defects down along the production line  they have stopped the production line and fixed all defects where they identified them  which I think is much more    a better or a higher quality way of producing the aircraft  We don t see them returning to producing 55  52 or 56 aircraft a month for 12 or 24 months after they start production  So once they get the airplane back in the year  their next challenge is going to be getting all the grounded aircraft up in the year  then getting the 500 aircraft  Phonetic  backlog delivered  then restarting the production line  which will be lumpy and bumpy So I think we will do well to get 50 aircraft in the    in time for summer of  21 and for summer of  22  Now thereafter  I probably do want to stagger the growth ourselves  So it s a mix of both  It s    generally  in the early year or two  it s Boeing related  and then in the later year or two  it s    we don t want to be growing at kind of breakneck speed ourselves because as Europe is consolidating  there aren t that many more opportunities for like Vienna came up last year where there s a large airport with a significant gap in slots  And I think that kind of more controlled growth going forward    and then I would    remember that of the 50 aircraft we would take in  23   24   25  probably only half of those would be for organic growth  At that stage  we ll start taking out some of our 20 year old or older NGs and selling them into cargo conversion programs So we are coming to the stage I think over the next number of years where instead of growing at 8  or 9  per year  because it s a land grab and we want to make sure we grab all the land  I think you will see us grow at a slower more controlled maybe 4  maybe 5  a year On the ancillary yield management phase  yeah  that continues  I think we ll give you more of an update on that on the full year when we re on the results road show in front of each one of you  Clearly  we expect the rate of ancillary revenue growth to slow down now  as we begin to lap some of these changes this time last year  But there is more there in terms of the yield management like  Phonetic  some pricing variations as we identified how    what customer behavior is like  and that s why the ancillary revenue line in Q3 has been a bit stronger than we    than the market expected because the yield management is working well  where we ve begun to lap the introduction of some of these changes  But I wouldn t want to give any more detail on that today  We ll do it on the full year results call Neil  do you want to update on capex  please Neil Sorahan    Group Chief Financial OfficerYeah  there s not an awful lot to update  Mark  I m a little reluctant to put numbers out there at the moment  given that we haven t got a firm delivery schedule from Boeing  We will be getting into peak capex over the next kind of 12  18 months where we d see somewhere between EUR1 8 billion and EUR2 billion  But I really    I m not going to break it out at this stage until we got firmer numbers and Boeing will be ramping up their pre delivery program  We haven t paid any PDPs in well over a year at this point in time  So they will also start to get moving once the aircraft start to deliver  So a bit like the ancillaries  I d hope to be able to give you a lot more detail when we see you in May Mark Simpson    Goodbody Stockbrokers    AnalystYeah  fair enough Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Okay  next question please OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Stephen Furlong from Davy  Please go ahead Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerStephen  Hi Stephen Furlong    Davy Stockbrokers    AnalystYeah  hi  Michael  So can you just talk about the Group airlines and maybe just talk about Buzz because I know you had referenced that you re expanding outside of Poland to Prague and Budapest  And secondly  just go back and talk about Lauda expanding in Vienna and Zadar  are you happy with the progress there  I know there s a lot of overcapacity in the market or have been in weak fares  Thanks Mark Simpson    Goodbody Stockbrokers    AnalystI think so  I think Buzz has grown faster than we had originally anticipated  There s is a very good management team there in Buzz  ably supported  Juliusz Komorek  who is our Head of Regulatory  is also the Chairman of Buzz  A  they have a clean sheet of paper and they ve hit the ground running  The charter operation in Poland is doing well  It has    in fact  it s a bit constrained this year  It operates seven aircraft this year  We d probably expand that up to about 10 aircraft next year  And it is very nice piece of business that makes nice profit Buzz is expanding  though  What we did last year is  it took overall the Ryanair bases in Poland  It s now expanding to take over the Ryanair bases in the other Central European economies  mainly because we can move those pilots and off    remember our    127B  this problem we ve always had with the Irish tax on pilots flying Irish registered aircraft  By moving these aircraft out of Irish AOC and into the Polish AOC or the Maltese AOC  they move now to paying local taxes in the countries in which they live  and that s part of our commitment in the union negotiations in countries like Italy and say    Italy  Germany and Spain with Malta  But it s going well  They are    above all  so they re doing a very good job in Buzz as they are in Malta Air Lauda  to be fair  they re doing a good job on the airline side  By any commercial measure  Lauda is doing very well  Load factor is running at 94   High on time performance  We ve restructured the aircraft leasing costs this year  We were very fortunate  I think  in the last year to be able to expand the fleet with least A320s  and there is a sweet spot in the market at the moment for secondhand leased COs  Phonetic  which are a bit    are available at terrific value like  170 000   180 000 a month on a lease basis The only challenge we face with Lauda is twofold  one  we re competing in the German Austrian market where Lufthansa certainly last year were using the Eurowings subsidiary to be low cost  Indecipherable  pricing in the German and the Austrian marketplace  We will live with that if that s    the only reason that Laudamotion is losing money is because the fares are significantly lower than they had previously been or than we had budgeted  But Vienna is filling up  Vienna  now this summer    the other issue with Lauda is  we took the strategic decision last year  let s double up  accelerate the growth  even if it means losing money  And by doing that  Lauda this year will grow    it s grown from eight aircraft in Vienna last summer to 12 this winter  But it will have 18    19 aircraft in Vienna this summer  It will be the clear Number 2 airline in Vienna behind Austrian  about twice the size of Wizz  LEVEL have essentially withdrawn from Vienna  easyJet are well on their way to withdrawing and said they reduced two more    closed two more routes this morning  Vienna and one of the Italian destinies  I think Rome or Milan  But as a result  this summer  Vienna will effectively be full  It s now slot blocked mornings and evenings  And I think Lauda will over the next year or two settle down  Pricing will    kind of will come back up  particularly as Eurowings has withdrawn their seven aircraft from the Vienna market So we look at Lauda as being a structural investment in a very significant presence in the Vienna market  We re the Number 2 airline in Vienna  Within about five years  I think it will overtake Austrian Airlines and carry more than Austrian Airlines  14  Phonetic  million passengers  They won t all be in the Austrian market  And it is successfully opening a new base in Palma  This summer  they d be up to eight aircraft  And in Zadar  which was a Ryanair base  it will open up and operate  We re looking for new base opportunities at Lauda in the next year or two to spread our dependence slightly away from Vienna and Stuttgart and Dusseldorf  But it s been disappointing from a financial point of view  but it s an investment in a structurally  I think  important market in a structurally important country  And by growing aggressively  we have kind of closed out that opportunity to Wizz  to LEVEL  to easyJet  who were all talking of Vienna 12  24 months ago and now no longer do Malta is growing strongly  It will be up to about 120 aircraft this summer  and again  primarily because we ve moved aircraft off the Irish register onto the Maltese register  which allows all the German pilots and cabin crew  the Italian pilots and cabin crew to now paid their taxes in Germany and in Italy instead of in Ireland  which was very much one of the key demands that the unions were making in our negotiations with those  It means there would be less taxes paid here in Ireland  but that was an inevitable byproduct of the government s refusal to alter Section 127B  which only affected Ryanair because we are the only airline with bases all over Europe on an Irish AOC  It s regrettable  but that s    nevertheless  it was the choice of the Irish government  So they re going well  and we would expect them to continue to grow over the next year or two Stephen Furlong    Davy Stockbrokers    AnalystOkay  That s great  Michael  Thank you Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerThanks Stephen  Next question please OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Jaime Rowbotham from Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead Jaime Rowbotham    Deutsche Bank    AnalystMorning  gents  Two from me  First would be to just challenge you a little bit on the guidance for this year  which does seem conservative  I know you don t want to commit to what 4Q fares will be and I know it won t be as easy to progress ancillaries as much post the anniversary of the bag policy change  But with fares tracking up 9  in Q3 and that saw a very soft comparative on fares in Q4  something north of 4  on full year rev per seat might seem rather likely  And if you could also comment on ex fuel unit costs  it would be good to know if there s anything in terms of phasing that might make a repeat of the plus 1  in Q3 hard to replicate somehow Second one was just on the balance sheet  Neil  in terms of the focus on reducing debt with expensive historic interest rates after the current share buyback program  presumably  we should think about you refinancing that debt at better rates and continuing to use surplus gross cash for buybacks or special divis  Given that even with the eventual 737 MAX capex to assume no releveraging  I would have thought to see the Group quite quickly moving into net cash  which is surely not that efficient  Thanks Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  thanks for the question  Look  the guidance on Q4    we were surprised ourselves by the strength of the close in bookings  and it was particularly a phenomenon over the Christmas and the New Year holiday period  We don t see that translating or being as strong again through the back end of February    the back end of January  mid February into March  March doesn t have any Easter in it  This year  Easter is in the middle of April  So I think we should continue to be cautious  I don t see    we ve already upgraded earnings from a range of EUR800 million to EUR900 million  to EUR950 million to EUR1 050 million  At the moment  we re tracking bang in the middle of that figure  Now  very little you might move it up toward the upper end of the range  But very little in terms of coronavirus and security events somewhere in Europe would move it toward the lower end of that range  So this is a year for caution  I know    I think our focus today should not be on what the Q4 fares and yields are going to be  It s what the Q1 and Q2 fares and yields are going to be next summer  And honestly  we haven t a clue  But I think it s reasonable to assume that the reasonably benign capacity environment will continue to translate into modestly rising airfares into the first two quarters of next year  Could they rise by more than that  Yes  they could  We could have a bumper year next year  but that s certainly not built into any of our forecast  And this is the airline industry  Just when you think is going well  there s always some shit  Indecipherable  depends or we get visited by some kind of an unforeseen event  So  no  we re not going to give you any kind of more optimistic guidance on Q4  Everything we see at the moment shows us coming in at the midpoint of that range  which is a significant growth in profitability from last year s  even allowing for the fact that Lauda    the losses in Lauda are higher and we ve had to step up the Lauda    the losses in Lauda as well Ex fuel unit costs  again  we think we re still going to be up 2  on the full year  We don t have    and that s terrific performance  A large proportion of that cost performance was going to be    was predicated on taking 20  30 MAX aircraft  We have none of them and yet we re still able to deliver that kind of unit cost performance  And I would contrast that with  for example  easyJet  last week  unit costs up 4   Because it s a usual thing with easyJet  we don t mind the cost increase  just look to the fares or the big data capture or some other distraction from the fact that they can t control costs  In Ryanair  we control costs  This was the year where we ve had a flow through of all very significant labor cost increases  big provision on the    four additional handling to improve resilience  We ve lost    the MAX aircraft haven t come through  We ve had higher maintenance on the extending out the older aircraft or postponing the aircraft delays  And you take    we would take all that and we re still able to deliver a 2  unit cost increase  I think it s a very creditable performance in a difficult year for all airlines  And next year  we know that fuel is going to kick in a significant saving already because we ve hedged it away On the balance sheet  Neil can speak for himself  but look  on the balance sheet  there won t be another share buyback after this one for the next 12 months  We ve EUR1 3 billion in debt to repay  That debt is priced at around 2   It will have significant impact on our earnings if we repay that debt  If we don t repay that debt  we are sitting there with substantial surplus cash and we    where I have no use for that substantial surplus cash and I would rather be paying down debt  I don t want to be soaked into the situation  All companies  once they start raising bond money or they just start replacing one bond with the other bond  the debt never gets paid back  Ultimately  I would like just to be conservative  pay back the debt  We own all of our fleet of aircraft and we will still be generating very significant cash to our annual cash flows  And who s to say that we won t be    shouldn t try to be debt free in the next four or five years  which will make us not alone we have the one airline in Europe with a huge cost advantage  but we ll also be the one debt free airline in Europe  which will make us an even stronger competitor to everybody else Neil  you want the balance sheet and paydown of debt Neil Sorahan    Group Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think you covered it well there  Michael  We already raised some money this year at very cheap levels  0 65  unsecured for EUR750 million  We don t have the need to raise more or refinance the bonds into next year  Our working assumption with peak capex is that we will also pay down the first maturing bond in June  21  If we decide to go back at some stage to refinance  it will be at a time of our choosing when it s just too attractive to say no  But at the moment  taking 2  interest rates off the P L makes a lot of sense and strengthening of the balance sheet gives us more flexibility in what we do Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerThanks Neil  Next question  please OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Neil Glynn from Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerNeil  hi Neil Glynn    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning  Two from me then  please  First  Michael  just in terms of the Q A on one of the videos this morning  you talked about your four key areas of focus over the medium term  And I wanted to just touch on    you mentioned management development  And obviously  with the individual operating companies developing under your ultimate stewardship  just interested in terms of how that evolves over the medium term  What would represent success for you in terms of how you develop as the management teams of each of those businesses  Then second question  with respect to the MAX situation and the potential for compensation  just interested in your preferences  I know things are evolving  But would you prefer cash as a compensation or a discount adjustment to the current order  or would you prefer that to be taken care of whenever the next order comes Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  The management development  what we re trying to do    I think to be fair  I admire what really Walsh did over a number of years in IAG  We set up the same type of weekly management media  Phonetic  groups meeting structure now where the CEOs of the individual airlines  meet with me  the head of regulatory and the group finance function  That is  I think  resulting in much more an integrated approach among each of the airlines  drawing on who could deliver best  For example  Ryanair is currently doing    providing the ops and crew control services for Lauda  but that would move to Buzz and Warsaw in about March of this year because they have lower cost labor and a better supply of it in Warsaw  And it s easier for them where they re currently managing 50 of their own aircraft to take on another 50 from Lauda and reduce some of the dependence we have here on ops here  So what would I think would be success  I think we d be    what I would gauge to be success in that is that replicating the Ryanair formula in the other airlines over the next year or two  but beginning then to have seen more management development  I d like to see Polish people coming and taking up middle management positions here in Dublin  The same thing  Irish people go and take middle management positions in Austria  so Austrians moving across to Warsaw and to Malta  so much more kind of cross fertilization within the middle management  because it gives us scope for more promotion of kind of our graduate development program coming through  One of the challenges we ve always faced here in Ryanair is a very settled senior management team  So we don t have much kind of promotional opportunities where I think it s much easier to give someone cut their teeth  if we think there s somebody good in operations  send him over to    if there is a vacancy at the moment for a Director of Operations slot in Lauda  send somebody down there for a year or two  let him be the Director of Operations there and then he becomes a much more    he or she becomes a much more polished potential candidate for a Director of Operations slot here in Dublin  So I d like to see that management development and more and more and more mobility between the middle management positions On the MAX situation  again  we re not    I wouldn t be wedded to one thing or the other  The issue    and I don t want to kind of    I ve got to be careful about what I say here  the discussions with Boeing do not just surround compensation for our lost traffic  lost passengers  lost ancillary revenues  There s also    clearly  the MAX has suffered a significant reputational hit as well  There is no doubt we would have passengers who will be nervous to fly on the MAX when we do take delivery of the aircraft  despite the fact that we  our pilots  myself  anybody else  we all believe it s a great aircraft and it will transform Rainier for the next five or 10 years  and once is delivered  it will be as successful  for example  as the 787 was once it was back and delivered  and after the grounding with the lithium ion batteries  So I think the general discussions    and we can t finalize numbers until  again  we have a confirmed delivery date for our MAX 200s and a revised delivery plan over a four  five year period  But the general tenure of it will be  we would expect Boeing to reimburse us the direct costs in sort of FY  20 and FY  21 of lost traffic  lost revenues  some of the cost cuts or savings we would have made if we had delivered the MAX on time  but much more of our focus would be on repricing the deliveries so that I think there would have to be a repriced deliveries of the new order to reflect the reputational damage going forward  That is where I see the competition    compensation discussions moving And then  we are already in discussions with Boeing about    we have an offer on the table with them for an order for new MAX 10s  which is the 230 seat aircraft  To be fair to them  I don t think    the new management team is not yet in a position to be able to talk to us about a new order  We understand that  but we have the offering and we expect to be at the head of the queue once they get their kind of heads around looking at the delivery profile  There is I think a concern about the Boeing short haul aircraft at the moment  And I think the kind of key critical issues for the new management team at Boeing is  one  get the return to service done  two  get the backlog of aircraft deliveries out of the way  three  get the production back up and running and running well and delivering a reasonable quantum of aircraft in a monthly basis  and four  let s start signing up orders for new aircraft and responding back    Airbus have had now a 12 and 18 month kind of lead over Boeing in terms of aircraft orders  And I think the new management team at Boeing need to be capturing back that lead  and the starting point should be their bigger existing customers like Southwest and Ryanair  which would be one and two in the world  So really  we re not that focused so much on compensation  But certainly  we will be    we expect to reprice the 200 order we already have and we would expect to put in place or agree a deal with Boeing on new aircraft pretty soon after the return to service kind of has been resolved Neil Glynn    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  Thank you  Michael Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  thanks for that  Next question please OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Savanthi Syth from Raymond James  Please go ahead Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerSavanthi  hi  how are you Savanthi Syth    Raymond James    AnalystHey  good morning  Good  On the MAX  just on the training side  first question was just  you have one sim  I m guessing you re going to plan on training pilots in the bases the MAXs are going  so maybe 500  600 pilots for next summer  Just kind of curious as to just your thought process on if that sim training is going to be maybe incremental cost pressures early on next year and just how you re thinking about what that new sim training means to kind of  Technical Issues  thinking about increasing the MAX  And then just the second question  a follow up on Lauda  how do you see Lauda s kind of growth in passengers over the next few years  Thanks Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  thanks for that  On the sim training  we have two MAX simulators already in situ in Stansted  A third one is due for delivery in June  The fact that the first of our deliveries has now been postponed back to September  October means we are in a pretty luxurious position in that we have plenty of time to train MAX pilots going forward  There is still kind of a debate  though  it s not clarified yet  I think if the    on the return to service  at the moment  it looks like that pilots flying the MAX will need  if you like  an initial simulator session on the MAX simulators  But thereafter  the recurrent training can be done either on MAX on NG simulators  and that s critical  We do not want to have a two aircraft fleet here  What is    but to be fair to Boeing  they re very much of the same view  Once the initial training has been done on the MAX simulator  recurrent training can be done on either MAX or NGs  and that s critical because we don t mind training everybody initially on the MAX simulator  but on an ongoing basis  we need them to be able to fly NGs and MAX aircraft  But with a delivery starting point of September October for 200 deliveries  we have no issues with MAX training  We have two right    the three simulators in June On Lauda  our general profile at the moment  if it ll do 6 5 million passengers this year  it will go close to 10 million passengers next year to FY    probably more likely 9 million  9 5 million passengers into FY  21  And thereafter  again  because of aircraft uncertainty  I think we re looking at maybe kind of 10  growth a year over a four or five year basis  so maybe at 1 million passengers a year at new bases outside of    Vienna would be full next year  So there won t be any more growth in Vienna  We like that they    that we don t plan additional growth in Dusseldorf or Stuttgart  again  until the German market kind of settles down  But we would like to see more developments    the Palma base will grow  Zadar hopefully will grow with the summer base  We re looking at the possibility of a Lauda base somewhere in    maybe in Spain or in Italy and alternatively something in Central Eastern Europe  We would like to see the Lauda footprint of bases kind of expand slightly outside of Austria and Germany  But that again depends on the availability of cheap secondhand Airbus aircraft  and that market has tightened significantly in the last 12 months with the MAX delivery delay  Phonetic   We would expect further opportunities to open up  particularly on good secondhand COs once the max deliveries backlog has been addressed and there is reasonable kind of capacity growth across certainly Europe and the world  But that is probably six  nine months away So very strong growth in Lauda this year  That s partly why there are more losses in Lauda than we had originally forecast  because we re being very aggressive with the growth in that marketplace  But as a result of that  we will have closed up all the slots in Vienna to    Wizz I think were completing last week  they cannot get slots in Vienna  and that s essentially because we have then mall now  and we will have a position of significant strength in Vienna where Wizz  which is unable to compete with us on cost  will continue to be unable to compete with us on cost  That would leave us I think competing on very favorable terms against Austrian Airways in Vienna  whose cost base is probably two or three times higher than that of Lauda and I think over the medium term would make Lauda a reasonable prospect for modest growth but significant profitability going forward Savanthi Syth    Raymond James    AnalystIt s helpful  Thanks Michael Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Next question please OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Alex Paterson from Peel Hunt  Please go ahead Alex Paterson    Peel Hunt    AnalystGood morning  everyone Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerAlex  hi Alex Paterson    Peel Hunt    AnalystYou ve talked a lot about    or a bit about taxes  Do you have a view on whether the fuel duty exemption will be removed in the EU  And if it was  would you look to pass it on to passengers in its entirety Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerI think it s unlikely that it s going to be removed in its entirety because it s almost impossible to ensure a level playing field across Europe  That s why the fuel duty exemption there already exists  I think it s much more likely that Europe will tackle it from an environmental tax  which again    but we raised it    we already have the ETS  emissions trading scheme  which is  if you like  the fuel tax  We have APD in the UK  We have the equivalent in Germany  This year  we paid EUR640 million in fuel environmental taxes  more than 10  of the air fare paid across all traffic  I think it ll be very difficult for Europe to come up with an exemption    or to remove the exemption on fuel duties  But that s not to say they will try  Certainly  countries at the periphery  Spain and Portugal  the tourist based countries have no desire to see that kind of taxation  And the Irish tried it 10 years ago with that EUR10 environmental tax or travel tax here during the teeth of the recession and its all air traffic collapsed by 50  within two years  But I think the risk is in the short term more environmental taxes  but probably more likely around the center  economies like Germany  the Dutch  the Belgians  to a lesser extent  the French  and not having any impact on the environment or anything else  But they are economies that have very small air travel segments  The Dutch are already talking about a travel tax  but of course  exempting all of KLM s connecting traffic across Schiphol  which accounts for probably 80  of KLM s traffic  There isn t a big domestic flight schedule in Holland anyway  So it s an air travel tax in name rather than anything else  It s also a massive hidden state subsidy to the likes of KLM where easyJet and Ryanair or the people doing short haul point to point flights into Schiphol would have to pay this environmental tax  But of course  KLM would have an exemption because most of their traffic is connecting  So I think the answer to the question is  I don t think there s going to be a change in the fuel taxes  but the risk is on the environmental taxes Juliusz  anything you want to add on that in terms of an EU policy Juliusz Komorek    Group Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer  Company SecretaryJust to summarize  I think where the risk is a further tightening of the EU ETS for aviation over the next few years and new or increased national taxes  An example of it is in Austria  where I think the new government intends to increase the tax subject to going through the legislative process  I do not  at the moment  see a significant risk of an EUwide tax on air travel or the removal of the exemption on tax on fuel Alex Paterson    Peel Hunt    AnalystThank you Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  thanks Juliusz  Next question please OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Johannes Braun from Mainfirst  Please go ahead Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerJohannes  hi Johannes Braun    Ryanair Holdings plc    MainfirstYeah  hi  good morning  Two questions from my side as well  Back to Lauda  just a more general question  Lauda  Phonetic  has now been an underperformer for quite some time and you explained why that is  But still it has I think the highest cost now in the Group and the lowest yields at the same time  So shouldn t you rather shrink that business into elsewhere where profits are higher  That s the first question  And secondly  just an accounting question  I guess  for Neil  In your cash flow statement  the item trade payables literally exploded by EUR1 billion compared to this time last year  And this obviously boosted free cash flow and thus lead to your solid net debt performance  Can you just explain why that it is Neil Sorahan    Group Chief Financial OfficerSure  Mike  I will maybe take that one first Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerYeah  go ahead  Phonetic  with PDPs Neil Sorahan    Group Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s the Boeing PDPs  So effectively  while you can see the capex of EUR1 4 billion  there s an offset there on the trade payables because we re not paying pre delivery payments out the door  That will change as soon as the deliveries start to come into the fleet Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  And on the first part of the question  you re correct in your analysis  Lauda does have the highest unit costs and the lowest yields in the Group  I believe  though  the yields are a temporary phenomenon as a result of below cost selling  mainly by the Lufthansa subsidiaries in Austria and in Germany  The yields out of Palma are quite strong  I think the yields    once the capacity growth has tapered off  which it will do in summer of 2020  you re then into a much more steady state capacity environment in both Dusseldorf  Stuttgart and in Vienna  And I think you will see a very significant rise in average yields  certainly out of Vienna  once the heroic kind of growth has tapered off  And I think the very fact that you have somebody like Eurowings withdrawing    closing its seven aircraft based in Vienna is a significant indicator of what s coming  You also have Austrian Airlines losing money  I think    and the Lauda grew  Phonetic  generally under significant pressure to explain why they re blowing brains out losing money in Eurowings without any kind of structure or without any great strategy  I think it s inevitable in the next year or two  Carsten and the team in Lauda    or in Lufthansa will have to see some kind of further capacity cuts in Eurowings  which generally competes only with Lufthansa mainline  Fares in the German and Austrian markets  which have been very low for the last two years  steady themselves  and then Lauda will be reasonably profitable  I think the unit cost in Lauda will always be slightly higher than the Group average  But I expect that the yields in Lauda will also be higher than the Group average going forward and it should be a consistent deliverer of similar margins to what we deliver in Ryanair but with a higher average fare and a higher average cost Johannes Braun    Ryanair Holdings plc    MainfirstOkay  thank you Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerNext question please OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Malte Schulz from Commerzbank  Please go ahead Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerMalte  good morning Malte Schulz    Commerzbank    AnalystGood morning  Michael  First of all  maybe also a little bit on the subsidiaries or between the airlines  You do not disclose    you say a little bit on Lauda but you do not disclose maybe margins and cost levels for Buzz and Malta Air  Is it something you might take up in the future so that you see  similar to IAG  maybe on an annual basis  the performance of the single brands that you see    or the investor can see where you earn the most and where you have the highest return on invested capital  And the second question was  your tax rate in the first nine months were quite low  Is it also something that we can now look going forward that you will be significantly below 10  for the Group Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Neil  I ll give you the tax question  On the subsidiaries  going forward  let s say  we are in discussions with KPMG  there will be some segmental information in the full year results  There won t be anything remarkable in the    or differentiated between Malta  Buzz and Ryanair  It s the same aircraft  They re taking over  for example  Ryanair bases in Central Eastern Europe  So they would be consistently  I would have thought  similar or at least the differences won t be material  It s a question where we allocate some of the overhead from Ryanair DAC here  which is kind of the Group overhead  Lauda will be slightly differentiated  I m not sure whether it s big enough in this year to have segmental information  But it s likely I think Neil  in discuss with KPMG  will come out with some kind of guidance on traffic and revenues  We won t be breaking it down to unit costs and yields because that would be kind of commercially sensitive  But really  there will be no great difference between the 737 subsidiaries between them  There will be some differences in 727 subsidiaries and the A320 subsidiary  but how much of that we ll break down    we ll break down as little as we have to  but there would be some kind of segmental information  not dissimilar to what IAG do Neil Sorahan    Group Chief Financial OfficerSo just adding on to that  it s really a factor of the strict thresholds in place in which you have to report segments and the level that you don t  None of our subsidiaries would probably qualify this year  But as Michael said  we may do some more details on like Lauda  The rest  as they get bigger  we ll probably get to a stage where we have to break them out  and when we get there  we will do so  But in the meantime  Ryanair DAC still remains the main airline in the Group On the tax rate  for the first nine months of the year  we had a tax rate of about 7 5   I wouldn t expect it to be much different to that  somewhere between 7 5  and 8  for the full year Malte Schulz    Commerzbank    AnalystOkay  thank you Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerThanks Neil  Next question please OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Gerald Khoo from Liberum  Please go ahead Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerGerald  hi Gerald Khoo    Liberum Capital    AnalystMorning  A couple from me  if I can  Firstly  with the growth of multiple brands and AOCs  how would you guys be handling that when you ve got multiple brands and multiple AOCs operating in the same country with regard to marketing  perhaps with exception  Phonetic  on the commercial side  and in terms of talks with the unions on the operating side  And secondly  on the ancillary revenues  you ve talked about the sort of majority of priority boarding and seating  I m just wondering where the next opportunity is there  You hinted at personalization  Where the opportunity is there  What s the next big thing on that ancillaries  really Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerI think you identified it youself  And I think ancillaries is more personalization  which does kind of increase the propensity of people to take up those services  We kind of pack    more packaging of those services  which is helping the conversion  If there was some other line of ancillaries or a stream of ancillaries that we were planning  we d already be doing it  But we continue to look for opportunities there  But that s why we ve been kind of reasonably cautious on ancillary revenues for the next year or two  We think the big step up in growth coming from priority boarding and the reserved seating is done  There ll be a little bit of yield management going forward for the next year or two  but nothing more than that On the brands and AOCs  again  don t get too caught up with brands  We re not like IAG where you bought established airlines  Aer Lingus  Iberia  They re all different brands  They do their own different things  We are a much more operationally efficient operation  Most of the sales for Lauda  Buzz  everything  they re still done across the ryanair com website  So the sales come across the same website  The Lauda routes are    they re sold on the ryanair com website  They re also sold on the lauda com website  The lauda com website also shows the Ryanair sales  So it s really just a front end for what is a big    the Ryanair big central sales engine  Thereafter  we    the way we do see the AOCs  it does give us the opportunity for further operating cost efficiencies  The fact that we can move to local taxation  and why the unions wanted local taxation in most of the countries is because personal tax rates are lower there than they are in Ireland  Ireland has this reputation as being a corporate tax haven  but it s a very penal country from a personal tax point of view  You hit the marginal rate of kind of EUR40 000 a year and you can t buy much in Dublin on EUR40 000 a year  And it does give us other efficiencies  In a way  it s helpful in some cases where we may be closing a base because we don t have enough 737s  But if we have some more spare A320s coming out  we could reopen that base as Lauda  Lauda  we do want to export the Lauda brand the Lauda operation into other countries  So it s not very narrowly focused on just Vienna  Stuttgart and Dusseldorf  That will also bring further efficiencies in Lauda as well  For example  three of the 19 aircraft that are based in Vienna this year would be Ryanair 737s operated by Ryanair on behalf of Lauda  So I regard separate brands and AOCs as much more  A  separate AOCs that give us operating efficiency and cost reductions  For example  lower taxation  rather than separate brands  We ve never been big players of brands that are out here  The key brand here is we have lower cost than anybody else  We have better operational efficiency than anybody else  And we now have lower emissions than anybody else as well And next question please OperatorThere are no further questions on the phone Michael O Leary    Group Chief Executive OfficerExcellent  Okay  no further questions  Thank you very much for dialing in today  Again  I would just leave you with a bit of caution  everybody  against kind of irrational exuberance into Q4  There is a prospect  I think  of a more benign pricing environment out into the Q1  Q2 or through the summer of 2020  I think all of the indications we ve seen from easyJet  Wizz and others is that there is a more benign pricing environment into next summer  As long as that maintains itself  we could be set fair for a reasonably positive FY  21  But we should be  again  guard    cautiously guarded against things that could go wrong like coronavirus epidemic  We had the security incident in London last night  But I would be    we should be reasonably optimistic into the next 12 months  There are still some cost challenges out there  ATC will still be a challenge into the summer of 2020  But certainly  I think the fact that we don t have any MAX aircraft for this year means that we will have less capacity ourselves  That means  we ll be putting less pressure on everybody else s capacity in Europe  I think capacity is going to fundamentally be flat to slightly down as Norwegian  Eurowings and others cut capacity  and that should be a reasonably benign pricing environment going forward where already we ve locked away fuel into next year  We ve hedged away the fuel and secured significant savings The MAX will continue to be a slightly movable feast  We won t have any clarity until Boeing get the aircraft back in the air and then are able to deliver us MAX 200s  But I think that will be more an opportunity into FY  20  summer of  21  For those of you who d wish us to stop growing and just start screwing passengers with higher fares  it won t happen  As soon as we can take those aircraft  we will take them because they will reduce our unit costs and they will widen the cost gap between us and all the other airlines who can t compete with us on cost here in Europe Okay  Shane is here manning the phones in the Investor Relations desk today  Neil is in London doing all the PR  We re not doing a road show  obviously  I am    I ll be doing a day in    we re doing a morning in Paris or a day tomorrow in Paris  I m doing a day in Frankfurt next week  just to keep boosting the European message as we encourage our    the ADR brethren  Phonetic  to sell down some more stock  But other than that  I look forward to seeing you all in the full year results road show in May Thanks very much  everybody
