rise in loans is likely to have been low on a sequential basis for the September end quarter  Particularly  weakness in revolving home equity loans  commercial and industrial  C I   and commercial real estate loans might have offset growth in consumer loans  Also  trade war concerns have hurt business sentiments across the industries  which might have affected loan demand Notably  management s

Income  NII  Disappointing  A dismal lending scenario   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  and commercial real estate   during the third quarter is expected to have had an adverse impact on net interest income  NII   while decent consumer loan growth might have been an offsetting factor Further  the Fed s accommodative policy stance with decline in interest rates  two rate cuts   in July and September   flattening of the yield curve and steadily rising deposit betas are likely to have hurt the bank s net interest margin Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  111 billion for the quarter is slightly down sequentially  Yet  the consensus estimate of  957 million for NII reflects around 1 6  sequential growth Non Interest Income Improving  The persistent decline in non interest income has been weighing on the top line for the past few years  Fixed income trading revenues are likely to have been muted on a year over year basis due to the challenging trading environment during the quarter Nonetheless  consumer spending trend was stronger during the July September quarter  which will likely have bolstered the bank s credit and debit card revenues  In a reversal in trend  mortgage banking performance is also projected to have improved  aided by lower mortgage rates  which drove refinancing activities during the quarter Notably

with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the figure compares unfavorably with the prior year quarter figure of 20 cents Lower expenses and benefit provision drove the company s performance  Moreover  higher deposit and loan balances were a tailwind  However  fall in revenues remained on the downside  Also  decline in margin was an undermining factor The company reported net income available to common shareholders of  89 4 million compared with  98 3 million recorded in the prior year quarter Revenue Fall Offset by Lower ExpensesTotal revenues came in at  266 1 million in the quarter  down 9 2  year over year  In addition  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  267 2 million Net interest income was down 10 7  year over year to  241 3 million  The fall mainly resulted from elevated interest expense due to rise in cost of funds  partly offset by higher interest income  Adjusted NIM of 1 95  shrunk 34 basis points  bps  year over year Non interest income came in at  24 8 million  up 8 3  on a year over year basis  Net gain on securities mainly led to this upsurge New York Community Bancorp reported non interest expenses of  138 8 million  slightly down from the year earlier quarter  Lower compensation and benefits along with occupancy and equipment expenses mainly led to this downside  However  elevated general and administrative expenses were on the downside As of Mar 31  2019  total deposits improved nearly 3  sequentially to  31 6 billion  Total loans inched up 1  sequentially to  40 4 billion in the reported quarter During the quarter  loan originations for investment came in at  2 billion  down 6  sequentially  The company has around  1 5 billion of loans in its current pipeline  including  833 million of multi family loans and

year quarter  Allowance for losses on loans to total loans was 0 39  compared with 0 41  in the year ago quarter Robust Capital PositionNew York Community Bancorp s capital ratios remained strong  As

  down from 9 50  as of Mar 31  2018  Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 11 64  down from 12 93  as of Mar 31  2018 Our ViewpointNew York Community Bancorp delivered a decent performance in the first quarter  Lower expenses reflect prudent expense management  At the same time  a strengthening capital position and lower provisions are anticipated to favor the company s prospects for the near term  In addition to this  we believe its efforts to originate loans for investment will augur well for earnings in the subsequent quarters  Also  steady improvement in the economy will support the future performance of the company Nevertheless  we remain apprehensive owing to several issues  including lower revenues  New York Community Bancorp  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   New York

Citizens Financial Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Factors at PlaySoft Net Interest Income  NII  Growth  The second quarter witnessed slowdown in commercial and industrial  and real estate lending scenarios  Though consumer loans witnessed an uptrend  little support to NII is expected  Also  flattening of the yield curve and steadily rising deposit betas during the quarter are likely to impact net interest margin to some extent However  rise in earning assets is likely to boost interest income  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  146 1 billion for the to be reported quarter indicates a 4  rise from the year ago reported figure The consensus estimate of  1 17 billion for NII suggests 4 6  year over year growth Moreover  management expects 0 5  sequential average loan growth for the quarter  Further  margin is expected to remain stable or decline slightly on a sequential basis due to continued but decelerating deposit repricing Capital Market Fees to Rise  Decent equity markets performance and the central banks  dovish stance seem to have supported equity issuance across the globe  This also had a favorable impact on IPO activity during the quarter to some extent  So related fees are likely to increase Also  while M A deal value and volume witnessed a fall due to higher borrowing costs and several geopolitical concerns during

 Per the Fed s   deposits improved in the second quarter  and is likely to have aided Citizens in bagging higher service charges and fees  The consensus estimate of  130 million for the same indicates 2 4  year over year jump Further  the trend of consumer spending was decent during the quarter  which is likely to provide some support to the company s top line  The consensus estimate for card fees of  63 million indicates a 5  increase Due to lower mortgage rates  mortgage refinancing activities and fresh originations might have picked pace in the second quarter  Also  driven by the impact of the Franklin American Mortgage acquisition  Citizens is expected to report higher mortgage banking fees  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for same is  53 million  indicating considerable rise Furthermore  with decent equity markets  trust and investment services fees are expected to rise 16 3  year over year to  50 million Given expectations of rise in most components  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non interest income is  447 million  up 15 2  Expenses to Trend Higher  Despite its TOP V efficiency initiatives  Citizens  expenses are expected to increase due to investments in enhanced data

28850,250365,BOKF,Wells Fargo To Focus On Auto Lending  CRE Raises Concern,opinion,"Per a Bloomberg article  Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   plans to boost auto lending business as CEO Tim Sloan finds the commercial real estate  CRE  unit to be a concern 
In an interview with Bloomberg  Sloan commented on auto lending by saying   we ve pulled back enough and now we re going to be growing that business again   In mid 2017  the bank had reduced focus on this business due to fall in reselling value for cars  Decline in prices made it difficult for the bank to offset losses by repossessing cars in cases of default by borrowers 
However  in February 2018  Wells Fargo indicated plans to consolidate its auto lending units and put the division back on track within two quarters 
Regarding CRE  Sloan said that some deals had been insignificant  He noted that 2018 gave a good start to the business  The market at the time was enjoying benefits from lower tax rates and improved consumer spending  which made the buyers more aggressive 
Having seen so much since the fake account scandal in September 2016  troubles at Wells Fargo still seem to continue  Last week  the bank brought to the notice of the regulators that employees at its Wholesale Banking segment added or changed some personal information of clients  without their knowledge  between late 2017 and first few months of 2018 
Affected by a horde of scandals  Wells Fargo has been trying hard to control costs and concentrate on more profitable segments  In its Investors  Day  held on May 10  the bank said that it expects to reduce expenses by  2 billion in 2018  followed by another  2 billion in 2019 
We believe that Wells Fargo s impressive cost control plan will help it deal with persistent legal expenses  Also  the bank s efforts to revamp its financial position supported by lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives 
Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 2 2  in the past year  significantly underperforming the  s rally of 18 1

28942,250457,BOKF,Wells Fargo Might Be Hit With Massive Fine By Regulator ,opinion,"Per a Reuters article  Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   is likely to face penalty as large as  1 billion due to its wrongdoings in auto insurance and mortgage lending business by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau   CFPB   
Brief on the Two Frauds
The San Francisco based bank has been accused of pocketing commissions from pushing unnecessary auto policies on its customers  Per Wells Fargo s auto insurance policy terms  drivers who have borrowed money from the bank for a new vehicle  are supposed to carry a policy that would pay off the bank in case of a theft or damage  
However  the bank s employees have been blamed of forcing such policies on about 570 000 customers  who were already under coverage  Wells Fargo has blamed the third party vendor by stating that they wrongly layered insurance policies on its auto borrowers  The bank had investigated the matter thoroughly till 2005 and found that it would have to make refunds of about  145 million to borrowers and adjust account balances by another  37 million 
Regarding the mortgage lending probe  Wells Fargo was accused of charging extra fees to customers when their mortgage applications were delayed  The fees in question is rate lock extension fees  which is supposed to be charged only when borrowers fail to submit documents on time or want to retain the interest rate that initially was quoted for the loan 
However  the bank s officials levied fees on its customers even though the delay was caused by them  Last year  Wells Fargo had announced that it will refund fees to the affected customers  after a review of the matter 
CFPB Director s Motive Behind Such Huge Penalty
CFPB s acting director  Mick Mulvaney  is seeking to penalize the bank with an aim to duplicate the  100 million penalty that was imposed on it to settle the infamous fake accounts scandal in September 2016  The penalty  so far  is the highest the regulator has levied on a bank 
Also  it reiterates President Trump s opinions on Wells Fargo s misdeed  which he had voiced through a tweet last December   Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped  as has incorrectly been reported  but will be pursued and  if anything  substantially increased  I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating  
Road Ahead 
Since revelation of the bogus account openings scandal  Wells Fargo has been getting involved in a number of probes  These legal hassles are likely to keep its cost base elevated 
However  the bank has diligently taken remedial measures and initiatives to keep afloat  Also  lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives 
Wells Fargo s shares have lost 4 9  in six month s time versus 5 5  growth for the  it belongs to 

The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

28943,250458,BOKF,Can Fee Income Growth Aid U S  Bancorp s  USB  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 18  before the opening bell  The bank s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year 
Benefits of higher rates  improved lending scenario and rebound in trading activities are anticipated to offset muted investment banking performance  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  5 5 billion reflects a rise of 4 9  from the year ago quarter 
Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store  let s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter 
U S  Bancorp s fourth quarter 2017 results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income  Also  a strong capital position and increasing loans were the positives  However  higher expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues were the key headwinds 
Notably  the company displays a decent earnings surprise history  It surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 1 2  
 U S  Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise   Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that U S  Bancorp will likely beat on earnings in the first quarter  This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   for a possible earnings beat 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

Zacks Rank  U S  Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank of 3 
Though estimates for the to be reported quarter have remained stable over the last seven days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 94 cents reflects growth of 14 6  year over year 
Factors to Influence Q1 Results
Rise in net interest income  NII   Improvement in loan demand  particularly in commercial and industrial  real estate and consumer areas  along with and rising interest rates during the to be reported quarter will likely support the company s NII  Also  income from interest earning assets  average balance  are projected to rise 4 5  to  417 2 billion 
Non Interest Income Likely to Improve   Strong equity issuances along with a potential rise in fees from increasing M A s are likely to have supported U S  Bancorp s fee income  Per the consensus estimate  trust and investment management fees are likely to improve 8 1  to  398 million on a year over year basis  Moreover  the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter  which is likely to boost the bank s credit and debit card revenues by 4 8  from year ago quarter to  306 million 
Nevertheless  with the slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates  no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment  The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is  197 billion  down 4 8  year over year 
Expenses Might Trend Higher  Increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings and seasonally higher compensation expenses might escalate costs moderately

year  Moreover  the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  355 5 million Net interest income was up nearly 14 4  year over year to  241 9 million  The rise was mainly attributable to increased interest income on loans and leases  partially mitigated by decreased interest income on loans held for sale and rise in total interest expense NIM of 4 57  expanded 27 basis points  bps

accrual loans and leases  and other real estate owned plunged 40 1  year over year to  136 8 million However  provisions for credit losses were  22 3 million  up 11 9  year over year  primarily due to higher net charge offs in the leasing and equipment finance portfolio Net charge offs  as a percentage of average loans and leases  expanded 11 bps year over year to 0 38   The upsurge was chiefly attributable to increased net charge offs in the leasing and equipment finance and auto finance portfolios  partly mitigated by lower net charge offs in the consumer real estate portfolio Robust

29060,250575,BOKF,Banks Boost Payouts After Clearing Fed Tests  5 Great Picks,opinion,At the conclusion of the Federal Reserve s seventh annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review  CCAR   all of the participating banks received welcome news  After clearing the first round of these stress tests last week  the central bank cleared all the 34 largest U S  banks  capital plans  This was the first time that the Fed raised no objection to any of these plans ever since the tests were instituted in the aftermath of 2008 Great Recession Big banks promptly announced a windfall for their shareholders with dividend hikes and repurchase programs  The Financials Select Sector SPDR  XLF  increased 1 6  on Jun 28  on expectations that banks would clear the Fed s tests with flying colors  a fact which was confirmed after trading hours The day s events add to the optimism created by recent legislative developments which seeks to curtail strictures placed on the financial sector  Such efforts would gain strength now that banks have proved their financial robustness  which makes it a great time to pick up stocks from the sector Capital One Falls BehindAt the end of its rigorous capital adequacy tests  the Fed cleared the capital plans of all the banks under review except one  Capital One Financial  NYSE COF  Corporation   NYSE C   failed to clear the tests  with the Fed stating that its capital planning process suffered from serious weaknesses  The central bank alluded to the risk of losses for one of its major line of business  which market watchers believe is a reference to its credit card division Even so  Capital One has received the Fed s approval to proceed with its capital plans though it must provide a revised proposal by the end of the year  As a result  Capital One has elected to keep its dividend unchanged though it is proceeding with a share repurchase plan worth  1 85 billion Banks Raise Dividends  Announce RepurchasesFor the wider industry  however  it was a day to celebrate  Investors of Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   possibly received the greatest reward with the bank raising its dividend twofold to 32 cents per common share  Additionally  a share repurchase program of  15 6 billion was announced  which market watchers stated was the largest in the bank s history Meanwhile  JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   increased its quarterly dividend to 56 cents a shares and announced a buyback program of  19 4 billion  Bank of America  NYSE BAC  Corporation   NYSE C   followed suit  raising its dividend to 12 cents a share and authorizing the repurchase of shares worth  12 billion  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   said it would be raising its dividend from 20 cents a share to 25 cents a share and increased its share repurchases from  3 5 billion to  5 billion Banking Sector in Better ShapeThe first round of the Federal Reserve s stress tests was intended to determine whether banks  current level of capital reserves can withstand a severe recession  All thirty four of the largest banks  passed  having more than minimum capital and leverage ratios under severe adverse situations   Read   Now  the results of the second round of tests have dispelled all doubts about the health of the banking sector  This is because the 34 banks which were scrutinized together hold in excess of 75  of the sector s total assets  As of the fourth quarter of 2016  banks held capital reserves amounting to  1 2 trillion  This represents an increase of  750 billion from the level witnessed during early 2009  when the crisis intensified Moreover  banks are expected to return 100  of their net revenue to shareholders over the four upcoming quarters  This represents a significant improvement when compared to the level of 65  witnessed during the same quarter last year Our ChoicesTaken together  stress test related developments have provided the financial industry a strong reason to assert the need for removal of restrictive regulations  They would also likely add further weight to the Trump administration s attempts to undo the Dodd Frank set of reforms   Read   Adding banking stocks to your portfolios makes for a smart choice at this time  We have

29122,250637,BOKF,Bank Stock Roundup  Enough Positive Surprises In Q2 Despite Weakness  JPM   BAC In Focus,opinion,"Over the last five trading days  major banks displayed a bearish trend  Though most banks which reported second quarter 2017 results this week managed to beat estimates  concerns over the underlying weakness shadowed the optimism Results demonstrated an upswing in loans and improved margins  However  lower treasury yields curbed the benefits  Additionally  rise in deposit balances and lower provisions driven by reserve releases in the Oil   Gas loan portfolio were impressive Investment banking fees were favorable  but fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter  Also  higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume were on the downside Though the absence of exceptionally high legal expenses was a big support  an overall rise in non interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor 
 Read   Important Earnings of the Week1  Rising interest rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase   Co  s   NYSE JPM   second quarter 2017 earnings of  1 82 per share  which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 57  Also  the figure reflects a 17  rise from the year ago period  Notably  the results included a legal benefit of  406 million 
Solid loan growth and higher interest rates supported net interest income  Further  investment banking fees recorded a rise  Apart from these  results were supported by a fall in provision for credit losses  mainly driven by reserve releases in the Oil   Gas loan portfolio As expected  fixed income and equity trading slumped during the quarter  Also  fall in mortgage banking income  due to higher funding costs and decline in mortgage origination volume  was a headwind  Operating expenses reported a rise during the quarter   Read more   2  Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5 0  in second quarter 2017  riding on higher revenues  The company s income from continuing operations per share of  1 27 for the quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 21  Also  earnings compared favorably with the year ago figure of  1 25 per share 
Overall revenues escalated  driven by higher banking revenues  However  expenses surged  Further  Citigroup s costs of credit escalated largely reflecting net credit losses and a net loan loss reserve release   Read more   3  Higher interest income drove Wells Fargo   Company s   NYSE WFC   second quarter 2017 earnings which recorded a positive surprise of 4 9   Earnings of  1 07 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 02  Moreover  the figure compared favorably with the prior year quarter s earnings of  1 01 per share 
Wells Fargo witnessed organic growth aided by strong loans and deposit balances  Higher net interest income was also favorable  In addition  a solid capital position and improving credit quality acted as the key positives  However  higher expenses and lower non interest income were on the downside   Read more   4  Higher investment banking fees as well as loan growth drove Bank of America Corporation  NYSE BAC  s   NYSE C   second quarter 2017 earnings of 46 cents per share  which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents  Results included  103 million of after tax gains related to the sale of its non U S  consumer credit card business  The figure was 12  higher than the prior year quarter 
Sequential decline in net interest margin  owing to lower treasury yields during the quarter  and decline in mortgage banking fees were headwinds  Further  a slight rise in expenses and fall in trading revenues  as expected  acted as negatives  However  increase in investment banking fees more than offset these and partially aided fee income growth during the quarter 
The quarter witnessed modest loan growth  which helped in improving interest income  Additionally  provision for credit losses recorded a fall   Read more   5  Riding on higher revenues  The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE PNC   reported a positive earnings surprise of 4 5  in second quarter 2017  Earnings per share of  2 10 easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 01 
Moreover  it reflects a 15  increase from the prior year quarter  Continued growth in loans helped the company earn higher revenues during the quarter  Further  decline in provision for loan losses was a tailwind  However  the positives were partially offset by an increase in expenses   Read more   6  Driven by high net interest income  U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB   reported a positive surprise of 1 2  in second quarter 2017  The company reported earnings per share of 85 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Results also came ahead of the prior year quarter earnings of 83 cents  Rising interest rate environment aided the bank s interest income

BOK Financial s fees and commissions revenues amounted to  177 5 million  down 1 5  on a year over year basis  The quarter witnessed growth in several income categories  partially offset by lower mortgage banking  and brokerage and trading revenues Total other operating expenses were  250 9 million  down slightly year over year  The decline can be attributed to a significant reduction in insurance costs Total loans as of Jun 30  2017 were  17 0 billion  almost stable compared with the prior quarter  As of the same date  total deposits amounted to  22 3 billion  down nearly 1 2  from the prior quarter Credit Quality  A Mixed BagThe company did not record any provisions during the quarter  Also  charge offs were down 77 8  on a year over year basis to  1 6 million 
Further  the combined allowance for credit losses was 1 49  of outstanding loans as of Jun 30  2017  down from 1 54  in the year ago period

Our ViewpointBOK Financial s consistent revenue growth keeps us optimistic about the stock  Moreover  continued growth in loan balances indicates an efficient organic growth strategy  Its diverse revenue mix and favorable geographic footprint should keep supporting growth in the upcoming quarters  However  elevated expenses remain a concern

Better than expected results were primarily driven by higher net interest income  Rise in loan balances aided revenue growth  Notably  the absence of provisions in the quarter acted as a tailwind  However  the results were partially offset by an increase in expenses Net income attributable to common shareholders came in at  88 4 million  up 107 5  from  42 6 million in the year ago quarter

Our ViewpointBOK Financial s consistent revenue growth keeps us optimistic about the stock  Moreover  continued growth in loan balances indicates an efficient organic growth strategy  Its diverse revenue mix and favorable geographic footprint should support growth in the upcoming quarters However  several issues  including the stringent regulatory landscape and rising expenses  remain key concerns

29257,250772,BOKF,9 Small Bank Dividend Stocks Outperforming In 2015,opinion,"Looking for outperforming dividend stocks to capitalize on rising interest rates  As it turns out  many regional and small bank stocks and ETFs have been outperforming the S P 500 handily over the past month  and year to date 
Here s a look at how 4 of these ETFs  SPDR S P Regional Banking  NYSE KRE   SPDR S P Bank  NYSE KBE   First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank  NASDAQ QABA  and iShares US Regional Banks  NYSE IAT   have trumped the S P 500 in these periods 
Digging down further  we culled out the stocks from the universe of outperforming small and regional banks  to find the high dividend stocks within this group  As you can see  these are a far cry from the 6  to 12  high yielding stocks which we usually write about  and also track in our  
This group  BOK Financial Corporation  NASDAQ BOKF   First Community Bancshares Inc  NASDAQ FCBC   Umpqua Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ UMPQ   FNB Corporation  NYSE FNB   Chemical Financial Corporation  NASDAQ CHFC   Southside Bancshares Inc  NASDAQ SBSI   Hancock Holding Company  NASDAQ HBHC   Westamerica Bancorporation  NASDAQ WABC   First Financial Bancorp  NASDAQ FFBC   has a dividend yield range of 2 42  up to 3 53   and its Dividend Payout Ratio range is quite wide  from a low of 30 80   up to 92 60  Performance  All of these small bank stocks have outperformed the S P 500 over the past month  and the overwhelming majority have also outperformed over the past year and year to date Financials  A common trait among these stocks is that they seem to be more conservative than the large mega banks   none of them has a large debt load   they re all way below 1 00  and some of them have no debt at all  As a contrast  Citigroup  NYSE C   JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  all have Debt Equity loads of over 1 00  The smaller debt loads for these smaller banks may also be a by product of increased bank regulation  but this trait is one we often hear about them   that they re a more conservatively run group as a whole Valuations  Most of these banks  Forward P E valuations seem quite modest  in addition to some of them being much lower than their trailing P E s  which is also a positive sign that they are moving in the right direction

29258,250773,BOKF,SPX Breaks Through Neckline  Yen Continues Rally,opinion,"VIX pulled back from its Head   Shoulders neckline at 26 00 in a retracement  then broke through in the follow through rally this week  This is at the same level that VIX closed on August 21  It remains on a buy signal  NYSE sell signal   The close above the neckline suggests a very robust follow through rally next week  Although SPX closed beneath a critical level  investors are no less complacent as a week ago 
 ZeroHedge  At the start of September last year  as stocks began to ramp aggressively off the Black Monday crash lows  we unveiled a rather discomforting  decoupling  that suggested strongly  don t believe the hype  
Specifically  on August 30 we said that of all trades out there  the O XIV S P convergence trade is as close to a  no brainer  as it gets 
SPX broke through the Neckline 

The SPX declined through its massive Head   Shoulders neckline at 1887 00 and closed beneath it  Should it remain beneath the neckline  it may result in a very quick panic decline  However  should it rally above it  the bounce may last through the end of the month before declining through the neckline again  Either way  the ensuing decline may go further than many expect 
 ZeroHedge  In a time when the S P fluctuates with unprecedented velocity and investors need HFT like reflexes to catch any momentum move  this may be the most practical advice to traders we have heard today

The High Yield Index declined beneath the trendline of its Broadening Wedge and mid Cycle support at 138 64  The next level of support is the weekly Cycle Bottom support at 128 08  Once broken  the last level of support may be the neckline of the Head   Shoulders formation near 122 50  MUT is on a sell signal 
 NYTimes  The tide has definitely turned against investors in high yield debt  better known as junk bonds 
Market indexes are down approximately 9 percent from their highs of last year  Plummeting prices for oil and other commodities have done most of the damage  but the decision last month by a well known mutual fund  Third Avenue Focused Credit  to halt redemptions  has also spooked the market

 CNBC  As global stocks sell off  one overseas currency has been picking up steam 
The Japanese yen has risen 3 percent against the U S  dollar this year  and it s one of the best performing currencies of the year  According to Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management  the yen tends to outperform in times of trouble because of its widespread use as a funding currency

The Nikkei closes at neckline support 

The Nikkei appears to have impulsively declined to its Head   Shoulders neckline at 16945 00  There may be a two week bounce here before it resumes its decline  but we may need to watch how the Nikkei opens next week  If the neckline is broken  it may trigger panic selling  since the neckline represents support that held the lows for the past 15 months  A point of interest is the open gap at 16413 76 which was made on November 4  2014  It has not been fully closed since inception and a reversal gap though that zone may leave an Island formation  which may be a very strong trend reversal signal

 Reuters  Speculators pared bullish bets on the U S  dollar in the latest week  with net longs falling to their lowest in 2 1 2 months  according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday

112 4 million or 72 cents compared with the  22 1 million or 15 cents recorded in the previous quarter Note  The company s prior quarter  three month period ended Sep 30  2019  results reflect Legacy

million in the reported quarter  up 21 6  sequentially  Moreover  the top line figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  557 1 million Net interest income was up 9 9  sequentially to  408 8 million  This upswing can be mainly attributed to increased interest income on loans and leases  along with loans held for sale  partially mitigated by rise in total interest expense  NIM of 3 89  contracted 25 basis points  bps  sequentially Non interest income came in at  158 1 million  up 67 7  on a sequential basis  Rise in almost all components of income mainly led to this increase  partly offset by lower net gains on investment securities TCF Financial reported non interest expenses of  416 6 million  down 2 1  from the third quarter  This decrease primarily reflects lower merger related expenses  partly mitigated by higher compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment along with other expenses As of Dec 31  2019  total deposits declined 2 3  sequentially to  34 5 billion  Yet  net loans and leases climbed 3  to  34 4 billion in the December end quarter Credit Quality  A Marked ImprovementCredit quality for TCF Financial reflected improved credit metrics  Non

performance during the October December period as a combined entity following the merger of equals  Continued top line improvement reflects the company s sturdy standing in the market  At the same time  a strengthening capital position and improving credit quality are anticipated to favor the company s growth in the upcoming period In addition to this  we believe its efforts to reduce balance sheet risks and diversify the loan portfolio will augur well for earnings in the subsequent quarters  Also  steady improvement in the economy will support the future performance of the company Nevertheless  we remain apprehensive due to several issues  including margin pressure  TCF Financial Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   TCF Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank  3
