ahead  sir Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Hector  and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call  Joining me today are Chris Niles  our CFO  and Pat Ahern  our Deputy Chief Credit Officer  Pat is succeeding the current Chief Credit Officer  John Hankerd  I d like to begin by extending our gratitude to John for his 15 years of service at Associated and wish him a well earned retirement after almost 40 years in banking We welcome Pat to his new responsibilities and know that his 30 years of banking experience including nine at Associated will serve the Bank well  Turning to Slide 3  in 2019  we faced an interest rate dynamic that was significantly different than the environment for which we had positioned the bank at the end of 2018 Going into the year  our expectation was for two rate increases  However  as we all know the Fed cut rates three times and we spent much of the year repositioning the balance sheet for a lower rate environment  We reduced our higher cost network transaction deposits from  2 3 billion at the end of 2018 to  1 3 billion at the end of  19 and we sold  1 billion of lower yielding investment securities Aided by the Huntington branch transaction  we increased our low cost deposit mix from 51  to 56  at the end of the year  Since we couldn t control market interest rates  we focused on controlling our costs  We reduced our absolute non interest expense by  28 million year over year even while we added 14 net branches from Huntington in June We continued to benefit from positive credit trends and our overall credit metrics have remained stable as we further de risked our oil and gas portfolio  We remain committed to disciplined underwriting standards  We built capital ahead of the CECL implementation that occurred on the first of this year  while continuing to deploy capital in accordance with our stated priorities We increased our dividend by 11  and we repurchased  177 million of common stock  Turning to Slide 4  we highlight our 2019 loan trends  Year over year  we had solid growth in our commercial and business loan portfolio  particularly in general commercial lending and in our power and utilities vertical  Commercial and business lending balances were up 9  year over year despite shrinking in the fourth quarter This portfolio represents 36  of our total loan book at year end  and our largest single industry exposure remains the Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade sector  Our commercial real estate portfolio faced significant headwinds in late 2018 and early  19 from higher than expected pay down activity  However  we returned to growth in the second quarter of 2019 and are optimistic that this positive trend will continue throughout  20 Commercial real estate comprises about a quarter of our total loans and growing the CRE balances as a share of total loans is a focus of our management team this year  The CRE portfolio is well diversified by geography  property type  and borrower with about one third of our CRE loans in multifamily properties Our exposure to retailers remains very modest and our construction exposure remain near 6  at the end of the year  Our residential mortgage book was up slightly in 2019 represented about 36  of the total loan book at year end  Portfolio growth in  19 was negatively impacted by the sale of  240 million in prepayment sensitive mortgages in the third quarter  Fourth quarter loan trends are highlighted on slide 5  Our commercial and business portfolio had a challenging quarter with declines in general commercial lending  REITs and the oil and gas book  Phonetic  However  power and utilities had another strong quarter and with several credits booked late in the quarter  we expect continued growth in this vertical in  20  CRE continued its rebound with modest growth in the fourth quarter despite seasonal headwinds  Average balances in the residential mortgage book decreased in the quarter as a result of the previously mentioned sale of mortgages late in the third quarter  However  we remain Wisconsin s most active mortgage lender in 2019 and grew originations in the fourth quarter  giving us positive momentum as we head into  20 Turning to Slide 6  as shown in the left graph  our oil and gas balances decreased by nearly  100 million from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4  After wrapping up the fall  Phonetic  borrowing base redetermination period  we benefited from more credit resolutions and pay offs than we previously anticipated Looking ahead  we expect balances in this portfolio will stabilize as we ve neared the completion of the planned derisking  In the middle graph  power and utility balances have grown by  300 million over the last five quarters  we anticipate that trend will continue into  20  Our commercial real estate pipeline remains strong as seen in the right hand graph  Unfunded commitments have increased nearly  400 million to  2 billion  since the third quarter of 2018 and have risen for four consecutive quarters Looking forward  we expect to grow our average total loans by 2  to 4  in 2020  Turning to Slide 7  we highlight our annual deposit trends  Average deposits grew 3  or approximately  660 million from a year ago  driven primarily by the Huntington branch acquisition  We ve met our Huntington deposit retention goals and expect the same success with First Staunton The graphs on the right side of the slide highlights the progress we ve made in improving our deposit mix while growing overall deposit balances  At the end of 2019  our mix of low cost deposits was 56   up from 51  at the end of  18  While our deposit mix had been trending positively over the last several years  the jump in lower cost deposits we saw in  19 is a result of our balance sheet repositioning efforts These efforts also led to the continued reduction of our network transaction deposits  2019 year end balances of these higher cost funds fell 41  from 2018 and now just represents 6  of our total deposits  The remixing of our deposits contributed to the 37 basis point reduction in interest bearing deposit costs over the past two quarters of 2019 Fourth quarter deposit details are on Slide 8  Fourth quarter average deposits were down  1 1 billion from the third quarter as our funding needs declined with the sale of lower yielding securities and prepayment sensitive residential mortgages  These asset reductions enabled us to reprice certain high cost deposit categories lower  including some of our non core price sensitive depositors to withdraw funds Net outflows from time deposits and money market accounts totaled  700 million  most of these outflows were public funds  While interest bearing demand average balances were also down about  300 million  Phonetic   this was due to seasonal outflows as municipal customers to run  Phonetic  their operating accounts We also continued the reduction of our network deposit balances in the quarter  decreasing these high cost deposits by over  300 million  While we anticipate these balances may increase in the first quarter of  20 as we experienced additional seasonal deposit outflows  and we fund  Phonetic  anticipated draws on commercial loans  we expect the addition of First Staunton deposits will mitigate the overall level of non core deposits and further reduce our cost of funding While our loan to deposit ratio will remain somewhat seasonal  we anticipate maintaining this ratio under 100  funding the majority of our loan growth with core deposits and a lower total cost of deposits given no Fed rate increases  Turning to Slide 9  our investment portfolio declined to  5 6 billion as we sold securities and let balances run off to pay down higher cost funding  We decreased lower yielding taxable securities by approximately  400 million while we increased our tax exempt balance slightly Our portfolio yield increased as we retained less short duration securities and added higher yielding longer duration muni bonds  We expect our securities book to trough  Phonetic  in the first quarter and anticipate holding the balance at about 17  of total assets  Turning to slide 10  our full year net interest income was  836 million  down  44 million from 2018  and our net interest margin was 2 86   down 11 basis points from the previous year The lower net interest income and margin were caused by several factors  First  we had  20 million left in acquisition related prepayments and purchased loan accretion in 2019 than we did in  18  Second  our deposits repriced higher in the first part of  19 as they continue to be affected by the rate hike cycle that ended in late 2018  This lag effect is typical during rate cycles and often persist for some months after the final rate hike Third  our commercial loan yields were negatively impacted by Fed rate decreases in 2019  This effect was exacerbated by LIBOR to Fed funds compression as LIBOR rates decreased in anticipation of Fed action  This led to lower LIBOR based asset yields  while the rates on our Fed index funding held steady until the actual Fed action date Turning to slide 11  we highlight the fourth quarter net interest margin trends  Net interest income was  200 million  down  6 million from the previous quarter as our repositioning efforts resulted in a smaller balance sheet  However  our net interest margin increased 2 basis points from the third quarter as the decrease in our funding costs outpaced asset yield reduction The net interest margin results were driven by dynamics on both sides of the balance sheet  On the asset side  average one month LIBOR in the fourth quarter decreased 39 basis points from the third quarter  negatively impacting commercial loan yields  However  long term rates were relatively steady  reducing refinancing activity and stabilizing residential mortgage yields Our investment portfolio yield increased slightly as lower yielding securities ran off or were sold and we increased the mix of higher yielding municipal bonds  On the liability side  our balance sheet repositioning strategy resulted in lower funding costs in the fourth quarter  Total interest bearing deposits and total interest bearing liabilities decreased 25 basis points and 21 basis points respectively Looking ahead  we expect our deposit costs to continue to decline in the first quarter  although at a slower pace than what we saw in the third and fourth quarters of  19  We anticipate our asset yields will stabilize resulting in a full year  20 net interest margin between 2 80  and 2 85  assuming a stable interest rate environment  Turning to Slide 12  we highlight annual non interest income  Total non interest income for the year was  381 million  up  25 million from 2018 The increase from the previous year was driven by higher net mortgage banking income  which was up  12 million from 2018  Gains on investments also contributed to the year over year increase  We anticipate the mobile and digital loan application technology investments we made in 2019 including solutions for mortgages  consumer loans and business loan applications will help facilitate revenue growth in the coming year For 2020  we expect total non interest income to be between  375 million and  385 million excluding investment gains and losses  Slide 13  we show noninterest expense trends  Actual noninterest expense was  794 million  below our initial guidance for the year of  800 million and  28 million below the prior year s level  Controlling costs has long been a focus here at Associated and 2019 was no different Our noninterest expense was down year over year  even with the exclusion of acquisition and restructuring related costs  which were elevated in 2018  The year over year decrease was achieved despite the additional operating expenses of the Huntington branches acquired in June of 2019  We recently took actions to keep our costs in check for 2020 and beyond  While we incurred  3 million in restructuring related charges in the fourth quarter  we anticipate the restructuring will enable us to maintain flat to modestly lower noninterest expenses in 2020 including the full absorption of First Staunton s costs While we maintain our focus on controlling costs  we understand that we need to continue investing in technology that will further improve operational efficiency and enhance our digital presence and capabilities  We ve increased our technology spending by more than 25  over the past four years  and we expect this trend will continue Looking ahead to 2020  we expect total non interest expense to be between  790 million and  795 million including the cost of converting and operating First Staunton  On Slide 14  we summarize the annual credit quality trends of the loan book  During 2019  the credit environment remained benign and our credit metrics generally improved  Potential problem loans decreased  93 million from the end of 2018  Our provision for credit losses was  16 million  up from zero  in 2018  but down from  26 million in 2017 As we ve previously noted  we have already provided for and reserved against the risks we currently see in the oil and gas portfolio  We anticipate future oil and gas loan losses are manageable and within our historical patterns of normal provisioning  The allowance for loan losses at the end of 2019 was 0 88  down from the third quarter and previous years  As part of the implementation of CECL this quarter  we expect to incur an after tax equity adjustment of  70 million to  80 million which will reduce our tangible common equity ratio by 21 basis points to 24 basis points as expected On slide 15  we highlight our strong capital position  In 2019  we maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment  We built up capital in preparation for CECL implementation while we adhered to our stated priorities to support organic growth  pay a competitive dividend  pursue end market efficiency driven acquisitions and repurchase shares We increased our dividend 11  in 2019 and have grown the dividend by 68  since 2015  We deployed capital through the Huntington branch acquisition and we returned  177 million to shareholders through common stock repurchases To sum up on Slide 16  where we restate our 2020 outlook  which reflects our expectations of a stable economy and the closure of the First Staunton transaction in February  We expect 2  to 4  annual average loan growth and to maintain our loan to deposit ratio under 100   We anticipate our full year 2020 net interest margin will be between 2 80  and 2 85  assuming a stable interest rate environment Non interest income is expected to be between  375 million   385 million  Non interest expense anticipated to be between  790 million and  795 million  including acquisition related costs in connection with the First Staunton transaction  We expect that 2020 effective tax rate between 19  and 21   Our loan loss provision is anticipated to adjust with changes in risk grade  other indications of credit quality and loan volume  And finally  we expect to continue to deploy capital through our stated priorities  and we ll continue to operate with at least a 7  tangible common equity ratio With that  we ll open it up for your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  At this time  we ll be conducting a question and answer session   Operator Instructions   Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler  Please proceed with your question Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood afternoon guys  Thanks for taking the question  Couple of quick ones for you  Just in terms of the guidance  I know it s pretty small in the grand scheme of things  but does the guidance outside of expenses include or exclude First Staunton  and I guess specifically where I d be most curious is in the margin guidance  Is there any additional purchase accounting adjustment baked into there  or is that kind of a clean margin guidance  2 80  to 2 85  Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Clean margin guide and all the First Staunton stuff is included in all the guidance we gave you Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  perfect  And then are you able to say what    in the press release you noted some credit valuation adjustments in the fourth quarter  are you guys able to detail the size of those Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerIt s a relatively small number  it s on our customer derivatives  and it s just change in the rates and it was    it was  1 million Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  So nothing too significant there  All right  And then final question  just I think you also put in the release there was an 18  sequential increase in potential problem loans  Anything in particular there  Or is that just kind of normal ebbs and flows Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  We re dealing with such absolute low levels of potential problem loans that year over year  they re down  they re up a little bit in the back half of the year  but it doesn t seem systemic and we re not concerned about it Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Perfect  All right  thank you guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens  Please proceed with your question Terry McEvoy    Stephens    AnalystGood evening Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood evening  Terry Terry McEvoy    Stephens    AnalystHi  I was hoping you could discuss maybe your thoughts on insurance and mortgage banking in 2020  It looks like the insurance dipped a little bit in the fourth quarter  So within the context of that  375 million to  385 million  could you just provide some commentary there please Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou know  the insurance business is inherently a slow growing business  We did a number of acquisitions  We didn t do any this past year  We ll see what happens in the coming year  but the  375 million to  385 million assumes a steady state for the insurance biz  Phonetic  and it assumes a lower run rate of mortgage banking income than what we enjoyed in the back half of the year given rate stabilization Terry McEvoy    Stephens    AnalystAnd then looking at your noninterest expenses  I see the  1 3 million acquisition related costs  Did I miss some severance expenses as well in the fourth quarter  Is that in the  203 6 million number Christopher J  Del Moral Niles    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt is  Terry  and if you look at Page 10 of our press release tables  we break out the severance specifically  It rounds to  4 million for the quarter  it was  3 million and change  it rounds up to  4 million  It was  5 million for the year  and  4 million for the fourth quarter rounded Terry McEvoy    Stephens    AnalystOkay  Thanks for pointing that out  Chris  Thanks guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC  Please proceed with your question Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThanks  good afternoon Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon  Jon Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  Phil and Chris  on Slide 5 that decline in general commercial  you may have touched on a bit  but can you go into detail a little bit more on that  what really drove that Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou know  it was kind of across the board  I think we feel it s pretty anomalous  We re not really terribly concerned  We anticipate    we anticipate pretty robust loan growth this coming year  We expect the general commercial lines to grow  We certainly expect commercial real estate to grow  Commercial real estate is sitting on  2 billion of unfunded commitments  They had their best year for new production ever in 2019  more than  2 8 billion of new transactions  So of that  2 billion  a significant amount of that will fund up  in addition to the new work they re doing now So the combination of reasonable expectations in Commercial Banking  strong expectations in commercial real estate  steady growth in resi mortgage makes us feel pretty confident that we re going to hit that 2  to 4  Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  good  That helps  And then the comment you made on the securities portfolio  I just do this simple math  and I think it suggests maybe a bottoms at around  5 5 billion in Q1  Is that the right way to think about it Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  it s definitely going to bottom out at roughly 17  of assets during Q1  and we re basically bouncing around the bottom now and it will    it won t grow other than in proportion to our balance sheet as we move through 2020 Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  You guys almost filled out my earnings model  but I was just trying to get to an earning asset number  So that helps Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah   2 million is  Indecipherable  expense   2 million is snow plow expense  And it s snowing outside right now Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystIt s been great this winter  Last one Chris  I know you ve done a lot of thinking about CECL  How should we think about the provision for 2020 maybe you ll get a little bit of an increase in the state of reserves  but how do you want us to think about your provision Christopher J  Del Moral Niles    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And so in general  we think our provision should have less volatility under CECL  So it should essentially track growth in the portfolio  would be our baseline  and we would anticipate  again  we ve got some nice growth anticipations  but    and the overall nature of the portfolio environment and we ve been on a positive or benign credit environment  And there is no reason to believe that s going to stop here at December 31st  So there is some positive general portfolio trends which will be partially offset by the growth trend we see going forward But generally  less volatile provisioning going forward Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystAnd it feels like most of your cleanup in energy is done as well Christopher J  Del Moral Niles    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  We feel    we ve reduced that portfolio substantially another  100 million in the fourth quarter  We don t see a whole lot of charge offs left and for stuff that we re worried on about beyond that  the contribution we re making to CECL here in this quarter should cover our worries So I feel pretty good about where we are on that Jon Arfstrom    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  All right  thanks for the help OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW  Please proceed with your question Christopher McGratty    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystHey  great  Thanks for the question  Phil  in terms of capital  you talked about    excuse me  a 7  floor on the tangible ratio  Can you speak to inorganic growth opportunities  I think in the past you said one to two small deals a year will be possible  And I think recently you talked a little bit more openly about the potential merits of an MOE  Maybe some updated thoughts here Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So our    our stated goal is to continue to look for efficiency driven in footprint relatively modest acquisitions and we have discussions going on  What I ve said about the possibility of MOE is  there is a limited number of options and we re always open to talking to anyone about what makes sense for our shareholders  as well as potentially someone else s  So we re open to those discussions Christopher McGratty    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystGreat  thanks OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo  Please proceed with your question Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo Securities LLC    AnalystHi  good afternoon guys  Chris actually hit one of my questions  but any thoughts on acquiring business lines or portfolios apart from your comments on potential whole bank deals Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  You saw us do the Huntington branch transaction which at the end of the day was almost all deposits and buying a portion of what Huntington has  buying out their Wisconsin stuff  So we re always open to looking at non whole bank deals  We re particularly interested in looking at opportunities like we had with Huntington  where we can continue to grow low cost core deposits  Those kind of opportunities are few and far between  of course  But to the extent something    something came up  we would certainly be interested in that As far as looking at loan books and portfolios  we re open to that  but it s not as higher priority as continuing to build out the deposit base Christopher J  Del Moral Niles    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd of course we continue to be interested in asset management related opportunities should they present themselves  and   Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd insurance transactions as well  yeah Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo Securities LLC    AnalystOkay  And then on your    on the CRE portfolio  Can you comment on what you re seeing in terms of pay off  pay down trend  And what your expectations are around that as you look going into 2020  do you expect that to stay stable or potentially increase or decrease Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So we had a real rush of pay offs  back    back end of 2018 leaking into 2019  That has abated somewhat and we don t expect any elevated payoff activity  So the funding up of a couple of billion dollars of commitments there on our books coupled with new production  minus reasonable level of payoffs and there s always plenty of payoffs offs I mean  it s the nature of the commercial real estate business that it s somewhat of a hamster wheel of making new loans  having loans payoff  that s how it s supposed to work for banks  But we re going to be net ahead and should be hopefully net ahead this year Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo Securities LLC    AnalystGreat  thank you Operator Operator Instructions   Your next question comes from the line of Michael Young with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey  Please proceed with your question Michael Young    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey     AnalystHey  thanks for taking the question  Just wanted to ask about the appetite for residential mortgage on balance sheet production in 2020  Is that impacted by CECL  and do you view that at all as an alternative to securities book growth  Just kind of    get your high level thoughts there Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So the securities book is going to remain at a lower level than we ve historically held as Chris said around that 70  range  So to the extent the balance sheet expands with loans  that will creep up a bit  The residential mortgage stuff  it s a good point  clearly CECL causes more credit to be attracted to those loans  So we re going to be very deliberate about what goes on the balance sheet  We have a very active origination  sale  retain  service model here and we ll continue to look at continuing that model But I think it s fair to say that we have some reticence to put lower yielding residential mortgages that attract significantly more capital because of the accounting rules than they used to on the balance sheet Michael Young    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey     AnalystOkay  And just a follow up on the technology and equipment expense  Can you talk about where kind of new dollars are being put to work  maybe how much of that is kind of customer experience driven versus efficiency efforts  etc Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  It turns out that usually improving the digital customer experience also leads to more efficiency  So  we re now up to about 80  of our mortgage applications are rolling through our blend application that we rolled out earlier this year  That causes significant efficiency with the digitization of that application from the moment that someone starts typing on their computer or their phone or their tablet Most of our efforts are customer facing  so that we remain relevant and    more than competitive with many of our competitors in our footprint  And then that will continue  but we also have other significant technology projects that we ve completed  We recently completed a complete revamping of our campaign  marketing campaign management system  which automates a lot of our ability to digitally connect with customers and send out hundreds and thousands or millions of emails in an efficient manner So that s    that s both a customer facing technology  but clearly drives efficiency and accuracy  in the back shop  So I d say it s both  but it s more heavily weighted toward the customer experience Michael Young    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey     AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorYour next question is a follow up from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler  Please proceed with your question Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystHey  guys  Thank you  I was just curious on the overall credit portfolio  I guess if there    if we re sort of nearing the end of energy related charge offs as you finished derisking that portfolio  where are your non energy charge offs running these days  Maybe in terms of basis points would be great  I know they re very small  but I m just trying to get a sense for what the expectation for total charge offs would be if we re kind of sunsetting on the issues in the energy portfolio Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean that s always hard to prognosticate because any one charge off can drive that  In this past quarter  we had  14 million of net charge offs  a little less than  10 million were oil and gas related  most of the rest of it was some mortgage and other consumer asset So a vast bulk of our charge offs this past year were oil and gas and the remainder was next to nothing  I don t have the basis points in front of me  but it s probably a single digit Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystYeah  Okay  All right  Perfect  thank you Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorLadies and gentlemen  we have reached the end of the question and answer session  And I would like to turn the call back to Philip Flynn for closing remarks Philip B  Flynn    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thanks everybody for joining us today  We feel well positioned going into 2020  The efforts we made to reposition our balance sheet for the rate environment we re in  we believe  will pay dividends  We should have a stable net interest margin potentially rising a little bit  You saw the results in the fourth quarter of our NIM actually going up 2 basis points We feel good about our loan growth  We will manage expenses as we always do and we believe we re in a benign credit environment  So I think we re well positioned to perform well in 2020 We look forward to welcoming our First Staunton customers and colleagues in February and we look forward to talking to all of you in April  And as always  if you have any questions  give us a call and thanks again for your interest in Associated Operator Operator Closing

in the fourth quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward  Thus  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fourth quarter earnings has been unchanged at  4 59 over the past seven days  The figure indicates a decline of 9 5  from the year ago reported number The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at  786 8 million  which suggests growth of 12 2  from the prior year quarter s reported figure Key Estimates for Q4Net interest income  NII   In the fourth quarter  real estate loans witnessed decent growth  Also  growth in commercial loans  constituting a major part of SVB Financial s loan portfolio  was soft The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the fourth quarter is pegged at  65 2 billion  which suggests rise of 4 9  sequentially Thus  despite modest loan growth  the decline in interest rates is likely to have hurt the company s NII to some extent Management expects NII to be in low double digits in 2019  Net interest margin is projected at 3 50 3 60  Non interest income  The fourth quarter witnessed an increase in credit card related consumer loans  Supported by this  the company s credit card fee is expected to have risen  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for credit card fees is pegged at  30 59 million  which indicates growth of 1 4  sequentially Moreover  on the expectation of rise in deposit balances  service charge on deposits is likely to have been positively impacted  The consensus estimate for the same is  23 05 million  suggesting 2 5  rise from the previous quarter s reported number The company has been witnessing an increase in client investment fund balances over the past few quarters  Thus  on the expectation of rise in fund balances in the fourth quarter as well  client investment fees are likely to have increased  The consensus estimate for client investment fees of  48 37 million suggests 3 6  sequential rise The consensus estimate for foreign exchange fees is pegged at  41 51 million  suggesting 3  sequential growth Also  the consensus estimate for lending related fees is pegged at  12 million  indicating rise of 2 5  from the previous quarter  Letters of credit and standby letters of credit fees are estimated to be  11 million in the fourth quarter  suggesting 1 5  sequential growth Notably  the company expects core fee income for 2019 to grow in the low 20s  Including the favorable impact of the SVB Leerink acquisition  it is expected to increase in the high 60s Expenses  SVB Financial s expenses are likely to have remained elevated in the fourth quarter because of continued spending on technology system overhaul and investments in franchise Notably  the company expects non GAAP non interest expenses  excluding expenses related to non controlling interests  to increase in low teens in 2019  Including the impact of the SVB Leerink acquisition  it is projected to rise in the mid 30s Asset quality  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for allowance for loan losses of  314 million for the fourth quarter suggests an increase of 3 3  from the prior quarter s reported figure Earnings WhispersPer our quantitative model  the chances of SVB Financial beating the Zacks

117388,338903,ASB,Huntington Continues To Grow Inorganically  Costs Increase,opinion,"On Jun 8  we issued an updated research report on Huntington Bancshares Incorporated   NASDAQ HBAN    The company continues to benefit from sound organic and inorganic growth strategies  However  mounting expenses and lack of diversification in loan portfolio remain key concerns 
With  104 billion in assets as of Mar 31  2018  Huntington s profitability is expected to benefit greatly from the softening of regulations on account of lower compliance costs  Also  its bottom line will get further support from lower tax rates and rising interest rates 
The company s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings has remained stable  over the last 30 days  As a result  it currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Shares of Huntington have gained 20 5  in the past year  slightly underperforming the 21 5  growth for the  

Huntington has witnessed consistent growth in deposit balance over the last few years as it remains focused on achieving the best deposit franchise  Also  loans improved due to its commendable performance in commercial and consumer portfolio  Management predicts average loans and leases to increase in the 4 6  band in 2018 while average deposits are expected to be up 3 5   We believe the rising tendency in these balances is likely to continue in the quarters ahead with support from improving economic conditions 
On the back of its strong liquidity position  Huntington continues to expand through acquisitions  In August 2016  it completed the buyout of Ohio based FirstMerit Corporation  Management expects the deal to be accretive to earnings per share in 2018  We expect these initiatives to support its top line growth and help it gain market share  going forward 
However  the company s non interest expenses saw a CAGR of 13  over the last four years  ended 2017   mostly due to acquisitions and compensation related expenses  Such consistent rise in costs is likely to deter bottom line growth 
Also  Huntington s loan portfolio consists of nearly 51  of commercial loans  Such high exposure to commercial loans depicts lack of diversification  which can be risky for the company amid a challenging economy and competitive markets

117420,338935,ASB,Why Is An Earnings Beat Likely For BNY Mellon  BK  In Q1 ,opinion,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation   NYSE BK   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 19  before market open  Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year Last quarter  the company s adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Higher net interest revenues and assets under management  AUM  growth were offset by lower fee income and rise in expenses BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history  Its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters  The average positive surprise was 3 7  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    However  activities of the company in the first quarter were not adequate to win analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents has remained stable over the last 30 days  Nevertheless  the figure reflects year over year growth of 21 3  Further  the company s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is  4 05 billion for the to be reported quarter  reflecting an improvement of 6 4  year over year BNY Mellon s shares have gained 10 8  in the past year  underperforming the 17 8  rally of the  it belongs to Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings  To a great extent  it depends on whether the company will be able to beat earnings estimates this time around  Let s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts A Positive Surprise in Store According to our quantitative model  chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high  This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is  0 21  Zacks Rank  BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank of 3  This  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsImprovement in Fee Revenues  Given that the equity markets have performed decently during the first quarter  BNY Mellon s asset servicing fees  as well as investment management and performance fees  are expected to witness modest improvement  Moreover  with the expansion in the spread between three month LIBOR and the Fed funds rate  along with an increase in trading volumes  securities lending revenues are also expected to improve during the quarter Further  driven by higher foreign exchange trading volumes and increased volatility  foreign exchange trading revenues are also likely to witness improvement  Thus  with the expected rise in the above mentioned components  overall fee revenues must improve during the quarter Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee revenues of  3 16 billion reflects 5 1  year over year improvement Higher Rates to Boost Net Interest Revenues  NIR   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  296 8 billion reflects an improvement of 4 7  from the year ago quarter  Moreover  the quarter has witnessed a moderate improvement in the lending scenario  primarily due to rise in consumer confidence and increase in loan demand to some extent  owing to the tax reform  Thus  given the improvement in loan balances  along with the effect of rising interest rates  BNY Mellon should register an increase in NIR Moreover  management believes  any rate hike will lead to an improvement in margin  Hence  improving margins  due to the increase in rates  is likely to more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet and hence lead to a modest increase in NIR in the quarter Expenses to Decline Slightly  Supported by the cost saving initiatives  BNY Mellon s expenses have been declining for the past few years  Moreover  despite the impact of investment related expenses  overall costs are expected to remain low in the quarter Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have

117434,338949,ASB,Should Value Investors Pick Associated Banc Corp  ASB  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Associated Banc Corp   NYSE ASB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Associated Banc Corp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 2  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Associated Banc Corp s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 15 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Associated Banc Corp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Associated Banc Corp s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Associated Banc Corp has a P S ratio of about 3 2  This is marginally lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Associated Banc Corp currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ASB a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 4  which is slightly better than the industry average of 14 3  Clearly  ASB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Associated Banc Corp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives ASB a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen 8 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 4 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Associated Banc Corp Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Associated Banc Corp is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineAssociated Banc Corp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 38  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends and broader factors to turn around first   When they do  this stock could be a compelling value pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent

remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2017-12-10,Zacks Investment

117437,338952,ASB,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Associated Banc Corp  Hancock Holding  Heartland Financial  Synovus Financial And Zions,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 08  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Associated Banc Corp   NYSE ASB    Hancock Holding Company   NASDAQ HBHC    Heartland Financial USA  Inc    NASDAQ HTLF    Synovus Financial Corp    NYSE SNV   and Zions Bancorporation   NASDAQ ZION   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Markets at Record Highs  5 Stocks to Bet OnIt has only been a handful of days into 2018 and the markets are already touching record highs  It looks like the rally will continue for some time The Dow Jones Industrial index crossed the 25 000 level for the first time yesterday  while other two major indexes   the S P 500 and Nasdaq also closed at all time highs  The primary driving factor is the strong domestic economic data including better than expected ADP private sector payroll reading for December 2017  and robust manufacturing and services sector data Also  the FOMC Minutes from last month revealed discussions that the new tax act  which was not even finalized at the time of the meeting  will aid GDP given the increase in consumer spending  higher business investments and a steady decline in unemployment rate The tax act is expected to result in huge savings and cash repatriation for the companies  But only a few sectors industries will continue to gain over the longer term  banks being one of them   Read more   Apart from this  the Fed has indicated three more rate hikes this year  This alone is sufficient to improve banks  financial performance  But anticipated higher inflation driven by tax cut stimulus may lead the central bank to raise the interest rate at a faster pace  as economic growth improves further  Higher rates help banks in expanding their net interest margins  thus driving revenue growth All these indicate a stronger economy this year  With banks  financials directly linked to the health of the nation  they stand out to be clear winners Further  reduction in stringent regulations might be implemented soon as part of President Donald Trump s election promise  While no time frame has been outlined for the execution  the announcement of a bipartisan agreement has helped investors regain confidence  This will help banks in reducing regulatory compliance costs and will likely to lead to a wave of M As for the banking industry Picking the Winning Banking StocksThe banking industry  as a whole  is likely to gain from the favorable

117469,338984,ASB,Rise In Interest Income To Drive BB T s  BBT  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,BB T Corporation s   NYSE BBT   third quarter 2017 results  slated on Thursday  Oct 19  are expected to witness a slight rise in tax equivalent net interest income  NII   This  in turn  will support the company s revenues and bottom line Improvement in loan demand  particularly commercial and industrial  and consumer loans during quarter will support NII  On an annualized basis  BB T expects total loans to grow 1 3  sequentially while core loan growth is anticipated to be in the range of 5 7  Further  BB T expects to record stable core net interest margin  NIM   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIM of 3 46  reflects 1 basis point fall from the prior quarter  This is likely to be attributable to higher interest rates  which will be more than offset by marginally lower average interest earning assets  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earning assets is  193 3 billion  Thus  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of  1 68 billion shows marginal growth on a sequential basis  On the other hand  management expects NII to remain stable from the prior quarter Now  let s check out a few other factors that might influence BB T s Q3 performance Lower non interest income  BB T has been witnessing continuous fall in mortgage banking fees as higher interest rates are leading to lower mortgage originations  However  an expected higher rate environment might have led to rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter  thus helping the company record some mortgage revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of  106 million shows a jump of 12 8  sequentially Further  as deposit balance rises  the company will record an increase in service charge on deposits  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for service charge on deposits of  179 million reflects a rise of 1 7  from the last quarter However  BB T is expected to record lower insurance income as hurricanes hit the U S coast during the latter half of the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for insurance fees is  417 million  plunging 13 3  from the prior quarter Overall  total non interest income is projected to witness a 3 4  sequential fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is  1 18 billion while management projects the same to grow 1 3  year over year Expenses might increase modestly  Excluding merger related and restructuring charges  BB T expects expenses to remain flat or increase 2  on a year over year basis Asset quality to support results  BB T expects loan loss provision to match net charge offs  NCOs  in addition to providing for loan growth  Also  management expects NCOs rates to remain in the range of 0 35 0 45  Non performing asset  NPAs  levels will likely remain stable with the prior quarter  Similarly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NPAs is  690 million  stable sequentially Here is what our quantitative model predicts According to our quantitative model  chances of BB T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better  which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for BB T is  0 43  Zacks Rank  BB T carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to be reported quarter has been revised 1 3  downward over the last 60 days to 78 cents  with four out of 12 estimates moving lower  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year over year improvement of 2 2  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  2 84 billion indicates 2 6  growth from the prior year quarter BB T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB   is slated to release third quarter

117593,339108,ASB,U S  Banks With Growth Potential,opinion,"U S  banks are starting to look a lot better as the risk of yet another economic slump has gradually abated and the ability to endure pressures from the operating environment has improved  Adding to these are the tailwinds from sustained GDP growth and reduction in unemployment 
Further  although the prevailing low interest rate environment curbs net interest margin   banks  key source of earnings   it will continue to act as a key performance driver for some time  Asset quality  one of the most important performance indicators  will in particular keep building up on the back of low interest rates  which are expected to prevail at least till mid 2015       Looking at fundamentals  cost containment and balance sheet recovery hold the key to the banks  success  While cost containment can be perceived as a defensive measure  balance sheet recovery should help banks prosper Balance Sheet Recovery Underway   Lack of low risk investment opportunities has been continuing to aid deposit growth  Also  demand for loans has been increasing with recovering economic conditions and banks  efforts to ease lending standards  Moreover  improvement in GDP  employment and other economic indicators have been helping banks strengthen their balance sheets  but reversal of interest rate environment will result in unrealized losses on underlying securities  However  banks are trying to reorganize risk management practices to address potential solvency issues from rising interest rates  Asset quality troubles are also being addressed by divesting nonperforming assets  Yet  we don t expect balance sheet strength to return to the pre recession peak any time soon  Problem Banks List  Shortens  but Not Reasonable Yet   The FDIC s  Problem List  contained 329 names as of Sep 30  2014  down from 354 as of Jun 30  2014  This is the lowest level since 305 in the first quarter of 2009 and represents a 63  decline from the post crisis high of 888 as of Mar 31  2011  This reflects improvement no doubt  but the number looks extremely high considering the occurrence of the financial crisis six years back  There were only 76 banks on the Problem List at the end of 2007  just before the crisis  Considering the recovery witnessed by the economy and stock markets so far  the number of problem banks ought to have been much less  This indicates that the industry is still fraught with trouble  However  14 banks failed during first nine months of 2014 compared with 22 failures in the same period last year  Total 24 banks failed in 2013  versus 51 in 2012 and 92 in 2011  and a lesser number is expected in 2014  Though the pace of bank failures has been decelerating  the industry is still to see an average failure of just four or five banks annually  which would indicate its maximum strength 
  Too Big To Fail  Notion About to End 
Mega banks have been benefiting from lower funding and operating costs since the financial crisis six years ago  This is because of the impression that the Federal Reserve will always protect these banks from failing in case of any major financial trouble  However  the advantages have been waning in recent years  The regulatory changes  in particular the 2010 Dodd Frank law  made these systematically important banks self sufficient  in terms of capital reserves  to some extent to endure any further crisis  So the likelihood of a bailout is less now  Further  a new set of rules put forth by the Financial Stability Board  FSB   expected to take effect in 2019 following the G2O leaders  endorsement  would make the  too big to fail  notion a thing of the past  The rules would require the world s 30 so called  systemically important  banks to hold up to one fifth of their risk weighted assets in the form of debt or equity  This buffer would help bolster these banks in case of any risk of failure      Though the biggest banks will continue to enjoy low borrowing costs and take bigger risks until these rules are implemented  the advantages should wane with time Stocks Worth Betting On Now As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the U S  banking industry now  So one may consider buying some bank stocks that promise better performance based on their strong fundamentals and a favorable Zacks Rank  Specific banks that we like with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  include Baylake Corp  NASDAQ BYLK   Enterprise Financial Services  NASDAQ EFSC   Oritani Financial Corp  NASDAQ ORIT   S T Bancorp Inc  NASDAQ STBA   Fidelity Southern Corporation  NASDAQ LION   Investar Ho  NASDAQ ISTR  and Western Alliance Bancorporation  NYSE WAL

117618,339133,ASB,Never Trust A  Money Center Bank   And Never Invest In One,opinion,If I am doing right by our clients  subscribers  and online readers  it is my responsibility to advise what investment vehicles  in my opinion  should be avoided  as well as that which should be considered    To wit  After repeated admonitions to all to avoid US money center banks and brokerages   JP Morgan  JPM  declared that  oh  whoops  we lost  2 billion   of shareholders  money on a  risk management  issue  The biggest risk is what takes place between the ears of big bank brokerage senior leadership s ears and there is clearly no management of those functions whatsoever  Morgan would have you believe this is just a one off event that could never happen again  Like Lucy and Charlie Brown with the annual football kicking trick  somehow they get away with it     All analysts and reporters  it seems  and too many investors as well  fall for it  The problem isn t that they lost money  The problem is that they are playing with fire when they haven t any clue how to tame it  Like kids who end up burning down a beautiful dry forest  they must actually believe at the time that they are in control and they know what they are doing   The only alternative is that they know they don t know what they are doing  but the profits are huge and they do know the US government will send the bill for restoration to the US taxpayer  But that would be way too cynical so I choose to believe they are simply stupid and not entirely venal  We all rationalize from time to time      Maybe the better analogy than merely burning the forest down is kids digging around in the dirt and finding an unexploded land mine  It may be unarmed  the moisture and insects may have destroyed its ability to fire  or it may be a dud  I don t want to be an alarmist and say that there must be another meltdown  merely that  as long as the arrogant and cocksure play around with the potentially explosive  we continue to leave ourselves open to danger    Back in 2003  when the kids were first digging in the dirt  the notional value of all derivatives outstanding  worldwide  was something like  70 trillion  Apres le deluge in 2008  when the banks received a  strong letter of disapproval   rather than a good caning  which is what they needed   notional values have now climbed to over  250 trillion  Boy  I guess that strong letter really slowed  em down  I want to disbelieve the numbers in the chart below  from the United States Comptroller of the Currency  an independent bureau within the Treasury Department which exists to charter  regulate  and supervise all national banks and the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks in the United States  Not exactly some alarmist sky is falling blogger  I assume these guys know whereof they speak  I need to clarify that not all derivatives are bad  Listed options are also derivatives  Convertible bonds may be thought of as a type of derivative in that they represent a contract that must be met upon demand and exchanged into something else  One could even argue that life insurance policies are derivative in that a third party  the beneficiary  is involved and a known amount must be paid out when the derivative unwinds    But the ones that are the most arcane and likely out of control derivatives which hold the greatest risk are often off the books and are  netted  against not exactly alike counter hedges   Think apples and oranges  only in this case the Imagineers who design these things put an orange rind around the apple so it looks like an orange  Hey  they re both fruits  profitable to fool oneself    The viability of the derivative markets is completely dependent upon what are called  netting benefits   by which the banks make themselves believe that their exposure to risk is almost perfectly balanced and almost perfectly hedged  Well  that s what Bear  Stearns and Lehman Brothers thought as well  The truth is  and 2008 is the proof thereof  netting benefits are illusory  They can disappear in a flash  When one big firm  let s call them Lehman Brothers  makes a  bet that proves to be  shall we say  unpropitious  that would be banker talk for a        calamity  it typically creates a chain reaction that quickly reaches into the trillions of dollars  as actually occurred 10 years earlier  when we chose not to learn this lesson  with the Long Term Capital Management fiasco  as well as in 2008    Since we have not reined in the ability of banker brokers to continue writing these contracts without regard to real capital structure  it is likely that similar events to Morgan s recent  2 billion  screw up will occur  or  worse  those similar to Long Term Capital Management  an ironic name for a moronic gamble by  among others  a couple of Noble Prize winning economists   still think this is an easy business to figure out    Or  devastatingly worse  Bear Stearns   Lehman   Step Right Up  Who s Next     Certainly  the rate of derivative growth continues unabated to this point  Notional values of derivatives now equal about 16 times our Gross Domestic Product and  growing at more than  100 billion per day   The GDP itself is growing by only  41 billion per day     While the Volcker Rules held the promise of removing some risk from derivatives  Paul Volcker  a former chairman of the Fed  a non public banking regulator  clearly knows whereof he speaks  the bank brokerage lobby was successful in watering it down significantly and delaying its implementation until the current crop of CEOs could buy their Gulfstreams  chateaux along the Loire  and other to them indispensable baubles  and hand the business over to someone else to take the fall   Already  the banksters have been granted a July 2014 date to comply and have negotiated the ability to request three one year extensions  Clearly  the regulators don t understand the issue or have all their assets in a Swiss bank    The larger issue here  of course  is the threat to the economic viability of the nation itself  To deal with that  I and our firm have acted more conservatively than those who have thrown caution to the winds  drank the Kool Aid  and said  Let s party    This has cost us the occasional client who wants to join in the fun but also gained us new clients who understand there be dragons here  whether they breathe fire this quarter or not  It is not encouraging that America seems content to churn out weapons of mass financial destruction rather than create meaningful jobs in meaningful manufacturing and service sectors  Again  we address that general issue by being wary of jumping in the deep end of the abyss  As for the more specific    Avoid US money center banks  They will always find a way to lose money for their shareholders and  via government largesse  for American taxpayers  There are plenty of other ways to  far more safely  participate in the economic strengths of a nation  including our own  Buying other financials like the few well run insurance companies that do not dally in the landmine strewn fields of derivatives   or public mutual fund families  or banks that remember what it is to be a banker    One way we have chosen to participate in America s economic future  a future hopefully untainted by another derivatives blow up  is to buy smaller US banks that serve their communities  state or region  One we hold in our current portfolios is SIVBO  the SVB  Silicon Valley Bank  7  preferred which we bought at  10 back in March of 2009  currently  25 40  at which price it paid  and continues to pay  us a stellar 17 5  per year in dividends    The other  more recent addition  is First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank  QABA    This is an ETF that holds a very different mix of banks than the Citi  C   Goldman  GS   B of A  BAC  paper that most analysts recommend  It is a mirror of an index that selects the common stock of all NASDAQ listed banks and thrifts or their holding companies that are designated as banks by the Industry Classification Benchmark but which excludes any of the 50 largest banks or thrifts and their holding companies based on asset size or any banks or thrifts classified as having an  international specialization  or a  credit card specialization      In other words  this ETF owns banks   they take in deposits and make loans  mostly from local depositors to local businesses  They may not all be Bailey Savings and Loan  the bank in  It s a Wonderful Life   but they are a lot closer to that model than the wannabe pirates on Wall St    Each bank in the ETF must have a market capitalization of at least  200 million and a three month average daily dollar trading volume of at least  500 000  In addition  they must meet certain operating history  solvency  and financial statement requirements to remain eligible for inclusion in the index    The index is rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted semi annually  Its top 10 holdings may not be familiar to everyone but if you live in one of the areas these banks serve  you probably know them well  BOK  the old Bank of Oklahoma  Financial  BOKF   Zions Bancorporation  ZION   Commerce Bancshares  CBSH   East West Bancorp  EWBC   TFS Financial Corp  TFSL   Signature Bank  SBNY   our old favorite SVB Financial  SIVBO   Hancock Holding Company  HBHC   Associated Banc Corp  ASBC   and Fulton Financial  FULT     On any general market malaise we will be buying more QABA  I want to invest in American entrepreneurs  not holding companies that don t really know what they are that trade scraps of paper for teenies in nanoseconds  I ll leave that to the Masters of the Universe wannabes   Let them juggle grenades  Me  I ve thrown enough live grenades to know that I d rather buy quality and watch it grow    Disclosure  We are long SIVBO Pfd and QABA  We wouldn t touch a US money center bank unless it was selling for a dime on the dollar
