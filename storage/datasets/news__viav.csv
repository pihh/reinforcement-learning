we are recording today s call  and we ll make the recording available by 4 30 p m  Pacific Time this evening on our website  I would now like to turn the call over to Amar  Amar Maletira    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Bill  Viavi delivered another quarter of record breaking performance  A record revenue in fiscal 2020 second quarter of  313 7 million grew 2 2  year on year and exceeded the revenue guidance range of  292 million to  312 million  Both NSE and OSP delivered strong performance  Viavi s record operating margins at 21 6  expanded 80 basis points year over year and exceeded the guidance range of 18  to 20   Also  record EPS at  0 23 also exceeded the guidance range of  0 18 to  0 20 and reflects a 4 5  growth from a year ago levels  Now moving to our reported Q2 results by business segments  starting with NSE  NSE revenue at  234 2 million grew 4 7  year over year and exceeded the guidance range of  216 million to  232 million  Within NSE  NE revenue at  203 million grew 3 8  from a year ago levels  driven by strong performance in fiber  wireless and cable products  SE revenue at  31 2 million grew 10 6  year over year  driven by strength in our data center products from improved market conditions and execution  Our growth assurance products also saw year on year growth  which more than offset the expected revenue runoff in our mature assurance products  Mature assurance products currently represent less than 10  of SE revenue  NSE gross margin at 66 4  increased 110 basis points year over year  Within NSE  NE gross margins at 66 4  expanded 210 basis points year over year due to higher revenue volume and favorable product mix  SE gross margins at 66 7  was down 530 basis points from a year ago  Last year s SE gross margin at 72  reflected favorable product mix from more software content and the higher margin mature assurance products  NSE s operating margins at 16  increased 130 basis points from a year ago levels  reflecting the gross margin improvement and favorable operating leverage  This is also a new NSE record and exceeded the guidance range of 12  to 14   Now turning to OSP  OSP revenue at  79 5 million reached the high end of the guidance range of  76 million to  80 million and declined 4 4  year over year  This decline in revenue is a result of the expected decline in the core OSP business  partially offset by growth in 3D sensing from increased demand  OSP s gross margins at 54 8  expanded 460 basis points due to efficiencies and higher absorption of manufacturing overhead  Operating margin at 38 2  exceeded the guidance range and expanded 80 basis points year on year  reflecting the higher gross margin levels  partially offset by increased investments in growth areas  Now turning to the balance sheet  Our total cash and short term investment ending balance was  556 9 million  Operating cash flow for the quarter was  38 million  In Q2  we repurchased approximately  9 2 million of Viavi stock at an average cost basis  including commissions of  13 93 per share  Of the  200 million authorized share buyback announced during our September 2019 analyst day event  we have repurchased to date approximately  10 7 million of Viavi stock  We plan to continue to repurchase Viavi stock opportunistically to offset earnings dilution from stock based compensation  Now on to our guidance  We expect fiscal third quarter 2020 revenue for Viavi to be approximately  278 million  plus or minus  10 million  operating margins at 15 5   plus or minus 1   and EPS to be in the range of  0 13 to  0 15  We expect NSE revenue to be approximately  212 million  plus or minus  8 million  with operating margins at 10 5   plus or minus 1   We expect OSP revenue to be approximately  66 million  plus or minus  2 million  with operating margins at 32   plus or minus 1   Our tax expense rate is expected to be approximately 17  to 18   We expect other income and expenses to reflect a net expense of approximately  2 million  Share count is approximately 240 million shares  With that  I will turn the call over to Oleg Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Amar  I m pleased with our strong performance in Q2  resulting in a record quarter across many key metrics and breaking the prior year s record  Our non GAAP operating profit of  67 9 million was up 6 3  from the prior year s record of  63 9 million  Business strength came from our three major growth drivers  5G  fiber and 3D sensing  We expect 5G lab test demand to remain robust throughout calendar 2020 driven by continued investment by leading NAMs in 5G R D  The demand for 5G field test instruments is expected to start ramping in late calendar 2020 or early calendar 2021  We expect fiber demand to remain robust throughout 2020 driven by continued network densification  In Q2  we also benefited from year on year growth in cable  The increase in cable spend has begun in Q1 and continued into Q2 driven by follow on DOCSIS 3 1 upgrades at both North American and European cable providers  That said  we expect cable spend to moderate for the remainder of fiscal year 2020  SE revenue came in better than expected at  31 2 million driven by improved demand in enterprise and data center and good acceptance by service providers of our growth assurance products  In OSP  3D sensing revenue increased significantly year on year driven by increased penetration and adoption of our 3D sensing products  We expect 3D sensing revenue to decline seasonally for the remainder of fiscal year 2020 but be up year on year  reflecting increased customer diversification  We expect 3D sensing to continue its growth momentum driven by the continued technology adoption  Viavi is a technology leader in 3D sensing optical filters and diffusers with a strong IP portfolio  In January  we announced settlement of several IP claims regarding our optical filter patents  including an agreement with LG Electronics and LG Innotek  as well as a licensing agreement with Sonet Optical  We are pleased with our enforcement efforts to date and continue to pursue IP claims against multiple companies in several countries  Anticounterfeiting revenue came in as expected driven mostly by bank note reprint demand  We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of fiscal 2020  The bank note redesign pipeline remains robust  However  there is limited visibility for major currency redesign launches over the next several quarters  Lastly  in December  Viavi went live with our new ERP system  We have been working on upgrading our ERP system for the past two years as part of our continuous operational transformation  Improving operational effectiveness  combined with strong secular growth in 5G wireless  fiber and 3D sensing  positions us well to continue growing our top line and expanding profitability  In conclusion  I would like to thank my Viavi team for another quarter of strong performance and express my appreciation to our customers and our shareholders for their support  I will now turn the call over to Bill Bill Ong    Head of Investor Relations Thank you  Oleg  This quarter  we will be participating in Morgan Stanley s TMT investor conference on March 4  taking place in San Francisco  Chris  let s begin the question and answer session  We ask everyone to limit discussion to one question and one follow up  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Your first question is from John Marchetti with Stifel  Your line is open John Marchetti    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Thanks very much  Oleg  I was hoping maybe you could spend a minute and just talk about some of the geographic trends  Just looking at the numbers that you reported  it seemed like Europe was actually up pretty strongly on a sequential basis  You had APAC down almost about the same amount  Curious if you could just spend a little bit of time on some of the different growth categories and how you re seeing that play out a little bit geographically right now Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So I think  generally  our geographic mix that we are driving is about kind of a third  a third  a third  although  I d say  U S     North America has been up stronger like in high 30s  Last quarter  Europe was also in the mid  to high 30s  And Asia was down  I think it s really driven by the timing of some of the major orders  In Asia  we sell a lot less  what I would call  service provider test instrumentation  Most of our Asia sales are    on the NSE side are lab and production  And there  we kind of    we go with the cyclicality of procurement by our major NAM customers  as well as some of the major fiber optic module suppliers  The other thing is    also is how our sales get booked on the anticounterfeiting and where the orders are coming from  So I wouldn t read too much into the regional volatility  but I would just say a few big orders coming in in Europe can sway the European mix  And next quarter  you may see a big order in Asia that will reverse the trend  Aside from that  I wouldn t read too much into the regional mix Amar Maletira    Chief Financial Officer And just to add just very quickly here  On the Asia  you see 12  growth on a year on year basis  To Oleg s point  that also includes strength in 3D sensing business because we typically ship it to the Asian supply chain there  So that is reflected in that    in those numbers John Marchetti    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Great  And then  Amar  just maybe on the guidance itself  Just curious if there s any expected impact or something built into that guidance from the coronavirus stuff that s going on now in China and how that maybe impacts either your ability to meet demand or some of the demand that you re seeing out of China right now with the    at least with the extra week of the shutdown for New Year Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer So this is Oleg  I ll start  and then Amar can continue  So in terms of our guidance  clearly  we now have good three weeks    three  four weeks of visibility into all the health issues going on in Asia  So at this point  our forecast and guidance pretty much includes up to date information on any potential cost impacts  as well as some of the revenue impact  Now in terms of the revenue  top line  China is not a major customer for us for service provider instrumentation  It s mostly anticounterfeiting  as well as the 3D sensing and lab and production  In that respect  the impact on the revenue there  at this point  is somewhat limited because a lot of the demand can be met with the inventories  Obviously  if a Chinese supply chain shutdown gets extended for a longer period in the next one or two weeks  we may see some potential disruption in the supply chain for various components  And obviously  even though we    our supply chain is not going to be impacted  the customers  end demand may get impacted  So at this point  I m not going to speculate what might happen  I ll just say that everything that we know up to date today is factored into our forecast  Now on the cost side  we are expecting to see a bit more of an under absorption in our factories in China given the extended shutdown after Chinese New Year  But as I said  that s also factored into our gross margin guidance for this quarter  Amar Amar Maletira    Chief Financial Officer Yes  I think you covered it well  so a little bit on the revenue side  We have factored in the revenue impact up to about maybe 1 5 to 2 percentage points of the total revenue given our exposure in China  As Oleg mentioned  we do not sell a lot of field instruments into China  It s mainly    on the NSE side  it s mainly lab to high end  highly differentiated products that go into lab and production  And then to the extent our business on the OSP side will get impacted on 3D sensing  we have factored that in  too  But mainly  I think the bigger impact will be on under absorption  and that s already baked into the guidance John Marchetti    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Thank you very much OperatorYour next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham  Your line is open Alex Henderson    Needham and Company    Analyst Yes  So I was hoping you could help us out a little bit with some of the OSP numbers  excluding 3D for a second  So was that fairly flat  I know you don t want to break out the exact number  but the trajectory would be very helpful Amar Maletira    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So Alex  sequentially  it was slightly up  But for the full year of fiscal  20  we still expect it to be averaging about  50 million a quarter  So  200 million  the baseline business is still intact in the core OSP business Alex Henderson    Needham and Company    Analyst If I could Amar Maletira    Chief Financial Officer Yes  go ahead Alex Henderson    Needham and Company    Analyst So do you see    in the calendar  20 time frame  do you    I mean  that s kind of baseline of    without any major prints  I m assuming  So are we assuming  at some point  there ll be some prints in the back half of the calendar year Amar Maletira    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So this assumes    so in the first half of the calendar 2020  we re assuming the normal reprint volumes  which is the baseline business  And for the second half to the extent we have visibility into the funnel for the redesigns  we do expect some redesigns in the second half  And I think we should be updating you guys when we announce the results for our March quarter  so I think that s where we are  We do expect some redesigns  But at this point in time  the visibility is not very clear Alex Henderson    Needham and Company    Analyst If I could just ask one last one really quickly  The SE business spiked up quite a bit  Is that seasonal  How should we be modeling that  How should we be thinking about that in the next couple of quarters  Should we assume that that success continues  But with the seasonal decline and then a seasonal rebound and the seasonally stronger June quarter  any kind of trajectory would be very helpful Amar Maletira    Chief Financial Officer Sure  I think we did have a record performance in our SE business for the first time in    since    from    I think since Viavi was formed  this is the first time this business actually grew 10 6  year on year  Two things happened there  One is  as you recall  we mentioned for a data center business in our September quarter  we did see some pushout of orders into December quarter  Market conditions improved  Our execution was really good  and we were able to capture those orders  and so it was a very strong quarter for our data center business  Similarly  for our growth assurance business  we also saw the business executing quite well  and we were able to get some acceptances  So that s how we saw sequential growth from a low of  20 9 million to  31 plus million in our fiscal Q2  Now going forward  I think our guidance for SE business is the same  We believe that this business on an average quarterly basis should be roughly about  25 million per quarter for at least fiscal  20  And this is    fiscal  20 should be considered as a year of stabilization before we pivot this business to grow in fiscal  21  So in fiscal Q3  which is our March quarter  I expect it to sequentially go down from the  31 2 million that we posted in the December quarter to roughly about  25 million in the March quarter  So it will be down close to about 20  sequentially  Perfect  Thank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna  Your line is open Mehdi Hosseini    Susquehanna International Group    Analyst Yes  Thanks for taking my questions  A couple of follow ups  I want to dive into the 400 gig upgrade  How do you see the market evolving  And how do you see that trending into the second half  Should we expect a material pickup from the first half calendar year into the second half  And I have a follow up Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Sure  We ve been selling a lot of our 400 gig gear to the lab at the NAMs customers for now several years  We are now starting to see demand being very robust for the production equipment for both modules  as well as the equipment  So we do see strong demand from customers emerging  and I would imagine that 400 gig is going to continue to gain momentum throughout the calendar year  And we ll see    we have a robust pipeline of orders for both production  as well as the continued lab test and measurement Mehdi Hosseini    Susquehanna International Group    Analyst Great  And as a follow up  I imagine the same would be with some of your field test instrument  especially as the installed 5G base stations turn on  So I imagine in the second half  you should have a much    we should see some growth in unit shipment  So in that context  given the fact that maybe there is some underutilization happening in the first half  should we see operating margin nicely rebounding into the second half and perhaps hitting your targeted range from the first half into the second half Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  I think  generally  for us  the first    September and the March quarters are the weaker quarters  and the December and June quarters are the stronger quarters  So we always get more operating leverage in the December and June quarters  right  Now in terms of the 5G  we have a pretty good demand pipeline for 5G lab equipment  And as we ve been telling for now quite some time  in terms of field deployment  we were more conservative into our outlook how the operators will deploy 5G infrastructure  And I think  largely  given the latest updates from major carriers  we    it s very much in line with our expectations  So we do expect to start seeing 5G field instrumentation demand starting to ramp in the second half of the calendar year or toward the end and early next calendar year because I think that s kind of the timing when I d say physically  many carriers will be able to do any kind of meaningful infrastructure deployment  So I would say  as a rule of thumb  we get more operating leverage in the December quarter  as well as the June quarter  less operating leverage in the March and the September quarter Mehdi Hosseini    Susquehanna International Group    Analyst Great  Thank you OperatorYour next question is from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital  Your line is open Tim Savageaux    Northland Securities    Analyst Hi  Good afternoon  I wanted to start focusing on the growth you re able to show  really  in any year in the CommTest business in general  Clearly  you re working on a tough comp last year with a pretty significant either catch up or budget flush type spend  and yet  you were able to kind of grow on that even in the NE business  I wonder if you could talk about what the drivers were there  where the unexpected strength might have been  Did you  in fact  see some degree of budget flush in the quarter  Or from a product standpoint  whether it s 5G or fiber  did you see something more than you expected Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer So I will start  and I ll let Amar continue  So I think    listen  I mean  there were some puts and some takes  I mean  for example    I mean  clearly  December quarter last calendar year was a very strong quarter  But also remember  the September quarter in the prior year was very weak  This time around  we had a very strong September quarter and very strong December quarter  So some of the revenue that we normally would have maybe taken in December might have fallen into September quarter  So that alone  I think    overall  if you look at the half on half  the growth is much more meaningful than just purely comparing quarter on quarter  Also  last December quarter  we had a very strong demand for anticounterfeiting  which this time around was more or less baseline  But that was fairly compensated by higher demand for 3D sensing  So if I d look at it what really drove our December quarter this time around  it was really a multifaceted strength across all our major markets  the fiber  the 3D sensing and 5G  So there was no one  I would say  bluebird that kind of carried the way  And I d say    the other thing I would add is the    we did have some uptick on the cable  but that was more of a    not a major wave  but like a secondary wave  where some of the North American and European customers came in and placed secondary orders for the upgrade of their DOCSIS 3 1  So that kind of helped us a bit to push the revenue a bit higher  As to any kind of budget flushes  I really don t believe this year we saw anything that would qualify as a budget flush  Pretty much everything that we shipped was in our pipeline  I classify budget flush as something that we did not expect at the beginning of the quarter and it appeared during the quarter  Most of the revenue this quarter was pretty much    I mean  December quarter was pretty much the revenue that we had in our pipeline  Amar  anything else to add Amar Maletira    Chief Financial Officer Yes  I think you quoted well  So we    when you look at the beat  I think  Tim  that s where you re also going versus our expectation  At the beginning of the quarter  we did see a good beat  both in the NSE business  And within NSE  it is    also SE contributed to it  The data center business  as I mentioned  we did see pushout of deals from  say  fiscal Q1  which is September quarter into December quarter  and we were able to go execute and the market conditions improved  And so SE also contributed to the beat in addition to NE  In NE  we are seeing strength  Clearly  we re seeing strength in lab and production on the optical side  as well as on the lab wireless side  And as Oleg mentioned  cable products was also strong  But again  this is probably the secondary wave Tim Savageaux    Northland Securities    Analyst Got it  And if I could just follow up quickly on that  There s been some concern out there  given reports from various component system suppliers about some sort of pause in 5G spend or deployment  Given your results in the quarter and I guess  likely  your outlook  as well as your comments about calendar  20  you don t seem to be seeing that  I wonder if you might be able to kind of help us reconcile some of these conflicting data points Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  I don t think there s conflicting data points  I think if you kind of recall  in all our communication  we were always consistently more conservative as how the 5G rollout is going to happen and we ve guided accordingly  So as a result  it all comes down to what were your expectations and what you communicated  So I think we are pretty much in line with what we were saying  and it s pretty much    playing out pretty much along the scenario that we have laid out  In other words  we didn t overhype it Tim Savageaux    Northland Securities    Analyst OK  understood  Thanks  and congrats on a strong quarter OperatorYour next question is from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners  Your line is open Michael Genovese    MKM Partners    Analyst Thanks very much  Earlier today  a company that s in the 3D sense supply chain talked about world facing as an opportunity for early fiscal  21  And I m just curious to what extent does that add to your TAM and to your expectations as we get into second half of the calendar year Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  clearly  depending on what the timing will be  I m not going to speculate on the timing  But if it does happen earlier  it ll be an upside  If it gets delayed  it will get delayed  So I think  Mike  I m not going to speculate on any particular timing because  I mean  remember  if you re talking about lasers  customers might buy laser several quarters in advance of the major ramp  We are supplying much more just in time  So we get the orders when the business materializes Michael Genovese    MKM Partners    Analyst OK  Oleg  if we were going to go from one 3D module per phone to two  does that double your TAM  Or does it add 50  to it at that customer  How should we think of that Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  I think it really will come down to what the margin looks like  So the sensors in    like world facing are somewhat smaller  so it s a smaller area  So the ASPs in that area are smaller  So I wouldn t    I won t say double  but it increases meaningfully  But also  you have to then run into assumption of how many models would deploy  right  I mean    so if it s only one model and it s a high end model then the incremental volume and revenues  they re not going to be that significant  If it s across the board  the whole pallet of products  clearly  then it s meaningful  So you got to look at it    the ASP  which is driven by the area of the world facing module  but then also what assumptions you are making on how many models and what volumes of those models are going to be built  So I mean  listen  I would take    if I was a kind of betting man for the second half of this year  I think it s going to be an upside  but I don t think it s going to be a huge upside Michael Genovese    MKM Partners    Analyst Great  That s a very helpful way to think about it  And then just finally for me since you ve mentioned it on previous calls  800 g  just I think is a lab test opportunity in optical and fiber  Just    I think you mentioned it one or two quarters ago  Is there anything    any update on that business  Or is it  Inaudible Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  I think that s a very much advanced R D  right  So that s really something that people are still playing in a lab  So it s far from production  but it s    we start    remember  we were shipping 400 gig about five years ago  So it just tells you only now a lot of it is becoming a reality  So I would say 800 gig would put you somewhere in line for 2016 in terms of the demand Michael Genovese    MKM Partners    Analyst All right  Thanks very much OperatorYour next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan  Your line is open Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hey  thanks for taking my question  Oleg  I just wanted to start off with asking for your thoughts or how you view the opportunity for Viavi around some of the forced vendor changes in the network  So for example  if the U K  decision on Huawei forces some changes in the vendor landscape there  do you see it as an opportunity as some of the 5G vendors  as well as 4G vendors  get reworked Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  I think the    I mean  we work with all companies in various capacities  In case of the 5G wireless  pretty much everybody  with the exception of Huawei  is largely a merchant customer  right  They buy their test systems  In many cases  companies like Huawei  our biggest competition there  is internal sourcing  And so in that respect  we don t have much exposure to Huawei 5G spend  So to the extent there is more restriction rather than less restriction and one of the other customers picks up more business  I d say it s marginally positive for us Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    Analyst Got it  And if I can just follow up on    you ve already talked about the visibility on the 5G wireless field deployment and the timing being late calendar 2020  Just kind of wanted to see if you can give more details as to what the service providers are saying  why the service providers are feeling more confident about the timing at this point  which is kind of improving your confidence in that and kind of how you re thinking about which geographies go first in that kind of timing Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Well    listen  I ve been talking about it for many quarters  I mean  let s separate the hype versus reality  Everybody has got the marketing story on 5G  and then there is a real physical story of deploying 5G  As we were saying all along  5G is a vastly different technology with a different topology  So before you go deploy it and spend money  all the operators  they re very financially astute  They re going to take all the vendors  and they re going to apply a principle of show me  Basically  here s your test market  go deploy it and show me all the benefits that I will be able to get  show me how my customers are going to benefit  And most importantly  show me the economics of this solution  Now on the other hand  the  Inaudible  field  they got to show something  So there is going to be an element of being able to put a checkmark that they have a 5G product available  So then comes a story    clearly  there is a    economic wise  it s an interesting technology  and it could open new revenue streams for many operators  But then comes a point of physical deployment that means you got to have physical people  physical trucks  physical equipment get provisioned in the field  connected in the field  installed  calibrated  so on and so forth  When you start talking about that whole thing and take into consideration that 5G ultimately will have five to six times as many location    sites as 4G  you start realizing just how big an undertaking it is  And my view is that operators will roll it out within    with a certain level of cadence that allows them to maintain their current level of operations and not expand their network operations significantly or increase their headcount  So that s why I m more skeptical at the speed and velocity of 5G spend by operators and how quickly it all gets deployed Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thank you  Thanks for taking the questions Oleg Khaykin    President and Chief Executive Officer Sure OperatorAnd our last question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Great  Thanks  I just wanted to kind of get into the 3D settlements or kind of settlements that you guys had on the filter business during the quarter and just kind of what use cases were you able to go after those four  And just kind of what was the process of settlement  And then maybe just kind of speaking to the success that you guys

174099,395615,VIAV,4 Telecom Stocks Likely To Surpass Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"The U S  telecommunications industry is apparently on the cusp of a digital revolution with leading carriers increasingly deploying 5G technology in select cities across the country and aiming for a nationwide rollout in the near future  Sweeping government reforms and a historic merger approval were the other hallmarks in the fourth quarter that reshaped the sector dynamics to weed off the uncertainty triggered by the prolonged trade war   The industry faced a gamut of trade restrictions and tariffs that affected its supply chain mechanism and dented profitability  The Sino U S  tariff war virtually led to intense technology warfare between the two superpowers of the global economy  forcing the industry to get polarized into two halves  bringing an element of uncertainty within the rank and files of the telecom sector Factors at Play  5G Wave5G is billed as the technology of the future with faster download speed and seamless transfer of data  Leveraging state of the art communication network architectures  5G is touted to be the primary catalyst for next generation IoT services  These include connected cars coupled with augmented reality and virtual reality platform  smart cities and connected devices that revolutionize key industry verticals Superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost necessity in managing the exponential growth of IoT  Moreover  5G technology is likely to augment the scalability  security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry  which is expected to propel the wide proliferation of IoT  According to data from research firm  IHS Markit  5G is expected to enable  13 2 trillion of global economic output by 2035  Consequently  U S  telecom firms are moving ahead with steady investments to upgrade the networks with state of the art technology for faster 5G deployment Sweeping ReformsIn a landmark decision  the Federal Communications Commission   FCC   voted unanimously in favor of splitting the spectrum block earmarked for auto safety for use by wireless devices to meet the exponential growth of bandwidth due to increased 5G deployment  The plan seeks to allocate 45 MHz for Wi Fi use and set aside the remaining 30 MHz for auto safety  The allocation is based on the perceived importance of Wi Fi  which is likely to double by 2023 to more than  1 trillion  according to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  Out of the 30 MHz spectrum band assigned for auto safety  20 MHz will be allotted for a newer version of vehicle to everything communications or V2X technology  known as cellular vehicle to everything or C V2X  and the remainder for the legacy DSRC safety system The Senate passed the anti robocall bill  paving the way for the President to formally sign it into a law  Dubbed the TRACED Act  for Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence  the bill mandates telecom firms to offer free call blocking apps to thwart spam calls  The Senate also passed the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability  DATA  Act that enables the FCC to collect more precise data from wired  fixed wireless  and satellite broadband providers to get a better understanding of the nationwide broadband coverage  This is likely to bridge the urban rural digital divide and foster the development of high speed Internet connectivity across the country Industry ConsolidationThe U S  Department of Justice finally gave green signal to the merger of T Mobile with Sprint   the third and the fourth largest wireless companies in the country  Allaying antitrust concerns  the authorities observed that the merger would create an entity that would thwart the dominance of China in the 5G market and benefit the larger community with superior rural broadband coverage  In addition  a  5 billion deal with Dish Network for divesting Sprint s prepaid wireless businesses  including Boost Mobile  and some of its spectrum cleared the decks for the formation of a new entity  The agreement established Dish as a disruptive force in the wireless industry  redefining the broader industry metrics How to Pick A multitude of telecom stocks are likely to report earnings in the coming weeks  Solid earnings results of the telecom sector could sow the seeds for future investments in network and 5G enabled devices for superior 5G readiness Amid a diverse range of companies  picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a colossal task  While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  our proprietary methodology makes the choice fairly simple Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold

174101,395617,VIAV,Telecom Stock Roundup  Verizon  Woodward s Top Line Increases   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks continued to mirror the broader S P 500 Index and initially trended down amid escalated fears of the coronavirus outbreak hurting the global economy  With the contagious disease spreading across the world despite precautionary measures and 12 positive cases confirmed in the United States to date  the markets remained apprehensive about possible repercussions  However  solid quarterly performance led by technology  energy  financials and healthcare sectors helped the markets to shrug off the negativity and script a turnaround at the later stages of the week China has been one of the most important markets for U S  telecom firms  Despite quarantines and other safety measures  coronavirus  which originated in Wuhan  China  managed to spread  affecting more than 24 000 people in the mainland and killing nearly 500  This disrupted normal business operations and supply chain mechanisms of various companies as they preferred to exercise caution and held their delivery schedules to and from the communist nation until the health risks were neutralized  This  in turn  triggered uncertainty within the industry  inducing a downtrend    Meanwhile  the Trump administration is stepping up efforts to encourage domestic firms in developing common engineering standards for 5G networks to thwart the dominance of China based telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei  The government is also reportedly tapping technology behemoths like Dell and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  to build 5G centric hardware so that the bulk of 5G architecture and infrastructure is made by U S  firms with Nordic firms with long term ties to the Silicon Valley like Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Nokia  HE NOKIA  also pitching in  The 5G thrust is possibly gaining precedence as coronavirus has hampered the pace of 5G deployment in the communist nation In a follow up of the U S  Department of Justice s enforcement action last week that sought temporary restraining orders on five domestic companies for fostering the robocall menace  the Federal Communications Commission has asked seven gateway service providers to help trace the international spam calls to its roots  It also sent letters to 19 Voice over Internet Protocol service providers  warning them of legal actions for facilitating illegal telemarketing or robocalling Regarding company specific news  quarterly earnings primarily took the center stage over the past five trading days Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1      Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   reported solid fourth quarter 2019 results  primarily led by the wireless business  With industry

174180,395696,VIAV,Altice Poised For Solid Growth With Core Focus  Risks Remain,opinion,On Apr 9  we issued an updated research report on Altice USA  Inc    NYSE ATUS    one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers in the United States Altice is on track with its five year plan to build a FTTH  fiber to the home  network and deploy its new home communications hub  The company believes the FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements  fewer service outages and lower power usage  which is likely to lead to further cost efficiencies  This network will allow Altice to satisfy demand for increasing speeds and support evolving technologies  such as the expected transition of mobile networks to 5G and enable it to capitalize on associated revenue growth opportunities At the same time  the company has been rolling out enhanced data and services for its business customers  Altice Business  which was formed by clubbing its Lightpath  Optimum and Suddenlink business brands under a single umbrella  offers the best in class data  voice  video and managed services to about 2 million customers  As part of this effort  Altice Business has standardized its product portfolio footprint wide  providing customers with access to services that meet their needs  regardless of size or region  and creating more value and choice  Additionally  the company is building a next generation fiber network capable of delivering broadband speeds of 10 Gbps  reflecting Altice s continued investment in technology and innovation for its customers in the United States Altice also augmented its market position as a pioneer in the advertising business with the launch of a4   an advanced advertising tool   to provide audience based  multiscreen advertising solutions for its clients  With this  the company has successfully implemented its strategic plan to strengthen footprint in digital advertising through multiple acquisitions and investments     From being the first MVPD  multichannel video programming distributor  partner to offer addressable advertising solutions in the New York DMA  Altice has evolved as a leading player in this segment and has subsequently created a niche market for itself  This was achieved through the acquisitions of Cablevision  NYSE CVC  in 2015  followed by Audience Partners  a leading provider of authenticated IP addressability technology  and Placemedia  a premier provider of programmatic ad solutions for OTT and on demand television With the successful integration of these businesses with Cablevision s advertising and data business  Altice has brought to the fore unique skill sets for advertisers to identify the target audience across screens and local and national TV  They can then create an effective media plan  execute the buy and measure cross screen reach  frequency and attribution to measure the efficacy of the program Leveraging the superior reach of a4  advertisers can reportedly extend their content to more than 90 million households  85  of broadband subscribers and 1 billion devices in the United States  This would significantly benefit advertisers to screen their advertising messages to target pool of audience  thereby reducing operating costs However  Altice has underperformed the  with an average loss of 18 7  in the last three months compared with a decline of 10 2  for the latter  The company operates in a highly competitive industry against a variety of broadband  pay television and telephony providers and delivery systems  including broadband communications companies  wireless data and telephony providers  video signals  video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers  Moreover  consumers  selection of an alternate source of service due to economic constraints  technological advances or preference can curb demand for the company s services  The company s ability to increase the number of subscribers of its services is highly dependent on penetration rates Moreover  Altice s programming costs increased 4 7  year over year in fourth quarter 2017 primarily due to a rise in contractual programming rates  partially offset by the decrease in video customers  We expect programming costs per customer to increase going forward Nevertheless  we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  Some better ranked stocks in the industry are Arista Networks  Inc    NYSE ANET    Viavi Solutions Inc    NASDAQ VIAV   and Westell Technologies  Inc

174217,395733,VIAV,5 Sensibly Priced Breakout Stocks,opinion,Probably one of the most favored methods for those utilizing an active investing approach  picking breakout stocks offers the promise of substantial returns  This method involved zeroing on those stocks whose prices are varying within a narrow band  If the price of the stock falls below this channel  it could be the best time to sell of this stock  However  the best time to buy a stock as per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band  Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains Spotting Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  the demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those which have just breached this level Has a Genuine Breakout Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a bona fide breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends  The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive    Current Price  52 Week High greater than or equal to 0 9  Stocks which are trading 90  close to their 52 week highs    Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through    Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2  Stocks which move by a greater degree than the broader market but within a reasonable limit    Current price less than or equal to  15  Stocks which are reasonably priced  These criteria narrow down the universe of over 7 000 stocks to only 13 Here are the top 5 stocks that meet these criteria AXT Inc    NASDAQ AXTI   is a designer  developer  manufacturer and distributor of single and compound element semiconductor substrates  It has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and its

VIAV Technical Analysis

VIAV opened trading yesterday at  10 78 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  10 75  VIAV closed trading yesterday at  10 63 and spiked down after market to  10 20  equivalent to a 4  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time VIAV traded below these levels we have to go back to May 2nd when it traded at  10 13 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down VIAV had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to July 25th when it traded at  11 48  VIAV has a float of 226 06 million shares and traded 1 67 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see VIAV open trading on Wednesday below  10 35 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 10 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

174241,395757,VIAV,Three Proven Keys To Contrarian Investing,opinion,Over the course of my career  I ve gone out on a limb multiple times In the summer of 2008  when oil topped  140 barrel   and Wall Street banks predicated a  super spike  to  200   I told readers to sell it short  Within five months  oil tanked more than 70  In August 2009  everyone hated the U S  dollar  Heck  foreign governments even publicly jawboned about the need for a stronger reserve currency  And the euro was everyone s choice as a replacement  which seems laughable now  Yet I told readers to bet on the almighty dollar and bet against the euro  Those who listened profited handsomely I insisted that readers buy the auction house  Sotheby s  BID   when everyone else thought it was heading for the chopping block Then I urged a bullish stance on JDS Uniphase  JDSU  when everyone else left it for dead And there s no doubt that longtime readers recall my multiple recommendations to short Facebook  FB    before it even went public Now  I m not bringing any of this up to brag  Instead  I want to prove a point In isolation  each bold call above seems wonderfully lucky   and can be quickly ignored  Collectively  however  these predictions can t be so easily dismissed So how d I do it Simply put  I cheated  That is  I relied on the help of the world s greatest investors  And today  I want to show you how you can do it  too You re Either a Contrarian or a VictimIt may shock you  but unlike everyday Wall Street types  the world s greatest investors don t believe in keeping secrets  They freely share their profit strategies Mind you  this benevolence doesn t just come from their exploding net worth  They just have zero confidence in the average investor s ability to master their strategies We re certainly not average investors  though  And I have all the confidence in the world that we can put their invaluable insights to work for our ultimate profit So listen up From Sir John Templeton we get this nugget of wisdom   It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something that is different from the majority  Warren Buffett advises   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  And Silicon Valley venture capitalist extraordinaire  Bill Gurley  says   You can only make money by being right about something that most people think is wrong  Or  to sum them all up  the key to minting riches in the stock market boils down to this  Be a contrarian  That s easier said than done  of course  But it s imperative if we want to maximize our profits  Now  I ve spent the better part of a decade fine tuning my contrarian investing skills  I ve taken some lumps along the way  After all  nobody s perfect  In the process  though  I ve been able to boil down contrarian investing to three simple  yet powerful  keys  Follow them  and I m absolutely convinced you ll become a more disciplined and profitable investor ,2013-05-13,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/three-proven-keys-to-contrarian-investing-166629,166629

174243,395759,VIAV,These ETFs Are Far From Trend,opinion,"Are investors cautiously optimistic  Probably  A little bit greedy  Maybe  Yet I would be hard pressed to describe the current psychology in terms of  euphoria   The most apt descriptor is  complacency  
No Stopping It 
Keep in mind  geopolitical tensions are rising in the Middle East  Ukraine and off the coastal waters near China  Not surprisingly  gasoline prices have remained stubbornly high with the price of Crude Oil holding well above  100 per barrel  Yet none of these troubles have impeded the historic rally for U S  stocks 
Junk bonds and investment grade bonds have compressed to dangerously narrow spreads  Similarly  the CBOE S P 500 VIX Volatility Index is pushing single digits  10 5   Both of these circumstances reflect levels last seen in 2007   levels associated with the previous bear market s beginning  Meanwhile  the equity put call ratio as well as adviser sentiment readings illustrate a calmness that is eerily reminiscent of the late 1990s  And perhaps most telling  The S P 500 has stayed above a 200 day trendline for 400 trading sessions   the longest stretch in the history of benchmark 

Ironically  the fact that the S P 500 s current price is 8  above its 200 day moving average is not particularly alarming  Even a reversion to this particular mean would constitute corrective activity that many regard as healthy for the uptrend s longevity  Nevertheless  an 8  pullback in the popular benchmark would likely come with selling activity in risk assets across the equity board  Moreover  the most susceptible stock ETFs might be those that have deviated the most from a respective mean 
Here s an accounting of asset groupings that have traveled the furthest above a 200 day trendline 
1  Biotech Pharma  In March of this year  the biotech pharma boom seemed as if it were pining for an ignominious conclusion  Momentum  faves  like FirstTrust Amex Biotech  NYSE FBT  and SPDR S P Pharmaceuticals  NYSE XPH  gave up 13 3  and 19 7  respectively  Then came the April May turnaround  Not only did these resilient sub sectors fend off the bear during the harsh correction  but FBT and XPH are hitting record highs once again 
On the other hand  the dot com bust in March of 2000 followed a similar pattern  The highest of flyers from JDS Uniphase  NASDAQ JDSU  to Sun Microsystems rallied back into August of 2000 before the  New Economy  tablecloth had been yanked for good  FBT and XPH are susceptible to dramatic selling pressure with prices more than 15  above the long term trend 

2   Oil Services  Energy stocks tends to outperform when oil prices remain elevated and when conflicts break out in oil producing regions of the world  From Russia to Iraq to Syria   even recent concerns in Israel   only seem to bolster energy production and exploration stock prices 
That said  it is the oil services companies that have been getting the biggest boost lately  The only problem  The last two times that exchange traded trackers like Market Vectors Oil Services  ARCA OIH  and iShares DJSU Oil Equipment   Serv   NYSE IEZ  rose more than 15  above respective long term trends   February of 2013 and November of 2014   each ETF reverted back to its 200 day moving average  Additionally  Relative Strength Index  RSI  readings above 70 advance the case that the sub sector is decidedly overbought 

3  Semiconductors  Historically speaking  semiconductor stocks tend to lead the way in economic recoveries  Of course  the below trend GDP expansion over the last five years has not been typical  Many folks believe that the recovery is just now   here in 2014   just getting ready to fire on all cylinders 
Semiconductor ETF investors seem to think so  Investors in SPDR S P Semiconductor  NYSE XSD  have garnered unrealized gains of 25  plus in the first half of 2014 alone  By the same token   semis  may be ultra sensitive to a summertime swoon  Both XSD and Market Vectors Semiconductor  NYSE SMH   are more than 15  above their trendlines ",2014-07-03,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-etfs-are-far-from-trend-218335,218335
