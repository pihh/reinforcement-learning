Communications   NASDAQ CHTR   and DISH Network   NASDAQ DISH   continued to lose voice  video and Pay TV subscribers due to persistent cord cutting and stiff competition from streaming services like

33485,255000,SSP,TV Broadcast Stocks Plunge On Weak Election Ad Spending,opinion,The U S  broadcast TV industry is currently in the doldrums  The year 2016 was expected to bring a substantial windfall for the industry as the upcoming Presidential elections usually results in increased political advertisement spending  In Apr 2016  Moody s Investor Services projected an increase of 18  in ad revenues for TV broadcasters from the Presidential elections in 2012 However  the ground reality is strikingly different from the projections  Soft advertisement spending by presidential nominees  especially by Republican candidate Donald Trump  has made the situation glum for TV broadcasters  With just one and a half month to go for the election  most of the TV broadcasters and analysts are of the opinion that actual political ad spending may be much lower than that in 2012   TV Ads  Out of Vogue Many industry researchers wonder whether the current situation is a result of the unorthodox approach by the Trump camp or is an indication that spending money on TV advertisements is gradually becoming irrelevant for political superstars  At the moment  it appears that Trump s lukewarm approach toward TV ad is the primary reason According to a Wesleyan Media Project report  89 000 TV political campaigns were aired nationally between Aug 19 and Sep 15  2016  down a significant 42  from the comparable period in 2012  Of the total  Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and her supporters aired about 62 000 ads whereas just 27 000 ads were aired by the Trump camp As per the Federal Election Commission  in 2012  Republican nominee Mitt Romney spent nearly  50 million on advertising through July to September while Mr  Trump spent a mere  20 million  Clinton s ad spending is in close proximity to that of Barack Obama in 2012  During the Jul Sep cycle  Obama spent  111 million on TV ads while Clinton spent  108 million Whatever may be the reason  an overenthusiastic broadcast TV industry  which was thinking of a greater bonanza from political ads this year compared with the last Presidential election  is in nowhere near to the expectation so far Market Reacts As several TV broadcasters have started slashing their revenue estimates from political ad spending and various brokerage firms started predicting a soft ad market  stock prices of various leading broadcast TV operators took a beating in the first three trading sessions of this week Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc    NASDAQ SBGI    which recently cut its guidance for political add sales declined 9 82  so far this week  Sinclair currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Other major TV broadcasters which were affected include  Gray Television Inc    NYSE GTN    The E  W  Scripps Co    NYSE SSP    Tribune Media Co    NYSE TRCO   and CBS Corp    NYSE CBS   which lost 8 8   7 70   6 47  and 3 30   respectively  In addition  leading TV operators like TEGNA Inc   Nexstar Broadcasting Group Inc  and Meredith Corp  also witnessed a considerable slide in their respective stock prices Bottom Line Many industry watchers are hopeful that things may take a positive turn as the elections approach  The industry may receive a boost from an uptick in political ad spending  However  if the situation remains the same and if Trump finally wins the election  there are possibilities that soft spending on political ads on TV will become the new trend Now See Our Private Investment IdeasWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public  other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members  Would you like to peek behind the curtain and view them  Starting today  for the next month  you can follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum       from stocks under  10 to ETF and option moves       from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ,2016-09-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tv-broadcast-stocks-plunge-on-weak-election-ad-spending-200154973,200154973

33497,255012,SSP,U S  broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,news,"By Sin ad Carew  Reuters    Local TV companies such as Sinclair Broadcast Group  O SBGI  and Gray Television  N GTN  are set for a significant political advertising boost this year as candidates and special interest groups are spending heavily to woo voters in mid term elections   Demand for commercial airtime is particularly strong ahead of elections for one third of the U S  Senate seats  and all 435 House of Representatives seats as well as positions such as state governorships  because U S  President Donald Trump s Republican party is fighting to keep its majority in both houses of Congress while Democrats are battling to turn the tables   Politicians and their supporters from both political parties are looking to win voters with their stances on hot button issues such as gun control and abortion rights    There s a lot of excitement and probably a lot of paranoia and a lot of fear  and those things drive political dollars   Kevin Latek  chief legal and development officer at Gray Television  told investors on Tuesday  according to a conference call transcript   Gray posted second quarter political ad revenue of  18 1 million  20 percent above the high end of its forecast and 9 percent above the same quarter in 2014  the last mid term election year  Political ads brought about 7 percent of total second quarter revenue at Gray  which forecast a third quarter range of  41 million to  45 million for the segment versus  41 million in 2014   After reporting bumper second quarter political revenue on Wednesday  Sinclair raised its 2018 target for the segment to  160 million from a range of  140 million to  150 million  The new target would be 5 8 percent of total revenue  according to analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters data   Of course the momentum could change as 80 percent of political ad spending typically occurs between the start of September and election day  which is Nov  6 this year  But analysts are hopeful the early strength will continue    It looks like its going to be a record year even without a Presidential race   said Daniel Kurnos an analyst covering broadcasters at Benchmark Company   For 2018  political advertising could generate  2 4 billion revenue for local broadcasters compared with  2 1 billion in 2014  according to Kantar Media CMAG unit s latest forecast issued in 2017  Steven Passwaiter  vice president and general manager at CMAG  said he aims to update the estimate this month   The 2016 U S  presidential election generated  2 85 billion for local broadcasters  according to Passwaiter  The presidential race tends to attract more advertising dollars than local mid term battles but 2016 spending was much weaker than expected as Trump relied far more on free media than past candidates      That disappointment  which pummeled broadcasters shares in 2016  is fuelling hopes that forecasts are more solid this year    Everybody got burned two years ago because the presidential spend turned out to be a dud  I think these guys are going to be incredibly careful not to raise expectations to disappoint the street again   said Passwaiter   Gray Television shares rose 14 8 percent in the two sessions after its Aug  7 quarterly report  In 2016  the stock fell 24 7 percent from June to October   Sinclair s shares rose 4 percent on Wednesday after its report  although enthusiasm was dampened by the collapse of its effort to buy Tribune Media  N TRCO  Sinclair stock fell 20 6 percent from June to October in 2016   Another local broadcaster E W  Scripps  O SSP   rose 5 7 percent after it reported results on Aug  3 including political ad revenue of  14 9 million  compared with  7 million pro forma political revenue in the 2014 quarter  Political brought 5 3 percent of its total second quarter revenue   Investors are careful about making bets on political revenue for broadcasters as it only shows up every two years  before elections and is unpredictable   The amount a broadcaster generates varies a lot in election years as it depends on how many of their stations serve battleground states where campaigns spend heavily in a particular year for reasons such as close polls   Also  strong demand for political commercials tends to eat into core advertising revenue from clients like carmakers as broadcasters only have a finite number of timeslots  said Leo Kulp  analyst at RBC Capital Management   But even if broadcasters can t bank on future political windfalls  a strong season is still a big positive  according to Kulp   
 What it does is help generate incremental free cash flow  It s going to translate to the companies deleveraging more and giving them more capacity to do M A   he said ",2018-08-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-broadcasters-in-line-for-political-ad-windfall-1569247,1569247

33536,255051,SSP,Time s Ripe For Publishing Stocks  Here s Why,opinion,"The newspaper companies are transforming their business models to better position themselves in a multi platform media universe  According to industry experts  newspaper companies will focus more on mobile devices  online advertising based on user experience and personalized content to make them less dependable on traditional advertising revenues  They are streamlining their cost structure  strengthening their balance sheet and restructuring their portfolio 
 Let s have a look at what is happening in the publishing industry and how newspaper companies are adapting to the changing face of the media to keep themselves fit to run the race for survival Business Reviving Endeavors In an effort to offset declining revenues and shrinking market share  publishers are scrambling to slash costs  This has compelled many newspaper companies to undertake cost cutting measures  such as headcount trimming  pay cuts  furloughs  voluntary retirement programs and closure of printing facilities  Gannett Co Inc s  NYSE GCI  flagship newspaper USA Today trimmed its workforce in September to rein in costs amid dwindling print advertising demand  The move involved the elimination of 60 to 70 staff across the newsroom section and other business operations  Publishing companies have been offloading assets that bear no direct relation with the core operations  The New York Times Company  NYSE NYT  in May 2012 divested its remaining stake  210 Class B units  in the Fenway Sports Group  the owner of the Boston Red Sox and the Liverpool Football Club  for  63 million  Another example of asset shedding by the company is the Dec 2011 sale of Regional Media Group  which was long grappling with shrinking advertising revenues  Waning print advertising revenues  in an uncertain economy  compelled The New York Times Company to take this tough decision of divesting Regional Media Group  part of The New York Times Media Group  This helped the company to re focus on its core newspapers and pay more attention to its online activities  The divestiture was also considered part of the cost containment efforts undertaken to stay afloat in this anemic environment  The New York Times Company on Sep 24  2012 completed the sale of About Group  which it acquired in 2005  to InterActiveCorp       for a consideration of  300 million  In Oct 2012  the company sold its stake in Indeed com  a job portal  for approximately  167 million  The New York Times Company on Oct 24  2013 completed the sale of its New England Media Group  including The Boston Globe and its allied properties to an acquisition company spearheaded by John W  Henry  who owns Fenway Sports Group  Additionally  the company also offloaded its 49  stake in Metro Boston Diversifying Revenue Base  Focusing on Profitable Zones Publishing companies are also diversifying their revenue base  For quite some time now  Gannett has been making endeavors to expand its presence in broadcasting and digital products with the aim of lowering its dependency on its soft print media business as well as traditional advertising and therefore reducing susceptibility to economic conditions  The recent news of Gannett taking over Cars com underscores the same  Cars com gives online visitors price checks  model comparison and dealer reviews  Launched in 1998  Cars com is owned by Classified Ventures  a consortium of five companies  Apart from Gannett  other companies that form the joint venture are Tribune Media Co   The McClatchy Company  NYSE MNI   A  H  Belo Corp  and Graham Holdings   Prior to this  Gannett bought six television stations of London Broadcasting Company and also acquired television station operator  Belo Corp  We believe this will transform Gannett s business model  which was largely focused on low margin newspapers to a high margin multi media business  Gannett also announced that it will split its business into two separate entities  one completely focusing on Broadcasting and Digital businesses and the other concentrating on Publishing  Other publishing companies such as Journal Communications Inc  NYSE JRN  and The EW Scripps Company  NYSE SSP  are also trying to include different revenues generating ways  Both companies entered into a deal to merge their broadcasting operations and spin off the newspaper business into a separate entity  Journal Media Group  The merged broadcast and digital media company  headquartered in Cincinnati  will retain the name of The E W  Scripps Company Pay As You Access  To read further please subscribe  is the new mantra that newspaper companies are fast adopting  To curb shrinking advertising revenues and improve market share battered by the recent economic downturn  some of the publishing companies are now considering charging readers for online content  We believe that this would end the free usage of online content  Despite hiccups in the economy  the online subscription based model still promises guaranteed revenue generation  The New York Times Company fixed monthly charges of  15 for access to more than the restricted number of articles on its website and on a smartphone application   20 for unlimited access online and on Apple Inc  s iPad tablet computer application  and  35 for online  smartphone and iPad application  Moreover  in order to woo subscribers  the company introduced a plan of 99 cents under which one will be able to enjoy all digital offerings for one month  The New York Times Company notified that the number of paid digital subscribers reached 875 000 at the end of the third quarter of 2014  rising 44 000 sequentially and over 20  year over year  The launch of new subscription based digital products such as NYT Now  Times Premier and Cooking product also contributed to the improvement 
The New York Times Company is steadily taking strides to bring in more readers under the ambit of the subscription based model  Gannett also initiated a subscription based model Bottom Line With a strategic and steady newspaper budget  we could see fewer layoffs  increased focus on web and local content  improved subscription and concentration on profitable circulation  We observe newspapers are turning more subscriber oriented  offering reports in line with readers  choice  We expect paywall strategies  new pricing techniques and product innovation to generate more revenues for the newspaper companies  As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic on the newspaper publishing industry over the long term  But what about investing in the space right now  Check out our latest  here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector ",2014-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/time's-ripe-for-publishing-stocks:-here's-why-235374,235374
