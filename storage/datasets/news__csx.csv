Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood afternoon  ladies and gentlemen  and welcome to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Call  As a reminder  today s call is being recorded  During this call  all participants will be in a listen only mode  Following the presentation  we will be conducting a question and answer session   Operator Instructions  For opening remarks and introduction  I would like to turn the call over to Mr  Bill Slater  Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation  you may begin Bill Slater    Chief Investor Relations OfficerThank you  and good afternoon everyone  Joining me on today s call are Jim Foote  President and Chief Executive Officer  Mark Wallace  Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing  Kevin Boone  Chief Financial Officer  and Jamie Boychuk  Executive Vice President of Operations  On Slide 2 is our forward looking disclosure followed by our non GAAP disclosure on Slide 3 With that  it is my pleasure to introduce  President and Chief Executive Officer  Jim Foote James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Bill  and good afternoon  I want to begin by thanking all of our CSX employees for another great job this quarter  They continue to show that they are the best operators in the industry  For both the fourth quarter and full year  they once again broke their own records and set new all time low operating ratios  Our service is the best it has ever been and getting better  The key here is reliability  Our  0 01 23  operating a simpler  more efficient network  we are able to offer rail users a service that is truck like inconsistency  but with lower cost and more environmentally responsible  More shippers are selecting us for their shipping needs when we have tremendous opportunity for growth Let s now turn to Slide 5 of the presentation  Our financial results are straightforward with only a few unique items  which Kevin will point out in a few minutes  Fourth quarter EPS declined 2  to  0 99  The operating ratio improved by 30 basis points to a new record of 60  as continued operating momentum offset top line headwinds  For the full year  EPS increased 9  to  4 17  and the operating ratio improved by 190 basis points to 58 4   These are truly great results considering the industrial economy s second half performance Turning to Slide 6  Fourth quarter revenue declined 8  year over year  due to the continued impact of the softer industrial economy  intermodal lane rationalizations and coal headwinds  Merchandise revenue and volume declined 3  as growth in Ag and Food   Minerals markets was more than offset by declines in chemicals  auto and other markets  The Philadelphia refinery explosion and GM strike accounted for more than two thirds of the volume declines in the quarter  Intermodal revenue declined 9  on 7  lower volume  primarily due to the impact of lane rationalizations implemented around the 2018 peak season  We have now lapped the impact of these changes  Coal revenue decreased 22  on 17  lower volumes with declines in both export and domestic markets  due to the impact of lower export demand and benchmark prices  as well as low natural gas prices  Lastly  other revenue declines resulted from lower storage revenue at intermodal facilities and lower demurrage charges Moving to Slide 7  Let s review our safety performance  The full year personal injury rate declined 15   and we reduced the full year train accident rate by 41   including setting another company record in the fourth quarter for the lowest accident rate  This progress is a result of concerted daily effort on the part of the employees performing the work  At the same time  we still see areas where additional improvement is needed  In 2020  we will maintain our rigorous safety program focused on continuing education of our workforce  further strengthening rules compliance and empowering employees to have the courage to act if they see something unsafe  As I have said before  we will never be satisfied with our performance if just one of our employees gets injured while at work Moving to Slide 8  Let s review our operating performance for the quarter  CSX set new all time Company records for both velocity and dwell achieving significant year over year improvements  as well as strong sequential momentum  The combination of these improved metrics helped significantly increase car miles per day as we continue to translate incremental operating efficiencies into higher asset utilization across the network  We also continue to set fuel efficiency records operating below 1 gallon of fuel per 1 000 GTM despite typical seasonal headwinds in this quarter  CSX is the only US Class 1 railroad to have crossed this threshold  Fuel efficiency remains a key focus for the team  given the combination of financial as well as significant environmental benefits from reducing fuel consumption  and we believe opportunities remain to get even better going forward  Reducing emissions is important to us  our customers and the communities we serve  And we are proud to have been recognized by various institutions as leaders in sustainability for the transportation space On Slide 9  most importantly  we are translating these operational improvements into more reliable service for our customers  Trip plan performance set new records again this quarter with 83  of our merchandise cars and 95  of intermodal containers hitting their hourly trip plan targets  Additionally  we successfully completed the roll out of individualized trip plan performance data to our merchandise and intermodal customers  Feedback on the tool has been very positive  and we believe providing this unique level of transparency to our customers will continue to differentiate CSX s best in class service I ll now turn it over to Kevin  who will review the financial results Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Jim  and good afternoon  everyone  Turning to Slide 11  I ll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement  As Jim mentioned  total revenue was down 8  in the fourth quarter as the impact of lower intermodal and coal volume  as well as reduced fuel recovery  lower other revenue and unfavorable mix more than offset the benefit of pricing gains and merchandise and intermodal Moving to expenses  Total operating expenses were 9  lower in the fourth quarter  a significant achievement that reflects CSX s ability to react to changing markets  while delivering record service levels  Overall  these results reflect the Company s sustained operating improvements and significant gains in labor and asset efficiency  Labor and fringe expense was 3  lower  with average headcount down 7  or nearly 1 600  Efficiency gains were strong in the quarter  partially offset by inflation  other cost and incentive compensation  including acceleration of stock compensation related to certain retirement eligible employees Our ongoing refinement of the operating plan continue to drive savings from fewer crew starts  enabling a 9  year over year reduction in the active train and engine employee base  and driving a 7  improvement in crew utilization  as measured by gross ton miles per active train and engine employee  The workforce efficiency and management execution rereduce over time across the operating department by nearly 15  sequentially  or approximately 30  versus the fourth quarter 2018  Additionally  the average active locomotive count was down 10  year over year in the quarter  The smaller fleet  combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies  help drive a 9  reduction in the mechanical workforce  while also reducing mechanical overtime expense by over 40  Finally  we cycled a unique benefit in the prior year related to the railroad retirement tax refund  MS O expense improved 20  versus the prior year  continued improvements to the train plan  combined with increased network fluidity have enabled an 8  reduction in crew travel and repositioning expenses  On the mechanical side  the lower locomotive counts also drove savings in MS O  including a 26  reduction in locomotive materials and contracted service expense versus the fourth quarter of 2018 Real estate and line sales were  10 million lower in the quarter  We continue to see a pipeline of real estate opportunities  And for planning purposes  we currently expect gains in 2020 to be approximately  60 million  while the impact of these transactions will remain uneven from quarter to quarter  As you remember  in March of 2018  at our Investor Conference  we guided for  300 million in real estate sale proceeds over three years  We will significantly exceed this guidance with our expected 2020 results Fuel expense was  37 million favorable or 15  year over year in the quarter  These savings were driven by a 7  decrease in the per gallon price  but were further aided by lower volume and significant efficiency improvements  Our enhanced focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software  combined with training    train handling rules compliance  drove a fourth quarter record fuel efficiency  Full year 2019 fuel efficiency was also in all time best for CSX Looking at the other expense items  Depreciation was relatively flat year over year  While we did recognize  10 million in additional expense this quarter  due to a 2019 depreciation study  this was more than offset by other items  none of which were individually significant  We expect depreciation expense to increase approximately  50 million to  60 million in 2020  reflecting the continued impact of the recent study  as well as a higher net asset base  Equipment rents expense increased 9  as the impact of inflation and other items more than offset the benefit of lower volume related costs and efficiency gains  Equity earnings increased  7 million in the quarter  due to higher net earnings at our affiliates Looking below the line  interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances  partially offset by a lower all in coupon  Other income decreased  4 million as the Company recognized a  10 million make whole premium on their early redemption of  500 million of long term notes in October  This was partially offset by increased income from higher investment balances Income tax expense decreased  45 million due to lower pre tax earnings and further  aided by a certain state tax matters and federal legislative benefits  Absent unique items  we would expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24 5  for future quarters Closing out the P L  as Jim highlighted in his opening remarks  CSX operating income declined 8  year over year in the fourth quarter  reflecting the challenging volume environment  Despite the tough backdrop  the Company delivered another record operating ratio of 60   a 30 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter 2018 Finally  turning to Slide 12  Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 12  In 2019  capital investment declined  88 million or 5  year over year  While overall capital investment declined  investments in our core track  bridge and signal infrastructure saw an increase of 13  as we continue to prioritize investments that provide safe and reliable train operations  Overall  our reduced asset intensity  especially enrolling stock  has enabled us to sustain lower levels of capital investment without compromising safety or reliability  The level of PTC spending has also come down significantly in the last two years Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team  Generating operating productivity while driving improved capital efficiency has produced differentiated free cash flow conversion  Growth in CSX s core operating cash flow generation  including improvements in working capital  drove a 9  increase in adjusted free cash flow to  3 5 billion in 2019  We returned over  4 1 billion to shareholders in 2019  including nearly  3 4 billion in buybacks and over  750 million in dividends  Additionally  we are exiting 2019 with nearly  2 billion of cash and short term investments  which combined with another year of substantial free cash flow generation  provide significant opportunities to reinvest in the business and continue to return cash to shareholders With that  let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerGreat  thank you  Kevin  Let s turn to Slide 14 in our outlook for 2020  We expect underlying economic demand to remain relatively consistent with current levels  It took industrial activity awhile to cool off  and it will take a while to heat back up  Based on this  we expect full year revenue to be flat to down 2  versus 2019  This forecast includes more than  300 million of top line headwinds from the coal business  driven primarily by lower export coal volumes and pricing  For the first half of the year  the merchandise business will continue to lap the higher economic level    the higher level of economic activity from the first half of 2019  but we expect merchandise volume growth to turn positive in the second half of the year  We expect intermodal volumes to increase in 2020 as we have now fully lapped the lane rationalization impact and look to grow the reengineered network  As to the operating ratio  our goal is to operate as efficiently as possible while ensuring we maintain our reliable service product  Our focus is on growing the business and in that context  we are targeting cost efficiencies that will not inhibit service  There are additional cost levers out there for us to pull  but we must make sure we are well positioned to capture new business and respond to demand when industrial production moves up Looking at the 2019 operating ratio results  we again outperformed our real estate target of approximately  100 million a year  Adjusting for this outperformance implies a baseline operating ratio of 59   Despite roughly  300 million of operating income headwinds in 2020 related to export coal and non core items such as lower real estate gains  higher depreciation and lower other revenue  we still expect to realize enough incremental savings across the business to maintain or hopefully  even improve our margins For capital allocation  our first call on cash is maintaining the integrity and reliability of our railroad  As Kevin noted in 2019  we again significantly increased investments in rail infrastructure  spending more on rail  ties  ballasts and signals  and we expect to maintain this level of investment going forward  In total  we project capital expenditures for the year of  1 6 billion to  1 7 billion  in line with our 2019 targets  In the absence of any high return growth projects  we expect the next principal use of cash flow will be continued return of capital to shareholders through both dividends and additional share buybacks  Importantly  we are committing to doing so in a way that maintains our strong investment grade credit rating Over the last two years  we have accomplished many exciting things at CSX and fundamentally transformed the way the Company does business  However  none of us are resting on that success  In fact  we have only scratched the surface of this Company s potential  I believe the best is yet to come for CSX as we continue our journey to be coming the best railroad in North America Bill Bill Slater    Chief Investor Relations OfficerThank you  Jim  In the interest of time  I would like to ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question and one follow up only if necessary With that  we will now take questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now be conducting the question and answer session  Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays Capital  Your line is open Brandon Oglenski    Barclays Capital    AnalystHey  good afternoon  everyone  and congrats on a pretty good year relative to pretty difficult conditions  Jim or I don t know if Mark Wallace is on the line  But do you guys mind digging a little bit deeper into your macro assumptions behind the flat to down 2  revenue assumption  I think you did call out some headwinds in coal as well  Do you mind just repeating that again Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingYeah  sure  Brandon  It s Mark  So going into 2020  we expect a continuation of the current macroeconomic trends to continue as we know the consumer economy remains strong  but PMI and IDP and other macro indicators suggest we re not going to see a near term increase in industrial activity  IDP is projected to be relatively flat for the year and the PMI read in December was 47 2   which was the second worst since  09 and the fifth consecutive month signaling contraction  So given this  we re not forecasting a hockey stick recovery  but any improvement in the macro environment would be upside for us Despite these challenges  we re going to continue to get better at what we can control  providing high quality service to our customers and executing  We have not changed our outlook for long term revenue growth  Intermodal  as we ve said many times  I think    we think we can grow 2 ish times GDP and merchandise GDP plus  So we re going to stay close to our customers  watch things and see if the sentiment improves throughout the year  but clearly  as I said  we re not forecasting any type of a big recovery in the year Brandon Oglenski    Barclays Capital    AnalystOkay  And I guess it s a related follow up  Mark  can you just tell us how the marketing strategy and sales strategy has changed at CSX  especially related to intermodal and merchandise Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingYeah  sure  I mean  we    in 2019  we spent a lot of time revamping the entire sales and marketing organization  We ve changed a lot of people  brought in some great talent  We ve actually developed a strong marketing team  no longer a pricing team as we ve discussed in the past  The marketing team is doing a fantastic job working hard  doing actual marketing activities and looking for opportunities to gain share and from truck and going after    and providing the sales team with those leads and those opportunities to grow our share as we are leveraging this fantastic service product that the Jamie and his operating colleagues have provided the sales team to sell On the intermodal side  again as Jim has alluded to  we re through our lane rationalizations that began in late 2017  We have a great intermodal network that we re leveraging  and we re excited to sell our    as Jim said  our 95  plus trip plan compliance or trip plan performance numbers and even higher in some other    in some lanes is exciting  and customers are taking note and we re executing and doing really well with our intermodal customers there Brandon Oglenski    Barclays Capital    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Next  we have Tom Wadewitz from UBS  Your line is open Thomas Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystYes  good afternoon  Wanted to see    I appreciate the detail on coal  the perspective  I think that  300 million is a revenue number  Any thoughts on how we might think of that in terms of an EBIT number  is that a    presumably a fairly high incremental margin  Is that a 50  incremental margin or how do you think about the EBIT headwind related to the coal revenue comment that you provided Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  Tom  it s Kevin  We really never broken down the profitability between our different segments  But we ve always said that the coal business is obviously a very attractive business for us  and we re going to continue to move as much coal as we can  but that s probably as far as we want to go there on the profitability side Thomas Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystOkay  What about    I guess  a thought in terms of the pricing assumption you have for seaborne  I mean  it seems like see  Queensland benchmark look like    I think it went down to    or the market went down to the  1 30  Phonetic   0 23 35  area  you ve kind of I think come back to  1 50 Phonetic   is there any sense within that coal headwind  kind of  what you re assuming broad brush for the seaborne prices for met Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingYeah  Tom  it s Mark again  The met benchmark    and again  the met is about 65  of our export coal  The benchmark prices have continued to decline as the global production has weakened  And currently  there are about  150  As a reminder  our contracts reprice quarterly  So you should expect to see a bit of a drag on the RPU into Q1  But that s kind of where it is  and we ll see what happens throughout the year  As a reminder  this time last year  the met prices were coming into the first quarter of the year were about  220 Thomas Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystSo you just assumed they kind of stay where they are today  is that the right way to think about it Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingCorrect  Yeah  So we ll see the    overall for coal  we re going to see a step down in the first quarter  but sequentially throughout the rest of the year  we don t think it s going to get any worse on the RPU Thomas Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thank you for the time  I appreciate it Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingSure OperatorKen Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Your line is open Ken Hoexter    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  Hey  good afternoon  And just maybe Jim  looking at the expense side  you ve kind of accelerated cost here  but if volumes are going to be down  maybe you can talk about if most of the PSR gains are over  how do you think about moving along with reducing expenses in light of these reduced volumes in contrast to your statement about being cautious about not going too far to be prepared for the rebound and specifically  like any employees James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll ask Jamie to give a little color on it here  but there are significant amount of cost reduction embedded in that guidance that we provided just to offset inflation and other cost increases that we set out in terms of the increases in depreciation  et cetera  So    but this game is not over  and we re going to do the first and more formal thing is to make sure that we are well positioned to provide a really good quality product to our customers in the future  And again  I ll let Jamie offer a little more color on the specific initiatives Jamie Boychuk    Executive Vice President of OperationsAbsolutely  Ken  we re continuing to look for good improvements this year on fuel  Definitely  toward our car hire end of things  We re finding  as we become more fluid out there and the railroad moves better  our bigger yards are able to do more for us  So we re looking at getting rid of more other route miles  Our locomotive fleet continues to go in a great direction as we utilized to get more miles out of our engines  which again turns into fewer asset costs with respect to repairs and parts and really  it just keeps on chipping away Each and every day  we re getting involved and getting into what s going on out on the ballast line  and that s probably the most important piece that the team is doing as we re getting on the ballast line and we re walking out there and looking at each industry looking at how we switch on  how can we do things better and by getting out of headquarters and making sure that all of the right team  including myself is out there each and every week taking a look at what we can do different and better not only does it give us an opportunity to continue to reduce costs  but continue to improve the product that we re able to supply  Mark and his team to get out there and gain some more business as we keep on moving along Ken Hoexter    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  Jamie  But I guess maybe    I was trying to be more specific on the employee side right  So employees were down over 1 500 year on year  Is that something you would see accelerating at this point given the volume declines or is that holding  I just want to understand given Jim s commentary over not taking out too much to be prepared for the rebound James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerWell  as we ve said before  our focus is on labor cost  not just headcount reduction  We made a significant reduction in the labor cost and not just targeting heads  So we ll continue to look for ways to reduce our labor cost  And as we did in this quarter and as we ll do in every quarter that we have to manage the Company  we ll do what s necessary around here based upon what we see in terms of business activities  Right now  it s kind of given your guidance that we think especially on the merchandise side of the business  there s going to be some reasonable stability sequentially in terms of where the volume line should be and that s    and an increase on the intermodal side  And we ll manage the headcount according to that  if it goes sideways or downward  you guys get the numbers every week  And if you miss a week or something  we ll point it out to you that which direction the numbers are going in Ken Hoexter    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  And just a quick follow up  Jim  The arrivals really jumped    or maybe  Jamie  from 53  on time two quarters ago to 85  now  Is there something beyond just execution that you re kind of    that you want to highlight  I guess  on the positive side  something really strong performance there James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerNo  I mean  look at the team is executing  the guys are out in the ground  taking a look at everything we can  We ll probably    I can tell you right now  we re going to crank the times a little bit  We re going to pull some times out of our trains  We re going to get things moving faster on the network with respect to cutting out some hours on how long it takes to get across the network  And that number might bump down a little bit into the next quarter because we tighten things up  So that s a gauge for us to make sure that our assets and people get to the other end  so we can turn them back  but at the same time  when I see that number start to go up  it tells myself and the team that on the service design side  we can take a look at  we re moving some hours and times from our trains getting across the network Ken Hoexter    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAppreciate the thoughts  Thanks guys OperatorAllison Landry from Credit Suisse  Your line is open Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  Good afternoon  So  obviously  this year you have a number of headwinds that you outlined  and that was really helpful  But I just want to understand and also you ve talked about more to do on the cost side  But just broadly speaking  do you need a more normal volume environment in order to really leverage those costs and get the OR even lower  somewhere in that mid  to high 50s  How should we think about that in terms of the different revenue environments Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Hey  Allison  it s Kevin  Clearly  we ve outlined more cost savings that we think and there s runway to continue to do that  The model we re setting out here is  we re positioning ourselves for growth and really to leverage that when the growth comes  And so  I think we re very excited about the model we ve created  There is a lot of leverage in this model to really drive the revenue at a high incremental margin  that s what we re looking forward as Mark and the team are diligently pursuing growth opportunities for us  So    but as Jim just explained  too  if the volume environment gets worse than what we expect  we all know we have to react  We did it last year  We came into 2019 thinking revenue was going to be  500 million higher  We had to react after in the second quarter  And Jamie and the team pulled together  we came up with a new plan based on the volumes that we saw from that point on and we adjusted  And I think we did a great job  So we ll do it again if we have to Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe math will just work out in terms of what the margins are should the business levels come back  We re building a tremendous company here with great operating leverage to take advantage of incremental volumes when they come back Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  That s definitely helpful  Maybe just    on that point but specifically to your expectations for intermodal volume growth this year if truck rates remain weak for some period of time through 2020  is there a point at which you might be willing to give a little bit on price to maybe drive some of that traffic into the network or will you just wait for capacity to shore up and then wait for the volumes Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingNo  listen  Allison  we re not going to be cutting prices to grow the business  I think the team here is    CSX has worked way too hard to do everything we ve done to provide our customers with exceptional service out there  Large portion  the vast majority of our intermodal network on the domestic side is under long term contracts anyway  We re not looking to grow by just going out and slashing rates  That s not our game plan  That s not our    that s not what we re going to do  But the truck environment is still pretty loose to build as we saw it last quarter  We don t think there s going to be any meaningful snap back or tightening there  but clearly  if that happens  it will be a demand driven environment event and that would be good for intermodal  if that happened Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you OperatorAmit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank  Your line is open Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThanks  operator  Hi  everybody  Kevin  just wanted to quickly confirm the  300 million for coal  that was a revenue number  right Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAbsolutely  That was a revenue number Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  Yeah  that makes sense  And it s obviously imply 15  decline  any help on how we can    maybe you can provide some color on what s the split between the volume and revenue per yield on that  What s the makeup of that and then  I thought you had said last quarter the D A expenses were going to tick up sequentially by about  15 million  We obviously didn t see that  Just wondering what    if there is any impact to the first quarter  what should we think about from a sequential from a D A perspective Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I ll handle the D A question and I ll pass over the coal to Mark Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingYou want to do D A first Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  On the depreciation  we did expect from the life study to have a little bit of uptick here in the fourth quarter  which was offset somewhat by some smaller items  so we basically netted out to zero  I did guide for 2020 in the  50 million to  60 million range incremental depreciation year over year  So we ll still see some bump up from the life study and some incremental capital spend next year  let s say  expectations  so no change to 2020 expectation there Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingAmit  on the coal side  let me run through the coal environment and hopefully  we can get to the    your answer without me answering it just specifically  but   Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingStarting with export  As we ve talked about before  it s been a tale of two cities between met and thermal  As we guided through the year of 2019  our expectations for export coal was around 40 million tons  We slightly missed that number coming in around 38 million  I tried to rounded up to 39 million  Kevin will allow me to do so  It had to be 38 million  But we now expect this year to deliver low 30s for 2020  As I said  we expect the declines both for met and thermal  but probably larger for thermal than on the met side On the thermal side  again  it s one third of our export shipments where we ve seen large volume declines given low natural gas prices and mild winters in Europe  obviously impacting the coal demand there and the API2 benchmark  As we talked about a little bit earlier   55 per ton  so really low  On the met side  again it is mostly a price story    not a volume story but a price story  Back to my comment earlier  the prices have continued to slide down to about a  150 per ton today  So that s kind of what we see on the export coal front Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  That s very helpful and then just one follow up for me  Kevin  we saw  I guess  a pretty sizable uptick in the labor and fringe per employee  I know there is    you called out some acceleration incentive stock comp  So I m just wondering what s the right way to think about that line item in 2020  because you have regular inflation  but you guys have also been kind of focusing on managing over time and with the volume environment being what it is  there could be some cross currents there  So if you can just talk about that  And if I missed it  just help us think about how headcount will be at the end of 2020 as well  Thanks Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  You talked about the incentive comp as a little bit of headwind to that number when you calculated  The other thing that you have to remember in the fourth quarter is  we have a lot of our capital teams  particularly on the engineering side that go over into vacation and once    a lot of their labor through the year is going toward capital  but once they go on vacation  it starts to hit our OE expense  So  there is a bit of seasonality to our per employee cost  And so  that s what you saw there in the fourth quarter Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystBut it was a year over year number  It was up over 4  year over year Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think some of that impact as well and then obviously the inflation that like I said within that number  There s a little bit of mix as well  But going into next year  I wouldn t see any significant rise in our per employee cost  What was the other part of the question Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystJust the year end headcount in 2020 Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  look  we have a lot of momentum  obviously  that we ve been carrying through the 2019 that will go into 2020  We ll continue to focus on managing attrition  there s a process here where we look at every job that comes available and ask ourselves  given the new model or whether that job is necessary  So we ll continue to evaluate those  With the lower volume  there s opportunities on the operating side that we ll find  So we ll continue to manage the labor side  It s not all about headcount  It s about over time  which we saw some great success in four quarter  We have big targets next year to continue to drive the overtime down as well  So it s across the board on the labor savings Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  All right  Thank you for the time  gentlemen  Appreciate it OperatorBrian Ossenbeck from J P  Morgan  Your line is open Brian Ossenbeck    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  thanks for taking my question  Mark  I wanted to ask you about the pricing environment  especially given the softness here to start the year in rail volumes and the industrial economy as mentioned  In the last quarter you gave some indication of same store sales and how they were trending  So  just given the backdrop and what we re seeing on the rail indices from a pricing perspective  I wanted to see what you thought was kind of the current market temperature when it came to price  realizing you just commented on not gaining volume for price  So when  Indecipherable  the market will be helpful Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingYeah  No  I was going to repeat  but we re not  So    but within merchandise and intermodal  our same store sales pricing in Q4 was about in line with what we saw in Q3  which again was the strongest  I think    I said back then was the strongest we had seen in the past three years  And our contract renewals  the pricing on our contract renewals that came up in the quarter exceeded our same store sales pricing  So clearly  the team is doing a great job to value the product for the service that we re offering to customers  and we re pleased and I m pleased with the great work that the team is doing on the pricing side Brian Ossenbeck    J P  Morgan    AnalystAnd in terms of the inflation indices  do you have a lot of exposure in the contracts that are going to actually reset lower in this coming year or is that not Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingNo  I mean  the    on the thermal side  those are annual contracts  So they will reset sort of now  On the met  as I talked about earlier  they reprice every quarter  but clearly  so the met benchmarks being  140 ish or  150 ish   150 a ton in Q4 will sort of reset those contracts in Q1  So yeah Brian Ossenbeck    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Mark OperatorScott Group  Wolfe Research  Your line is open Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  thanks  Afternoon  So  I think you talked earlier about  300 million of operating profit headwinds  So  I presume that s coal plus any of the discrete cost stuff  I just want to review that discrete cost thing  So I got real estate and depreciation  But maybe  Kevin  can you just walk us through any of the other discrete cost headwinds that you see in 2020 Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think we    obviously  we called out the real estate sales this year  In 2019  we realized roughly  160 million  The guidance for that is  60 million  which I talked about in my opening comments  the depreciation step up of  50 million to  60 million versus what we saw in 2019 are the items outside of coal that we really kind of called out Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystAnything on the other railway revenue or the other income that you want us to be thinking about Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think where we re run rating today is probably a consistent    a good way to think about it going into next year  So there will be a little bit of headwind on the other revenue side  as our customers demurrage cost of lowered going down over the year  So we ll ask a little bit higher other revenue in the first half of the year and kind of normalize to where we are right now Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  And then just lastly  when we get back to revenue growth  What are the right incremental margin  It sounds like you re positioning yourself  you said for incremental margins  Is that 50   60   40   How should we think about incremental margins when we get back to revenue growth Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerProbably the best incremental margins that other businesses would be envy itself Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingAt some level  it does matter where the business comes  but we have a lot of trains that have capacity  So  obviously  in those situations on the merchandise manifest business when we re adding a car to the back of a train    existing train  there s not a lot of cost you add to it  a little bit of car higher  a little bit fuel  But I think the incremental margins will be quite attractive Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystThank you  guys OperatorChris Wetherbee from Citi Research  Your line is open Christian Wetherbee    Citigroup    AnalystHey  thanks  Good afternoon  Wanted to ask about the revenue line  So if you take out the  300 million from coal and headwinds  so it seems like you re guiding revenues kind of up a little bit to maybe up 2 5  or so  We know we have some headwinds from other revenue with some of the ancillary stuff from earlier in the year    last year  How should we    thinking about maybe that cadence  is it merchandise volume had improved as we go through the year in addition to intermodal volume  Maybe if you could help sort of bridge some of that gap because I would have thought mix might have been a negative 2   So  any color would be helpful there Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Sure  Chris  So we talked about coal being a significant headwind down sort of mid double digits  as Jim alluded to  In intermodal revenue  we expect in 2020 we re going to return to GDP plus environment as we lap our lane rationalizations and as I said many times  our service product is strong with 95  plus trip plan compliance  So  I think very good momentum there On merchandise  we exited 2019 really well positioned to grow with a strong service product and I think even despite the tough environment and the tough comps year over year  we can see a slight improvement    revenue growth in the first half and with a stronger second half Christian Wetherbee    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Should maybe inherently ex coal volume up for the full year  does that sound right Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI would say that  yeah  absolutely Christian Wetherbee    Citigroup    AnalystOkay James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerIf it    again in the merchandise business segment  if it hadn t been for the two really specific items  which I pointed out  the refinery explosion and the GM strike  we would have been close to flat this year in terms of volumes in merchandise  which is significantly different than the rest of the industry  And so  we re reasonably positive as the business environment begins to  at what point in time  I don t know  when that s going to happen  This is not the new norm  This is kind of a natural evolution  things go down and then they go back up  When these things start to go back up  we would expect to see merchandise volumes begin to increase  And intermodal  we have always said  we believe we have a fantastic intermodal franchise  we have fantastic intermodal service  and we had to bite the bullet over a two year period to reengineer the franchise to make it better as we go into 2020  We knew that s what we were doing  And now we re going to see  as Mark said  hopefully  grows 2 times GDP  So  put those together and 60     80  of our business should be doing extremely well  Unfortunately  all four discrete segments of the coal business are getting hit simultaneously  which is difficult for us to overcome Christian Wetherbee    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Okay  that s very helpful color  Appreciate the time  Thank you OperatorThank you  Next  Bascome Majors from Susquehanna International  Your line is open Bascome Majors    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystYeah  And good evening  guys  I wanted to go back to the service levels  you improved your trip plan performance in the carload business by 7 full points in this quarter  It has been pretty steady in the mid 70s before this gap higher  can you dig a little more into how you re able to drive such a big improvement in 4Q if there s any    if that s sustainable or are something lumpy there  And as you look forward  is the conversation with your customer is changing  Is    are you feeling that this yields excess carload business growth over some period of time  You just tell us how that s going on the ground  Thank you James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerI ll start off with the product that we were able to create here and then let Mark touch on some of the feedback he s getting from the customers  But look  it    we ve got a fantastic team of railroaders out there with CSX  and we ve gone through this transition over the past 2 5 years  almost three years  And trip plans was a difficult piece for us to work on as a group  We tackle the first piece of intermodal  which Mark just mentioned  the team has been knocking it out of the park over 95   We still haven t achieved internally what we want to achieve for a trip plan on the merchandise side  But it is day in and day out grinding discussions talking with the field working inside and out with each and every one of our operators in order to move up each percentage point  So we have  I d like to say  the most stringent trip plan with respect to a two hour buffer and that s it  We measure empties  which I don t believe any other railroad does  And we work really hard hand in hand  seven days a week  driving that product  So I would say that we re going to continue to see that  that percentage improve as we continue to prepare and get Mark s team ready to jump out there and make those sales Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingAnd intermodal  we measure to the minute Jamie Boychuk    Executive Vice President of OperationsYeah  Intermodal  absolutely Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingWithin two hours  So if we missed by a minute  it s a trip plan failure  October 1  we rolled out trip plans  As Jim said in his opening remarks to our customers  on ship CSX in December  I think  on the 2  we rolled our trip plan performance out to all our merchandise customers  so they have total unprecedented visibility to every car whether it s a load  whether it s an empty on the CSX network  These are unprecedented visibility to their trip plans to what we re doing  how we re how we re doing in every lane  every car and customers love the tool  something they ve never know railroad has ever provided this type of visibility  Listen  it s been having an impact I think going back to Jim s comments a few minutes ago if you look at our carload performance in Q4  we were down 3   the industry was down 5   If you take out the PES  the impact of PES refineries and the GM strike  we were flat in merchandise  rest of the industry down 5   Clearly  customers are responding to that type of level of performance and rewarding us with their more of their business and we re winning share every day from trucks  And we re going to continue to push  And as this performance plus 83  for the quarter was great  We re hitting high 80s today and low 90s with some customers  And we re going to continue to    I know  Jamie is not satisfied and team is not satisfied with that  So as we get better  continue to push and become more truck like and provide great service  And we re going to be rewarded with more business Jamie Boychuk    Executive Vice President of OperationsThe one piece to remember on trip plans for us  what Mark and his team has taken beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans were going to be  Trip plans are more of an internal metrics  so we can see how we were doing and look at costs as well as getting hour by hour across the network by putting this out to the customers  put the pressure definitely on the operating team  but guess what  we are hitting it  And look  we got a little bit more work to go  but we ve taken this beyond what I think anyone ever thought trip plans could be James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerAnd going from whatever the number was over the last couple of quarters  say  75  to 85  in terms of the carload trip plan compliance  Two years ago that number was 35   The reason we have to give our visibility and tracking mechanisms to our customers is so that they will trust us to try our new service product to prove to them that it is as reliable today as a truck  When a couple of years ago  your trip plan compliance was 35  and you were trying to get a customer to switch from moving his freight in a truck to rail  he didn t have a lot of confidence that the    his freight was going to get to his customer on time when you re on time performance was 35   So that s why it s so important that we focus on this metric  And then  we re so confident that this number would be reliable and consistent  but even more importantly  that customer believes that  that product is reliable and consistent  So he is willing to shift  He s always been willing to pay the 15  premium to buy the reliability in a truck  We need to show him through this transparent tool that he can trust us to get his product there when we said we re going to get it there Bascome Majors    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystGreat  I appreciate it the comprehensive answer from everyone  Thank you OperatorJustin Long from Stephens  Your line is open Justin Long    Stephens Inc    AnalystThanks  and good afternoon  So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color around what the guidance assumes for that quarterly cadence of consolidated volumes  Is it the right way to think about it that we should see something like a low  to mid single digit decline in the first half and then something like a low single digit growth number in the back half as the comps ease Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingYeah  Clearly  we re lapping some    going up against some tough comps here in the first quarter as I    in the second quarter of the first half as I said  We had a pretty good environment in the first half of 2019  But we got a great service product  And we re going to do as much as we can  As I said  I think we re going to be able to do well in intermodal in the first half and in merchandise  hopefully  eke out some positive volume growth in merchandise  But we will  as we sort of get into the back half of the year  we think that it will be a little bit stronger than the first half for sure Jamie Boychuk    Executive Vice President of OperationsYeah  I think  Justin  you ll see throughout the year going first quarter will mark the low point from a growth perspective  That s probably across all of the    not only revenue  but operating income  EPS across the board  And then from there    and this is a lot of just based on the comps as we get in the back half of the year lapping some of the coal and some of the other headwinds that we saw in 2019  that growth should improve Justin Long    Stephens Inc    AnalystOkay  But when you put together all the pieces  do you think in the second half of this year  volumes can be up on a year over year basis  is that the assumption James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerYes Justin Long    Stephens Inc    AnalystOkay  Great  And then  secondly on free cash flow  obviously  that s a highlight of the business right now  So I wanted to ask in 2020 and beyond  what s the right framework in your mind to be thinking about for the free cash flow conversion percentage  And then  also on buybacks  Kevin  maybe you could provide a little color on the magnitude you re expecting in 2020 relative to what we saw last year Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Free cash flow conversion  our goal is to remain    keep that high  We have some headwinds in terms of cash tax rate that will    over time  that s going to trend higher  We re going to do everything we can on    to offset that with working capital initiatives and really taking a look at our capital program and how efficient we can be on that side to save dollars there  So  a lot of opportunities  I don t think we have any plans to go back to the old ways of very low free cash flow conversion that we saw historically from not only CSX  but the industry  So we    that s something we pride ourselves in  We continue to strive to maintain and have every plan to On the buyback  we are taking in  2 billion of cash  as I mentioned  end of the year  It gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility  There is no reason for us to retain  2 billion of cash on our balance sheet  So that allows us some flexibility going next year to be opportunistic when the markets present opportunities and we ll do that  We ll also look at the dividend as well  So we have a history of returning cash to shareholders  and we ll continue to do that Justin Long    Stephens Inc    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks for the time OperatorDavid Vernon from Sanford Bernstein  Your line is open David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystHey  Mark  I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the expectation that intermodal is going to get better  it sounds like you were thinking in the front half we might start to see a return to growth  How are your intermodal partners kind of talking to you about the outlook for the business in terms of their ability to actually attract share  We re coming off a year where domestic intermodal is down  call it  whatever 5   6   What s going to flip that switch that s going to get that volume to start coming back on to the network Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingYeah  Let me split it up a little bit and talk both intermodal on the international side  on the domestic side  But the international business  it was down less than domestic  We re still continuing to see    going into the early part of 2020 and hopefully  for the rest of the year  we re continuing to see good growth there on the international side with inland port strategy and some new service offerings with our customers  But the overall market remains soft  But we are doing well with picking up some business there I think    listen again  customers are not responding to our repositioned network  It s moving faster and more reliably and more efficiently  And they like to service  and we re doing well to grow the intermodal franchise  And we re lapping those lane rationalizations  those are all behind us now and we re growing from that  So  again  we think    given the environment and given the service product we got and we can grow this thing David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystOkay  Maybe just as a follow up  as you think about the improved service  obviously  some business is under contract  Is that going to give you a better leverage to kind of get some even better than sort of run rate pricing going forward  or should we be thinking about that as being kind of the standard and you re going to be using service more to drive growth than to really try to extract more value from the existing book Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingWell  we attack it from all fronts  right  We re going to    we ve got long term contracts with our customers  and there s rate escalators in there and we re going to    but we re going to continue to grow with them and bring on more business and get price where we can get price  And again  we re not giving away our service  And so  we re going to attack it from all fronts David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystAll right  Thanks  guys OperatorCherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities  Your line is open Cherilyn Radbourne    TD Securities    AnalystThanks very much  Good afternoon  Just wanted to ask a question in terms of performance evaluation  and how you differentiate between performance improvements that may be associated with lower traffic volumes on the network versus improvements that would be associated with sustainable process optimization that would remain once volume growth returns Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think when we look at productivity  the way we measure it here internally  it is a lot easier to drive productivity and a growing volume environment because first  you got to    in a declining market  you got to offset the decline in revenue before you even generate any productivity  So  the fact that we re able to offset the headwinds that we have talked about a lot on this call implies a lot of productivity this year  and there s a lot of smaller things that are adding up to big numbers across the board  When I look at the overtime percentages and I look at a lot of different things  those aren t being driven by lower volumes  That s a lot of blocking and tackling  even at the D A side  we re getting a lot more productivity out of our employees than we ever have  So  we measure productivity internally  It s certainly harder to    it would    if I can tell you right now  we would have realized a lot more productivity this year in an increasing volume market if that was the outlook for us James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerWe can    I mean  I    we can look at the metrics and to Kevin s point  give me a growing environment  it s easier to run the railroad  Right now  we re in tough conditions to put up the numbers that we re putting  But ultimately  if you take a look at the metrics and where the metrics are sitting  how do you know that things are    that we are improving even in the environment we re in  the cash is falling out  If we were hitting metrics and the cash wasn t falling out  then there d be a point made  hey  it s easier and it s all because of volume base  But I think we ve proven that  along with our metrics going in the right direction  the cash is falling out in the savings Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd many of these changes are transformational in nature and therefore  sustainable  We are not just kicking the can down the road  We are fundamentally in every respect changing the way we run this Company  and these changes that are resulting in these efficiency gains are to a large degree is going to stay with us as we go forward Cherilyn Radbourne    TD Securities    AnalystOkay  All of that makes sense  Maybe just by way of a quick follow up  as operating ratios across the industry start to converge and maybe it s in the high 50s  what metrics do you think that investors should pivot to start focusing on to differentiate between the various franchises  whether it s ROIC  free cash flow conversion or some other metric Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerCash flow  we talk about it a lot around here  I think we re pretty proud of our cash flow conversion  It s not easy to both improve OR and generate a lot of cash flow  and I think we ve proven that  So that s really the differentiator that we see out there  And as we shift longer term  we re here to drive operating income growth as well  So those are the two things that I think we ll be focused on Cherilyn Radbourne    TD Securities    AnalystThat s all from me  Thank you OperatorJordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  Hi  just a quick question  We talked a lot on the coal side about the export front  can you touch base a little bit on the domestic side  and how much of that  300 million top line headwind might be tied to that or is it really all on the export side  Thanks Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingYeah  No  Sure  On the domestic side  there is some impact  I don t think it s going to be as much of a negative impact in 2020 as we ve seen going forward  Net gas prices  unfortunately  have remained stubbornly low dropping to about  2 recently  But    and we did not see the surge in prices that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018  When they hit like  4 for a couple of weeks  But for core    for utility coal to be competitive  prices would have to increase from the current levels  And total electric demand would need to increase  Yes  as we all know in many locations  coal is used for peaking generation  And so  our upside is always seen or many cases seen when we have these extreme weather conditions and cold  Unfortunately  or fortunately  for the people on the call in the northern half of the country  you re not seeing a much cold weather  but that s bad for utility coal  So the natural gas capacity has not been stretched so far this year  But for 2020  we do see and we do expect that our utility tonnage will be relatively flat as we have had some wins  offsetting some market declines Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd just a quick follow up on the coal pricing  does domestic coal revenue per carload  I mean  does that stay positive or is it positive  I shouldn t say stay  I m not sure that s the question Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingThere s going to be    there    on the domestic utility Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYes Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingWell  again  it will be down  just given where things are  Those contracts are multi year contracts with our customers  But there are price adjustments  But we have minimums in the contracts with all these tied to them  but we do expect a little bit of pressure on coal    on utility RPU Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much Mark K  Wallace    Executive Vice President of Sales and MarketingNo problem OperatorBen Hartford from Baird  Your line is open Benjamin Hartford    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystOkay  Thanks for getting me in here  Kevin  just had a perspective as we move beyond 2020 and the model evolves one    toward one of a growth focus as this operating plan takes hold  this 59  OR target here for the full year for 2020 and as Mark had said  we re near trough level  cycle trough levels for PMI ratings and industrial related activity  To what extent  do you view 59  or thereabout as a representative trough or a floor for this model s OR as we look ahead to the next decade or so  Why would not that be the case Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWhy wouldn t 59  be the floor Benjamin Hartford    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystWhy couldn t 59  be the cycle floor for dealing with trough levels of PMI readings and we re looking out toward growth  Why shouldn t this 59  OR or thereabout be viewed as a representative trough for a floor for this model s OR going forward Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou say floor  you re meaning that is    why wouldn t it get better from here Benjamin Hartford    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystCorrect  Yeah  Can we treat this as a cycle trough  this 59   the low point Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  I think as we look longer term and maybe Jim has some comments on this as well  We re really going to focus on growing operating income and generating EPS growth in the most effective way  We talked about the leverage we have we built in this model  So  we think  given everything that Jamie and his team have done that we can drop through revenue at a very high incremental margin  so that implies pretty good outcome on the margin side  but we ll have to think about what s the most effective way is to grow operating income and    at a very high return  So those are the things that I think as we get further out  we ll have to contemplate  But it s    we have a better service  So clearly  getting price for service as we ll go after and    but it s really operating income and cash flow that we ll be striving for in the next few years beyond 2020 Benjamin Hartford    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystPerfect  Thank you James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerRight at    42 or so margins and as Kevin said  easier for that number as our    for our margins to improve our operating ratio to go down with increasing volumes  Our long term strategy is to continue to leverage our service  regain business that has been lost from the industry  while maintaining what I consider to be extremely good margins and grow our operating income  cash flow and earnings per share of the Company Benjamin Hartford    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystUnderstood  Thank you OperatorRavi Shanker from Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Ravi Shanker    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks   Indecipherable   Just a quick one  again on coal  you said that you probably hit the worst ever 1Q and then things kind of normalize from there if the benchmark stays where it is  Given your  the kind of  take or pay as you have on the volume side and kind of the way the contract reset  If the benchmark stays where it is for  let s say  the next three to five years or forever  is all of the coal impact going to be isolated in 2020 or is there like another leg to come in 2021 James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerOh my gosh  Ravi  Coal benchmarks stay here  That s not going to be happy Ravi Shanker    Morgan Stanley    AnalystSorry  I m making you do math at the end of the call James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Listen  I m in no position to speculate what s going to happen to coal internationally  whether it s thermal  met  I mean  again thermal is going to be driven internationally by the demand for coal    agility coal in India and other places  Turkey  Pakistan  it s going down  It s    in the next 10 years  it s probably not going to    we re not going to be shipping anymore to Europe  And on the met side  again  it s industrial production worldwide  It s cyclical  These things   Ravi Shanker    Morgan Stanley    AnalystRight  right  I get that  I mean  I get that  We don t really have any visibility of where coal is going to go  But my point was  if it didn t change starting tomorrow  if it just stayed where it was  are your contracts all going to just lap and kind of completely reset in 2020 or is there more to come in 2021 James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerNo  no  They would    it would keep going  It would lap Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThere s not a contract that s going to expire in 2020  where there s another shoe to drop  so to speak on    if the commodity    underlying commodity prices to stay the same  I think what the volumes today represent is what the underlying commodity prices are at  So  all else equal  there is no long term contracts within our export coal business that are set to expire after 2020 Ravi Shanker    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  That s what I was getting at  Maybe just one more kind of  you guys implied that you re going to see a significant incremental margins when the volumes come back  that kind of implies that you haven t necessarily downsized your operations completely for the cyclical volume environment you re seeing right now  Maybe some of the other rails have  If volumes don t come back until the back half of next year  at what point do you guys say that  hey  maybe we can cut some more on the cost side here Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe watch this daily  It was kind of like  let s just kind of transition back six months ago when everybody was saying  man  in the second half of 2019  it s just going to be gangbusters  and we were saying  I don t see it  And we were responding accordingly and making the appropriate steps on the cost side to make sure that we delivered almost double digit earnings growth this year in an extremely difficult environment  and we ll do the same this year as we go each and every month and assess where we are  And    are the volumes better than or worse than what we expect them to be right now and we ll respond accordingly Ravi Shanker    Morgan Stanley    AnalystVery good  Thanks  guys OperatorWalter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets  Your line is open Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  Thanks very much  Thanks for sneaking me in here  I want to go back  Jim  You were talking a lot about the improvement in operating metrics that you had and how that s improving service and Mark is certainly echoing that  You mentioned about how you re using that to convince the truck customer to switch over  What evidence are you seeing that they are capitulating here and moving over  are they waiting for some other factor to consider  Is it    or are you going to    do you look at 2020 and see an opportunity for a notable share gain against truck coming up into 2020  Any thoughts on share gain opportunity against truck Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Well  let me touch it real briefly  It took us decades  it took the railroad industry decades of poor service to drive the business off the railroads onto the trucks  We are not going to get the business off to highway back on to the railroad in two weeks  So we re going to have to earn it  As we were talking about earlier  we re going to have to not only put up good metrics but prove to the customers that these metrics are as equal to a truck and that this business model is sustainable  In the past  I m sure they ve had a lot of railroad guys that have walked in and said  hey  trust me take your business off to truck  put it on the railroad  I ll get it there on time  And the next thing six months later  it wasn t performing as well  and that customer lost business as a result of his conversion from truck to rail  He is skeptical and rightly so  We need to prove to that customer that this is a long term  as I said  structural fundamental change in the way we do business  And when we do that  we ll continue to see where we grow our merchandise and intermodal volumes at a rate that is faster than the industry  Is that going to be 1  greater than the industry  Is that going to be 1 5  greater than the industry  It isn t going to be 12  greater than the industry  It s going to be incremental quarter after quarter after quarter  year after year after year  where we have outsized growth relative to the industry that s going to prove this business model Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystLet me turn around and ask that same question now against your rail competitor  We ve talked to a number of your customers  they ve confirmed the service metric improvement  Jim  you ve had experience of running    working with a company that has had a significantly better operating ratio than its competitor  Is that an opportunity for share gain against rail if your operating metrics  as they have shown here  continue to improve and certainly  relative to the competitor  are we    could we see a more notable upward shift in your share gain opportunity against your rail competitor James M  Foote    President   Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think it s different than    our business environment here in the eastern half of the United States as I would say  is significantly different than the business environment in Canada  We have billions of dollars of opportunity available to us from truck  Customers today that are shipping products with us in a boxcar that are also shipping 50  to 60  of their product in a truck because the truck is more reliable  I want that opportunity  which is billions  It is crazy for me to go over there and price my service as a commodity that try and pick up a couple of million bucks of the other railroad  That s the business model that has run the railroad industry down for decades  And that is not the business model that we are pursuing Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  That makes a lot of sense  Appreciate the time OperatorAllison Poliniak from Wells Fargo  Your line is open Allison Poliniak Cusic    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHi  guys  Thanks for taking my call and my question  Just wanted to talk  you made a lot of progress on the operations over the past few years  And you talked about the levers that you can pull in 2020  If you    as you look at those  which ones do you feel could be the most challenging  particularly in this environment if there is anything Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe levers are always challenging  As we said  if we wanted to just take    and I ve been saying this for the last six  eight    we have been saying this for the last six  eight  10 months or more  If the business had dropped off 10   12  in a couple of weeks in a traditional kind of recession scenario  it would have been easier for us to go in there and find the equivalent amount of costs and take it out of the Company  When it was a slow drip week after week  month after month  a percent here  a percent in the half year and continue to down  down  down  down  down  it was more difficult for us to respond to that because we were fearful that we would    and as we expressed again here today  we would cut service in areas where we were in an attempt to reduce cost  and we would perpetuate the downward trend by driving more business off the railroad and on to the highway  So that is a challenge  where can we cut and where can we maintain our levels of service  If the volumes continue to decline  it creates opportunities for us  And at some point in time  you just get a little more aggressive  We have not done that and    but we have the ability  if it was necessary Allison Poliniak Cusic    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGreat  And then just trying to be optimistic  if we do get may be even more significant inflection in the back half  Just any of those levers sort of get moderated or pull in a little bit Kevin S  Boone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerBoy  we re really    we are optimistic  We like to think we re realistic  We are optimistic  We expect 80  of our business    our merchandise business and our intermodal business to do quite well this year  especially as we said  in the second half of the year  If for no other reason  then we just get easier comps  And yeah  if the business comes back  which clearly we hope it does  well  it s going to  Not a question  as I said  this is not the new norm  Business is going to come back  It is    all of our businesses are cyclical  It s just a question of when does it come back  We re    all we re saying is  as of right now  we re being a little more pessimistic about    I don t expect all of a sudden volumes to jump up 5  in the    on May 12  We re going to wait and see  We re going to be cautious  We re going to be vigilant in making    and we have to do that in order to manage the Company  And if things come back  we ll be in a position to handle the volume and grow the business  Jamie Jamie Boychuk    Executive Vice President of OperationsLook  as Jim said  this isn t slash and burn exercise that we ve been going through  It s controlling the costs  And on the operating side  we work very  very close with Mark and his team  As the business starts to come back  we re going to be prepared for it  We re going to be ready for it  We ve got the assets  We make sure we have the people  and we don t leave alone behind  So this is purely being a controlling    and look  we need to continue to control the cost because the businesses are coming back as quick as we may have thought it does  then we ll do that  But we will be prepared to grab every carload that starts to come toward us Allison Poliniak Cusic    Wells

193543,415059,CSX,What CSX s Earnings Are Saying About the Economy,news,"CSX s  NASDAQ CSX  fourth quarter earnings and guidance need to be put into context  It s no secret that the first quarter of the year is going to be a difficult one for the industrial sector  Railroad revenue is always correlated to growth in the overall industrial economy  and given the broad based weakness as we begin 2020  it s hardly surprising to see CSX guide toward full year 2020 revenue to be flat to down 2  from 2019  That said  the report guidance wasn t that bad  and there was enough in it to make investors in the industrial and transportation sectors be positive  Let s take a closer look 

Current trends in railroad stocks
Investors in railroad stocks already know that the railroad sector is facing a difficult year  The industrial sector is currently in contraction mode    something you can see by the widely followed Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index survey  A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in the industrial economy 

US ISM Manufacturing PMI data by YCharts
The broad based weakness in the industrial economy is also reflected in the Association of American Railroads rail traffic data    the latest data shows total rail traffic down 7 6  on a year to date basis    and it s also mirrored in the 7  decline in carload volume and 8  decline in revenue reported by CSX in the fourth quarter of 2019 
CSX s underlying improvement
The headline volume and revenue numbers look bad  but then most investors were already reconciled to this for the first quarter  On closer inspection  there are actually quite a few positives to be gleaned from the report and guidance 
First  it s quite possible the first quarter of 2020 will mark a trough in the railroad sector and the industrial sector at large  Indeed  according to CSX VP of Operations Jamie Boychuk on the earnings call  the  first quarter will mark the low point from a growth perspective  and growth should improve in the back half of the year  Meanwhile  CEO Jim Foote expects  merchandise volume growth to turn positive in the second half of the year  
Moreover  management s commentary is backed by its guidance  For example  CSX exited the year with an 8  revenue decline in the fourth quarter  so a forecast for full year 2020 decline of 0  to 2  implies a relative improvement through 2020 
Second  it s worth noting that  among the industrial and transportation sector  railroads face the specific challenge coming from the decline in the use of coal as a source of electricity generation  To put this fact into context  CFO Kevin Boone agreed with an analyst on the earnings call that ex coal carload volumes would be up on the year  In other words  declining coal volumes are dragging down CSX s revenue 
Third  CSX continues to make progress on reducing its operating ratio  OR     a key measure of efficiency which divides operating costs by revenue  so a lower number is better 
Largely thanks to the adoption of Precision Scheduled Railroading  PSR   a set of railroad management principles which involve running railroads with fewer assets  all the listed Class 1 railroads have been improving their ORs    something you can see by looking at the improvements in operating margin in recent years 

CSX Operating Margin  TTM  data by YCharts
For reference  CSX managed to reduce its OR to 58 4  in 2019 from 60 3  in 2020    a good result in a year where revenue fell 3     and it suggests that operating profit growth could be substantial when its end markets turn up 
What it all means for investors
On a headline basis  the numbers weren t great  That said  anyone buying into the thesis that the second half of 2020 will look more positive for the industrial sector would have received support from CSX management s commentary and outlook  In addition  the company s impressive improvement in OR and ongoing execution of PSR augurs well for future profit growth in the railroad sector  In context  it was a decent earnings report for the company and the industrial economy at large ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkuex,2063848

193546,415062,CSX,CSX  CSX  Surpasses Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"CSX  CSX  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 99 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 97 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 01 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 06   A quarter ago  it was expected that this freight railroad would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of 6 93  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
CSX  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry  posted revenues of  2 89 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 14   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 14 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CSX shares have added about 3 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 8  
What s Next for CSX 
While CSX has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CSX was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 97 on  2 92 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 36 on  12 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Transportation   Rail is currently in the bottom 13  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-csx-surpasses-q4-earnings-estimates-200499450,200499450

Box  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    Factors at PlayBox invested in security  compliance and administrative technology during the fiscal third quarter  These investments with leading enterprises helped the company to capitalize on increasing adoption of cloud computing technologies and the need for secure collaboration  This in turn is likely to have driven top line growth in the quarter to be reported During the quarter  Box rode high on the back of increasing adoption of the cloud content management platform by existing and new customers  Expanding paid customer base is anticipated to have aided its top line growth for the to be reported quarter Moreover  strength across international markets and growing add on products might have aided the to be reported quarter s earnings However  weakness in the EMEA region may reflect on its upcoming results  Also  continuous investments in research and development may have dented margins and profits for the quarter to be reported For the quarter to be reported  it expects revenues in the range of  174  175 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s revenues is pegged at  174 5 million On a non GAAP basis  Box projects loss per share in the range of  1  cent to breakeven for the to be reported quarter  The corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 1 cent per share What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boxthis time around  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of an earnings beat  That is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Currently  Box has a Zacks Rank  3 Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks worth considering  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in the upcoming releases Pinduoduo  Inc    NASDAQ PDD   has an Earnings ESP of  25 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   has an Earnings ESP of  0 50  and a Zacks Rank  3 Momo Inc    NASDAQ MOMO   has an Earnings ESP of  3 94  and a Zacks Rank  3 Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of  24 5  per year These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout ",2019-11-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/box-box-gears-up-for-q3-earnings-whats-in-the-cards-200486950,200486950
193565,415081,CSX,Analysts Estimate CSX  CSX  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when CSX  CSX  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This freight railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 92 billion  down 7 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 81  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CSX 
For CSX  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CSX will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CSX would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  6 93  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CSX doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-csx-csx-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200497682,200497682

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 93   A quarter ago  it was expected that this freight railroad would post earnings of  1 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  2 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
CSX  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry  posted revenues of  2 98 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 09   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 13 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CSX shares have added about 11 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for CSX 
While CSX has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CSX was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 on  3 01 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 12 on  12 06 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Transportation   Rail is currently in the bottom 29  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-csx-q3-earnings-surpass-estimates-200474256,200474256

193581,415097,CSX,Fed  Sunny outlook for U S  despite shade thrown by trade,news,"By Howard Schneider and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  economy grew at a  modest  rate in recent weeks  with consumers continuing to spend and a  generally positive  outlook overall even in the face of disruptions caused by U S  trade policy  the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday 
Employment continued to expand and  labor markets remained tight  with contacts across the country experiencing difficulties filling open positions   the Fed reported in its latest Beige Book compendium of anecdotes from businesses around the country   The outlook generally was positive for the coming months  with expectations of continued modest growth  despite widespread concerns about the possible negative impact of trade related uncertainty  
The document in summary portrayed an economy that was largely in good shape ahead of a July 30 31 Fed meeting at which the central bank is widely expected to reduce interest rates 
Indeed the apparent durability of the now decade old U S  recovery has led some Fed officials to question whether a rate fed cut is needed 
In the southeastern states  some employers reported boosting wages to  15 an hour to compete for entry level workers  manufacturing increased  home sales grew  and  the start of the summer season was robust   in states like Florida  Georgia and Louisiana  the Atlanta Fed reported  Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic is among those who have remained unconvinced rates should be lower 
RATE CUT STILL LIKELY
But the detailed text from the 12 Fed regions showed why the rate cut is likely to proceed  with businesses being forced to adapt on the fly to supply chain  tariff  visa and other problems that may pose broader risks to growth  Linked to both a weakened global economy and to Trump administration policies  those issues provided the major element of doubt in the report s otherwise optimistic outlook  and have caused some Fed officials to begin shifting their views 
Kansas City Fed president Esther George  among the most concerned about leaving interest rates too low  said Wednesday she was  prepared to adjust those views should we realize some of these downside risks  posed by trade policy and slower growth in China  Europe and elsewhere  George has a voted on Fed rate policy this year and will be faced with the decision of whether to go along with or publicly dissent against a rate cut when the Fed meets in two weeks 
The view from her district was largely positive  with businesses saying they  generally expected a faster pace of growth moving forward   and no explicit mention of trade related troubles 
By contrast  the Dallas Fed reported that a survey of 360 firms showed 28  were  negatively affected  by recent tariff hikes  while only 5  felt a positive impact from the Trump administration s decision to tax Chinese and some other imports 
The Beige Book noted emerging weakness in business for transport companies   a potential ill sign for future growth some analysts noted   and trade related troubles in manufacturing  It even traced layoffs in some cases to administration imposed tariffs as companies shifted final production of goods using Chinese parts from the United States to elsewhere 
In the Boston Fed district  one electronic components maker had shifted an assembly line to Germany  because most of the components in the product came from China and making the product in Germany allowed them to avoid the tariffs  
In Cleveland   manufacturing continued to weaken because of trade wars  high customer inventories and slowing global growth  Freight haulers saw a modest decline in demand  despite summer s typically being the strong season  and they are concerned about the future  
That point was emphasized by poor results reported late Tuesday afternoon by CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX   the nation s third largest railroad  that was leading U S  markets lower on Wednesday 
The Fed reported other firms had experienced  difficulties in securing and renewing  work visas for employees with specific skills 
The Beige Book was compiled by the San Francisco Fed from reports assembled from all 12 regional reserve banks before July 8  a period that included new tariff threats leveled by the president against Mexico  as well as the subsequent lull in those and other trade tensions ",2019-07-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fed-sunny-outlook-for-us-despite-shade-thrown-by-trade-1926592,1926592

193594,415110,CSX,After New High  Will CSX Be Stopped in its Tracks ,news,"By Charley Blaine
Investing com   On Monday and Tuesday  railroad giant CSX s shares hit 52 week highs  On Wednesday  the shares fell back and are falling again on Thursday 
The question is whether CSX  NASDAQ CSX  is peaking  That 52 week high on Tuesday was immediately followed by a pullback and the shares ended the day down 0 7   They re off another 1 9  since  And three days of declines will tell a chart watching investor that maybe a trend has been established 
The consensus price target for CSX  according to analysts polled by Investing com  is  76  which doesn t suggest there s much upside  Investing com s technical indicators rate the stock a sell 
To be sure  CSX has had a big run since the end of 2017  rising nearly 43   The stock rebounded 20 4  in the first quarter after slumping  like just about everyone else  in the fourth quarter 
And they weren t alone in the sector  The largest railroad companies in the United States and Canada all sported healthy first quarter gains and  like CSX  were having big years in 2018 until that awful fourth quarter slump set in  The S P 500 fell 20  from the end of September though the end of the year  CSX fell 16 1  
Railroad stocks have been rising as they start to make major moves to streamline their operations and boost their financial performance  The idea is not to let rail cars sit idle in big yards until all the cars going from  say  Nashville to Detroit  are in the same place 
The trick is to start building the train to Detroit as soon as possible when the cars first arrive from various places so that the departure can happen earlier  In the long run  it means fewer locomotives and fewer cars  lower costs and higher profits and earnings per share 
The idea is called  precision scheduled railroading  
  first pioneered by  when he was CEO at railroads in Canada and then at CSX before he passed away in December 2017 
CSX had such a rocky transition implementing the new system   that the federal Surface Transportation Board ordered the company to brief officials weekly

193601,415117,CSX,Railways Put China on a Belt and Road to Nowhere,news," Bloomberg Opinion     If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result  what are we to make of China s plans to build a Silk Road railway through the heart of Asia 
After all  those who think steel tracks are the best way to shift goods from the Pacific to the Atlantic have been able to use the Trans Siberian Railway since 1916  In practice  the efficiency  flexibility  volumes and logistical simplicity of maritime freight have won out again  and again  and again 
That s even been the case in the past five years  when President Xi Jinping s One Belt  One Road infrastructure initiative encouraged rail operators to splurge on subsidies and incentives like free advertising on Chinese state television to promote the overland route 
Thanks to China and Russia s heavy endorsements  east west container traffic over the Trans Siberian Railway s three main routes has surged to 278 000 twenty foot equivalent units in 2017 from 43 900 TEUs in 2014  Still  that s less than half of the 480 000 TEU increase in traffic that shipping lines achieved over the same period  amid a once in a generation crisis for the industry  Meanwhile  total maritime volumes on east west routes hit 15 9 million TEUs last year  equivalent to almost 60 Trans Siberian Railways 
There are fairly fundamental reasons for this  It takes about 15 grams of diesel to move one metric ton of freight a kilometer along U S  railways  based on figures cited by logistics operator CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX   That sounds pretty good until you consider that a vessel capable of carrying the same ton a kilometer by sea needs only about 8 grams  and the fuel oil it consumes costs about a third less than rail diesel 
Combined with the almost infinite capacity of the seas compared with easily congested rail routes  ocean freight almost always wins out  Even in the short hop between the U K  and France  shipping dominates  with 2 9 million freight units going by boat compared with 1 5 million through the Channel Tunnel in 2015  The maritime advantage only increases as distance rises 
That s just the start of it  When Imperial Russia started building its railway network in the 19th century one of its biggest worries was invasion from a rail borne foreign army  so former Soviet nations still use track wider than the standard gauge in China and Europe  Cargo trying to make it from Asia to Europe must either be transferred to different trains at each gauge break or have the bogies carrying their wheelsets physically swapped to the new size 
While solutions to these problems such as variable gauge trains and new broad gauge routes from Moscow to central Europe have been aired  they remain no more than proposals  Even then  shipments from Asia would still have to cross a minimum of three borders before making it to Poland  necessitating a further burden of customs checks 
How  then  to explain the rise in long distance train traffic  Transit times  which used to be greater than those on sea routes  have improved over the past decade  opening up a narrow sweet spot for rail between low cost  slow maritime transport and high cost  rapid air freight 
In addition  companies such as HP Inc  NYSE HPQ   that have established factories in China s west must use a decent slice of domestic rail if they want to get their products to port quickly  Chongqing  where the firm has a laptop factory  is about 1 700 kilometers  1 056 miles  west of Shanghai  and the rail journey takes only three or four days compared with as many as 13 barging down the Yangtze  Doing the whole route to Europe overland isn t such a bad option 
Still  one of the biggest factors is likely to be the opaque but significant subsidies available to anyone prepared for a spin on the tracks  Those available from parts of the Chinese government can range between  1 000 and  7 000 for each 40 foot shipping container  according to a March report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies  That s an exorbitant level of support when you consider the cost of moving the same box from Shanghai to Rotterdam hardly ever breaks north of  2 000 
It s a tribute to the romance of rail travel that whenever a train inaugurates a new path along the 12 000 kilometer odd corridor between China and Europe it s greeted not with reflections on the route s obvious inadequacies but by dragon dancers  media scrums and breathless plaudits 
Even China s banks seem smart enough to see what a busted project the government s touted Eurasian land bridge is  Belt and Road spending is overwhelmingly concentrated in Pakistan  Malaysia and megaport projects like those that have sprung up in Sri Lanka and Myanmar  Investment in central Asian logistics has largely been confined to the Khorgos container hub on China s border with Kazakhstan   a drop in the ocean in Belt and Road terms 
Rail s disadvantages may get even worse in the future  At present  the shortest ocean route from China to Europe still clocks in at some 10 000 nautical miles  a 30 day journey  If global warming makes the Arctic Ocean north of Siberia a viable passage  that will drop by almost half  making ocean freight not just cheaper but as quick as train travel 
In China itself  rail traffic peaked in 2013 and has never quite recovered  despite an economy that s grown by half since then  Global trade is unlikely to behave any differently ",2018-11-05,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/railways-put-china-on-a-belt-and-road-to-nowhere-1674989,1674989

193605,415121,CSX,Chart Of The Day  S P 500 May Be Set For A Correction   And Possibly More,opinion,"After its stunning double digit advance since June  the S P 500 Index is showing signs of a potential correction  Also  a rare pattern is emerging   a broadening pattern   that if completed would herald a bear market 
The Index fell 0 65  yesterday  its second day of losses  with a total drop over the two sessions of just below 1 00   Industrials   2 14   underperformed after railroad behemoth CSX  NASDAQ CSX  plunged 10  into a downtrend after soft guidance for sales  Although  the SPX was hit by industrials  the sour mood was more widespread than that  with all but defensive Utilities   0 38   and Healthcare   0 02   in negative territory 
CSX had delivered excellent results before this  jumping almost 30  YTD and outperforming the 21  gain of the Dow Jones Transportation Index  The current slump and weak guidance are the direct result of falling demand amid the protracted U S  China trade war  and the sector is feeling it hard 
Will falling demand for goods persist  Based on the charts  it s possible to attempt to form a trajectory showing which price levels to look out for 

The SPX has completed an evening star   a three candlestick bearish pattern depicting a top   and Wednesday s selloff cleared the short term uptrend since June 3  raising the odds of a short term reversal and completing a descending series of peaks and troughs 
The MACD triggered a sell signal  when the short MA fell below the long MA  as current prices are weakening relative to the average of the longer period 
The RSI has completed a double top falling below July lows and may continue to form a triple top  falling below the June lows  suggesting prices may follow 
While all these bearish triggers paint a bleak picture in the short term  they increase the odds of a long term correction as a larger pattern emerges 

When stepping back to look at the bigger picture  a rare broadening pattern emerges  The placement of the evening star is arguably more important than the pattern itself  Its development precisely below the upper boundary of the broadening formation exponentially increases its bearish value  as the proximity lends credence to the significance of the supply increase 
The characteristics of the broadening pattern are rising peaks and falling troughs  a contradiction in market structure  If investors believe in long term growth  they should support prices  pushing for higher lows  to accompany the higher highs  thus forming a coherent long term uptrend  On the other hand  if investors expected company profits to diminish  they should sell on the rallies  forcing lower highs as well as lower lows 
This paradoxical price structure projects a severe lack in market leadership  when participants can t stick to a consistent strategy  Therefore  this is considered a very bearish pattern that develops at market tops but is completed only when the lower boundary is breached 
Note of caution  trend lines are tricky things  and it takes substantial experience to develop an eye for this over commercial but illusive skill  Given that the broadening pattern s boundaries change along with trend lines that recede from each other  it s challenging to determine when the pattern is complete  Even then  it requires experience to know how to navigate the trade afterward  However  we will attempt to keep on top of developments and do our best to guide you along 
Note also that the weekly RSI has been providing a consistent series of negative divergences  with each RSI peak falling lower  contradicting the rising price peaks  The recent RSI peak   well below that of the start of the broadening pattern  despite hitting a record high   may give us a heads up to a price correction  if the RSI falls below its June low ahead of the price 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait for the pattern to either complete  with a decisive downside breakout of the broadening pattern  which is a long way off  at the 2 000 level to go short  or for the pattern to blowout  with prices over the 3 100 level  at the current angle  to go long 
Moderate traders may short after the short term trend develops a falling series of peaks and troughs 
Aggressive traders may short now  counting on the evening star s development precisely below the broadening top  as well as the bearish indicators 
Note  If a traders shorts now  he must be prepared that the price could retest the resistance  and either accept being stopped out or committing to a generous stop loss  thus increasing potential loss  If he chooses to wait for an upward move  he risks losing the position  Therefore  it s crucial to develop a trading plan that fits the account the trader is committed to

The earnings growth for these 44 index members is ever so slightly better than what we saw from this same Finance heavy sample of results in the preceding period  but that s probably no better than just nitpicking  The growth picture is weak and we knew that already 
Positive surprises  particularly on the EPS side  are relatively more numerous at this stage  as you can see in the right hand chart above  This likely points to estimates being on the low side  even though estimates had not fallen that much over the last three months 
Importantly  a number of major companies have guided lower for the current and coming quarters  If this trend continues  we will likely a bigger drop in estimates for Q3 than we saw ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season  
The trade issue has become a recurring theme  with many seemingly immune players also experiencing its effects  For example  the tepid growth in corporate lending at JPMorgan  JPM   Citigroup  C  and other major banks is partly due to the banks  corporate clients holding back on their spending plans as a result of the trade uncertainty  The effect is a lot more direct on others like CSX Corp   CSX   which lowered its outlook for the year as the railroad operator expects shipping volumes from its industrial customers to remain under pressure as a result of the trade overhang 
Looking at Q2 as a whole  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  2 3  on  4  higher revenues  This blended growth has been steadily improving as companies report better than expected results 
The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings and revenue growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following 3 quarters and actual results for the preceding 4 quarters 
 
 
As you can see above  earnings growth was essentially flat in the March quarter  actually down  0 2   and the expectation is for a  2 3  decline in the June quarter  Earnings growth is expected to be in negative territory in Q3 as well  down  1 9    with positive growth expected to resume only in last quarter of the year 
Driving this weak growth picture is tough comparisons due to the huge boost to profitability in the year earlier period  The chart below puts earnings growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 
 
The market appears to have accepted the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards 
The key issue will be if expectations for the second half of the year and beyond hold or come down as we move through the remainder of the year  Analysts have not made any significant downward adjustments to their estimates in response to the ongoing trade dispute  likely in the hope that the issue will eventually get resolved  But with many companies citing the issue as a reason for their lowered guidance  we will likely see an acceleration in negative revisions in the coming days

On paper  the most prominent events today are Fed s Williams  NYSE WMB  and Bostic speaking this evening and afternoon  respectively  However  given the recent communication from FOMC board members including Fed Chair Powell we doubt these speeches will have much market impact  see selected market news  
In the US  we get the weekly jobless claims figures that as always will receive attention given the importance of the labour market to the Fed  After a rebound in April  initial jobless claims have since been fluctuating around 220 000  After last week s drop to 209 000  we expect a modest rebound to a level just below these 220 000  If right  this would suggest that the labour market   albeit a lagging indicator   remains healthy

The Fed Beige Book   based on anecdotal information from the regional Feds up until 8 July   released yesterday painted a  positive  outlook for the coming months  with expectations of continued modest growth  despite widespread concerns about the possible negative impact of trade related uncertainty    This underpins the challenge for the Fed  with domestic data staying at least decent but rising downside risks and continued subdued inflation at the same time  We think the downside risk for the Fed of staying on hold is now larger than the risks associated with delivering insurance monetary policy easing  With Donald Trump s recent reminder to markets that the trade truce may quickly end  we think it is fair that markets price a slight probability of a 50bp cut at the end of this month even if we ultimately expect a 25bp cut  Markets fully price 25bp with an additional 30  probability mass of a 50bp cut 
While posting a small rebound this morning oil has traded heavy over the last sessions with Brent crude now back below USD64 bbl  Yesterday  inventory data from the US Energy Information Administration  EIA  showed an unexpected large build in inventories of gasoline and distillate fuels of 9 25 m bbl  As we are in the middle of the driving season  the inventory figures have contributed to the bearish oil momentum initiated Tuesday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the possibility of easing Iran sanctions

EUR USD
The International Monetary Fund  IMF  noted that the dollar is overvalued by 6  12   based on short term fundamentals  The IMF rarely comments on courses  and therefore  there are growing fears that the Trump administration will seize upon this thought  increasing pressure on the FOMC before the meeting on interest rates in two weeks  At the same time  the growth of the single currency is limited by the expectations of softening ECB policy next week  Central banks continue to play the senseless game of  make it softer than your neighbour

193631,415147,CSX,CSX  CSX  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CSX  CSX  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 16  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This freight railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 10 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 9  
Revenues are expected to be  3 16 billion  up 1 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CSX 
For CSX  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CSX will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CSX would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 02  delivering a surprise of  12 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CSX doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-csx-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200438122,200438122
193632,415148,CSX,CSX  CSX  Q2 Earnings And Revenues Lag Estimates,opinion,"CSX  CSX  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 08 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 11 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 01 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  2 70   A quarter ago  it was expected that this freight railroad would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 02  delivering a surprise of 12 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
CSX  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry  posted revenues of  3 06 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 60   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 10 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CSX shares have added about 26 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for CSX 
While CSX has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CSX was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 09 on  3 15 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 30 on  12 45 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Transportation   Rail is currently in the bottom 38  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-csx-q2-earnings-and-revenues-lag-estimates-200440445,200440445

193641,415157,CSX,For CSX  more job and train cuts in post Harrison era,news,"By Eric M  Johnson  Reuters    U S  railroad operator CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX  said on Thursday at its first investor day since the death of former Chief Executive Hunter Harrison that more cuts to jobs  rail cars and locomotives were key to its three year plan for boosting profitability and streamlining operations  Harrison  cherished by investors for leading turnarounds of Canada s two major railroads  died in December just eight months into a dramatic restructuring campaign that included slashing jobs  shutting eight rail yards  mothballing locomotives and running trains on tight schedules rather than based on customer needs  CSX shares  up about 1 percent in early Thursday trade  have surged about 50 percent since January 2017 and about 12 percent since March 2017 when Harrison took over as CEO following a high stakes push by activist investor Paul Hilal of investment fund Mantle Ridge LP  But the overhaul has triggered persistent service delays and disruptions and raised costs for many shippers  and drawn scrutiny from federal regulators   The new CEO  Jim Foote  and his revamped management team reaffirmed that it would substantially lower its operating ratio   a closely watched measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue   to 60 percent by 2020 from 67 9 percent at year end 2017    What are we here for  To make money   Foote told investors at a conference in New York   What are we trying to do  Drive efficiency  improve the network  improve the quality of our service  which will reduce our costs    The Jacksonville  Florida based railroad  the third largest in the U S   said it would cut an estimated 2 200 jobs by the end of 2018 and another 4 000 in 2020   It also plans to decrease locomotives in service by up to 20 percent by 2020  while also reducing the number of rail cars it uses by more than 20 percent in the same time period  Several shippers have told Reuters that service has been steadily improving from a nadir last summer  although companies such as U S  agricultural firm Cargill Inc and coal company Murray Energy Corp are still struggling with crew and rail car shortages  CSX said it expects compound annual revenue growth of 4 percent in 2019 and 2020  driven by rising freight volumes and higher pricing

193642,415158,CSX,CSX  CSX  Is Up 1 71  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at CSX  CSX   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  CSX currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CSX that show why this freight railroad shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CSX  shares are up 1 71  over the past week while the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry is up 0 45  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 79  compares favorably with the industry s 1 85  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of CSX have increased 10 05  over the past quarter  and have gained 29 22  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 7 07  and 10 01   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CSX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CSX is currently averaging 3 497 277 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with CSX 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CSX s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 23 to  4 34 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that CSX is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep CSX on your short list ",2019-05-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-csx-is-up-171-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200418888,200418888

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates

Currently  CSX has an average Growth Score of C  however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side  putting it in the middle 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in

193666,415182,CSX,CSX  CSX  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"CSX  CSX  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for CSX basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price

The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for CSX imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for CSX
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this freight railroad is expected to earn  4 32 per share  which is a change of 12 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for CSX  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

193667,415183,CSX,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love CSX  CSX ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at CSX  CSX   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  CSX currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CSX is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this freight railroad holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CSX  shares are up 3 01  over the past week while the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry is up 0 84  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 24  compares favorably with the industry s 3 65  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of CSX have risen 21 4   and are up 29 06  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 9 35  and 9 4   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CSX s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CSX is currently averaging 4 218 038 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CSX 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CSX s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 23 to  4 32 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CSX is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep CSX on your short list ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-csx-csx-200408812,200408812

193679,415195,CSX,Trump rail safety oversight in focus after Amtrak crash,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    As investigators sift through the wreckage of this week s Amtrak train crash in Washington state  critics have begun questioning President Donald Trump s recent efforts to roll back or delay finalizing U S  rail safety regulations  Making American railroads safer drew renewed attention after the passenger train derailed on Monday morning while speeding onto a bridge  killing three passengers and sending about 100 people to hospitals  The accident occurred as the U S  Transportation Department is reviewing rail safety requirements or proposals set under prior administrations  The White House has promised a sweeping effort to eliminate regulations throughout government and cut at least two existing regulations for every new one  Earlier this month  the department reversed a decision requiring crude oil rail tank cars to be fitted with an advanced braking system designed to prevent fiery derailments  The requirement to install electronically controlled pneumatic brakes had been included in a package of safety reforms the Obama administration unveiled in 2015 following a series of deadly derailments stemming from the U S  shale boom  Senator Ron Wyden  an Oregon Democrat  called this month s move  a senseless decision that endangers our communities by making oil by rail transportation less safe   The Transportation Department has defended the decision  saying the mandate s costs would be three times as high as the benefits it would produce   The agency has also delayed finalizing regulations proposed during the Obama administration to require railroads to run all trains with at least a two member crew unless it got specific approval  Train track safety inspections were another focus of the Obama administration  which said it planned to propose new rules to address  dangerous track conditions and defects  in order to prevent train derailments  The Trump administration said in a document posted last week that the previous administration s initiative had been moved to the  long term action  list  meaning it does not plan any additional action for at least 12 months on the proposal and could abandon it completely  In their defense  administration officials complain that Senate Democrats have for months delayed a vote on Ronald Batory s nomination to head the Federal Railroad Administration  the top rail safety post  and say administration reviews of many railroad regulations are ongoing and no final decisions have been made as additional data is analyzed  On Thursday  Senator Maria Cantwell  a Washington state Democrat  called on the Senate Commerce Committee to quickly convene a hearing on the state of Amtrak safety standards and federal rail safety regulation   The traveling public needs to know that Amtrak and its regulator  the Federal Railroad Administration  are doing all they can to protect the safety of passengers who use this vital piece of our transportation infrastructure   Cantwell said in a statement  citing several major rail accidents over the last decade   Railroads note that derailment rates have fallen in recent years and that the train accident rate is down 44 percent since 2000  But the biggest pending railroad safety issue is a government mandate to install a technology called positive train control to prevent derailments  Had the technology been operational for the stretch of track where Monday s derailment occurred  the crash might have been prevented  In 2015  Congress delayed an end of year deadline for installing the technology by three years to the end of 2018 after lobbying by major railroads  including Warren Buffett s BNSF Railway Co  BNISF UL   The Transportation Department can extend the deadline again until the end of 2020   Railroads had argued for years that the initial 2015 deadline set in 2008 was unworkable and that they had spent billions to develop the technology  While many passenger rail companies and freight rail companies have installed the system  CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX     Norfolk Southern  Corp  NYSE NSC  and Canadian National Railway Co expect to complete the effort by 2020  according to the Federal Railroad Administration  Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Tuesday that the Trump administration must back the funding to ensure positive train control is implemented   The resources aren t preventing its installation  it is the will and determination to do so  The failure of federal authorities to require and provide support for positive train control is a moral choice this nation has made   Blumenthal said  The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended the technology since 1970 and said that since then there have been more than 140 accidents across the country resulting in nearly 300 fatalities  more than 6 500 injuries  and millions of dollars in costs  which could have been prevented by positive train control  Batory  the White House rail nominee  told a Senate panel in July he backed a regulatory approach to safety known as  performance based regulations   Critics say that would allow railroads to largely self regulate and would eliminate specific safety technology requirements  Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska in June proposed legislation requiring regulators to consider adopting a performance based approach rather than setting specific regulatory requirements  Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota  who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee  said in a statement the Amtrak crash was not caused by the vacancy at the Federal Railway Administration  but said the agency needs leadership to advance safety issues and oversight    The time for playing political games with the leadership of this railroad safety agency should be over   Thune said  
Thune on Thursday moved that the Senate unanimously confirm Batory  but Schumer objected and the motion failed ",2017-12-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-rail-safety-oversight-in-focus-after-amtrak-crash-1020277,1020277

193699,415215,CSX,CSX  CSX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"CSX  CSX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This freight railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 02 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 15  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CSX 
For CSX  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CSX will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CSX would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 01  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CSX doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-csx-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200405152,200405152

halted all automobile shipments to or through its yard in Lordstown  Ohio  where new vehicles are unloaded from trains and trucked to dealerships  to give workers time to clear a backlog of rail cars and relieve congestion  according to a CSX email seen by Reuters  CSX Assistant Vice President Maryclare Kenney apologized to customers in the email dated Sept  8  Such freight  embargos   more commonly associated with hurricanes and other disasters  can send companies scrambling to find alternate  usually higher cost ways of getting products to market  The Surface Transportation Board  the U S  rail regulator  is due to host a hearing in Washington  D C   over CSX s service on Oct  11   CSX spokesman Rob Doolittle said on Thursday that operations should return to normal in the near

railroad is now returning to a normal operating rhythm  and our performance metrics are improving   Chief Executive Officer Hunter Harrison said on Sept  6  when the company also cut its earnings forecast  Harrison  who took over as CEO in March after leading turnarounds of Canadian railroads  has vowed to cut costs and streamline efficiency through his  precision scheduled railroading

our new operating model   Harrison said in a statement on Thursday   We remain confident that Precision Scheduled Railroading will provide lasting benefits to our customers  our employees and our shareholders   Doolittle said rail cars were spending less time idle than during the worst summer periods  and train velocity was essentially the same last week as it had been a year ago  He said

said train transit times on multiple routes in place for years spiked in recent months by as much as 80 percent  He said the railroad had failed to communicate transit changes and at one point lost track for several days of tank cars carrying hazardous materials   CSX s service is failing its customers   McDivitt told the transportation board in a Sept  13 letter seen by Reuters  While Ascend has seen some improvements  a spokesman said  it has switched some freight to truckers and ordered staff to alert CSX customer service representatives as delays arise  The American Chemistry Council trade group  which includes 3M Co  said CSX s problems continued to affect product shipments  including roof coating component titanium dioxide   Some areas have improved  but by and large  there are

193723,415239,CSX,CSX  CSX  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects CSX  CSX  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 16  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This freight railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 00 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  56 3  
Revenues are expected to be  3 13 billion  up 9 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 25  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CSX 
For CSX  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 80  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CSX will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CSX would post earnings of  0 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of  11 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CSX doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-csx-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200374066,200374066
193724,415240,CSX,CSX  CSX  Meets Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"CSX  NASDAQ CSX  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 01 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 64 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this freight railroad would post earnings of  0 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of 11 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
CSX  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry  posted revenues of  3 14 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 40   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 86 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CSX shares have added about 4 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 4 1  
What s Next for CSX 
While CSX has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CSX was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 92 on  3 05 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 20 on  12 69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Transportation   Rail is currently in the bottom 34  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-csx-meets-q4-earnings-estimates-200376331,200376331

193777,415293,CSX,Exclusive  Safety deadline may exempt U S  railroads from freight obligations ,news,"By David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  railroads may not be obligated under federal law to carry freight including crude oil and hazardous materials from Jan  1 if they fail to meet a year end deadline for implementing new train safety technology  according to a top federal regulator  In a Sept  3 letter to the Senate Commerce Committee  U S  Surface Transportation Board Chairman Daniel Elliott says the common carrier obligation requiring freight railroads to honor reasonable requests for service from shippers  is not absolute  and railroads can suspend service for various reasons  including safety   The letter  reviewed by Reuters  presents the most tangible sign yet of what could lie ahead for rail carriers and their customers  if Congress fails to extend its Dec  31 deadline for railroads to implement positive train control  or PTC   The National Transportation Safety Board  which has been calling on railroads to adopt PTC since the late 1960s  says the technology would prevent major rail accidents such as the May 12 Amtrak derailment that killed eight people and injured more than 200 others   The approaching deadline has prompted at least one major railroad company to look seriously at suspending service  billionaire investor Warren Buffett s BNSF Railway Co  N BRKa   the No  2 freight railroad operator and the leading carrier in the  2 8 billion U S  crude by rail market   BNSF confirmed that it will not meet the deadline and offered the possibility that neither passenger nor freight traffic would operate on BNSF lines   Elliott said in the letter  which was addressed to the committee s Republican chairman  Senator John Thune of South Dakota  In a July 24 letter provided to Reuters by BNSF  railroad president and chief executive Carl Ice informed Elliott that BNSF is analyzing the possibility of a service shutdown and actively consulting with customers    CSX Corp  N CSX   the No  3 U S  freight handler  also told the board that it would not meet the PTC deadline but did not discuss possible decisions on whether to continue service  Elliott said   A CSX spokeswoman said the company was working diligently to implement PTC but that a  seamless  safe operation is imperative to maintain the fluidity of the national rail network    Railroad officials in June raised the possibility of shutting down service as a way to avoid potential legal liabilities and fines for operating outside the law  Elliott told Thune it was unclear whether railroads would be exempt from their obligation to provide freight service for cargo  including hazardous materials  under federal rules that say service cannot be denied simply because it is inconvenient or unprofitable for the carrier  The Surface Transportation Board  a regulatory agency charged by Congress with resolving rail disputes over rates and service  had no immediate comment  nor did the Federal Railroad Administration  the main U S  railroad regulator   Up to now  the board has mainly handled common carrier obligation cases involving services that have complied with federal safety rules   A carrier initiated curtailment of service due to a failure to comply     would present a case of first impression   Elliott wrote   I cannot predict the outcome of such a case    PTC can avoid accidents by using a complex network of sensors and automated controls to slow or stop a train under dangerous conditions   In 2008  Congress mandated that railroads implement the technology by the end of 2015  But only a small number of U S  passenger  commuter and freight railroads will meet the deadline  according to an Obama administration report released last month    The report named BNSF as one of only three railroads that have provided regulators with a PTC implementation plan   Railroad officials have complained about the cost and complexity of adopting PTC and have produced freight and commuter rail estimates showing full implementation could cost the industry nearly  13 billion   A six year transportation bill approved by the Senate last month would allow the Obama administration to extend the deadline for up to three years    The administration requested authority to extend the deadline for positive train control and the Senate subsequently advanced a bipartisan proposal to create accountability and set realistic deadlines   said Frederick Hill  Republican spokesman for the Senate Commerce Committee   This provision in the surface transportation bill will address the concerns summarized in Chairman Elliott s correspondence   he added

kilometer  network  the railway also has done something unexpected  it pulled thousands of rail cars off its lines  The strategy appears to have paid big dividends this winter  helping ease congestion on tracks and speed up traffic  according to a Reuters analysis of weekly data the industry supplies to the U S  Department of Transportation  BNSF rail cars that were stuck at terminals for an average of 35 hours last winter are now back on the tracks in less than a day  The trains are also moving 15 percent faster than they did last year  reducing critical travel times  data shows   BNSF disappointed many of its customers   Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said in a letter to shareholders last month about last year s performance of one of North America s top railroads   However  our outsized expenditures are beginning to show results    The railway s metrics  which have not been previously reported  have improved markedly this winter  reflecting less congestion  increased investments and weaker demand from the oil and agricultural industries  Since October  BNSF has cut its number of cars by 9 percent to just under 237 000  whereas the rest of the industry grew by 0 4 percent  Anthony Hatch  owner of New York based transportation consultancy ABH Consulting says all rail operators struggle to strike the balance between the number of cars on the tracks and freight volumes  BNSF is the only major U S  rail operator  though  to cut the number of cars in the past two years  MORE WITH LESS In its latest report  BNSF showed strong year over year increases in the number of carloads of grain and petroleum products hauled during the first two months of 2015 combined with double digit declines in container and trailer volumes   BNSF spokesman Mike Trevino said that improvements  such as building extra tracks and sidings  essentially allowed fewer cars to move the same amounts of freight    We did some things operationally that allowed us to take cars off the railroad while still being able to generate the same or better number of movements   Trevino said   Other major rail carriers also have spent billions on upgrades and bigger workforce  but none has reduced car counts or seen as dramatic improvements in travel speed and the time cars spent in terminals  CSX  NYSE CSX   which last year carried about a quarter of BNSF s crude load  reported relatively steady car dwell times  Canadian Pacific  which faced similar criticism as the much larger BNSF  saw small overall decreases in dwell times  CSX spokeswoman Melanie Cost said the company has hired 1 900 frontline employees in 2014  bought new locomotives and upgraded lines where crude oil traffic has soared to ease capacity constraints and improve performance   BNSF s geographical focus on the nation s Corn Belt states  along with North Dakota  a leading shale oil and grain producer  means it struggled more than its peers to keep up with demand generated by the oil boom and bumper crops  The stress  aggravated by a series of paralyzing winter storms  led to nagging delays that plagued major shippers and triggered scrutiny from U S  lawmakers and regulators  One refiner  Philadelphia Energy Solutions  was hit so hard by the delays last year that it ordered a half dozen extra tankers of crude before the start of this winter season  This year  however  the extra reserve proved unnecessary  leaving the laden tankers idling offshore for months  according to a trader with knowledge of the situation  The company would not comment on its supplies   Other big customers are also taking note of the improvement in areas served by BNSF  which pledged further  6 billion for capital maintenance in 2015 touting it the biggest amount ever invested in a single year by a North American rail company   Rail was a lot better this year  We didn t see the delays   said Mark Formo  president of the North Dakota Grain Growers Association   In fact  we saw cars showing up for deliveries a day early    In a February survey by the Soy Transportation Coalition all respondents said cycle times   how long it takes a train to pick up a shipment  deliver it and return   have improved from last year  To be sure  some customers primarily credit fewer weather related disruptions and cooled demand for oil by rail and grain shipments for better service   To me it s market driven   said Brian Hammerbeck  president of Dakota Mill   Grain   Prices are down  and you have farmers keeping more of it  so it s a much different environment   ABH s Hatch says  however  many

193803,415319,CSX,Canadian Pacific approached CSX about merger  WSJ,news," Reuters    Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd  TO CP  has approached CSX Corp  N CSX  about merging the two North American railroad operators to create a transcontinental carrier worth more than  60 billion  according to the Wall Street Journal 
The offer was made in the past week and was rebuffed  the newspaper said on Sunday  citing people briefed on the matter  It added that it was unclear if CP had shelved the plan 
CP spokesman Martin Cej and CSX spokeswoman Melanie Cost told Reuters their companies did not comment on market rumors 
Calgary based CP has said it is interested in acquisitions as rail traffic surges on the back of the North American energy boom 
 Would we ever consider anything  As I ve said publicly before  sure  But you got to have somebody to dance with and I don t know anybody that wants to dance now   CP Chief Executive Hunter Harrison said on a call with analysts on Oct  1 
Harrison  a former CEO of Canadian National Railway  TO CNR   joined CP in 2012 after being hand picked by activist investor William Ackman  whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management owns a large stake in the company 
Harrison was at CN when it tried to merge with Burlington National  which is now owned by Warren Buffett  That deal   the last attempted merger between two big  tier 1  railways   was scuttled in 2000 by the U S  Surface Transportation Board due to competition concerns 
Any attempt to join CP and Jackson  Florida based CSX  would also likely face intense regulatory scrutiny  said independent railroad analyst Anthony Hatch  If it were approved  he said  it would be  with such strings attached that they would feel like anchor chains  
CP  Canada s No  2 railway by revenue  has a market value of about  32 billion  while Florida based CSX  the No  3 U S  carrier  is worth about  30 billion 

Harrison has also said he is interested in buying or operating the small switching lines that knit together North America s major railways at Chicago

Price Performance
In the first quarter of 2018  United Continental clearly outpaced CSX in terms of price performance  United Continental rallied 3  compared with CSX s 1 2  rally 

 
ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive   the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our United Continentalis likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported  This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of  2 50  and a Zacks Rank  3  Previously too  our model conclusively showed an earnings beat as the Earnings ESP was  7 00  with a same Zacks Rank  Read more   However  the picture is opposite for CSX as it has an Earnings ESP of  1 71  and a Zacks Rank of 3   Read more

Blockchain Stocks AnalytixInsight Inc  V ALY   ATIXF on OTC  C 0 55  C 0 43 Analytix has a very strong chart  We bought it about a week ago as it completed a tight bull Flag  which it then broke out of so that we are now up 28  and holding for further gains  Note the powerfully bullish volume pattern 

Marathon Patent Group Inc  NASDAQ MARA  MARA on NASDAQ CM   4 95
Accumulated Marathon Patent from September through November  having observed that a Cup   Handle base was completing  accompanied by a bullish volume pattern  and that the price was converging with its falling 200 day moving average  It broke out a week or two ago and went nuts to the upside on immense volume  which was clearly a very bullish development  We sold half our position at a good price in expectation of a heavy reaction  which ensued  and held the balance for a later resumption of the advance  After we bought this stock there was a 1 for 4 reverse split  which evidently didn t do it any harm  It is understood that  despite the name  this is now a Blockchain stock 

Riot Blockchain Inc  NASDAQ RIOT  RIOT on NASDAQ CM   15 00
We were on to Riot Blockchain as far back as October  when we bought it  but tragically we were just stopped out  because a few weeks later it broke out and took off like a rocket  Then it overreacted to the downside last week giving us a chance to jump on it at a relatively good price  Given that this stock is in one of the hottest sectors on the planet and that it is one of the few Blockchains that are publicly traded  it has the potential to do a moonshot  especially as it only has 8 32 million shares outstanding and a float of only 3 83 million 

Cannabis Stocks
Given the number of cannabis stocks shown below  you might be forgiven for thinking that the writer has a predisposition towards cannabis  perhaps even has an addiction problem  Not true  we went for them because they looked like they were going to appreciate  and they did  Canadian cannabis companies are the global leaders in the field  largely thanks to the moronic Federal threat to the industry south of the border  and Canada sports some of the biggest names in the industry like Aphria  Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth Corp  which have all done very well this year  Their growth potential  no pun intended  has not gone unnoticed by either the Alcohol and Tobacco industry or big Pharma  who are starting to circle overhead like vultures in readiness to swoop and take over these companies  This is why we went for Aphria and Aurora Cannabis over 6 months ago  which have proved to be very good investments that we sold at the peak of the recent parabolic ramp for big gains  Aphria Inc  TO APH  APH TSX  APHQF on OTC  C 11 40   8 95

Aurora Cannabis Inc  TO ACB  ACB TSX  ACBFF on OTC  C 7 52   5 92

Future Farm Technologies Inc  SNX FFT  FFT  CSX  NASDAQ CSX   FFRMF on OTC  C 0 47   0 376
While Future Farm might have thought it would escape our notice tucked away out in the countryside  it didn t  because we spotted that a Head and Shoulders bottom was completing in it  so we went for it late in October before it broke out and are up 92   However  a toppy candle formed in it on high volume on Friday  so it may now react back 

Liberty Health Sciences Inc  SNX LHS  LHS CSX  LHSIF on OTC  C 1 62   1 28
It seems to be  de rigueur  these days for a company to massage its stock price higher before giving its shareholders a jolly good soaking with a funding exercise  We  smelt a rat  in the nick of time and offloaded Liberty Health for a nice profit right at the top  having grown suspicious due to an excessively orderly advance on expanding volume  This was a nice trade because it collapsed immediately after we sold it at the peak 

Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd  V NSP  NSP V  NSPDF on OTC  C 0 29   0 24
We bought Naturally Splendid at a good point  after being alerted to  something going on  by the 1st impulse wave which got turned back by the falling 200 day moving average  Volume pattern indicated it was going higher again  so we bought it during the formation of a tight bull Flag  and sure enough it took off higher gain  so that we are now up 48  on the last purchase in 10 days  This position is still open and we raise the stop to C 0 248 for a risk free trade 

Revive Therapeutics Ltd  V RVV  RVV  V  RVVTF on OTC  C 0 31   0 242
The timing of entry into this could have been better as we could have picked it up cheaper a month later  but it revived and went on to do what was expected of it with a steep advance that has resulted in us being up 47   so it s a case of  all s well that ends well   except of course  that  you shouldn t count your chickens until they ve hatched   as we haven t sold it yet 

Vape Holdings Inc  OTC VAPE  VAPE on OTC   0 0054
We worked out that Vape was ready for a sharp rally and bought it right before the rally started  and sold it last Wednesday for a quick 111  gain in less than a week  Nice work if you can get it  Be good if it reacts back so that we can perhaps give it another go 

 Not all of our trades are profitable of course   there be always be a number of trades that don t work out as expected  This is because charts indicate probabilities not certainties  and there are always uncertainties that can throw things out of kilter  just as in everyday life  You can do the same commute for decades  but each and every day you have to be ready for the unexpected  such as a child running out in from of your car  In the same way  when trading  you have to be prepared to duck and dive and roll with the punches  For example  a charismatic well connected CEO of a company may suddenly get run over by a bus  and the next trading session the stock tanks  The only people in this game who are right all the time are liars  and in fact the only way to be right all the time is to have a time machine  like Doc and Marty s DeLorean in the Back to the Future movies  which would be very useful as you could zip forward a year  take a quick peek at the charts  zoom back and make a fortune  Whilst visiting the Universal Studios  lot in L A  a few years back I came across this DeLorean  seemingly abandoned  and made them an offer for it  but they refused to sell   I believe they are using it to fast forward and see which movies they are making will do well at the box office  although they would never admit it of course 
Here are a couple of examples of our losing trades to balance things up  
Helius Medical Technologies Inc A  TO HSM  HSM TSX  HSDT on OTC  C 2 86   2 23

After trading Helius well for quite a while  we sold it near to the early October peak  and then bought it back at a lower price early in November  After rising again for some days it suddenly cratered  due to a broker s report that came out before the results of an important medical trial were due to be posted  resulting in instant big losses for those long the stock  and it is thought that this was an organized bear raid where those taking part hastily covered their shorts before the results came out and the price bounced back  This theory is given added credence by the fact that the Accum line actually rose on the drop  Thus there is thought to be a fair chance that a Double Bottom is forming here  especially as the price is at important support and above its rising 200 day moving average although this is a difficult setup because there is a lesser chance that the pattern is instead a bear Flag  We were saved from much bigger losses by a stop at C 3 83  which was only activated at C 3 60 due to a large gap down  
Molori Energy Inc  OTC MOLOF  MOL V  MOLOF on OTC  C 0 30   0 25

 This is another stock that  after showing great promise  did an abrupt about face and ran into the sand  We bought it at the point shown  then it took off higher as expected and everything appeared to be  ship shape and Bristol fashion  but then it lost all its gains  didn t turn up as it should have done at support and has run off into an erosive decline  leaving us with a significant loss  but it s probably too late to ditch it now as the current light volume suggests it could turn up again  Fortunately trades like this are in the minority  Stops are a way to handle such situations  although stops can be a double edged tool as they can frequently result in you being shaken out before a big move  such as befell us with Riot Blockchain as set out above  This is especially the case with low priced stocks 
Oil Stocks
 AMAZ on OTC   0 76
This was an  amazing  trade  because after other investors had done the spade work all year building out an admittedly rather bizarre looking Cup   Handle base  we showed up like royalty at just the right time  the day before a sizable rally started  and grabbed a nice profit on Friday  because after becoming overbought at resistance  it looks like it might now react back or consolidate 

 MVN V  MDLNF on OTC  C 0 25   0 214
Here again we let other slower witted investors do the donkey work of building out a big Head and Shoulders base  and then our limo rolls up to bag a quick 47  profit in 2 weeks   Thank y all   be seeing ya  

General Stock
Enviroleach Technologies Inc  SNX ETI  ETI CSX  EVLLF on OTC  C 1 02   0 808
There s a tremendous  Urban Mining  story behind both Enviroleach and Mineworx Technologie  OTC MWXRF   that   We bought Enviroleach a little early back in September  but  no regrets  because early in November it broke out on big volume and rose strongly  Has reacted back on declining volume in recent weeks in what is believed to be a bull Flag  If this is what it is another upleg should begin soon 

 Any of you PM buffs remember this silver call made in September 2011    


I learnt that one subscriber in California who shorted silver made enough out of this trade to buy his wife a fancy sports car  although this turned out to be a case of enlightened generosity  as guess who ended up driving it most of the time 
Finally  a word about the broad US stockmarket  There was a quite dramatic drop intraday on Friday  the biggest for a long time  after which it rallied late in the day to close only a touch down on the day  This was being hailed in many quarters as a sign of its resilience  because the  buy the dip  crowd dutifully showed up as usual and saved the day  but that s not how it looks to us  That action Friday was a sign of growing nervousness that left behind a large bearish  Hanging Man  candlestick on the chart 

 That big intraday swing also caused the third big VIX spike in as many months on Friday  also a sign of growing nervousness in the markets  While it is widely assumed that Santa will do his thing and bring good cheer to the markets as he does most years  this year he might imbibe a little too much mead or sherry and not be in a fit state to come to the markets  rescue  It is therefore advised to pull in stops tighter than usual and perhaps do some Puts   we will be looking at some on the site  Fundamentally this might relate to the Neocons moving closer to their objective of bringing down Trump  since the markets might drop hard in the face of the crisis that would result 

 The successful use of charts as demonstrated in this review depends above all on common sense  experience and a sense of proportion  in this game formal qualifications count for nothing  In this sense at least the market is a level playing field in that it doesn t care if you are the Prince of Monaco or a taxi driver   if you get it right you win  if you don t you lose  The reason why so many highly qualified people  especially those with PHDs  fall on their faces trading markets is that they arrive on the scene with a superiority complex and the market quickly cuts them down to size ",2017-12-04,Clive Maund,https://www.investing.com/analysis/now-try-telling-me-that-charts-don39t-work-200270055,200270055

Traders and investors track the transportation sector as a leading indicator for the overall market  At this time  the transport sector is still in an up trend as it remains above its 50 day moving average on the daily chart  So Wednesday s decline is nothing more than a pullback  This moving average is very important for the trend and is watched by many institutional traders  A daily chart close below the 50 day moving average could signal trouble for the transportation sector and the overall stock market ",2017-07-19,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-transportation-flashing-a-warning-sign-200202141,200202141

193881,415397,CSX,The Energy Report  Oil Supply Falling And Geo Political Worries Rising,opinion,"Major oil draw and a Saudi Arabian coup  The Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported another major 4 727 million barrel drawdown in crude supply even as US shale production rebounded last week causing US oil production to rise to 9 43 million barrels per day  up from 9 4 million barrels which puts it at a two year high  We know that EU s oil inventories are draining at a record rate  but it is not the only place where we see evidence of global rebalancing which helped oil close at a 6  week high 
In Saudi Arabia  a report showed that Saudi domestic oil stocks fell to just 259 million barrels at the end of May 2017  which was the lowest level since January 2012  according to updated figures published on Tuesday from Reuters  That would mark Saudi crude stocks declining 16 out of the last 19 months and a sure sign of global market rebalancing  Saudi crude exports to the US also declined  hitting the lowest level since 2015  If the Saudi s follow through on their threat to cut their exports by another 1 million barrels  it would cause US oil inventors to plummet even father 
Shale oil production  as impressive as it is  would be no match for that magnitude of a cut and we would see the inventory glut disappear rather quickly  Shale producers  according to Reuters  have increased by almost 12 percent since mid 2016 to 9 4 million barrels per day  bpd  which has not been enough to stop the US crude and Saudi crude inventory drain game that is going to accelerate even as we are nearing so called seasonal peak demand for oil  And while we may see a pullback due do the seasonal drop in demand  a new commitment from OPEC against improving global demand should cause a price rise 
For shale producers  a price spike is desperately need because a lot of shale oil producers may be unhedged after the end of the year  Reuters reported that while most  though not all  shale producers have hedged the price of their output for the remainder of 2017  which gives them some protection in the short term against the downturn  But very little production has been hedged so far for 2018  The current calendar strip means hedging is only possible for 2018 at a WTI price of around  47   and many shale producers can t make money at that level 
Gillian Rich at the IBD wrote that Continental Resources  NYSE CLR  CEO Harold Hamm as saying for shale  50 oil isn t sustainable and that a drop below  40 would idle rigs  Rich points out that Baker Hughes reported the first drop in U S  rig counts since January  and U S  drillers only added two rigs last week in early warning signs of a shale pullback  The IBD says that even railroad companies are warning about a pullback on U S  crude prices and production  During its quarterly conference call Wednesday  railroad operator CSX  NASDAQ CSX  said it has idled 26 000 rail cars as crude oil train shipments fell to zero  That s right  zero 
Soon declining US oil supply in storage means we will be more sensitive to geo political events that could impact oil flow 
The market is coming to grips with the fact that Venezuela is on the verge of a collapse but could there be more risk of instability in Saudi Arabia that could blindside this market at some point 
What some may describe as coup  what may have taken place in the Kingdom as the ascension of Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman may have not been as smooth and easy as thought  Reports by the Wall Street Journal suggest that former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was held against his will and forced to give up his position in an offer he could not refused  And while publicly he has kissed the ring  things may never be the same between the  House of Saud  and bin Nayef  The WSJ says that with Mohammed bin Salman s elevation  Mohammed bin Nayef disappeared from public view 
Overnight some House of Saud royal family members were arrested  Arab News reported that Riyadh police have arrested a member of the Saudi royal family who abused citizens verbally and physically in a widely spread video that went viral over the past few days  The arrest came at the orders of Saudi King Salman who issued an immediate warrant for Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and the imprisonment of all those involved in abusive behavior towards citizens 
There have been other notable issues in Saudi Arabia  Oilprice reports two Saudi teachers are standing trial in Saudi Arabia on charges that they have allegedly spied for arch rival Iran in gathering information about a 5 million bpd oil pipeline for the purposes of planning to blow it up  Reuters reported on Wednesday  quoting two Saudi newspapers  According to the Makkah and Al Weeam newspapers  as carried by Reuters  the two men are charged with collecting information about the East West Pipeline in Saudi Arabia  known as Petroline  which ships crude oil from the desert Kingdom s eastern provinces to the Red Sea port of Yanbu  to be exported to North America and Europe  The Petroline can handle up to some 60 percent of Saudi Arabia s total oil exports ",2017-07-20,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-07-20-17-200202316,200202316

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

5 Strong Buy Stocks with Notable Relative Price Strength 

	Investors generally gauge a stock s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark 

	If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns 

	Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy 

	Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains 

Screening Parameters

Relative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   1 week greater than 0 

	 We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S P 500 over the last 12 weeks  4 weeks and 1 week  

  Change  Q1  Est  over 4 Weeks greater than 0  Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks 

Zacks Rank equal to 1  Only Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks   that have returned more than 26  annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years   can get through  You can see     

Current Price greater than or equal to  5 and Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000   A minimum price of  5 is a good standard to screen low priced stocks  while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity 

  less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential

Against this backdrop  investors will keenly await earnings reports of key railroads companies like CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited   NYSE CP   on Apr 19 According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase its odds of an earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  In this context  the Jacksonville  FL based  CSX Corporation s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an Earnings ESP of  2 33   makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat in Q1  Read more    CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

193907,415423,CSX,Hill Rom Holdings  HRC  Q2 Earnings  A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,We expect Hill Rom Holdings  Inc    NYSE HRC   to beat expectations when it reports second quarter fiscal 2017 results  before market opens on Apr 28 Last quarter  the company s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents  However  in the last four quarters  Hill Rom Holdings  earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate at an average of 3 11   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Hill Rom Holdings is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP   Hill Rom Holdings has an of  1 27  as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 80 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 79 cents  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Hill Rom Holdings Inc Price and EPS Surprise   Zacks Rank  Hill Rom Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions The combination of Hill Rom Holdings  Zacks Rank  2 and  1 27  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings Hill Rom Holdings  operating performance has been quite encouraging of late based on successful execution of its strategic priorities  These priorities include planned international expansion  innovation  portfolio transformation through accretive acquisition and non core divestiture The company consistently invests in Research and Development programs  including the recent launch of Welch Allyn Home Hypertension Program which allows patients to monitor blood pressure levels outside the physician office  The company also enjoys strong hold in the Diabetic retinopathy space  We believe this momentum should continue with the recently launched RetinaVue 100 Imager  a breakthrough handheld technology for primary care settings Last quarter  the company introduced the Envella Air Fluidized Therapy bed with an advanced surface that provides highest quality of wound care and faster healing We also take note of Hill Rom Holdings  marketed product  Integrated Table Motion for the da Vinci Xi Surgical System  which has already garnered significant customer acceptance and has provided satisfactory results in the last reported first quarter of fiscal 2017 Hill Rom Holdings has also designed and developed a new TruSystem 3000 Mobile Operating Table  This cost effective  reliable and flexible operating table enhances the Surgical Solutions product portfolio We expect all these product introductions to drive positive results in the yet to be reported quarter With respect to strategic takeovers  the company acquired diagnostic cardiology and patient monitoring technology company Mortara Instrument in the month of February  This acquisition should help Hill Rom Holdings expand its diagnostic cardiology franchise  It will also complement and enhance its Welch Allyn line s presence in vital signs monitoring and drive Hill Rom Holdings  second quarter revenues We are also optimistic about the company s plans to rebound its international business from the second quarter  Notably  the business has been disappointing in the past few quarters on challenging macroeconomic environment in international markets  A gradually stabilizing U S  eco political environment and favorable international comparisons are expected to accelerate international revenue growth for the remainder of the year The recent strategic non core asset divestitures which include the architectural products business and WatchChild are also expected to drive the company s top line Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter Angie s List  Inc    NASDAQ ANGI   has an Earnings ESP of  40 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   has an Earnings ESP of  2 33  and a Zacks Rank  2 Preferred Bank   NASDAQ PFBC   has an Earnings ESP of  1 43  and a Zacks Rank  2 Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply

193924,415440,CSX,CSX Switching Tracks To The Upside Into Earnings,opinion,"The transportation sector has refused to join the other indexes in reaching new all time highs this year  Many aspects have looked ready to break higher  including trucking and delivery stocks  but have failed to do so  The railroads have also looked ready to move higher and some have done that  One more data point in that series comes out tonight as CSX  NASDAQ CSX  reports earnings 
CSX stock made a high near 38 in May last year  From there it ran lower to an ultimate low near 22 in January  a drop of over 40   But since that low it has slowly drifted higher with a series of higher lows and higher highs  It is called rounding out a bottom  There has not been any major run  just chugging along higher with some short term pullbacks along the way  But the story keeps looking brighter 
In April it moved back over its 200 day SMA for the first time in 10 months and after some back and forth the 50 day SMA crossed up through the 200 day in May  Following that Golden Cross the price has remained over the 200 day SMA ever since  In September it moved up over a resistance range that had caused trouble in late 2015 and then again in July  Into earnings it is pulling back towards that range 

The short term question will be whether or not it holds as support  The momentum indicators are shifting to the downside short term with the MACD about to cross down and the RSI pulling back from a technically overbought condition  The path following the report seems easiest to the downside 
The October options chain shows the at the money straddle looking for a  1 40 move  4 6   by expiry next Friday  That would make for a range of 28 90 to 31 70  The lower end of that range is right back at the bottom of the resistance zone discussed above  Open interest is focused from 29 to 32  and biggest on the call side by a factor of 3  Short interest is low at less than 2  
If you are compelled to own this stock on its reversal  the earnings event may give an excellent opportunity to get in at a sub market price  Buying an October 30 29 1 2 Put Spread at a credit of 6 cents gives participation on a move lower to 29 and if it closes under 29 at expiry an entry there  but with a basis of 28 
That is right at the July through August base support  If you cannot do a 1 2 Put Spread then a 30 29 28 Put Butterfly accomplishes the same thing and only costs 15 cents  This one also gives protection should there be a big problem and the stock falls precipitously 
Another way to trade for a longer term upside gain is to use a Call Calendar  An October January 32 Call Calendar for 65 cents looks for the large open interest and options implied price move to hold the stock under 32 next week  then to continue higher over time

193925,415441,CSX,5 Transportation Stocks Likely To Top Q3 Earnings,opinion,"The transportation sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has made a strong start to the Q3 season in spite of the multiple headwinds it currently faces  Leading sector participants like Delta Air Lines Inc   NYSE DAL   CSX Corporation  NASDAQ CSX  and United Continental Holdings  UAL  reported better than expected earnings in the quarter  thereby raising optimism among investors 
According to the Zacks  report  transportation companies that have reported till Oct 14 have outperformed on the earnings front  However  this sector   comprising airline companies  truckers  shippers and railroads to name a few  is unlikely to continue the momentum till the very end of the current earnings season  According to the report  the bottom line earnings for the sector is expected to decrease by 19 8  in Q3  making it as one of eight Zacks sectors that are likely to exit the quarter with a year over year decline in earnings 
The worst performer  as has been the case in the last few quarters  is again likely to be the Energy sector  In fact  this sector is expected to witness bottom line deterioration of 71 9  in the current reporting cycle  Despite the improvement in pricing this year as well as the OPEC s surprise decision last month to curb production for the first time since 2008  oil continues to trade below  55 a barrel   nearly half the level reached two years ago 
Nonetheless  low oil prices have been a godsend for transportation players as fuel is one of the major input costs for any company in the space  Given that oil prices have been low for more than two years  it is natural that this major tailwind has already been accounted for and priced in  Despite its waning impact  cheap oil remains one of the major growth drivers for the transportation sector Headwinds
As noted earlier the transportation sector is poised to take a beating in Q3 thanks to the multiple headwinds that the sector faces  The challenges include declining travel demand due to security concerns associated with more frequent terrorist attacks  Brexit induced uncertainty  declining coal shipments and driver shortages  to name a few  The limited impact of cheap oil is also unfavorable for transportation players 
The bearish Zacks Industry ranks of most of the sub groups of the transportation industry are also reflective of the headwinds confronting the space  For example  the Transportation Airline  Transportation Truck  Transportation Ship and the Transportation Equipment   Leasing units carry a bearish Zacks Industry rank of 226  242  213 and 236  respectively among more than 260 groups Is an Earnings Beat Likely 
Despite the tough times the entire sector is going through  registering an earnings beat should not be a very difficult for some of the sector participants  This is primarily because the plethora of issues in the sector have resulted in earnings estimates moving south for quite some time owing to multiple downward revisions  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is quite conservative and much lower in most cases than the comparable year ago figure  For example  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Airlines Group s  AAL  third quarter of 2016 earnings is  1 66 per share  much lower than the year ago figure of  2 72 How to Select the Potential Winners 
Given the widely diversified nature of the transportation space it is a daunting task to select stocks that have the potential to outperform in the current earnings season  The headwinds faced by these companies make the job picking the attractive stocks even tougher  This is where the Zacks methodology shows its mettle  According to our quantitative model  stocks having a combination of a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  are likely to report better than expected earnings  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   An earnings beat more often than not boosts investor confidence in the stock  which translates into rapid price appreciation 
Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate Our Picks

Fed releases Beige Book  mortgage applications jump back to back 
The Federal Reserve s Beige Book  a tool summarizing economic activity across the nation used by the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  to prepare for its next two day meeting set to conclude on July 27  was released in afternoon action 
The report showed that U S  economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace across most regions and while employment continued to increase during the period  the rate of growth ranged from little change to moderate  Consumer spending  though positive  was reported as showing some signs of softening  and manufacturing was mixed  Reporting districts noted that the outlook remained positive but deteriorated 
As noted in the recent   while we agree that the July FOMC meeting is likely off the table for a move on rates  we aren t dismissing the possibility of a hike later in the year  A lot can happen in a few months and if financial markets stabilize  the job market remains healthy  and inflation pressures rise  the Fed could look to move toward a more  normal  rate  while also giving it some room to act if when the U S  economy begins showing recession risks 
The MBA Mortgage Application Index rose 7 2  last week after jumping 14 2  in the previous week  The second straight solid weekly gain was led by an 11 2  rise for the Refinance Index  while the Purchase Index came in flat  The average 30 year mortgage rate fell 6 basis points  bps  to 3 60

Tomorrow  the U S  economic calendar will yield the release of the Producer Price Index  expected to have increased 0 3  for May after rising 0 2  the month prior  and weekly initial jobless claims  forecasted to show an increase to a level of 265 000 
Europe modestly retreats from steep rally  Asia extends winning streak 
European equities finished slightly lower on the heels of a four session rally that came as the global markets recovered from the fallout from the late June vote in the U K  to leave the European Union  known as Brexit  Financials lagged as Italian banking worries festered  while energy issues were bogged down by a drop in crude oil prices in the wake of a mixed U S  oil inventory report 
However  the appointment of Home Secretary Theresa May as the new U K  Prime Minister cleared up some political uncertainty  while hopes of further stimulus measures in Japan and expectations of a rate cut from the Bank of England tomorrow added some support 
Stocks in Asia extended their recent winning streak to three days as the global markets continued to recover from the post Brexit fallout pressure  remaining buoyed by expectations of further Japanese stimulus measures and some political clarity in the U K  Japanese equities rose  adding to the rally as of late as expectations continued to be elevated that Prime Minister Abe  coming off his ruling party s convincing weekend upper house election victory  is close to announcing more aggressive stimulus measures 
Gains in Japan came even as the yen rebounded somewhat from its recent drop and as a Japanese government spokesperson denied an earlier media report that suggested government officials are considering  helicopter money  as a policy option 
Stocks trading in mainland China and Hong Kong extended their recent gains on speculation that the government is taking steps to support investor sentiment  per Bloomberg  After the closing bell  China reported a slightly smaller than expected drop in June exports  which came ahead of Thursday night s release of the nation s 2Q GDP report  expected to show year over year growth slowed to 6 6  from 6 7  in 1Q 
Finally  equities in Australia and South Korea advanced  while Indian securities were mostly flat  despite late yesterday s mostly upbeat data on the nation s industrial production and consumer price inflation 
The international economic docket for tomorrow will be limited  with expected economic reports consisting of inflation expectations  employment data and new vehicle sales from Australia 
Meanwhile  in central bank action  tomorrow the Bank of England is expected to announce a 25 basis point reduction to its official bank rate  which would lower the rate to 0 25   while the Bank of Korea will also meet and is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 25  ",2016-07-14,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-manage-mild-moves-and-mixed-finish-200141761,200141761

Commentary In the last T2108 Update  I noted how the market s strength at the time seemed to run contrary to a host of other bearish signals  That surprising strength continued to start trading for December when the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  N SPY   launched for a 1 1  gain  The close represented a breakout above a very tight range of churn that held the index in place for 7 trading days  Yesterday  December 2  the S P 500 perfectly reversed all those gains and brought bearish highlights back into prominence 
First  note in the chart below how all the trading action continues to unfold neatly  right on top of the 20 day moving average  DMA  

The S P 500 reversed a strong start to December trading but still sits neatly above support at its 20 day moving average  DMA 
If the S P 500 had closed below its 20DMA  I would have added a  bearish shade  to my neutral short term trading call  Still  I am wary  Thanks to my favorite technical indicator  T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  I know that the past two trading days are not the mirror images they appear to be in the chart of the S P 500 
T2108 barely budged on the index s 1 1  rally  Yesterday s 1 1  reversal exacted a HEAVY toll on T2108 as it dropped from 54 7  to 45 8   In other words  this notable setback signaled poor market breadth  Stocks broadly participated in the selling but NOT in the buying  Such behavior signals the kind of poor breadth that can precede larger sell offs once buyers tire of the same few select winning trending stocks 

T2108 exhibited a very imbalanced response to the buying and selling that left the S P 500 flat for the first two days of December 
The Volatility Index  the VIX  added a bit to the alarm by closing above the 15 35 pivot line  The main trading signal comes when the VIX separates from this pivot line 

The volatility index has churned around the important 15 35 pivot for 8 trading days now 
When December jumped to such a roaring start  celebrations seemed in order  I even saw headlines breathlessly speculating on an early start to the seasonal  Santa Claus  rally  The reversal says  not so fast  
However  bears cannot get overly excited either  December tends to be one of the least risky months of the year based on maximum drawdowns  Here is a telling chart from a piece I wrote in November  2014  December has the LOWEST average maximum drawdown of any month in the year 

2014 s October drawdown made up for below average drawdowns in the S P 500 s two other  most dangerous  months
The S P 500 once again survived its most dangerous months of the year  This time the recovery came in rapid order in October  The index is now sitting on a 1 0  year to date gain  This year seems to set to defy the January barometer  earlier this year  But it will be a close call  There are several important market events coming this month including an OPEC meeting and a likely rate hike from the Federal Reserve which could swing markets wildly  I am expecting profitable trades on BOTH to the upside and the downside before this month settles into the relative calm of the Christmas season  As always  I will take this one step at a time  Let s see how the market responds to the current setback 
I conclude with one chart  CSX Corporation  N CSX   one of America s major railroads 

CSX Corporation  CSX  plunges back into 50DMA support after reducing its guidance for earnings in 2015

CommentaryIn the last T2108 Update I warned that the S P 500  N SPY  experienced a notable setback  The action today  December 3  2015  delivered definitive follow through selling 

The S P 500  SPY  plunges through its 200 DMA again on its way to a retest of 50 DMA support 
Note that my trading call was not predicting the market s reaction to the news of the day  the latest monetary policy decision from the European Central Bank  ECB   What I will call the Draghi Drubbing  the president of the ECB is Mario Draghi  simply provided a sufficient catalyst to trigger the follow through selling  Think of the market being primed to throw a tantrum at even the slightest disappointment  The divergence I noted exposed the market s true underlying weakness 
So now  in just three days  the S P 500 has gone from a celebratory start featuring a quick 1 1  gain to a 1 5  loss on the month that has traders worried about all the rest of the economic and policy news coming down the pipe this month  However  as I stated in the last T2108 Update  bears cannot get too excited  December is typically a very tame month even in terms of maximum drawdowns  Indeed  T2108 has plunged right back to territory that in recent years has often preceded quick recoveries  The last close below 40  occurred on November 13  The next trading day  the S P 500  practically inexplicably  jumped 1 5   That was the start of the last  short  rally 

T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their 40 DMAs  is at a 2 month low 
The next catalyst for the market is the U S  jobs report for November  Just as the market was primed to react poorly to bad news the previous day  it is now primed to react very well to good news  I honestly have no idea anymore whether a strong jobs report will be interpreted as good or bad by the market at this juncture where a rate hike seems like a done deal  I will be in reaction mode  not prediction mode 
The Volatility Index  the VIX  jumped off its 15 35 pivot  If the market reacts well to the jobs report  fading volatility might be the best trade for the day 

The volatility index gains new life thanks to the Draghi Drubbing
If you still do not believe you have to pay attention to the currency market during tense market moments  THIS day should have cured you of this mistake  Currencies are tempering any bullish expectations I might have otherwise had with T2108 this low  I am keeping the short term trading call at neutral   The tremendous surge in the euro  N FXE  likely blew up a lot of carry trades that were helping to fuel stocks higher  Perhaps more importantly  the Australian dollar s  N FXA  rally against the Japanese yen  N FXY  finally came to a screeching halt right at 200 DMA resistance  My favorite forex indicator for stocks could be signaling further downside for stocks 

The Australian dollar s contrarian rally may have finally come to an end as AUD JPY fails to break through 200 DMA resistance 
Perhaps the big irony of the day is that the U S  dollar index  DXY0  plunged thanks to the euro and provided the Fed a much easier setup for raising rates  Draghi s drubbing demonstrated that a straight line to the easier money the market wants and expects no longer exists  Moreover  Janet Yellen testified in Congress on the Fed and monetary policy and once again made it clear that the Fed is more than likely on the way to hiking rates this month  The end result  A euro over extended above its upper Bollinger  Band  BB  against a whole host of currencies  a dollar index that managed to erase a month of gains in just one day  a iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  N TLT  that managed to lose a whopping 2 7   and odds of a December rate hike around their highest level yet 

The euro soared against the U S  dollar from multi month lows to a 1 month high in one day  Note that the 50 DMA is still holding as resistance 

The U S  dollar index plunged 2 1   Very conveniently  it is right back to its level right before the jobs report for October 

The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  N TLT  plunged as yields soared  The 200 DMA held as resistance 

The odds for a December rate hike increased on the day   just about the highest level yet 
If the jobs report extends all of these moves even further  then perhaps we better brace for a December that does indeed get more raucous than usual

Commentary
The day before the Federal Reserve issues yet another decision on monetary policy  the stock market took a turn that raised red flags 
T2108  my favorite technical indicator  plunged to its lowest level in almost three weeks  This move suggests that T2108 will NOT flip overbought anytime soon after all 

T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  plunges away from the overbought threshold
The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  N SPY   did not follow this sharp move  Instead  the index  gently  pulled back to 200DMA support and neatly bounced from there into the close 

The S P 500 pulls off an apparently successful test of support at its 200DMA
The volatility index  the VIX  traded up a mere 0 9  to close just above its pivot line  So no alarm is present here  meaning that there is little point in playing my typical  fade volatility  pre post Fed trade  

The VIX struggles to close above its pivot line 
Only the transports provided clear confirmation that underlying technicals for the market took a turn for the worse on the day yesterday  The iShares Transportation Average ETF  N IYT  dropped 2 7  although it did manage to close above its 50DMA support  Railroad CSX Corp   N CSX  was not so lucky at the end of its 3 8  loss on the day 

Transports take a dive on the day but hold support at the 50DMA 

Railroad CSX suffers another 50DMA breakdown
I would be very prepared to get more aggressive with short positions if not for the Federal Reserve meeting today  Wednesday  October 28  2015  As usual  I expect the Fed to work its magic to try to soothe any outstanding fears out in the market  However  the volatility index did not increase enough going into the meeting to make a good risk reward trade to fade volatility  So  I am stuck in neutral until the Fed ushers down its latest declarations 
The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  O IBB  also ran contrary to my bias to get more bearish given T2108 s plunge  IBB continues to show more life  It rallied for a 3 2  gain on the day in an impressive show of relative strength  IBB closed right at its 50DMA resistance so follow through in the next few days will be key 
Note that I sold my last IBB related position on the spike higher on the previous day  That includes Gilead  O GILD    I decided not to risk holding the call options through earnings 

The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB  is showing more and more signs of life  Early signs of buying interest are paying off now

194010,415526,CSX,CSX  Exceptional Performer Still A Reasonable Investment,opinion,"CSX has performed exceptionally well over the past decade 
The  usual suspect  metrics like P E ratios  dividend yield and expected earnings growth indicate that the company might be a reasonable investment 
This article takes a  behind the scenes  view of a variety of additional fundamental data 
Based in Jacksonville  Florida  CSX Corporation  NYSE CSX  has roots dating back to the early nineteenth century   starting in 1827 when the nation s first common carrier was  the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company   Today 30 000 plus employees are responsible for 21 000 route miles in 23 states with access to over 70 ocean  river and lake port terminals  Railroads remain as the low cost transportation option where no waterway connects the origin and destination of shipments 
As such  you might imagine that as economies grow  requiring more shipping both domestically and internationally  the need for CSX is substantiated  In fact  CSX has not only been sustaining itself but more readily growing 
For instance  as described by  analyst Keith Schoonmaker  here s how that message looks in words 

  CSX s competitive advantages are inseparable from the geography of its track  Its Eastern U S  network stretches a bit farther in latitude than that of competitor Norfolk Southern  reaching into Florida and New England  The location of all its assets enables CSX to attract a diverse mix of commodities  CSX made meteoric progress in its operations during the past decade  improving safety  shortening terminal dwell time  and increasing on time arrivals  In almost every measure of operating performance  CSX moved the needle significantly  

By utilizing  here s how that looks in a picture 

It is true that the company had one down year  yet it seems the  impossible to replicate  assets and  nearly impenetrable barrier to entry  helps not only protect but also drive CSX s profits   which grew by over 17  per annum since the end of 2004  As such  an investor would have seen returns of over 18  per year during this time 

Ordinarily we might dig a bit deeper into this side of the analysis by looking at the price and earnings correlation  why the performance results came out as they did along with the estimated returns looking forward  However  for this article we would like to focus on some of the fundamental underlying numbers  or  FUN   aspects of this company as well  In doing so  we will see one of the most important concepts in reviewing a company  the total business results and the per share results are not necessarily the same thing 
A case in point comes in the way of looking at common equity  ce  or book value  Below we see that from the end of 2005 until 2013 CSX was able to grow total common equity from about  8 billion to  10 5 billion in 2013   a compound rate of about 3 5   However  notice that in 4 of the 8 years there was a decrease in book value and generally the growth wasn t very consistent   

Conversely  when we view the common equity per share  ceps  figures below  we see a much more consistent and positive rate of growth  Per share book value jumped from about  6 a share to over  10 a share for a compound rate of about 6 5   Moreover  there were just 2 negative years  and even then the book value only decreased by 1  annually 

So what s the underlying cause of this discrepancy  Quite simply  CSX began an effective share repurchase program  Below we can see that common shares outstanding  csho  went from about 1 3 billion at the end of 2005 to just over 1 billion by 2013   a 3  yearly reduction  Said differently  the reason why per share book value was largely consistent and growing was due to a solid buyback plan 

Perhaps just as interesting is the idea that this has only been the case as of late  If we look further back in history   back to 1994 for instance   we see that common shares outstanding actually increased in some years and remained in the 1 25 to 1 3 billion share range for a long time  So in the future this might be something to monitor  will CSX continue its strong repurchase program or will share count remain constant  If it s the former an investor  possible given that CSX is presently in the middle of a  1 billion share   might see per share growth outstrip total company growth in all metrics 

Beyond repurchasing shares  paying a dividend is likely the most well known way to return cash to shareholders  To this point CSX has shown a strong propensity to do so by not only paying but also increasing its dividend for the last 10 consecutive years  With shares currently yielding about 2 1   it s prudent to include this expected cash flow in your expected return assumptions  So if you re going to count on this cash component  you might want to check in on its sustainability 
Below we have included a per share graph dating back to the end of 2005  Here we see cash flow per share  cflps  as the top light blue line along with capital expenditures per share  capxps  and dividends paid per share  dvpps   Note that cash flow and capital expenditures are somewhat inconsistent while dividends are much more reliable  Additionally  notice that cash flow was able to cover the combination of the capital expenditure and dividend obligations in every year  Moving forward  you might note that the dividend is well covered but there could be a reason that the payout ratio remains somewhat subdued  railroads require large capital expenditures  a nuisance with regard to payouts and yet a blessing in respect a competitive advantage 

Thus  the cash flows of the business should be continuously monitored   In addition to the sustainability of a business s obligations  you might also be interested in the returns generated on behalf of your capital  Below we see a depiction of CSX s return on equity  roe  and return on invested capital  roic  over the past 8 years  Notice that both have been increasing slightly   with ROE hovering around 20  and ROIC at about 11  

This concept follows through with the company s margins  Again  note the steady improvement as time has gone on  Gross profit margin  gpm  has increased from about 30  in 2006 to about 38  last year  Likewise  net profit margin  npm  has improved moving from under 14  to over 15  

These metrics   increasing returns and improved margins   are even more impressive when coupled with growing sales  As indicated below  sales have been largely consistent since 2004 with just 1 down year in the last 10 years  It is true that the growth isn t that impressive  but this is precisely why CSX has been a solid investment over the last decade  Improved margins  better returns  dividends and share buybacks do wonders for a company that barely grew total revenue 

Although we were primarily focused on taking a  FUN  or fundamental look at CSX  it can also be useful to look at where the shares are presently trading and what the future prospects could look like  Here we see that CSX is presently trading at just under 17 times earnings  Collectively  analysts reporting to S P Capital IQ come to a median long term growth estimate of about 9   If you add in the dividend   and assume an ending P E of 15   this might indicate a 10 1  annual return assuming the estimated earnings come to fruition 

Overall we found CSX to be a solid company at a reasonable valuation that has been improving as of late  Due to this improvement  it might be the case that future enhancements would be subdued  After all  it s hard to grow margins perpetually  for instance  Thus  on a forward looking basis you might expect returns to stabilize and even bake in a bit of caution  In addition  we find that it s useful to view not just the ordinary metrics but also a variety of additional fundamental data points  For example  looking at the dividend yield is okay  Looking at the payout ratio is good  Yet looking at cash flows and other requirements in comparison to what is being paid out is even better  And of course  you can go much further than we did in this article  Per usual  we encourage the reader to conduct his or her own thorough due diligence

194033,415549,CSX,Investors In Common Stocks Must Get Valuation Right  Here s How ,opinion,The investment industry is replete with pundits and self proclaimed experts espousing various principles and rules that allegedly are the best way to value a stock correctly  Unfortunately  and in most cases  these rules are stated as fact  but unfortunately very few facts are ever presented to back them up   In other words  much of it is either opinion or gleaned from something they ve read or been taught before   But even as a young boy  I was never willing to accept dogma as fact without simultaneously being provided supporting evidence and a logical explanation as to the  why  that they work In fifth grade I was once sent to the principal s office by my English teacher because I made her cry   She cried because every time she would regurgitate a rule of grammar  punctuation or spelling  she expected me to accept it unconditionally  merely because she said so   For example  she would say something like I before E except after C expecting me to simply accept this rule as fact  I  on the other hand  not meaning to be argumentative or disruptive  only inquisitive  would immediately raise my hand in class and ask a simple question why  No matter what rule she would state  I would relentlessly raise my hand and ask okay  but why   I was not willing to have the rule dictated to me  I needed to understand why it was the rule and why it was important Now that I am an adult  I have continued to embrace my inquisitive nature  and to this day I will not accept a dogmatic statement without understanding why   On the other hand  when I can review supporting evidence that validates the rule and therefore understand its significance  relevance and validity  then and only then  through my understanding it  can I embrace it willingly and passionately   Therefore  as an author of financial articles  I believe my readers should hold me to this same standard that I hold others to   Consequently  this article is designed to illuminate the  why  behind widely accepted notions of valuing a business primarily based on earnings  discounting cash flows  When Investing in a Business Earnings Determine Intrinsic ValueIn his best selling book One Up On Wall Street  famed portfolio manager Peter Lynch dedicated his entire 10th chapter to earnings and thus titled it  Earnings  Earnings  Earnings  In the chapter s second paragraph he succinctly stated the importance of earnings as follows  There are many theories  but to me  it always comes down to earnings and assets   Especially earnings   Sometimes it takes years for the stock price to catch up to a company s value  and the down periods last so long that investors begin to doubt that it will ever happen  But value always wins out or at least in enough cases that it s worthwhile to believe it  An important foundational principle behind this discussion is the idea that we are talking about investing as part owners of strong businesses  rather than trading stocks   Business owners are rewarded through the profits the companies they own are capable of generating on their behalf  These rewards can come in the form of salaries and bonuses for active owners  and from increasing value or cash flow from dividends for passive shareholders  In either event  all these rewards are ultimately a function of the businesses  earnings capability  at least in the longer run   Therefore  we should realize that when you truly invest in a stock  you really are investing in its ability to earn more money for you in the future When I first read Peter Lynch s famous book in 1990  I had already developed a strong belief in the importance of earnings regarding assessing the fair value of an operating business   Therefore  the theory behind Peter Lynch s wisdom already resonated deep within me   However  as already stated  it was the facts behind the theory that interested me the most  In fact  I was so committed to the notion that earnings determine market price  that I developed my own stock graphing tool that allowed me to evaluate the true relationship between a company s earnings and its stock price over time The following additional quotes from Chapter 10 of Peter Lynch s book titled  Earnings  Earnings  Earnings  speak to the importance of valuing a business based on its earnings power  you can see the importance of earnings on any chart that has an earnings line running alongside the stock price    On chart after chart the two lines will move in tandem  or if the stock price stays away from the earnings line  sooner or later it will come back to earnings  A few pages later  Peter offers us another nugget of wisdom on the earnings and price relationship  plus a little bit of investing advice thrown in  a quick way to tell if a stock is overpriced is to compare the price line to the earnings line    If you bought familiar growth companies   when the stock price fell well below the earnings line  and sold them when the stock price rose dramatically above it  the chances are you would do pretty well  Now that we ve reviewed some investing axioms and nuggets from Mr  Peter Lynch  let s see if we can perform two extremely important tasks  First and most importantly  let s see if we can answer the more important question as to why earnings determine market price  not just that it does  Next  let s produce some evidence that verifies the veracity of Mr  Peter Lynch s words  In order to accomplish both of these important tasks we will rely on visual representation  and mathematical proofs provided by  How to Value a Company s Earnings and WhyThe essential point underpinning the thesis of this article  is that when you re investing in a business you re not actually buying the stock  you re buying the company s earnings power   The stock is only the vessel that contains the earnings you are purchasing   When buying earnings  the principles of value apply just like they do with any other product or service  The easiest way to understand this clearly  is to think in terms of the price you pay to buy  1 dollar s worth of one company s earnings versus  1 dollar s worth of another company s earnings In other words  let s look at two companies to see what the price  and therefore  value  of  1 dollar s worth of earnings are  However  before we do  let s establish some doctrine that we are going to focus on  First and foremost  remember that we are going to buy  1 dollar s worth of earnings for each of our two companies   Now  we need to clearly understand that once either of those dollar s worth of earnings are taken out of the business and put into our pockets  the value of each dollar s worth of earnings is precisely the same  When separated from the business  a dollar is a dollar  and a dollar from one company will buy no more or no less than a dollar from another company However  we also have to deal with the fact that  1 dollar s worth of each respective company has a different cost   This then begs the question  why   In other words  why would we pay more to buy company A s dollar worth of earnings than we would to buy Company B s dollar worth of earnings  Since a dollar s worth of each company s earnings once received outside of the business is worth exactly the same  why would we pay more to buy one of the dollars than the other The reason  as we will develop more fully later  is that if we are long term investors in businesses  we are actually buying future earnings  not current earnings  Therefore  the amount of earnings we accumulate in the future will be a function of the company s earnings growth rate  and will determine what price we paid today to buy those future earnings of tomorrow  Let s clarify this by examining the dynamics of our two example companies  We will start with history presented as evidence of what has actually already happened  and then we will move on to the future  which we believe is actually more relevant Our first example is Sherwin Williams Co   SHW   which has achieved a historical earnings growth rate of 9 6  since 1999  At the bottom of the graph you can see that earnings have grown from  1 81 per share in 1999  to an estimate of  5 67 per share for fiscal 2012  see yellow highlighted earnings at the bottom of the graph    This represents approximately a three fold increase in earnings over the past 14 years  The primary point is that every  1 dollar s worth of earnings you bought in 1999  are now worth approximately  3 dollars  Another way to put this is that Sherwin Williams  future dollars in 2012 only cost one third as much as the original  1 dollars worth of earnings cost in 1999 Our second example  CSX Corp   CSX   grew earnings per share at the higher rate of 12 9  since calendar year 1999   Therefore  earnings per share grew from   26 a share in calendar year 1999 to  1 86 per share estimated for fiscal year end 2012  see yellow highlighted earnings at the bottom of the graph   This is approximately a seven fold increase in earnings per share over this 14 year period  The primary point is that every  1 dollar s worth of earnings you bought in 1999  are now worth approximately  7 dollars  Consequently  shareholders that bought CSX in 1999 only paid 1 7th of the original price for calendar year 2012 earnings   In other words  due to the company s historical earnings growth rate  future earnings were significantly cheaper than original earnings  As we will discover next  herein lays the essence of fair value  or what others call intrinsic value of a business  common stock  Now let s move to current time to examine what price we have to pay to buy  1 dollar s worth of each of our example company s earnings today  and attempt to calculate what  1 dollar s worth of future earnings are actually costing us  The metric that establishes that price is the common PE ratio   One of the definitions of the PE ratio is  The price you pay to buy  1 dollar s worth of a company s earnings   Remember though  we are pricing  1 dollars worth of today s earnings  even though in actuality what matters most is the price we re paying to buy  1 dollars worth of future earnings In the case of Sherman Williams  SHW   today we are asked to pay  20 90  current PE ratio 20 9 see red circle at right of graph   to buy our  1 dollar s worth of current earnings   As an aside  you can note from the graph that this is the highest valuation or price that you were asked to pay to buy a  1 dollar s worth of Sherwin Williams  earnings since 1999   In other words  Sherwin Williams  stock appears very expensive today based on historical earnings growth In the case of our second example  CSX Corp  we discover that we are only being asked to pay  11 90  current PE 11 9 see orange circle at right of graph  to buy  1 dollar s worth of CSX Corp  s current earnings  This is almost half the price we are being asked to pay to buy an equivalent  1 dollar s worth of Sherwin Williams Co  s earnings  Therefore  the rational investor should ask this simple question   Why should I be willing to pay almost twice as much to buy Sherwin Williams  earnings as I m being asked to buy CSX s earnings  The only logical answer would be because future earnings are expected to be much higher for Sherwin Williams Co  than for CSX Corp  But in fact  this is not true  and as we will next illustrate  the real answer doesn t make any mathematical sense Utilizing the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator we discover that the consensus  15 analysts reporting to Capital IQ  estimate earnings growth rate for Sherman Williams at a very strong 13 1   This calculates out that expected calendar year 2017 earnings of  10 64 will be approximately twice as large as 2011 s earnings of  4 95   Therefore  we are  in theory at least  only paying approximately  10 today to buy a future  1 dollar s worth of Sherwin Williams  2017 earnings   In other words  the PE ratio of the future earnings we are buying is approximately 10  or half of what we have to today pay for current earnings Once again  utilizing the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator we discover that the consensus  26 analysts reporting to Capital IQ  expect CSX Corp  to grow earnings at a very strong rate of 14   This calculates out that CSX Corp  s expected earnings in 2017 will also be approximately 2 times larger than today s earnings of  3 63 in 2017 versus the original  1 67 in 2011   To be clear  this means that the earnings growth rates in both of our sample companies are expected to be essentially the same or at least similar Most importantly  it also means that we are only paying a PE of 5 6 to buy CSX Corp  s  1 dollar s worth of future earnings  2017  versus paying a PE of 10 for Sherwin Williams   1 dollar s worth of future earnings  2017   As we ve previously established  if we received  1 dollar s worth of dividends from both companies  each would be able to buy no more or no less goods or services than the other   So once again we ask the question  why would we want to pay twice as much to buy  1 dollar s worth of Sherwin Williams  future earnings as we would to buy CSX Corp  s  Logically  it makes no sense  yet many investors do it every day In the two examples used in our analogy above  we identified two companies with somewhat similar historical growth rates  but more importantly with almost identical expectations for future growth   Consequently  logic should dictate that both companies should be priced at approximately the same valuations   The examples utilized  neither company has a real edge over the other company regarding earnings power  Therefore  why should the one  Sherwin Williams Corp   have an edge in market price over the other  CSX Corp   The straightforward answer  there is no rational reason It s also important to recognize that the market does not always price common stocks according to their fair value   In fact  at any moment in time  the market can be mispricing the value of common stocks by significant degrees   This is why the venerable Ben Graham gave us his famous metaphor   in the short run the market is a voting machine  but in the long run it s a weighing machine    This is the same lesson that Peter Lynch offered in the above referenced quote where he talks about value eventually winning out   Shrewd investors know how to calculate fair value  and therefore  are capable of avoiding what is often the obvious mistake of paying too much   On the other hand  shrewd investors also recognize a bargain when they see one Furthermore  it should also be understood that there are valid reasons to pay more for one company than for another   However  those reasons have to be mathematically sound and  therefore  make economic and prudent sense   For example  thanks to the power of compounding  a company with a very high growth rate of 20  to 30  or more would obviously be worth more than a company only growing at 10  or 15   The point is that the faster growing company would be capable of generating significantly more future earnings than the slower growing one   Therefore  even though you pay more today to buy the faster grower  you can actually be buying future earnings cheaper  again  thanks to the power of compounding Summary and ConclusionsThe moral of the story is simply that investors should be careful and willing to always run the numbers out to their logical conclusions  But  it all starts with knowing what you are buying  investing in  in the first place   True investors  like Peter Lynch  and many of the other renowned investing greats such as Phil Fischer  Warren Buffett  etc   all invest as owners in businesses with a focus on the strength of the business behind the stocks they buy  Therefore  these investor greats are always buying the earnings power of the respective businesses they are investing in  relative to their goals and objectives These principles of valuation apply equally to growth stocks as they do dividend stocks   When applied to growth stocks  investors need to understand that the more future earnings they can buy today at a good price  means more future earnings that the market can capitalize in the future   Since this is their only source of return  the more future earnings they can amass the more value or return they can expect   Fast growth does typically come at a higher price  but simultaneously it needs be understood that faster growth  if it occurs  also generates a bigger pile of future earnings   And  as this article has illustrated  it s the future earnings that ultimately drive fair value When applied to dividend paying stocks  the principle is just as valid  and maybe easier to see   Since the company is going to pay dividends  the dividend investor is going to receive some of the company s earnings in cash outside of the business   As I illustrated above  when they go to spend  1 dollar s worth of dividends from Company A versus  1 dollar s worth of dividends from Company B  each  1 dollar s worth of dividends will have the same value outside of the business   Therefore  it only logically follows that both of those dollars should have the same value while they are still in the business Importantly  a few words on the differences between investing and speculating are perhaps in order  Active traders will not find any value in this discussion  because active traders usually don t own a company long enough to think about earnings power at all   Active traders are only really interested in momentum and volatility   They are  the voting machine  segment of the market  This is a primary reason why stocks can become improperly or unrealistically valued by Mr  Market  the voter  however  there are others reasons that we will leave to future discussions  Additionally  to be a trader requires a continuous commitment to watching every little price tick of the market  which is beyond the interest of most people that are investing for their future economic benefit True investors are interested in building long term positions in great businesses bought at rational prices  It is to this segment of the financial community that this article is geared to   Frankly  we believe this is the largest segment of the market comprised of prudent investors that have other things to do with their time than watching the bouncing ball of often frivolous stock price movements   These true investors need to understand the principles of valuation presented in this article if they are going to achieve their financial goals while simultaneously doing so at reasonable levels of risk Based onthis discussion  of the two companies utilized as examples in this article  the principles of valuation would indicate that one is a buy and one is a sell  We believe that both of these companies are excellent candidates that when appropriately priced  valued  would make great additions to almost any long term investors portfolio   However  if the expected future growth rates are accurate  then Sherwin Williams is clearly overpriced  while CSX Corp  looks like a great bargain today   Of course  all prospective investors are encouraged to perform their own due diligence before taking any action Disclaimer  The opinions
