State and Local Tax Deductions  and Mortgage Interest

homes  Plus  you can generally deduct up to  100 000 in interest you pay on a home equity loan or line of credit 
What the House proposed 
No more state and local tax deductions  though you could continue to deduct up to  10 000 each year in property tax  For people buying in the future  which the bill defines as Nov  2  2017  or later   mortgage interest deductions would be allowed only on loans up to  500 000  Moreover  only debt from primary residences would count toward that limit  and you could not include any interest from home equity loans or lines of credit that you took out on that new home 
What the Senate proposed 
No more state and local tax deductions and no exception for property taxes  either  The mortgage interest deduction  however  would survive in its current form 
Student Loan Interest Deduction 
Whats in place now 
Currently  people with incomes below certain thresholds can deduct up to  2 500 of student loan interest each year
