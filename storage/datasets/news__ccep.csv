111354,332869,CCEP,As Fed tightening looms  big share repurchasers could be pressured,news,"By Rodrigo Campos
NEW YORK  Reuters    For the last several years  big U S  companies have lived by an unswerving rule  buy back shares to increase returns to shareholders 
Investors  too  have benefited from company spending habits as they bought shares of the biggest repurchasers 
This year has been a bit different  The buybacks have continued  but companies doing them have trailed the S P 500 stock index as investors anticipate higher interest rates 
Headed into 2016  with the Federal Reserve beginning what many expect will be a prolonged  if slow  cycle of interest rate increases  analysts say the quality of a company s balance sheet could matter as much as whether it is reducing the number of shares on issue 
The Fed is expected to raise interest rates at the end of its Dec  15 16 meeting for the first time in nearly a decade  While the increase in borrowing costs for big name companies will be minor  it could continue if the Fed raises rates further in 2016 
 A quarter of a percentage point is not going to make much of a difference   said to David Joy  chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  N AMP  in Boston  However  as the Fed keeps raising rates  those companies borrowing money to buy back their shares will likely be hurt most  he said 
With the Fed raising rates  those who borrow to buy shares could find it harder to justify their investments  This year  in part on the expectation of higher rates  the S P 500 buyback index has trailed the benchmark  SPX  by more than four percentage points 
That s a notable change  Companies that return excess cash to shareholders have been big favorites of investors in recent years  Despite this year s underperformance  the S P s buyback index has beaten the S P by about 24 percentage points since the beginning of 2010 
Buying back shares perks up stock prices in two ways  it increases the demand for a specific stock  setting a floor under its price  while at the same time reducing the number of shares in circulation  thus increasing the dollar value of earnings per share 
A Reuters analysis shows that spending on buybacks has surged relative to investment  in part due to shareholder pressure and executive compensation programs that tie pay to per share results 
Higher interest rates  of course  make borrowing to repurchase stock more expensive 
Companies that could be affected include CBS Corp  N CBS   Coca Cola Enterprises  N CCE    Xerox Corp   N XRX   Verisign  Time Warner and General Motors  N GM   The group is part of a basket created by Goldman Sachs  N GS  to track performance of companies with weaker balance sheets as measured by factors such as their leverage ratio and sales to assets ratio 
These companies are also notable for buying back plenty of stock  and the leverage and stock buybacks have made them steady winners during the long bull market that featured near zero interest rates 
The six companies  however  have been a mixed bag in 2015  Verisign is a notable outperformer  up more than 60 percent  while GM shares are up just 1 6 percent and Time Warner has lost nearly 20 percent 
Goldman expects companies of this type are likely to underperform in 2016 as financial conditions tighten 
This is not to say buybacks are going to end  Buybacks from S P 500 companies hit nearly  560 billion on a four quarter rolling basis  according to S P Dow Jones indices data 
That is the highest since the first quarter of 2008  and near the record of  589 billion for the four quarters of 2007  Goldman expects more than  600 billion in 2016 as companies struggle to deliver per share earnings growth 
 Credit Suisse   VX CSGN  noted a number of companies that engage in a high level of buybacks also show declining returns on investment  They include widely held stocks like Anthem Inc  N ANTM   up 4 percent year to date  L 3 Communications  N LLL   down 1 6 percent in 2015 and Yahoo  O YHOO   down more than 30 percent 
 When you reach a point in the market when valuations are reaching new peaks  there s uncertainty about how much longer these companies can buy back shares  and quality becomes more of a factor   said Ron Graziano  accounting and tax strategist at Credit Suisse s HOLT group in Chicago 
 That s when we expect some of these companies would come under some pressure  ",2015-12-10,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/as-fed-tightening-looms,-big-share-repurchasers-could-be-pressured-375356",375356

111376,332891,CCEP,ICO Analysis From Tokenbox ,opinion,"1  Centrifuge  Germany  
Centrifuge is an OS for the financial industry  The idea behind   the project is to manage interaction between 1  decentralized financial applications used for organizing logistics 2  document flow and 3  accounting tools for structures on the blockchain  Such a solution significantly reduces costs and creates a very convenient and functional environment for businesses 
Centrifuge is a system that consists of special components that provide convenient functionality of daily business operations and significantly reduces costs  Let us examine the technical part of the project 
At the moment  the platform intends to use the Ethereum network and its smart contracts  Centrifuge Nodes will be responsible for the efficiency and correct functioning of the network  The sidechains needed to ensure the operation of individual dApps will work using the POA algorithm  Private document management within the Centrifuge OS is based on a protocol that provides P2P transfers of private documents 
Any submitted document is registered at the level of the operating system as an NFT token   that is  it carries information not only about the value and the owner but also additional data  Thanks to usage of NFT tokens featuring the ERC 721 standard  the workflow becomes more secure and personalized 
The token standard is a very important aspect in terms of managing this kind of OS  The network uses 2 native tokens   Medallion and Cent  Medallion is used to vote online  as well as being a reputation indicator in order to be able to validate the network  Cent is used to pay for services  as well as to express gratitude to network participants  but not to pay for goods 
Custody service
The OS plans on using stable currencies for settlements  In addition  users need to keep a certain number of Cent tokens to be able to use the services of the OS  In order to effect faster settlements between users and provide them with the functionality of being able to purchase tokens quickly  Centrifuge provides this solution for quick purchase  in fiat  and secure storage of tokens 
Tokenometrics of the project  TBA 
It is important to note that Taulia  the parent company of the Centrifuge project  was established in 2009 and has been doing developing and programming work for banking institutions and is working to optimize bank transfers  Taulia has developed a unique dynamic discounting program  according to which fast payments by a customer are followed by dynamic discounts from suppliers of the goods 
There are plenty of positive things about the head company  They already have experience in dealing with organization of financial transactions and a large list of very reputable partners and customers  PayPal  IBM  NYSE IBM   Bell  Coca Cola Enterprises  NYSE CCE   Northgate  KPMG  
Taulia is trading on the NYSE  which means that the team knows how to organize successful trades and listings 
The team directly behind Centrifuge  however  boasts an impressive history of solving problems of supply management in the real sector  The three founders of the project   Maex Ament  Martin Quensel and Philip Stehlik   created and successfully developed several companies  including Taulia  This company deals with more than 1 5 million suppliers from 164 countries and has already provided more than   100 billion in liquidity and payment solutions for small and medium sized enterprises 
Partners of the project 
1  USD Coin is a new stable coin from Circle  for which 110 million dollars have already been gathered  One of the main investors is Bitmain  alongside whom Breyer Capital  Tusk Ventures  IDG Capital  Pantera  and Blockchain Capital have also invested 
2  Crossinx is a leading German software provider that supports more than 150 000 companies in digitizing financial processes 
3  Hokodo is a technological company that seeks to provide financing and insurance for small and medium enterprises 
The summary of the project from Tokenbox analysts  the project features a good team  a great idea  a base  an already existing reputable company with powerful clients like Fortune 500   and strong partnerships  Of the minuses  the project is at its early stage  and there isn t enough information on tokenometrics 
The preliminary assessment of the project from Tokenbox is 7 5   10 ",2018-10-25,Viktor Shpakovsky,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ico-analysis-from-tokenbox-200350594,200350594

Review  Is Technical Damage Driving The Market 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Is technical damage driving this market  We noted that the S P 500 had broken critical technical support levels  and it sank further below its closely watched 50 day and 200 day moving averages  and it hit a new low for 2018  However  we encouraged traders to remember that markets are driven by both technicals  often in the shorter term  and economic and fundamental factors in the longer term  Further  keeping technicals  fundamentals and economics in mind  traders should be sure to follow a strategy that is consistent with their personal needs and goals 
This Week  Are You Staying Sane In This Crazy Market 
The Dow Jones just posted its biggest one day point gain in history  on the day after Christmas  a day that is supposed to be relatively quiet 

Yet despite Wednesday s face ripper  the market is still down significantly for the quarter and the year  as shown in the chart above 
While we discussed last week that  technical damage  could be driving the market lower  there are obviously other things going on  such as tariffs and the fed  And according to this recent article  UBS economist Rob Martin believes 

 right now  at least   tariffs and the Fed are the two biggest obstacles to the market  

And per that same article  Data Trek Research co founder Nick Colas thinks 

 although a certain level of uncertainty won t kill a bull market  there are too many loose ends to tie up at once right now  and that could delay a rally in the beginning of the new year  

But perhaps a bigger question regarding the current crazy market is  Are you staying sane  When markets sell off in volatile fashion  traders need to keep their emotions in check  According to Brett Steenbarger  investors may want to heed The Psychology of Trading a Crazy Market  Specifically  Steenbarger writes 

 An important priority in trading crazy markets is doubling down on our own sanity  That means mentally and emotionally rehearsing being wrong on trades so that we are prepared to take the right actions if the stuff hits the fan  

Also worth a listen  Steenbarger recently participated in a podcast with J C  Parets of All Star Trading  where they discuss 

 how the volatility of markets can induce our own emotional and behavioral volatility  

The podcast is worth a listen 
Exiting Trading Positions 
Regarding our own trading models  we have a variety of risk management signals and procedures  For example  when near term market conditions are not favorable  we will exit all of our open trading positions  And in fact  based on the signal from our models  we have exited from all of our trading positions in the Athena  Felix and Road Runner models 
Just to reiterate  this step is a risk control measure rather than a prediction of the market going down  These models will be getting back to the market when conditions are better  Also worth noting  our Holmes trading model is not affected since it has an independent set of requirements and stops  Holmes can take care of itself  
Model Performance 
We are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models  as our readers have requested  as shown in the following table 

We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns

Expert Picks From The Models 
Note  This week s Stock Exchange is edited by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 
Holmes  I purchased Coca Cola European Partners PLC  NYSE CCEP  on Wednesday  on a price dip  How do you feel about that 

Blue Harbinger  What  American Coke is not good enough for you Holmes  Just kidding  I know CCEP distributes the same Coca Cola  Diet Coke  Coke Zero  and many others  in Europe  But why did you buy 
Holmes  I am a dip buyer  My typical holding period is six weeks  For risk management  I use price targets  stops and I monitor macro conditions  And unlike the other traders  I did not exit my positions  I am a contrarian through and through 
BH  Interesting pick  Coca Cola is one of those steady eddy blue chip dividend payers that all the aggressive growth guys hate  But these low beta shares have performed very well this year  especially this quarter as just about everything else has sold off relatively hard  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Holmes  Thanks for that information  but to remind you  I typically hold for about 6 weeks only  Your long term fundamental metrics are less important to meet 
BH  Suit yourself  Holmes  And how about you Felix  and trades to share this week 
Felix  I just excited all my open positions as a precautionary risk management move  Market conditions have gotten crazy  I will wait for things to settle down again before my next trade  However  I did run the Nasdaq 100 through my model  and my top 20 rankings are listed below 

BH  Thanks for that info  and I appreciate rankings  but remind us what is your trading style 
Felix  I am a momentum trader  I typically hold for around 66 weeks  I use stops and pay attention to macro conditions for risk management reasons  And as you know  I just exited all my trades because near term conditions have gotten a bit unhealthy  Again  not a bet on market direction just risk management 
BH  Okay  Thank you for that  And how about you Oscar  As our resident ETF trader  do you have anything to share 
Oscar  Yes  This week I ran our Comprehensive and Diverse ETF universe through my model  and the top 20 are ranked in the following list 

BH  Interesting  And remind us  what is your trading strategy 
Oscar  I am into momentum  I typically hold for 6 weeks  and then I usually rotate into a new sector or style ETF 
BH  Thanks  Oscar  I d ask Athena and Road Runner if they have any trades to share  but I already know what they are  Like Felix  they just exited all of their open trades because near term trading conditions are not healthy for their technical models  Which is fine  because I know they ll be back when conditions settle down it s all part of their process 
Conclusion 
When market conditions get wild  it becomes more important than ever to stay psychologically level headed  don t let your emotions drive you to make bad trades  Our trading process leads us to close open trading positions when near term conditions become unhealthy  And that is exactly what several of our trading models just did  Felix  Road Runner and Athena just exited all of their open positions  not because they re betting on market direction  but rather for risk management purposes  They will re enter when market conditions settle down and become more conducive for their specific trading styles

111382,332897,CCEP, Buffett Says He Abstained From Voting On Coca Cola s Compensation Plan,news,"By     Reuters    Warren Buffett  chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway  BRKa N   said on Wednesday he thinks Coca Cola s controversial equity compensation plan was excessive  but that Berkshire Hathaway abstained in the shareholders vote 
Earlier on Wednesday  Coca Cola  NYSE CCE  said 83 percent of shareholders approved the plan  Critics  most notably activist investor David Winters  said the plan would dilute the holdings of current shareholders too much 
As of December 31  Berkshire owned 400 million shares of the company  just over 9 percent of the shares outstanding 
Buffett  in an interview with CNBC  said he and partner Charlie Munger did not want to vote against the plan because he did not want to show disapproval of management  He said he has enormous respect for Coca Cola s chief executive  Muhtar Kent 
 I love Coke  I love the management  I love the directors  so I didn t want to vote  No    Buffett said   It s kind of un American to vote  No  at a Coke meeting  I didn t want to express any disapproval of management but we did disapprove of the plan  The plan compared to past plans was a significant change  
Buffett said he has no intention of selling any Coca Cola shares 

He said activist investors are getting stronger 
 The CEOs are terrified of activists  I can tell you that   Buffett said   They are all talking to investment bankers and lawyers and saying   What do we do about this   
He denied he had  soured  on his enormous investment in IBM  IBM N   and said Berkshire bought some more shares this year  although the purchases did not come after IBM s most recent earnings report  He said he would not  rule out  future IBM stocks buys

111384,332899,CCEP,Warren Buffett Speaks Of Stock Options For Next Berkshire CEO,news,"By     Reuters    The next chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway  BRKa  should be the only one at the company to get options  Warren Buffett  the current head of the sprawling conglomerate  said on Monday 
In an interview with Fortune  Buffett said he had written a memo to the Berkshire board to suggest the next CEO should be  the only one who would receive options because he would be the only one who is responsible for the overall success of the operation  
Buffett  an investing icon and the world s third richest man  came under fire last week when he said that he disagreed with a controversial equity compensation package for Coca Cola  NYSE CCE  management but nonetheless abstained from voting 
He told CNBC last week that he  didn t want to express any disapproval of management but we did disapprove of the plan  
He s since drawn broad criticism for not voting against the measure  which passed 
Buffett in the past has spoken out about stock options for executives as expensive and ineffective 

In 1995  for example  Buffett wrote   Who  after all  refuses a free lottery ticket   and called such arrangements  wasteful to the company  
Still  Buffett said on Monday that executive compensation is not out of whack with pay rates in the rest of the country 
 If you run a multibillion dollar company the difference between a 10 and an eight is huge in terms of value   he said 
 Still  almost on a voluntary basis  I think it should be somewhat restrained in some cases  
He offered no more details on who the next Berkshire Hathaway CEO could be  a source of widespread speculation as investors wonder how much longer the octogenarian can continue in his current role 
Buffett  83 and Charlie Munger  90  the chairman and vice chairman  respectively  of Berkshire Hathaway  have each drawn a salary of  100 000 each for more than 25 years 
In a securities filing this year  the company noted that  Mr  Buffett has advised the  Governance  Committee that he would not expect or desire such compensation to increase in the future

111396,332911,CCEP,Is Coca Cola European Partners  CCE  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Coca Cola European Partners Plc   NYSE CCE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Coca Cola European Partners has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 22 7  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Coca Cola European Partners  current PE ratio on par with its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Coca Cola European Partners has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Coca Cola European Partners has a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 6 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Coca Cola European Partners currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Coca Cola European Partners a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Coca Cola European Partners is just 1 8  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 13 3  which is far better than the industry average of 17 1  Clearly  CCE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Coca Cola European Partners might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B  This gives CCE a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been showing a bullish trend  The current year has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has also seen two up and none down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 2 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Coca Cola European Partners PLC Price and Consensus   Despite this bullish trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCoca Cola European Partners is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 33  out of more than 250 industries  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the six months  its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest

111418,332933,CCEP,3 Reasons Momentum Stock Investors Will Love Coca Cola European Partners  CCE ,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Coca Cola European Partners plc   NYSE CCE   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CCE s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for Coca Cola European PartnersA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 2 5  compared to an industry average of 1 2   CCE is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for Coca Cola European PartnersWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of CCE  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 7 4  to  0 9  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 16   Clearly  CCE is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors   Coca Cola European Partners PLC Price   CCE Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with CCE as of late too Over the past month  two earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that four estimates have moved upward with no downward revision for the next year time frame too  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as a month ago CCE was expected to post earnings of  2 35 cents per share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  2 50 for the full year  representing an increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have CCE as a security with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep CCE on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the best ones to buy can be tough  There s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector  Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without  More importantly  it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices  I encourage you to get the report now   before the next wave of innovations really take off ,2017-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-cocacola-european-partners-cce-200208186,200208186
111423,332938,CCEP,Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Q2 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   is slated to release second quarter fiscal 2016 results on Sep 21  Last quarter  the company had delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings Beat
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bed Bath   Beyond is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen 
Bed Bath   Beyond has an Earnings ESP of  1 71   as the Most Accurate estimate stands at  1 15  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at  1 17  While the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  yet we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise   
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Sluggish mall traffic and high promotional costs may impact the company s results in the second quarter also  Further  due to its exposure to global markets  the company faces various risks associated with international operations  including currency fluctuations  Hence  persistence of the currency headwinds remains a threat 
Management remains hopeful about driving future growth on the back of its strategic investments and omnichannel progress  Following the soft quarter and in view of the current trends  management anticipates fiscal 2016 earnings per share in the range of  4 50 to a little over  5 00  The estimate also includes the expected impact from the company s recent acquisition of One Kings Lane 
However  Bed Bath   Beyond now projects comps growth for fiscal 2016 in the range of flat to a 1  increase  compared with a 1  2  rise projected previously  Further  the company witnessed a rise in selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses in the first quarter due to higher advertising and technology related expenses  Management expects all these factors to linger in the future and therefore  anticipates gross margin and SG A expense deleverage in fiscal 2016  We expect the pressurized margins and higher expenses to dent the company s bottom line performance BED BATH BEYOND Price and EPS Surprise

111459,332974,CCEP,Altria  MO   A Beat in Store This Earnings Season ,opinion,"We expect leading tobacco maker Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO   to beat expectations when it reports first quarter 2016 results before the market opens on Apr 28 
Last quarter  the company posted a negative surprise of 1 47   Altria reported positive surprises in two of the last four quarters  reaching the average to a positive surprise of 0 40  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 

Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Altria is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  1 47   A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise Zacks Rank  Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
Altria s Zacks Rank  2 and positive ESP make us confident of an earnings beat in the first quarter of 2016 
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Strong pricing and high volumes boosted Altria s revenues in fiscal 2015  The company expects the trend to continue in the first quarter of 2016 as well 
The company is presently focusing on boosting growth at its e cigarette category and less harmful alternative tobacco products  which is in line with changing consumer preferences  The extended agreement with Philip Morris International  Inc    NYSE PM   regarding technology sharing and distribution of e vapor products is also commendable 
In fiscal 2015  the Marlboro owner stepped up innovation and expanded the distribution of MarkTen XL e vapor products and Green Smoke e cigarettes in several lead markets which should drive sales in the to be reported quarter  Further  in Nov 2015  PM USA expanded the distribution of Marlboro Midnight Menthol nationally  offering adult smokers a bold menthol flavor  It was received well in the market and is expected to boost the top line in the to be reported quarter 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other stocks that investors may also want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

111494,333009,CCEP,The Unbridled Truth About Dividends And Shareholder Profitability,opinion,The Two Components of Total ReturnThere have been many recent published articles and discussions that indicate that dividends have become the Rodney Dangerfield of the investing world  In short  dividends get no respect  as many believe that dividends do not add to a shareholder s profitability  We believe that dividends represent a return bonus  This article is written to provide evidence of our thesis  The following is the definition of total return according to investopedia When measuring performance  the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of investments over a given evaluation period  Total return includes interest  capital gains  dividends and distributions realized over a given period of time  With the above definition in mind  perhaps the best place to start is by examining the two primary components of total return in order to put everything in perspective  But before we go on  we are utilizing the phrase  total return  as synonymous to the word  profitability   In other words  an investor s profitability logically must be measured as the total return they receive on their investment  Total return is a function of two primary components  capital appreciation and income  Of course  investments that do not generate an income stream  dividends  interest or distributions  will only possess the capital appreciation component Capital appreciation  or depreciation  is simply the difference between the price you originally paid for an investment  and the price it currently can be sold at  More simply stated  it is the increase in the price or value of your asset  Since our focus with this article is on publicly traded common stocks  the capital appreciation component represents the difference between the price you paid and the price the stock currently trades at  For non dividend paying common stocks  this will be the sole source of your total return  Capital gains are synonymous with capital appreciation The second component of total return is the income component  As stated in the definition  this will include interest  dividends or distributions  Since we are focusing on dividend paying stocks  we will be analyzing dividends as our income component  At this point  we should focus the reader to the fact that by the very definition of total return  the income component represents a return in addition to the capital gain or appreciation component  Therefore  and again by definition  the dividend represents an additional return above and beyond the capital gains  This alone adds credence to the notion that dividends represent a return bonus as we had postulated in our previous article Real world Evidence Validating the Dividend BonusWe will utilize the F A S T  Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool  as a vehicle for providing clear  and we feel undeniable evidence  that dividends augment total return  In order for us to accomplish this objective  it is imperative that the reader clearly understands what the F A S T  Graphs  are depicting  Therefore  with our first example  Acenture  ACN   we will build the earnings and price correlated graph one element at a time Accenture  ACN   Annualized Earnings Growth Rate 17 3   Capital Appreciation 14 4 Accenture is a global management consulting  technology services and outsourcing company  The orange line on the first graph plots Acenture s fiscal operating earnings per share since 2003  and represents the calculated intrinsic value of the company  The green shaded area represents the total cumulative earnings that the company has generated  The important fact for the reader to note with this graph is that earnings have steadily increased at a very high rate  with the exception of the modest flattening during the great recession  As we will show next  these earnings are what the market will capitalize in order to generate and calculate capital appreciation for Acenture since 2003 With our next graph we add the element of monthly closing stock prices overlaid and correlated to the orange earnings justified valuation line  Since we are often accused of cherry picking  the reader should note that this example  and all the other examples utilized in this article  were hand selected based on valuation  In other words  in order to eliminate any market mispricings or anomalies  we are only reviewing companies where the beginning price and ending price is at or near fair value based on the black price line touching the orange valuation line When looked at in this manner  the source of capital appreciation is vividly depicted without any market inefficiencies or bias  Therefore  the reader can see that it is the earnings of the company that drive stock prices over the long run  Moreover  the reader can also see that the entire complement of earnings are what the market is tracking  There is no adjustment being made for dividends paid  which we will look at later  Once again  this capital appreciation component  capital gains  is not affected or adjusted by dividends in either direction  Furthermore  it is clear that market forces will drive prices above the justified earnings line and below it from time to time  but inevitably price always moves back into alignment with earnings  The capital appreciation component for Acenture shows that a  1000 investment on 12 31 2002 is now worth  3790 13  This is a function of the share price rising from  17 99 to the closing price on 11 23 2012 of  68 18  At this point  there is no dividend income included in the calculation  just pure capital appreciation based on earnings growth With our next graphic  we now bring dividends  the light blue shaded area  into the equation  Notice that we stack the dividends on top of the earnings line even though they are paid out of the green shaded area  This article  and the previous article that we authored and linked to  provide an insight and justification for why we present the graphs in this manner  It should be clear by examining the graphic that all of the company s earnings are being capitalized in order to create the capital appreciation component It should also be clear that the dividend paid represents an additional component to total return  By having the light blue shaded area stacked on top  this reality becomes visibly apparent  Furthermore  dividends do represent a return in addition to capital appreciation thereby making an important contribution to shareholders  total returns  profitability   The green and light blue lines with dots at the end are color coded showing the portion of earnings paid out as dividends  The green line represents earnings  the light blue represents dividends We can now see the total return performance for Acenture  while simultaneously examining each of the total return components  capital appreciation and dividend income  Moreover  we can review each of these components independently and then collectively  As we previously reported  Acenture shareholders enjoyed a 14 4  annual capital appreciation  However  in addition to capital appreciation that closely mirrored the company s earnings growth  shareholders received an additional  274 91 of cumulative total dividend income  dividends paid out and not re invested  which increased their total annual return from 14 4  to 15 2  per annum  The most important point here is that the capital appreciation component would have been the same whether or not Acenture paid their shareholders a dividend  Moreover  the dividend added almost a full percentage point of annual return to their results  Dividends  are clearly a bonus  or a return in addition to the capital appreciation component Additional EvidenceThe following earnings and price correlated graphs with dividends are offered to provide additional evidence clearly revealing the undeniable fact that dividends are a return enhancement  In order to illustrate this as plainly as possible  we will present three categories of companies ranging from low growth  moderate growth  and finally fast growth  Then  for an even greater perspective we will review a company that paid a very large special one time extra dividend As we did with the Acenture example  we will only utilize time frames where beginning and ending valuation are in alignment with the orange earnings justified valuation line  Therefore  the reader can vividly see that the company s earnings growth rate drives its capital appreciation component  and that its income component  the dividend  provides an additional return But perhaps most importantly  it will be clear that the dividend does not diminish the value of the company  The true worth of the company is a function of its record of earnings growth as long as fair value is in alignment both at the beginning and at the end of the period  In other words  market mispricing biases are excluded from the presentation Here are the key things to focus on as you review the following earnings and price correlated graphs plus dividends examples  First of all  notice how the black price line tracks and correlates with the orange earnings justified valuation line  Then  notice that dividends do not diminish or reduce the orange line  earnings   The companies earnings  the orange line  are capitalized by the market assigning the appropriate P E ratio based on the company s earnings growth  The P E formula is price divided by earnings  P E   and not price divided by earnings minus dividends  Finally  by stacking them on top  notice that the light blue shaded area representing dividends paid out of earnings  the green shaded area  are vividly depicted as return in addition to capital appreciation When reviewing the associated performance graphs for each sample company  notice how the company s capital appreciation component will correlate very closely with the company s earnings growth rate  This clearly validates the fact that earnings  all earnings  drive the stock price  Moreover  recognize that the company s full complement  total earnings  of earnings are capitalized generating the capital appreciation component  Then  notice how the income component  or the dividends  provide the additional return which augments and enhances the capital appreciation component Low Growth ExamplesVectren Corp   VVC   Annualized Earnings Growth Rate 1 9   Capital Appreciation 1 6 Vectren Corporation is an energy holding company headquartered in Evansville  Indiana  Since our low growth examples  5  earnings growth or less  generate low capital appreciation because earnings growth is so low  the importance of dividends is vividly revealed  As a reminder  notice that the full compliment of earnings  the orange line  are capitalized by the market  This is especially illuminating when you consider the high payout ratios which are common with low growth companies  In other words  even though these companies pay out very significant portions of their earnings  the capital appreciation component is still based on the company s total earnings reported WGL Holdings  Inc    WGL   Annualized Earnings Growth Rate 2 7   Capital Appreciation 2 4 Washington Gas distributes natural gas to customers in the District of Columbia  Maryland and Virginia  Moderate Growth ExamplesThe following moderate growth examples  8  to 12  earnings growth  generate capital appreciation that is highly correlated to the company s earnings growth rate  Once again  all earnings are capitalized  and the dividend generates a return in addition to capital gains  The reader might also notice that the big differences here are lower payout ratios and a greater contribution to total return from capital gains rather than dividends  Nevertheless  the thesis that dividends provide a bonus return is clear Baxter International  Inc    BAX   Annualized Earnings Growth Rate 9 9   Capital Appreciation 9 6 Baxter International Inc   through its subsidiaries  develops  manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the lives of people with hemophilia  immune disorders  infectious diseases  kidney disease  trauma  and other chronic and acute medical conditions Brinker International  Inc    EAT   Annualized Earnings Growth Rate 9 8   Capital Appreciation 8 1 Brinker International  Inc  is one of the world s leading casual dining restaurant companies  With more than 1 500 restaurants and over 100 000 team members in 32 countries and two territories  Brinker and its brands welcome more than one million guests into our restaurants every day The Brinker International Inc   EAT  example below offers additional insight into the contribution of dividends to total return  because the company did not start paying dividends until 2006  Therefore  we can see the capital appreciation component was there even when the company was not paying dividends  Moreover  we can see that dividends added a bonus return above capital appreciation after they were started Importantly  there are additional insights regarding the value of dividends that the Brinker International Inc  example provides us  From the dividend cash flow table on the performance report you will see that Brinker International Inc  was able to continue increasing their dividend each year even though earnings per share and stock price were falling  Although the above earnings and price correlated graph with dividends provides the illusion that dividends are dropping because they are stacked on top of the falling earnings line  the orange line   a review of the performance table shows that the payout ratio increased because of the decreasing earnings  but that the actual dividends themselves were increased each year The following graphs look at the time frame calendar years 2005 to 2010  We offer this graph to illustrate that during a period of falling earnings and stock prices  the rising dividend income component provided shareholders a buffer  Thanks to the dividend income  shareholders almost broke even  therefore  the value of dividends during difficult times are also highlighted Fast Growth ExamplesThe following fast growth examples  greater than 15  earnings growth  provide compelling evidence that earnings growth generates capital appreciation  regardless of whether dividends are paid or not  On the other hand  by examining the long term performance of these companies we can clearly see that the dividends do provide a return kicker Raven Industries  Inc    RAVN  Annualized Earnings Growth Rate 19 9   Capital Appreciation 23 1 Since 1956  Raven Industries has designed and manufactured high quality  high value technical products Ross Stores  Inc    ROST  Annualized Earnings Growth Rate 18 9   Capital Appreciation 19 5 Ross Stores  Inc  is an S P 500  Fortune 500 and Nasdaq 100  ROST  company headquartered in Pleasanton  California  The Company operates Ross Dress for Less    Ross    the largest off price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States with 1 097 locations in 33 states  the District of Columbia and Guam Special Dividend ExampleCoca Cola Enterprises Inc    CCE Coca Cola Enterprises is one of the world s largest Coca Cola bottlers operating locally in eight territories in Western Europe Our final example reviews Coca Cola Enterprises Inc   CCE  because the company declared a large  10 special dividend in October of 2010  With this example  it is clear that the ex dividend date did cause a huge temporary drop in the company s price due to its magnitude  see red circle   However  we also see that the company s earnings were not decreased and that the company s stock price eventually moved back into alignment with its earnings  This picture provides a stark and vivid depiction that dividends ultimately provide a return bonus The following graph courtesy of Google Finance shows that the ex dividend adjustment  even a very large one like a  10 special dividend that Coca Cola Enterprises paid out  can have less of an impact on stock price than normal price volatility does  It is clear that there is an adjustment  but it should also be clear that normal trading activity soon renders the adjustment moot The following earnings and price correlated plus dividends shorter graph on Coca Cola Enterprises dramatically illustrates the dividend bonus concept we are writing about  With this graph  we see capital appreciation generated by earnings  we see the ex dividend adjustment  as large as it was  soon mitigated  and we see an in our face picture of the dividend bonus When reviewing the performance of Coca Cola Enterprises since calendar year 2010  the year they declared a special  10 dividend  we are provided undeniable evidence that dividends provide a bonus return  From the graph above you will notice that initially there was the ex dividend effect  however  the stock price moves steadily back into alignment with earnings even after such a large ex dividend adjustment But most importantly  the performance report shows that the capital appreciation component correlated to  actually exceeded  the company s total earnings growth  But even more importantly still  we see that this huge special one time dividend essentially doubled the company s total return during this time frame  Clearly  we see that the special dividend was indeed a bonus to shareholders Summary and Conclusions Directly stated  dividends are one of the two major components of total return  and they provide an enhancement of return to shareholders that own them  Even more simply stated  two companies that generate identical historical earnings growth rates will tend to generate similar to identical capital appreciation components assuming valuation alignment  However  if one of these two companies pays a dividend while the other does not  the dividend payer will provide total returns in excess of what the non dividend payer provides to its shareholders  Not only is this common sense  we believe we provided ample evidence within this article to clearly illustrate the veracity of the above statements  Nevertheless  as compelling as the evidence we provided is  we could have provided hundreds and even thousands of additional examples  But that would simply have been overkill  However  the only way that the evidence will resonate is if the reader studies and analyzes the graphs in order to clearly understand what they depict  If they do  they will find that they support the hypothesis and the thesis of this article and our previous article    Furthermore  whether a company can grow faster or not if they retain their earnings and reinvest them in their company instead of paying a dividend  is not a relevant issue  Some companies need to reinvest more than other companies in order to grow  However  if they don t need to invest all of their earnings  then paying them out as a  bonus  to shareholders is a proper use of those earnings  And  if the potential growth rate of the company is slowing  and cannot be accelerated by throwing more money at the company  a dividend component can provide additional shareholder compensation to augment the company s lower capital appreciation potential When all is said and done  dividends are a very important part of the total return potential of any given company  Very fast growing companies may need to retain their earnings in order to fund their continued growth  These companies often provide a high enough total return to reward shareholders even though they don t pay a dividend  On the other hand  if the company s growth rate slows  paying their shareholders a cash dividend is a great way to reward them  This is especially true for those shareholders who are in retirement or approaching retirement and looking for spendable income  Dividends clearly pay a large and important role regarding their shareholders  profitability  and to state otherwise is simply balderdash Disclosure  Long ACN and ROST at the time of writing  Disclaimer  The

We have shown frustrating and indecisive charts in recent articles  We could produce additional examples from numerous corners of the market  including the chart of the small cap ETF  iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM   below  If investors had strong convictions about a brighter economic future  we would expect small caps to be performing well  rather than treading water for six months 

Indecisive markets are frustrating animals  If we remain patient and disciplined  the market will tip its hand  For now  a mix of stocks  bonds  and cash offers an appropriate balance between risk and reward  We questioned the sustainability of the bullish advance in stocks on April 4 with the S P trading at 1 865  We remain concerned with the S P trading at 1 827 ",2014-04-15,Chris Ciovacco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-range-vs.-correction:-most-plausible-scenarios-209727,209727

The Markets
Stocks ended higher after a volatile trading session as investors received better than expected results from Coca Cola Enterprises Inc  NYSE CCE  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   the two blue chip companies ended higher by 3 74  and 2 12   respectively  accounting for almost a quarter of the gain in the Dow Jones Industrials Average    Coca Cola continues to rebound from double bottom support around  36  while Johnson   Johnson continues to chart new all time closing highs  both stocks have outperformed the market since the beginning of March and the direction of the major moving averages  20 and 50 day  continue to point higher  implying positive short and intermediate term trends    Seasonal tendencies for Coca Cola remain positive through to the end of June  while seasonal tendencies for Johnson   Johnson remain positive through to November 




Stocks had swung between gains and losses during Tuesday s session  eventually amounting a rally within the afternoon trade to record firm gains on the day    The Nasdaq broke below support once again at 4000 and also broke below the February low at 3968 19 before bouncing off of the rising 200 day moving average  escaping the strong selling pressures during the midday trade  support on a closing basis remains intact at 4000    After a substantial move lower since the beginning of March  momentum indicators for the tech heavy benchmark are showing signs of exhaustion  hovering around oversold levels  downside pressures may be waning   As mentioned in yesterday s report  the Nasdaq is concluding a period of seasonal weakness  which runs from the end of January through to mid April    The benchmark typically attempts to find a low around this time of year  just as earnings from key tech companies are reported    The present seasonal and technical parameters continue to give the benchmark a good chance of bouncing following the almost 10  decline  from peak to trough  over the past month and a half    Resistance remains apparent at a declining 20 day moving average    A rebound in momentum stocks  as gauged by the Momentum ETF  MTUM   helped the Nasdaq recover during the afternoon trade  MTUM is also finding support at a rising 200 day moving average 



One thing that continues to be a threat to the equity market over the intermediate term is the US Dollar    The US Dollar index is once again bouncing from significant support at 79  suggesting a floor to the currency benchmark that has remained intact since 2012    The implication is that the US Dollar index has nowhere to go but higher  a trend that has a good potential to negatively impact the equity market in the US    Over the last nine months  the currency benchmark has been trading within a pattern that resembles a descending triangle  which is typically a continuation pattern should support be broken  resistance is immediately overhead around 80 50    The imminent breakout from the pattern  either higher or lower  will determine the direction over the intermediate term    Seasonal tendencies for the US Dollar Index are typically negative through the summer months 


Seasonal charts of companies reporting earnings today 





















Sentiment on Tuesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 93    The 14 day average true range of the ratio continues to hold around the highest levels in over a year after bouncing from the lowest level since 2000  this abrupt shift from complacency to volatility is typically a negative for stocks

111501,333016,CCEP,Why This Market Makes Absolutely No Sense,opinion,"The concept of corporate earnings being the single biggest factor that drives key stock indices like the S P 500 higher has been thrown out the window 
While I continue to see analysts issue buy recommendations for the S P 500  the fact of the matter is that profits at companies that make up the S P 500 are declining  For the first quarter of 2014  corporate earnings for the S P 500 companies are actually expected to decline by 1 6    Source  FactSet  April 11  2014   That s the biggest drop in public company profits since 2009 
But the stock market doesn t care if corporate earnings are declining just like it doesn t care if interest rates are rising  These are clear signs the market is acting irrationally an indicator of a stock market bubble 
Just look at what happened with The Coca Cola Enterprises Inc  NYSE CCE  Company   This well known S P 500 company reported that its first quarter 2014 corporate earnings declined by eight percent and revenues dropped four percent compared to the same period one year early   Source  The Coca Cola Company web site  last accessed April 15  2014  
But the market took Coca Cola s stock price higher on the bad results 
Below is the chart of Coca Cola s stock price  just as the markets opened  circled area  after the company reported its poor corporate earnings results  The stock gapped up 2 8   This confirms my take that the fundamentals don t count anymore to investors 

Chart courtesy of 
At the end of the day  all of this seems too familiar to us  This is what we have seen prior to other stock market sell offs  investors discounting all forms of time proven stock market valuations because they believe stock prices will keep rising no matter what 
I see the upside for key stock indices like the S P 500 as being very limited and the probability of a massive downside move is very likely ",2014-04-25,Michael Lombardi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-this-market-makes-absolutely-no-sense-210764,210764
111505,333020,CCEP,Luck  Skill And Concentrated Portfolios,opinion,"Thanks to yesterday s annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway Inc  BRKa   it s the high season once again for admiring Warren Buffett s stellar investing record  The praise is certainly justified  The company s stock has risen by roughly 20  a year over nearly five decades  convincingly outperforming the US stock market by a wide margin  As The Economist notes   someone who invested  1000 at the outset would now have more than  10m  compared to around  100 000 if they had invested the same amount of money in the S P 500   Buffett s investing record is widely attributed to skill  and there s enough evidence to back up the claim  But as an intellectual exercise  it s interesting to consider the influence of dumb luck  if any  Although Berkhire s success is linked to factors behind picking stocks  quite a lot of the praise over the years is bound up with his track record in buying shares of publicly traded companies  such as Coca Cola Enterprises Inc   NYSE CCE  and American Express Company  NYSE AXP   In fact  one of the reasons why Berkshire s performance has been head and shoulders over the US stock market is Buffett s success in building a concentrated portfolio of companies  That s no trivial factor in looking for explanations for his performance triumph  If you re intent on beating the market  some degree of concentration is necessary  But that raises the question  what are the odds for success with a concentrated portfolio  More to the point  how much of Berkshire s performance is a function of a concentrated investment portfolio 
The tailwind that arises from the simple choice of opting for concentration may be stronger than casual observation suggests  For one thing  there s a generally rising tide of success when it comes to stocks generally  as shown by the positive returns in US equities overall  As a result  it s difficult to choose a portfolio of losers across the board when growth is the bias  What are the odds of beating the S P 500 by randomly choosing 10 stocks from the index  In search of an answer  or at least some perspective  let s kick around some numbers with a basic simulation analysis in R 
First  let s generate a data set of 500 returns with randomly generated prices that have annualized volatility ranging from 1  to 10  and expected annual returns of zero to 30   After setting the initial prices to 100  here s how our fake set of 500 stocks compares across a time period of 10 years  120 months  

As expected  there are a few big winners  a handful of dogs  and a dominant pool of stocks that fall primarily in the middle of those extremes  Now let s randomly generate 10 000 buy and hold portfolios  based on a normal distribution   each reflecting a different mix of 10 stocks from this simulated data set   By the way  that s a small fraction of the total number of unique 10 stock portfolios that are possible in a universe of 500 companies   Assuming that all the portfolios start with an initial price of  100  the end values are spread far and wide  ranging from no change  a final dollar value of  100  up to around  1 600  The average is around  600 

In other words  sheer luck suggests that you d have a pretty good chance of earning average to above average returns by randomly choosing 10 stocks out of a field of 500  That s a high risk strategy in terms of real world investing  of course  but the results lay the foundation for thinking that you can do well with a passive indexing strategy 
Far be it from me to suggest that Buffett s results are due to luck  On the other hand  how many success stories should we expect to find if 10 000 monkeys randomly picked 10 stock portfolios from the S P 500  A surprisingly high number  as it turns out 
The lesson here is that if you assume that a rising economic tide will lift most equity prices over time  you don t have to be a genius to earn an average to above average return  In other words  it helps to fish in a productive pool of companies  Yes  a highly skilled manager is worth his weight in gold  but such talents are the exception to the rule  Even worse  it s hard to identify true investing talent in advance  Fortunately  you can still do pretty well by hitching your investment wagon to the market  Unless  of course  you re confident that you ve identified the next Warren Buffett for the next 40 years  today  Buffett  however  recommends another path  which is to say that he tells us to do as he says and not as he s done  Writing in Berkshire s 2013 letter to shareholders  the Oracle of Omaha offers some rather pedestrian investment advice 

My advice to the trustee couldn t be more simple  Put 10  of the cash in short term government bonds and 90  in a very low cost S   P 500 index fund   I suggest Vanguard s   I believe the trust s long term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors   whether pension funds  institutions or individuals   who employ high fee managers ",2014-05-05,James Picerno,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/luck,-skill-and-concentrated-portfolios-211684",211684
111507,333022,CCEP,The 6 Most Important Asset Bubbles In Modern Times,opinion,The six most important asset bubbles in modern times  in my opinion  are shown in Exhibit 1 and  as you can see  each of them qualifies on the 2 sigma definition  although the 1965 72 peak  known in the trade then as the  Nifty Fifty  event  did so by a modest margin  This event fell short in providing the usual good examples of extreme investment craziness  Perhaps  though  the very definition of the Nifty Fifty as  one decision stocks  may have qualified it  with one extremely crazy theme substituting for many smaller ones  for  one decision stocks  were so named because you only had to make one decision  to buy  These stocks were generally believed then to be so superior that once bought they would be held for life   Most  like Coca Cola Enterprises Inc  NYSE CCE  and Merck   Company Inc  NYSE MRK   stood the test of time well enough  but unfortunately several then unchallengeable examples like Eastman Kodak and Polaroid went the way of all flesh  or all film    There is one very important event that influenced our lives  financial and otherwise  2008  The U S  housing market leaped past 2 sigma all the way to 3 5 sigma  a 1 in 5 000 year event    The U S  equity market  though  was overshadowed by the then recent record bubble of 2000  although it still made it to a 2 sigma event on some definitions  But what was unique about 2008 was the near universality of its asset class overpricing  every equity market  almost all real estate markets  Japan and Germany abstained   and  of course  a fully fledged bubble in oil and many other commodities  The GMO Quarterly of April 2007   It s Everywhere  in Everything  The First Truly Global Bubble   started out   From Indian antiquities to Chinese modern art  from land in Panama to Mayfair  from forestry  infrastructure  and the junkiest bonds to mundane blue chips  its bubble time  libaba s platforms  the giant might start to grow more slowly   So 2008  particularly if you can imagine adding real estate and commodities  was indeed a true global asset bubble  being the most extreme collective outlier in not just 30 years  but in at least the 88 years of our data and probably forever  given the much lower correlations of earlier times ,2014-05-08,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-6-most-important-asset-bubbles-in-modern-times-212195,212195
