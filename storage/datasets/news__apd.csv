114877,336392,APD,Why Air Products   Chemicals Stock Soared 47  in 2019,news,"What happened
Bouncing back from their 2 5  drop in 2018  shares of Air Products   Chemicals  NYSE APD  rose 47  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  A strong fourth quarter 2019 earnings report  management s auspicious outlook for 2020  an update to the company s dividend policy  and a positive nod from Wall Street all helped to catapult shares higher throughout the year 
So what
While the gift giving season had wrapped up for most people weeks earlier  Air Products  a provider of industrial gases  extended the holiday spirit into the new year and offered investors a present in the form of a 5  increase of its quarterly dividend  to  1 16 per share  A Dividend Aristocrat  Air Products has raised its quarterly dividend for 37 consecutive years 

Investors stayed in a spirit of good cheer as the company announced a relatively strong start to its fiscal 2019 year  While sales in Q1 2019 were flat compared to the same period in 2018  Air Products reported earnings per share  EPS  of  1 57    a 124  increase over the  0 70 that it reported for Q1 2018  It wasn t only the income statement  which featured a year over year improvement  Air Products reported Q1 2019 operating cash flow of  655 million  for a 17  increase over the prior year period 
Whereas the dividend raise and Q1 2019 results propelled the stock higher in the first month of the year  a continuous wave of bullish sentiment repeatedly helped propel the stock throughout 2019  For example  In March  Chris Parkinson  an analyst with Credit Suisse  reiterated an outperform rating on the stock and raised his price target to  200 from  188  Becoming more optimistic throughout the year  Parkinson proceeded to raise his price target to  222 in April and to  238 in July  Barclays also expressed a bullish take on the stock  raising its price target to  220 from  184 in April and then to  260 in July  More recently  in November  Deutsche Bank raised its price target to  260 from  250 while reiterating a buy rating  according to TheFly com 
Ending the fiscal year much as it began  Air Products reported a strong Q4 performance  to the delight of investors  EPS jumped to  7 94 for 2019    a 20  increase over 2018    and 2019 operating cash flow rose to  2 97 billion from  2 55 billion in 2018 
But it wasn t only the company s previous performance which motivated investors to pick up shares  Management expects Air Products  bottom line will rise even more in 2020  issuing adjusted EPS guidance of  9 35 to  9 60 per share  up 14  to 17  over 2019 
Now what
In the coming weeks  look for the company to extend its streak of consecutive dividend raises to 38 years  And in the coming quarters  watch how well Air Products fares in meeting management s profitability forecast for 2020  Besides keeping an eye on the financials  look for the announcements of major deals  like the company s recent investment in hydrogen production  that may portend bottom line growth over the long term ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phjss,2058475

 That is the highest mark since July  2014  And July 3  2014 was the last time there were 90   That lasted for a day   Frank Cappelleri  executive director of equity sales and trading at Instinet  told MarketWatch on Friday   Meanwhile  a measure of how intensely the market has been bought is showing the highest reading since January of 2018  The relative strength index  or RSI  over a rolling 14 day period was at 76 91 on Friday and had touched 78 27 on Dec  27  marking the highest reading since Jan  26  2018  see chart attached   Traditionally  the RSI  which charts the speed of price changes in an asset  oscillates between 0 and 100 and is considered overbought when it reads above 70 and oversold when below 30 










Thus far gains have pushed stock prices up without the commensurate advance in corporate earnings  Indeed stocks are overvalued according to the popular measure of price to earnings  or P E  which compares the price of one share of stock against one year of per share earnings relative to recent history  By that measure  the S P 500 is trading at 18 6 times for the coming 12 months  according to FactSet data  That is above the average ratio of 16 7 during the past five years and 14 9 over the past 10  MarketWatch s Chris Matthews reports   Perhaps  that s why corporate earnings reports may take on added significance this week and next as the issues of Sino American trade spats have shifted to the back burner and interest rates remain anchored lower  So far this quarter earnings could help provide a further lift to stocks if companies manage to beat already lowered market expectations    MarketWatch s Tomi Kilgore reports that there s a chance earnings growth could end up better than feared   as analysts have been more pessimistic than usual  amid uncertainty over the negative impact from U S  China trade tensions and slowing overseas growth   That would end an earnings recession  which S P 500 index companies entered officially for the first time in three years back in September   In all  70 5  of the 9  of S P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far have beaten expectations  according to Refinitiv  above the beat rate of 65  for a typical quarter  This week s holiday shortened U S  week begins a more intense phase of fourth quarter earnings reporting which could help determine the fate of this bull market  at least in the near term   If quarterly results can help support this rally then investors may want to heed the advice of hedge fund luminary David Tepper and ride  a horse that s running     The market we re in is one that grinds higher or steadily creeps higher  it is doesn t give investors a chance to buy pullbacks   Paul Schatz  president of Heritage Capital  told MarketWatch  He said that s one of the reasons that FOMO  or fear of missing out  seems to have taken hold on Wall Street  How close are we to getting a pullback  Who knows    Indicators don t flash red when the market is at a top   writes Mark Newton  a prominent  independent technical analyst   It s hard to go out there and really trumpet a big bearish call  which makes you wonder if its probably the right thing to be doing   Or as Jim Carney  founder and CEO of alternative investment manager Parplus Partners  told MarketWatch   It s a tough one  You ve got these guys on TV saying all systems are go  there is no stress in the market and I can t see what the next problem is going to be on the horizon    But every time  it looks good something happens it s almost frightening and that s when it gets worrying   he said   Investors were skittish enough to help produce record flows into bonds  according to Bank of America which indicates that the past two weeks of purchases  about  40 billion  suggest an annualized pace of bond buying of around  1 trillion  see attached chart   Maybe that s why the 10 year Treasury note

114991,336506,APD,Time Warner Moves To Bar Shareholders From Calling Meetings,news,"By    Time Warner Inc s  NYSE TWX  board moved to prevent its shareholders from calling special meetings  effectively throwing up a hurdle to any quick move to approve a potential takeover by Rupert Murdoch s Twenty First Century Fox 
Fox made an offer for Time Warner for about  80 billion or about  85 per share in a mix of stock and cash that Time Warner rebuffed  both companies disclosed last week 
Time Warner previously allowed as few as 15 percent of its shareholders to call a special meeting  factors that could help a takeover bid  The move  revealed in a regulatory filing on Monday  was not preempted by any particular investor buying large amounts of Time Warner shares but rather to give the board the ability to defend itself from an unsolicited bid  two sources close to the matter said 
The sources said the board believed the move was in the best interests of all its shareholders   When you are facing a hostile bid  you don t want to give the bidder the ability to artificially preempt that process   one of the sources said 
The amended bylaw is temporary  however  as the board said it plans to reinstate the special meeting provision during its 2015 annual meeting  according to the filing 
Similar moves have been taken by other takeover targets in recent years  including Airgas Inc  NYSE ARG   which eventually implemented a poison pill that blocked a  5 9 billion hostile bid from Air Products and Chemicals Inc  NYSE APD   The sources  who declined to identified because the discussions are private  would not speculate whether Time Warner s board would also put a poison pill in place 
A spokesman for Time Warner  which owns cable networks TNT and CNN  pay TV channel HBO and Warner Bros movie studio  declined to comment 
Time Warner Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes told his employees in video that the company s standalone strategic plan would create value  superior to any proposal  that Fox could offer 
Part of the issue involves the mix of cash and stock and lack of control of Time Warner s shareholders if a deal should go through  sources told Reuters last week 
Murdoch controls Fox through a 39 percent stake in special shares that were not part of the offer 

Fox offered 60 percent in common stock and 40 percent cash 
Several Time Warner shareholders told Reuters last week that Fox may have to raise the bid to as much as  95 a share boosting its cash component to seal a merger ",2014-07-21,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/time-warner-moves-to-bar-shareholders-from-calling-meetings-296636,296636

115017,336532,APD,Will DuPont  DD  Witness Turbulence In The Next Year Too ,opinion,DuPont de Nemours  Inc    NYSE DD   had a dismal run this year  as the company was plagued with soft demand across some of its businesses due to the U S Sino trade tiff  sluggish automotive and electronics end markets  and weakening global economic conditions  These factors have caused its shares to nosedive 60 3

imaging business unit  Moreover  softness across the automotive and electronics end markets are hurting sales volume in the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions Weakening global economic conditions and trade tariffs are hurting automotive and electronics demand  Consequently  demand weakness  especially in automotive and semiconductor  is dampening the company s organic sales Soft demand is expected to thwart the company s 2019 organic sales performance   Its organic sales this year have been modestly down from the prior year DuPont has also been plagued with headwinds due to higher manufacturing costs  which will likely strain the company s margins  It witnessed elevated manufacturing costs across some of its segments in the third quarter 2019  In particular  higher plant turnaround expenses

115020,336535,APD,This Is Why Air Products And Chemicals  APD  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  in Focus
Air Products and Chemicals  APD  is headquartered in Allentown  and is in the Basic Materials sector  The stock has seen a price change of  3 83  since the start of the year  The seller of gases for industrial  medical and other uses is paying out a dividend of  1 16 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 05  compared to the Chemical   Diversified industry s yield of 1 74  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 79  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 64 is up 1 3  from last year  In the past five year period  Air Products and Chemicals has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 9 89   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Air Products and Chemicals s current payout ratio is 56   meaning it paid out 56  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for APD for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is  9 48 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 15 47  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  APD presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2020-01-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-air-products-and-chemicals-apd-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200496704,200496704
115021,336536,APD,Global Chemical Production Rebounds In November  5 Top Picks,opinion,Global chemical production bounced back to growth in November after slumping in the previous month  according to the recent monthly report from the American Chemistry Council  ACC   The growth in output in November came on the back of increased capacity Production Picks Up in NovemberThe Washington  DC based chemical industry trade group said that the Global Chemical Production Regional Index  CPRI  rose 0 3  in November on a monthly comparison basis  reversing a 0 2  decline in October The Global CPRI  which is measured using a three month moving average  measures chemical production volumes for 33 major nations  sub regions and regions  It is comparable to the Federal Reserve Board  FRB  production indices The ACC also noted that the Global CPRI went up 1 4  year over year on a three month moving average basis  Global capacity was up 0 2  for the reported month and also increased 3 5  on a year over year basis  Capacity utilization for the global chemical industry moved up 0 1 percentage points to 81 7  in November By regions  gains in production were seen across Latin America  up 1    Africa   the Middle East  up 0 7   and the Asia Pacific  up 0 6   in the reported month  Output fell in North America  down 0 6   and was flat in Europe With respect to segments  growth was witnessed in basic chemicals and specialty chemicals while agricultural chemicals and consumer products saw declines in November Initial Trade Deal Augurs Well for ChemicalsThe prolonged trade spat between the United States and China has taken its toll on a bevy of industries and the chemical industry is no exception  The damaging effects of the trade war were evident from the industry s lackluster performance in 2019  In particular  the U S  chemical industry is among those that have been hit the hardest by the trade conflict Washington and Beijing have levied billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each others  products  China s tariffs on American products include a vast range of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics  China is among the most important trading partners of the American chemical industry and is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals  Beijing s retaliatory tariffs have significantly hurt U S  chemical exports The Trump administration s protectionist policies and bitter tariff war with China have largely contributed to the slowdown in the world economy  The trade tiff has also led to a slowdown in industrial activities globally  hurting demand for chemicals In particular  chemical makers are seeing demand weakness in China associated with the trade war amid a slowing Chinese economy  Notably  the trade friction has led to a slowdown in demand in the automotive market  a major chemical end use market  in China  Trade war and a slowdown in the automotive industry have also hurt the European chemical industry Nevertheless  the de escalation in U S  China trade tensions  at least for now  due to the recent announcement of the phase one trade deal would instil confidence in the chemical industry The United States and China  last month  agreed to a phase one trade deal after months of negotiation on its terms  The deal averted the implementation of a new round of U S  tariffs on around  160 billion of consumer goods from China  which were slated to kick in on Dec 15  China has also reportedly suspended its additional tariffs on U S  goods that were supposed to take effect that same day  Moreover  the United States will also slash its 15  tariff on about  120 billion of Chinese imports to 7 5   The countries are expected to sign the trade deal in Washington on January 15 The trade deal would bring respite to the U S  chemical industry as it would avert tariffs on some of the U S  chemicals and plastics not already covered by earlier rounds of tariffs The partial trade deal will remove clouds of uncertainties and provide a boost to American chemical exports which would support the U S  chemical industry s growth this year Meanwhile  the U S  economy has shrugged off recession fears and remains fundamentally stable  With rising consumer confidence  gradual wage growth and unemployment level at five decade lows  the economy looks to be on firm footing 5 Chemical Stocks Worth Betting OnThe favorable November production data bodes well for the chemical industry  The U S  China trade deal will also provide a much needed relief for the industry and is likely to serve as a catalyst for growth this year  As such  it would be prudent to invest in stocks in the space that have compelling prospects and are well poised for solid upside We highlight the following five stocks with a

What s Next for Air Products and Chemicals 
While Air Products and Chemicals has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

115053,336568,APD,Know These 3 Facts To Avoid Paying Half Your Retirement Income To The IRS   December 16  2019,opinion,"Neglecting to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from an IRA by the due date brings about a painful tax code penalty  50   Yes  you read that right  If you are supposed to withdraw at least  4 000 and  uh oh   did not do as such  you have to write the IRS a check for  2 000 
Like many investors  you re likely aiming to build a comfortable nest egg to ensure a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is called the  accumulation phase   In this phase  your goal is to invest wisely by choosing stocks with long term potential for your retirement portfolio  such as Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD   a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
In addition to these considerations  it is essential to take into account the required minimum distribution  RMD  that applies to most retirement accounts  Basically  this is an IRS requirement that you withdraw a certain amount from your qualified retirement accounts once you reach age 70 1 2 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I need to begin withdrawals  For most accounts  you should take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you arrive at age 70 1 2 
For each subsequent year after your required beginning date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you do not have to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you paid taxes prior to contributing  Other types of Roth accounts require RMDs  However  there are ways to avoid them  For example  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  To figure out a particular RMD  you should divide your earlier year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the amount  Ann is 70 and will take her first RMD in the year she turns 70 1 2  Her IRA balance at the end of the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is how much Ann is required to withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 70 1 2

115055,336570,APD,What Makes Air Products And Chemicals  APD  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Air Products and Chemicals basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Air Products and Chemicals imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Air Products and Chemicals
For the fiscal year ending September 2020  this seller of gases for industrial  medical and other uses is expected to earn  9 48 per share  which is a change of 15 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Air Products and Chemicals  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Air Products and Chemicals to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-air-products-and-chemicals-apd-a-new-buy-stock-200492882,200492882

115134,336649,APD,3 Energy Funds To Gain Big From Natural Gas  Decline,opinion,Global natural gas prices witnessed considerable decline during the third quarter  owing to lower demand and rising supplies  As a matter of fact  investors looking forward to make the most of this dip in natural gas prices would do well to buy mutual funds with significant exposure to the space Inventories Rise  Demand PlummetsAccording to the latest  by U S  Energy Information Administration  natural gas stockpiles in underground storage in the lower 48 states increased by 102 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Sep 20 Total stockpiles for the said week stood at 3 205 Bcf  This also marks a 16 1  rise in natural gas stockpiles from the year ago period  Needless to say  natural gas prices continued to trend lower through Oct 2 The larger than expected climb in U S  stockpiles led to a slump in the natural gas futures market  In fact  natural gas futures marked a 12th consecutive session decline on Oct 2  This also indicated the longest losing streak on record  based on data dating back to November 1990 This decline in natural gas prices isn t all bad news  It simply means that natural gas heavy downstream companies are well positioned to gain  Why  This is because these companies purchase raw natural gas and process and purify it for commercial use  Therefore lower prices of natural gas will significantly lessen the purchasing costs for these companies  thus helping them garner profit Our ChoicesWe have  therefore  selected three mutual funds that invest in energy companies that could gain in the current scenario  All of these funds carry a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy   Moreover  these funds have encouraging year to date returns  Additionally

115185,336700,APD,Air Products And Chemicals  APD  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of gases for industrial  medical and other uses is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 29 billion  up 1 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Air Products and Chemicals 
For Air Products and Chemicals  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Air Products and Chemicals will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Air Products and Chemicals would post earnings of  1 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 92  delivering a surprise of  2 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Air Products and Chemicals doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/air-products-and-chemicals-apd-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200441553,200441553

115221,336736,APD,Chemicals Witness A Solid Q2 With Strong Production Growth,opinion,Global chemical production continued its uptrend in the second quarter with May seeing a rise in production on gains across most regions  according to the recent monthly report from the American Chemistry Council   ACC   May Sees Improved ProductionThe chemical industry trade group said that the Global Chemical Production Regional Index   CPRI   rose 0 4  in May on a monthly comparison basis  an improvement from a 0 3  gain in April The ACC also noted that the Global CPRI went up 1 6  year over year on a three month moving average basis The Global CPRI  which is measured using a three month moving average  measures chemical production volumes for 33 major nations  sub regions and regions  It is comparable to the Federal Reserve Board   FRB   production indices Capacity utilization for the global chemical industry moved up 0 2 percentage points to 83 1  in May  Utilization  however  fell from 84 7  a year ago By regions  May saw higher production across North America  up 0 5    Latin America  up 0 2    the Former Soviet Union  up 1 6    Africa   the Middle East  up 0 1   and the Asia Pacific  up 0 6    However  output fell in Europe  down 0 3   On a segment basis  growth was witnessed in bulk petrochemicals and organics  synthetic rubber  manufactured fibers  coatings and other

States went up 0 4  in May on a monthly comparison basis  following a 0 2  rise a month ago  May saw an uptick in chemical production on a monthly comparison basis across all regions barring the Ohio Valley Chemical Industry Poised for Upside Amid Challenges The chemical industry is among the industries that have been badly hit by the bitter year long trade spat between the United States and China  Washington and Beijing levied billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each others  products last year  China s list of U S  goods hit with tariffs includes an array of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics The tariffs currently in place are doing damage to the chemical industry  China is among the largest export markets for U S  chemicals  Beijing s countermeasures have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in China  The tariffs are hurting U S  chemical exports A downturn in the global economy  partly due to the trade tensions  is another concern for the chemical industry  Economic conditions have  in particular  weakened across emerging economies  Moreover  political uncertainties around Brexit and other concerns have led to a slowdown in the European economy Notwithstanding the headwinds  the chemical industry is poised for an upswing in 2019  In particular  the U S  chemical industry is expected to run higher this year on the back of strength in major end use markets and significant investment on capacity expansion The ACC expects the U S  chemical industry to grow 2 5  in 2019  The trade group sees growth in important end use markets to support the expansion of the industry  While the automotive sector is expected to remain at high levels  slow recovery in the housing market is expected to continue  Shale linked Investments are also expected to drive growth in the U S  chemical industry Chemical Stocks to Watch ForA few stocks currently worth considering in the chemical space are Israel Chemicals Ltd    NYSE

115258,336773,APD,US Chemicals Poised For Upside Amid Headwinds  5 Solid Picks,opinion,The U S  chemical industry is set to ride high this year notwithstanding a challenging world economy   according to the newly released  Mid Year 2019 Chemical Industry Situation and Outlook  by the American Chemistry Council   ACC    Growth is expected to be spurred by strength across major chemical end use markets and significant shale gas linked investment on capacity expansion However  the industry faces headwinds from slowing global growth  escalating trade tensions and a slowdown in manufacturing and chemical exports  the Washington  DC based chemical industry trade group noted U S  Chemical Industry Set to Run HigherAmid the prevailing challenges  the ACC envisions the U S  chemical industry to grow 2 5  in 2019 and further gain steam with a 3  growth in 2020  The trade group expects growth in the American chemical industry to surpass that of the U S  economy through 2024 The ACC expects growth in important end use markets to support the expansion of the U S  chemical industry  While the automotive sector is expected to remain at high levels  slow recovery in the housing market is expected to continue On a segment basis  the trade group sees strong gains in production in organic chemicals  inorganic chemicals and other specialty chemicals in 2019  This will be partly masked by modest declines in production of agricultural chemicals and consumer products While the ACC expects the U S  chemical industry trade surplus to continue to grow  it sees the expansion to be limited by lower external demand due to slower global growth and increasing trade barriers The trade group expects U S  chemicals exports to expand 5 9  in 2019 to  149 billion  resulting in the United States having a  37 billion trade surplus in chemicals  It also sees two way trade between the United States and its foreign partners to expand 4 4  year over year and reach  260 billion this year Shale linked Investments to Drive U S  ChemicalsThe American chemical industry continues to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheap feedstock extracted from shale gas Per the ACC  the United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical industry continue to enjoy the competitive advantage of access to ample supplies of natural gas and natural gas liquids  NGLs  from shale activity  This is driving capital investment in new chemical projects to beef up capacity  The trade group expects gains in capital spending  rising 5 4  in 2019 and 4 9  in 2020 According to the ACC  334 chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth  204 billion that are complete under construction or in the planning phase  Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream 5 Chemical Stocks Worth a BetThe U S  chemical industry s upturn is expected to continue this year on continued strength across major end markets and significant capital investment on capacity additions  Amid

115259,336774,APD,5 Top Basic Materials Stocks To Buy On June Turnaround ,opinion,After a disappointing May  the basic materials sector is witnessing an impressive turnaround in June  This sector suffered last month owing to a host of factors including the U S  China trade war  concerns over lower demand from China and higher raw materials costs The basic materials sector is made up of companies involved in the discovery  development  and processing of raw materials used in manufacturing and construction including steel  aluminum  chemicals and forestry products  Consequently  these stocks are sensitive to business cycle and likely to thrive when the economy is strong The trade conflict with China is persisting with no sign of an immediate resolution  Despite the trade tussle and threat of a global economic slowdown  the sector is flourishing primarily on strong market sentiment courtesy of interest rate cut signal by the Fed and rate reductions made by other central banks Basic Materials Sector Rebounds  The Materials Select Sector SPDR  XLB   one of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark S P 500 Index  has gained 9 6  so far in June  At present  XLB is the best performing sector of the S P 500 Index for this month since October 2015  when it registered a rally of 13 5  At its current level of 57 78  XLB is well above 50 day and 200 day moving averages of 56 03 and 54 97  respectively  The 50 day and 200 day moving averages are important technical barriers providing short term and long term support levels  Moreover  in the past month  XLB has been the best performing sector with a gain of 4 8  despite severe volatility  Year to date  this sector has rallied 14 4  High Expectations of Rate Cut  The primary reason for this impressive performance of the basic materials sector is the expectation of interest rate reduction by the Fed  According to CME FedWatch tool  65  responders were hoping for a rate cut in 2019 on Jun 3 However  after Powell s speech on Jun 4  in which he hinted at a possible rate cut  more than 90  of the responders are expecting a rate cut by September and 80  foresee a likely second cut by the end of December After the release of weak job data for May on Jun 7  market expectations of a Fed rate cut in June rose to 27 5  from 16 7   Moreover  the market is also predicting a 79  chance of lower Fed rates by July  On Jun 14  the CME FedWatch tool said that 85 3  responders are expecting a rate cut by the Fed in July The Fed is yet to commit an interest rate reduction anytime soon  On Jun 4  Jerome Powell said that the central bank is watching current economic developments and will  act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   However  his comments have been considered as a strong signal Moreover  recently released tepid economic data like job growth  manufacturing PMI and factory orders as well as subdued inflation have acted as catalysts for investors to consider strong ground for a possible rate cut  This sentiment boosted the basic materials sector Out Top PicksAgainst this backdrop  we have narrowed down our search to five basic materials stocks with strong growth potentials  Each of these stocks sport either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see  The chart below shows price performance of our five picks year to date Materion Corp    NYSE MTRN   is engaged in the

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Materion Corp    NYSE MTRN    SSR Mining Inc    NASDAQ SSRM    Axalta Coating Systems Ltd    NYSE AXTA    Air Products and Chemicals Inc    NYSE APD   and The Scotts Miracle Gro Co    NYSE SMG   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog 5 Top Basic Materials Stocks to Buy on June TurnaroundAfter a disappointing May  the basic materials sector is witnessing an impressive turnaround in June  This sector suffered last month owing to a host of factors including the U S  China trade war  concerns over lower demand from China and higher raw materials costs The basic materials sector is made up of companies involved in the discovery  development  and processing of raw materials used in manufacturing and construction including steel  aluminum  chemicals and forestry products  Consequently  these stocks are sensitive to business cycle and likely to thrive when the economy is strong The trade conflict with China is persisting with no sign of an immediate resolution  Despite the trade tussle and threat of a global economic slowdown  the sector is flourishing primarily on strong market sentiment courtesy of interest rate cut signal by the Fed and rate reductions made by other central banks Basic Materials Sector Rebounds  The Materials Select Sector SPDR  XLB   one of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark S P 500 Index  has gained 9 6  so far in June  At present  XLB is the best performing sector of the S P 500 Index for this month since October 2015  when it registered a rally of 13 5  At its current level of 57 78  XLB is well above 50 day and 200 day moving averages of 56 03 and 54 97  respectively  The 50 day and 200 day moving averages are important technical barriers providing short term and long term support levels  Moreover  in the past month  XLB has been the best performing sector with a gain of 4 8  despite severe volatility  Year to date  this sector has rallied 14 4  High Expectations of Rate Cut  The primary reason for this impressive performance of the basic materials sector is the expectation of interest rate reduction by the Fed  According to CME FedWatch tool  65  responders were hoping for a rate cut in 2019 on Jun 3 However  after Powell s speech on Jun 4  in which he hinted at a possible rate cut  more than 90  of the responders are expecting a rate cut by September and 80  foresee a likely second cut by the end of December After the release of weak job data for May on Jun 7  market expectations of a Fed rate cut in June rose to 27 5  from 16 7   Moreover  the market is also predicting a 79  chance of lower Fed rates by July  On Jun 14  the CME FedWatch tool said that 85 3  responders are expecting a rate cut by the Fed in July The Fed is yet to commit an interest rate reduction anytime soon  On Jun 4  Jerome Powell said that the central bank is watching current economic developments and will  act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   However  his comments have been considered as a strong signal Moreover  recently released tepid economic data like job growth  manufacturing PMI and factory orders as well as subdued inflation have acted as catalysts for investors to consider strong ground for a possible rate cut  This sentiment boosted the basic materials sector Out Top PicksAgainst this backdrop  we have narrowed down our search to five basic materials stocks with strong growth

115265,336780,APD,U S  Chemical Production On An Upswing  4 Stocks Worth A Bet,opinion,U S  chemical production continues to leap in the second quarter with May seeing a rise in production on gains in output across most chemical producing regions  according to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council   ACC   The Washington  DC based chemical industry trade group said that the U S  Chemical Production Regional Index   CPRI   went up 0 4  in May on a monthly comparison basis  following a 0 2  rise a month ago  The U S  CPRI  which is measured using a three month moving average  was created to track chemical production in seven regions nationwide May Data Shows Broad based Regional GainsThe May readings showed an uptick in chemical production on a monthly comparison basis across all regions barring the Ohio Valley The Gulf Coast region   the epicenter of the U S  specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry   saw the biggest gain with output moving up 0 5   Production from Northeast and Midwest rose 0 3  and 0 2   respectively  in the reported month  Output rose 0 1  in Mid Atlantic  West Coast and Southeast  Production was flat in the Ohio Valley By segments  chemical production was mixed  Gains in organic chemicals  inorganic chemicals  manufactured fibers  plastic resins  synthetic rubber  other specialty chemicals and industrial gases were neutralized by lower production in adhesives  fertilizers  crop protection chemicals  consumer products and coatings According to the ACC  activity for the U S  manufacturing sector   the largest consumer of chemical products   edged down 0 1  in May  marking the fourth consecutive month of decline The manufacturing sector serves as a barometer to gauge the overall health of the U S  economy and has a major influence on the chemical industry  The sector is a major driver for the chemical industry which touches around 96  of manufactured goods  Manufacturing activity is also a key indicator for chemical production Within the manufacturing sector  production rose in several chemistry end user markets in May including motor vehicles and parts  computers  semiconductors  oil and gas extraction  rubber products  apparel and furniture U S  factory activity slowed in May amid concerns over an escalation in the U S  China trade tiff and a slowdown in the world economy Meanwhile  overall chemical production also went up 2 1  on a year over year comparison basis in May with all regions racking up gains  Biggest gains were witnessed across Northeast  Mid Atlantic and West Coast regions U S  Chemical Industry Poised for UpsideNotwithstanding slowing global growth  escalating trade tensions and a slowdown in manufacturing  the ACC envisions the U S  chemical industry to grow 2 5  in 2019  The trade group sees growth in important end use markets to support the expansion of the industry  While the automotive sector is expected to remain at high levels  slow recovery in the housing market is expected to continue The ACC expects strong gains in production in organic chemicals  inorganic chemicals and other specialty chemicals in 2019  partly masked by modest declines in production of agricultural chemicals and consumer products Shale linked Investments are also expected to drive growth in the U S  chemical industry  The United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical industry continue to enjoy the competitive advantage of access to abundant supplies of shale gas and natural gas liquids  NGLs  This is driving capital investment in new chemical projects to beef up capacity  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream  The ACC expects gains in capital spending  rising 5 4  in 2019 and 4 9  in 2020 4 Chemical Stocks Worth a WagerThe U S  chemical industry s upswing is expected to continue on strength across major end markets and investment on capacity expansion  U S  chemical makers should continue to reap the benefits of abundant and affordable shale gas feedstock  As such  it would be prudent to invest in stocks in the space that have compelling prospects and are well poised for solid upside We highlight the following four stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  that are good options for investment right now  You can see  Axalta Coating Systems Ltd    NYSE AXTA  Pennsylvania based Axalta sports a Zacks Rank  1  The company has expected earnings growth of 35 2  for 2019  Earnings estimates for 2019

115297,336812,APD,Chemical Industry Off To A Good Start In Q2  April Output Up,opinion,The global chemical industry has gotten off to a positive start in the second quarter with April seeing an uptick in chemical production  according to the recently released monthly report from the American Chemistry Council   ACC   Positive April ReadingsThe chemical industry trade group said that the Global Chemical Production Regional Index   CPRI   went up 0 3  in April on a monthly comparison basis  following a 0 1  growth in March and a 0 2  rise in February  The ACC also noted that the Global CPRI rose 2 3  year over year on a three month moving average basis The Global CPRI  which is measured using a three month moving average  measures chemical production volumes for 33 major nations  sub regions and regions  It is comparable to the Federal Reserve Board   FRB   production indices By regions  April saw sequentially higher production across North America  Africa and the Middle East  and Asia Pacific  Output was flat in Europe while declining in Latin America On a segment basis  growth was witnessed in consumer products  bulk petrochemicals and organics  plastic resins  synthetic rubber  manufactured fibers  coatings and other specialties for the reported month  This was offset by softness across agricultural chemicals and inorganic chemicals The U S  chemical industry also started the second quarter on a positive note  Per the ACC  chemical production in the United States went up 0 3  on a monthly comparison basis in April  This follows a 0 2  sequential decline a month ago   Output also rose 0 2  in North America for the reported month The U S  chemical industry is expected to run higher this year on the back of strength across major end use markets  higher industrial activities and gains in business investment The ACC envisions national chemical production  excluding pharmaceuticals  to rise 3 6  in 2019  The growth is expected to be spurred by gains in manufacturing and export and sustained demand across light vehicles and housing markets Trade Tensions Cloud ProspectsThe chemical industry is among the industries that have been roiled by the bitter year long trade spat between the United States and China  In particular  the U S  chemical industry is bearing the brunt of the trade conflict Washington and Beijing levied billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each others  products last year  China s list of U S  goods hit with tariffs includes an array of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals and plastics  Beijing s countermeasures have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in China  The tariffs are hurting U S  chemical exports and the competitiveness of the American chemical industry  Trade tensions have also led to a slowdown in industrial activities across Asia and Europe  hurting demand for chemicals and plastics Chemical makers are seeing weaker demand in China associated with the U S  China trade tiff amid a slowing Chinese economy  Notably  the trade friction has led to a slowdown in demand in the automotive market  a major chemical end use market  in China  A downturn in the global economy  partly due to the trade tensions  is another concern for the chemical industry as this would hurt growth

115389,336904,APD,Chemical Diversified Stock Outlook  Near Term Prospects Dim,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals  plastics  specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals  Companies in this space serve a host of end use markets such as automotive  building   construction  transportation  electronics  aerospace and agriculture Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities and include petrochemicals and intermediates  such as ethylene  propylene and benzene   polymers  including plastic resins such as polyethylene  polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride  and inorganic chemicals  such as chlorine  caustic soda and titanium dioxide   Specialty chemicals that include catalysts  surfactants  speciality polymers  coating additives and oilfield chemicals are used in specific fields based on their performance  Agricultural chemicals include herbicides  fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease  pests and weeds Here are the three major themes in the industry The diversified chemical industry is among the industries that have been badly hit by the bitter year long trade conflict between the United States and China  Washington and Beijing slapped billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each others  products last year  China s list of U S  goods hit with tariffs includes an array of chemicals  Although recent negotiations between the world s two biggest economies have raised hopes of a possible resolution of the trade dispute  the tariffs currently in place are already doing damage to this space  Notably  China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals and  thus  leaves the American chemical industry heavily exposed to Beijing s countermeasures  The trade tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in China  Companies in this space are exposed to headwinds from raw material cost inflation as a result of short supply  partly due to production outages and plant shutdowns  China s environmental crackdown has led to tightening in the supply of certain key raw materials as a result of plant closures  The disruption in the supply chain has pushed up prices of these inputs  Some companies are also exposed to challenges from elevated logistics costs  Nevertheless  these players remain focused on countering the challenges through strategic actions including productivity improvement  capacity expansion  price hike initiatives and expansion of scale through acquisitions  Such actions should help them alleviate any pressure on margin  U S  chemical makers are spending heavily on chemical production projects to beef up capacity  The shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investments in plants and equipment in the country  The shale boom has provided U S  chemical producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts and incentivized a number of companies to plough billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the United States to produce key feedstocks like ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way  Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export  However  there is also concern that the trade tariffs currently in place may dampen new chemical investment in the United States   Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is part of the broader Zacks  Sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  210  which places it at the bottom 18  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group s earnings growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 11 3  Before we present a few diversified chemical stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and current valuation Industry Lags Sector and S P 500The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has lagged both the Zacks S P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector over the past year The industry has declined 16 1  over this period compared with the S P 500 s rise of 4 8  and broader sector s fall of 11 1  One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing chemical stocks  the industry is currently trading at 8 67X  below the S P 500 s 10 99X  However  it is ahead of the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 8 12X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 19 96X  as low as 6 18X and at the median of 8 92X  as the chart below shows Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio Bottom LineThe damaging impact of the U S  China trade conflict pose as headwinds to the diversified chemical industry  Moreover  margins of the companies in this space will remain under pressure in an inflationary environment given the spike in input costs Nonetheless  strategic actions including expansion of scale through acquisitions  operational efficiency improvement  capacity expansion and continued focus on cost and productivity should keep them afloat over the neat term Here  we present one stock sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that is well positioned to gain amid the prevailing challenges  There are also three stocks with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

115426,336941,APD,Air Products And Chemicals  APD  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This seller of gases for industrial  medical and other uses is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 87 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 29 billion  up 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 46  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Air Products and Chemicals 
For Air Products and Chemicals  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Air Products and Chemicals will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Air Products and Chemicals would post earnings of  2 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Air Products and Chemicals doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/air-products-and-chemicals-apd-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200377150,200377150

115428,336943,APD,Air Products And Chemicals  APD  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Air Products and Chemicals is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Air Products and Chemicals imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Air Products and Chemicals
This seller of gases for industrial  medical and other uses is expected to earn  8 17 per share for the fiscal year ending September 2019  which represents a year over year change of 9 7  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Air Products and Chemicals  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line

in what the leaders want from the deal Trump focused on trade issues  including a 90 day pause on raising tariffs and Xi s concession to buy  very substantial  amount of energy and agricultural goods from the United States to address the trade imbalance  Thus  Trump is emphasizing on  America first  and is urging countries to protect their economies by reducing the number of imports and investments from other countries China  in the meanwhile  is looking at the broader picture  The country is predominantly focused on diplomacy and regional issues  Xi s government surely wants to resolve complex territorial issues such as Taiwan and South China Sea before the truce develops into a full grown peace treaty Lest we forget  Trump had permitted a  330 million arms deal with Taiwan  following up on a previous deal of  1 3 billion  Such an arms deal irked China as it contradicted Beijing s age old policy that there is only one Chinese government and Taiwan is only a breakaway province  which will eventually unite with China With the world s two largest economies  approach being strikingly dissimilar  the G 20 truce has merely paused the trade war but not put an end to it

500 peaked in late September this year  it was way more expensive than at the top of the 2000 tech bubble  on the basis of price to sales ratio  And as the stocks get expensive  expectations rise  leading the market to a crash By the way  the  1 5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a blessing for corporates and has served as a major boon for the economy  But  it s been a year since the GOP passed such a bill and thus the short term growth effects from such a fiscal stimulus are widely expected to run out in the near term But  what about the current state of the economy  It s not good either  Recent housing starts and new home permits are down  while existing home sales have started to soften  Yale economist Robert Shiller summed up by saying that  the housing market has been an important element of economic activity  If people start to get pessimistic about housing and pull back and don t want to buy  there will be a drop in construction jobs and that could be a seed for another recession  The final threat to the Santa Claus rally is  of course  the Federal Reserve  The central bank has been raising rates steadily this year and is widely expected to lift rates to 2 5

115468,336983,APD,US Chemical Industry Set To Ride High In 2019  4 Solid Picks,opinion,The American chemical industry is poised for an upswing in 2019 on the back of strength across major end use markets  higher industrial activities and gains in business investment   according to the newly released  Year End 2018 Chemical Industry Situation and Outlook  by the American Chemistry Council   ACC   The Washington  DC based chemical industry trade group said that growth in manufacturing and exports markets this year will continue to boost demand for basic chemicals  These factors coupled with growth in construction markets are also expected to drive the specialty chemicals segments U S  Chemical Industry Set for Solid GrowthThe outlook for the American chemical industry paints an encouraging picture  The ACC envisions national chemical production  excluding pharmaceuticals  to rise 3 6  in 2019  following a 3 1  growth in 2018  The growth is expected to be spurred by gains in manufacturing and export and sustained demand across light vehicles and housing markets  However  rising trade tensions pose a risk The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to expand 2 1  in 2018 and further gain steam with a 4 8  rise in 2019 on the heels of investments in new capacity additions According to the ACC  strength in export markets and higher business investment have boosted demand in major chemical end use markets such as light vehicles and housing  While the automotive sector remains at high levels  housing activity is improving with 1 27 million starts in 2018 and 1 34 million in 2019  Light vehicle sales are expected to remain elevated at 17 1 million in 2018 and 16 8 million in 2019  the ACC added The specialty chemicals segment is also expected to see production growth of 3 7  in 2018 and 2 2  in 2019  per the ACC  Improvement in oilfield chemicals  electronic chemicals  coatings  adhesives  cosmetic chemicals  and flavors and fragrances are fueling growth in specialty chemicals  The trade group expects demand for specialty chemicals to grow in sync with gains in industrial and construction sectors in the years ahead Rising Capital SpendingThe American chemical industry continues to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheap ethane feedstock extracted from shale gas  The shale bounty has provided U S  producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts  which use oil based feedstock such as naptha  This is driving investment in chemical production projects to beef up capacity According to the ACC  333 chemical projects  both on new plants and capacity expansions  have been already announced by chemical makers since 2010 worth  202 billion  68  of which is foreign direct investment or involves an overseas partner  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream  Strengthening Export MarketsThe ACC expects improving export markets to contribute to growth of the domestic chemical industry  Total chemical exports are projected to rise 10  to  143 billion this year while imports are forecast to pick up 7 8  to  105 billion Higher exports will result in the U S  chemical industry having a  39 billion trade surplus in chemicals in 2018  the trade group noted  Moreover  the ACC sees two way trade between the United States and its foreign partners to expand 9 1  year over year and reach  248 billion this year 4 Chemical Stocks Set to Run HigherThe U S  chemical industry is set for solid upside next year on continued demand strength across major end markets and significant capital investment  Amid such a backdrop  it would be prudent to invest in chemical stocks with compelling growth prospects We highlight the

What s Next for Air Products and Chemicals 
While Air Products and Chemicals has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

115524,337039,APD,Chemicals Industry Stock Outlook   March 2018,opinion,"The chemical industry is riding an upturn in the world economy and continued strength across major end use markets such as construction  automotive and electronics  Another positive for the industry is a recovery in demand in the energy space   a key chemical end market that had been out of favor for a spell  The recovery has been driven by the rebound in crude oil prices from their historic lows 
The  has outperformed the broader market in a year s time  The industry has gained around 19 4  over this period  higher than the S P 500 s corresponding return of roughly 17 8  
Fourth quarter earnings season had been a good one for chemical stocks  Notwithstanding a few headwinds including some lingering impacts of devastating hurricanes  chemical companies continued the earnings momentum in the December quarter  We note that a number of companies in the space   including prominent names such as Eastman Chemical Co   EMN   Celanese Corp   CE   PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   Inc   PPG  and Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD   Inc   APD    produced earnings beats in the quarter 
The outperformance was driven by solid demand across major end markets as well as strategic measures including productivity improvement  pricing actions  portfolio restructuring and earnings accretive acquisitions 
Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on high growth markets  driven by megatrends  in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are struggling with weak demand and input costs pressure  These companies are also increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations 
Cost cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to reap industry wide margin improvements in 2018  Moreover  a number of chemical makers are taking appropriate pricing actions to offset raw materials cost inflation  which should also provide margin benefits 
Chemical makers also continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors   major chemical end use markets  The underlying trends in the housing space remain strong  backed by strong economic growth  steady buyer demand  high homebuilders  confidence and low unemployment levels 
The automotive sector also continues its good run amid certain challenges  supported by an improving job market  rising personal income  favorable credit conditions  improved consumer confidence and impressive vehicle launches  Rising demand for profitable crossovers  sports utility vehicles and pickups are also aiding the auto industry 
A rebound in crude oil prices has also led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space  an important end use market  The recent uptrend in oil prices has been supported by a decline in U S  oil stockpiles and extension of oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers until the end of 2018  The recovery in oil prices has also led to a favorable pricing environment for chemical products 
U S  Chemical Industry Set to Ride Growth Wave
The U S  Chemical Industry has recovered from the damaging effects of hurricanes and is set for solid growth in 2018  The American Chemistry Council   ACC    an industry trade group  envisions national chemical production  excluding pharmaceuticals  to rise 3 7  in 2018  further accelerating to a 3 9  growth in 2019  The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets  capital investments and improved export markets 
The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to expand 4 7  in 2018 and further gain steam with a 5 2  rise in 2019 on the heels of new capacity additions  The specialty chemicals segment is also expected to see production growth of 2 3  in 2018  per the ACC 
Surging Capital Spending
The United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks and energy  This is driving investment in chemical production projects 
The shale gas boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies including industry heavyweights such as BASF SE  DE BASFN   BASFY  and LyondellBasell Industries N V   LYB  to invest billions of dollars to beef up capacity  According to the ACC  roughly 320 chemical projects have been already announced worth more than  185 billion  62  of which is foreign direct investment 
Moreover  roughly 65  of the chemical investment announced since 2010 are complete or under construction  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream 
The ACC expects chemical industry capital spending to rise 6 3  in 2018 and 6 8  in 2019 and eventually reach  48 billion by 2022 
Strengthening Export Markets
The ACC sees improving export markets to contribute to solid growth of the domestic chemical industry  Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are driving chemical demand across key end use markets such as light vehicles and housing  Major export markets  such as Latin America and Asia  are also expected to play a significant role in basic chemical production growth this year and the next 
EU Chemical Sector Back in Business
The European chemical industry has also swung back to life on the back of improving global economic sentiment and a resurgent Eurozone economy  Eurozone s recovery has been backed by a pick up in global economic activity  declining unemployment and strengthening business and consumer confidence 
The outlook for the European chemical industry is positive  The European Chemical Industry Council  CEFIC  expects chemical output in the European Union to rise 2  year over year in 2018 
Per the CEFIC  the growth of manufacturing production across sectors such as automotive  construction  metal production and electronics in the European Union has led to higher demand for chemicals in the region  Exports of chemicals produced in European Union have also increased  particularly in Asia and Russia 
A Few Concerns
The chemical industry  however  faces certain headwinds  A number of chemical companies are witnessing a spike in raw material prices  exacerbated by short supply due to last year s hurricanes  Some of these companies  in their fourth quarter earnings call  had warned of continued headwinds from elevated input costs through the first half of 2018  As such  raw material cost inflation may unfavorably impact margins of these companies 
Chemical makers also continue to feel the pinch of depressed demand in agriculture markets  Sustained pressure on agricultural commodity prices is scuttling a meaningful recovery in this key chemical end market The outlook for the fertilizer and agricultural chemicals space remains cloudy due to continued weakness in crop prices  low farm income and sluggish economic conditions in certain emerging markets  including Latin America 
Moreover  concerns regarding China s future growth remain a source of near term uncertainty for the chemical industry  Uncertainties surrounding China   a key market for chemicals   is expected to remain an overhang on the industry in the short to medium term  Sustained overcapacity  weak private investment and high levels of corporate debt are still hurting the world s second largest economy

Valuation Looks Bit Stretched
Going by the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  multiple  a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like chemicals  valuation for the  Chemicals  industry looks bit stretched at the moment when compared to its own range and the broader market 
The industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 15 7  which is above its own average of 12 7 in the past year  Moreover  the industry compares unfavorably with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is at 11 8  As such  there seems to be little room for an upside moving ahead 
Final Thoughts
While the chemical industry still faces a few headwinds  its momentum is expected to continue this year on sustained demand strength across light vehicles and construction markets  a rebound in demand in the energy place and significant shale linked capital investment  Strategic actions including expansion of scale through acquisitions  operational efficiency improvement and continued focus on cost and productivity should help chemical makers weather the macroeconomic and industry specific headwinds in 2018

115574,337089,APD,Monsanto Battles Market Rivalry On Innovation   Bayer s Deal ,opinion,On Feb 13  we issued an updated research report on premium agricultural chemicals firm Monsanto Company   NYSE MON   Over the last six months  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have gained 2 8   as against the 3 5  loss incurred by the  Inside Story Increase in per capita income levels across emerging economies  like Brazil  and significant rise in global population have been escalating demand for food products  These  in turn  have been boosting sales for crop yield enhancing products offered by companies like Monsanto The company follows an innovation based growth strategy  under which it introduces unique products and process technologies to help cultivators lower input costs and enhance crop yields  The company believes its new innovation investments as well as research and development deals will assist in driving top line growth in the quarters ahead Monsanto is currently progressing on 20 new research and development projects  The company believes innovative farming solutions produced through these programs will help farmers battle severe agricultural constraints such as drought  water scarcity  climatic changes  land availability issues  plant diseases  incidence of weeds  and insects  Moreover  the company s business subsidiary   The Climate Corporation   and the BioAg Alliance with Novozymes are also inventing state of the art crop yield enhancing solutions for cultivators In order to become the leading player in the global seeds  traits and agricultural chemical industry  Monsanto has joined forces withBayer AG   OTC BAYRY    through a  66 billion buyout offer   The company believes that Bayer s association will open up a number of opportunities and growth for Monsanto s business Monsanto believes when its Seeds and Traits and Climate FieldView platform will be combined with Bayer s non imitable crop protection trade  the competency of the former will go up in the hostile agricultural chemicals industry  Along with Bayer  Monsanto is aimed at propelling innovation for farmers around the world  develop advanced integrated optimized solutions for the cultivators and provide new offerings in the market which will be highly beneficial for farmers  Monsanto anticipates closing the transaction in early 2018  which is subject to customary closing conditions and awaits regulatory approvals  Bayer has also pledged to reimburse a high break up fee of  2 billion to Monsanto  in case there is a deal blockage due to regulatory turmoils We notice that Monsanto reported robust first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings  Quarterly bottom line results came in 95  higher than the year ago tally and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 9   The company stated that this upside was primarily driven by healthy growth in South American business  Notably  the company anticipates to report stronger earnings in the upcoming quarters on the back of higher volume and pricing for INTACTA RR2 PRO soybeans in South America  gains secured from the Precision Planning business spin off  closed on Sep 5  2017  and increased glyphosate pricing However  over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained unchanged for both fiscal 2018 and 2019  reflecting neutral sentiments In order to boost competency in the market  Monsanto makes potential research and development investments  However  such expensive moves are currently adding up to its aggregate debt burden  We find that the company is highly leveraged with approximately  6 9 billion of long term debt at the end of first quarter fiscal 2018  Increased debt  if unchecked  will increase the company s financial obligations and impact its profitability in the near term In addition  commercial rivalry in the global seeds  traits and agricultural chemical industry has been significantly increasing  Intense competition exposes Monsanto to risks of market share loss  This is because the successful launch of a product by any rival can substantially lower the market value of the existing products offered by the company  In order to lower the bargaining power of prospective end users  Monsanto seeks to generate higher liquidity for research and development to fortify its product portfolio Also  Monsanto s cost and sales are highly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations  Weak agricultural products  prices might weigh over the company s near term revenues and margins  Given that incomes of farmers are directly related to agro product prices  lower prices are reducing farmers  income  and adversely affecting their seed and chemical product purchasing decisions  thereby hurting Monsanto s top and bottom lines  For instance  soft corn pricing in North America might dampen Monsanto s revenues in the upcoming quarters of fiscal 2018 Stocks to Consider Two better ranked stocks in the are listed below Air Products and Chemicals  Inc    NYSE APD   holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 4 68  over the last four quarters Praxair  Inc    NYSE PX   also carries a Zacks Rank

revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of

115695,337210,APD,Air Products Stock Popped But Is It A Long Term Play ,opinion,"Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  released earnings that beat estimates on all fronts  As a result  the stock price jumped more than 4   But is this stock a buy for the long term investor  The answer isn t so cut and dry as Air Products has faced a lot of headwinds over the past few years and faces more headwinds in the coming years 
But the company has taken some steps to keep growing in the future  The question then is whether or not these moves are enough to continue to grow earnings per share and revenues each year 
Below  we will take an in depth look at Air Products to try to determine if this stock is a good investment or not 
Air Products At A Glance
Air Products is a company that sells gases and chemicals for industrial use and has been in business since 1940 
The income strategy for Air Products is one that is beneficial to investors because they set up long term sales contracts with their customers  This allows for steady revenue each year and this means that the stock price will be less volatile overall 
What Air Products Has Going For It
So what does Air Products have going in its favor  First  I will note again the long term contracts that the company has  In addition to this  they are expanding into emerging markets where they hope to make a solid footprint 
Recently they opened up a new hydrogen plant in India and an oxygen plant in China 
Next  the company has decided to reinvest  8 billion back into the company over the next 3 years  They project that this reinvestment will allow for earnings growth of 10  annually through 2020 
Finally  the company is determined to provide shareholder value through raising its dividend  Air Products has increased their dividend each year for 34 years  which when looked at on an annual basis is an 8  annual growth rate 
When it comes to earnings  Air Products beat earnings per share estimates by  0 08 at  1 76  Revenues also beat estimates  coming in at  2 2 billion  which was an increase of 13   In the previous quarter  revenues were higher by 11  
Issues Air Products Is Facing
For a few years Air Products was not proactive in the industry and as a result  their competitors who were hungrier for market share have taken customers away from the company 
Related to this is the sheer size of Air Products  When companies get as large as they are  it is harder to continue growing a company at a fast rate 
To try to solve both of these issues  Air Products sold off their Materials Technology business  However many analysts think this move is too little  too late 
Where Air Products Goes From Here
Air Products is now at a crossroads  They have 2 options for future growth  add shareholder value by returning capital via dividends or find new investment opportunities to help grow revenues 
As of this writing  Air Products is taking the middle road  which really isn t a road  They are trying to find a healthy balance to do both 
In theory this sounds like a smart move  but from the businesses I ve seen in the past who go this route  it usually doesn t turn out well  In fact  it usually is just delaying the inevitable  which is that they should have just picked a path and put all of their focus into trying to make it work 
Because of this  I would be wary of investing in Air Products  I don t see the stock price going much higher than it currently is and I see revenue growth slowing in the coming years 
Maybe for the short term you could pick up some shares for the dividend  but at a 2 5  yield  you could invest in other companies and not only earn a higher dividend  but also invest in companies that are going somewhere in terms of growing revenues and earnings per share

115699,337214,APD,Chemicals Industry Stock Outlook   November 2017,opinion,"The chemical industry is back on the growth path after being roiled by the global economic crisis  The highly cyclical industry has enjoyed a positive run this year  helped by an upswing in the world economy and continued strength across major end use markets such as Construction  Automotive and Electronics  
The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has outperformed the broader market year to date  The industry returned around 26  over the same time frame  while the S P 500 index advanced roughly 16 1   
The September quarter earnings season is on its last leg  with most of the companies in the chemical space having already unveiled their quarterly numbers  We note that a number of companies in the space including prominent names such as Eastman Chemical Company  NYSE EMN   EMN   Celanese Corporation  CE  and Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD   Inc   APD   produced earnings beats in the quarter  The outperformance was supported by solid demand across major end markets as well as strategic measures including productivity improvement  pricing actions  portfolio restructuring and earnings accretive acquisitions  
Chemical companies continue to switch their focus on attractive growth markets in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand  Moreover  they remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify their business  enhance operational scale and perk up growth  
Cost cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to continue to yield industry wide margin improvements  A number of chemical makers are also taking appropriate pricing actions in the wake of a sharp rise in raw material costs  
Chemical makers also continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors    major chemical end use markets  The automotive sector continues its good run  supported by an improving job market  rising personal income  improved consumer confidence and attractive financing options  
A recovery across housing and commercial construction markets has been another tailwind for the chemical industry  The underlying trends in the housing space remain healthy  backed by steady buyer demand  low mortgage rates  rising rent costs and easy loan availability 
Another positive is a recovery in demand in the energy space    a key chemical end market that had been out of favor for a while  The recovery has been driven by the recent rebound in crude oil prices  supported by the Saudi led OPEC cartel s compliance with its production cut agreement  declining U S  oil stockpiles as well as the prospects of extended oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers 
Notwithstanding a few headwinds including the lingering impacts of the devastating Hurricane Harvey  the chemical industry s momentum is expected to continue through the balance of 2017  supported by continued strength across key end use markets  an improving global economy and significant shale linked capital investment ",2017-11-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chemicals-industry-stock-outlook--november-2017-200263675,200263675
115702,337217,APD,Chemical Industry On Solid Footing  Stocks Worth A Look,opinion,"The chemical industry is finding traction again after staying down for a while  The industry s upturn is expected to continue on sustained momentum across major end markets 
Notwithstanding a few industry related headwinds  weak demand in agricultural markets and sluggishness in China  there are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul  Let s find out what s supporting the bullish case for chemical stocks 
Shale Boom  Driving Force for Chemical investment
The shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country  According to the American Chemistry Council  ACC   the United States has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas  New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  are boosting shale production  bringing down prices of ethane  derived from shale gas  in the process 
The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way  Per the ACC  310 new chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth around  185 billion that are under construction or planned  Such investments    many backed by Federal government support    are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years 
Rebound in Construction
A recovery across housing and commercial construction    major chemical end markets    has been another supporting factor for the chemical industry recovery  After being hit hard in the recession  the construction sector has bounced back on the back of strong housing fundamentals 
Demand in the U S  homebuilding industry remains strong and is expected to continue in the rest of 2017 and next year  Strong employment  rising income  increasing interest from first time homebuyers  low inventory of new and existing homes and post hurricane rebuilding efforts are among the factors that should support continued growth in housing demand 
The renewal of long stalled construction projects and long awaited access to credit from lending institutions has also helped invigorate the commercial construction sector  The U S  Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an economic indicator that provides a roughly nine to 12 month glimpse into the future of non residential construction spending activity  has been above 50  a reading above 50 indicates an increase in billings  for most part of this year  indicating growth in architectural activity  The American Institute of Architects  AIA  expects non residential construction spending to go up 3 8  in 2017 and 3 6  in 2018 
Positives such as an improving economy  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the construction sector s performance 
A Resilient Automotive Sector
Chemical makers continue to see healthy demand from the automotive sector    a major end use market  The last two years have been exceptional for the auto sector  Sales in the United States saw record highs in both years  while sales in China and Europe also gained strength 
According to IHS Markit  global light vehicle sales are expected to increase 1 5  year over year to 93 5 million units in 2017  Moreover  IHS Markit sees U S  light vehicle sales to reach 17 4 million units in 2017    a slight moderation from the 2016 level of 17 5 million units  but still looks poised for another strong year 
Low interest rates  favorable financing and cheap oil have also backed a recovery in the European auto market  The auto industry in Asian countries  especially China  is also expected to thrive over the next several years  This augurs well for chemical demand in this important end market 
A Resurgent European Economy
Eurozone s economic recovery continues apace  as evident from recent upbeat economic data  The region s recovery is backed by declining unemployment and strengthening business and consumer confidence  The European chemical industry has also swung back to life on the back of a rebounding Eurozone economy 
The Eurozone GDP rose 0 6  in the third quarter of 2017  according to Eurostat data  on a quarter over quarter basis  coming above the consensus estimate of 0 5   The euro area unemployment rate also fell to its lowest level in almost nine years  Notably  the French economy  the bloc s second largest economy  grew at an annual rate of 2 2   the strongest pace since 2011  on the back of consumer spending and business investment 
While political risks may still remain a drag  the Eurozone economy is poised for a strong 2017  The European Commission  in its spring 2017 forecast  said that it expects the Eurozone to grow 1 7  in 2017  up from previous estimate of 1 6    followed by 1 8  in 2018 
Recovery in Energy Space 
A rebound in crude oil prices has led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space  an important end use market  Oil prices have been steadily recovering from their historic lows  currently trading above the important psychological level of  50 a barrel  The commodity has risen roughly 30  since sinking to a ten month low of  42 a barrel in late June 2017 in the face of a surging U S  oil output  Oil prices also recently soared to their highest level in more than two years 
The rebound in crude prices is backed by the OPEC cartel s compliance with its production cut agreement  slowing production in the United States as well as the prospects of extended oil production cuts by OPEC and other major global producers 
Improving fundamentals in the energy space is expected to support chemical demand moving ahead  Rising crude prices also augur well for chemical prices as they essentially move in tandem with oil prices 
Chemical M A Wave Continues 
Chemical makers remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth  These companies are increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations  The  130 billion mega merger of The Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW  and E I  du Pont de Nemours   Company  DuPont  NYSE DWDP   to create DowDuPont Inc   DWDP     the biggest chemical deal ever    is a huge testimony to these strategic moves 
Other major deals that have taken place in the chemical space in the recent past include China National Chemical Corporation s  43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG  SIX SYNN   Albemarle Corporation s  ALB   6 2 billion buyout of Rockwood Holdings  Inc   Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA s  17 billion acquisition of Sigma Aldrich Corp   and the  66 billion proposed mega merger between Monsanto Company  NYSE MON   MON  and Bayer AG  DE BAYGN  
Strategic Measures to Yield Margin Benefits
Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on high growth markets  driven by megatrends  in an effort to whittle down their exposure on other businesses that are struggling with weak demand and input costs pressure  Moreover  cost cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to yield industry wide margin improvements  Some chemical makers are also disposing non core assets as they shift their focus on high margin businesses 
Moreover  a number of chemical makers are taking pricing actions  reflected by hikes in chemical prices in the recent past  in the wake of a sharp rise in raw materials costs  This is also expected to reap margin benefits moving ahead

115727,337242,APD,Nucor  NUE  To Post Q3 Earnings  Stock Likely To Disappoint ,opinion,Nucor Corporation   NYSE NUE   is set to release third quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 19 The steel giant witnessed its profits surge year over year in second quarter 2017  but its earnings and sales fell short of expectations  Nucor logged a profit of  323 million or  1 00 per share for the second quarter  compared to earnings of  243 6 million or 76 cents it registered a year ago  The figure  however  trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 07 Revenues went up around 22  year over year to  5 174 8 million in the second quarter  but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 307 8 million   Nucor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two  with an average positive surprise of 8 99  Shares of Nucor have declined 4 8  in the last three months  significantly underperforming the  s 6 6  growth   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderLast month  Nucor provided its revised guidance for third quarter 2017 and it expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 75 80 cents per share  This is a decrease from  1 00 per share recorded in the previous quarter and 95 cents it earned a year ago Notably  expected earnings for the third quarter are also lower than the qualitative guidance provided by the company during its second quarter 2017 earnings call in July  Earlier  the company had expected earnings in the third quarter to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first half 2017 Nucor expects a decrease in earnings of the steel mills segment in third quarter 2017 on a sequential comparison basis  Regardless of higher utilization rates at its sheet mills  continued import pressure has not allowed pricing to keep pace with rising input costs during the quarter  Earnings of plate mills unit are also anticipated to be considerably less owing to tepid demand in plate end use markets The company expects profitability of its steel products unit to improve on a sequential basis in the third quarter 2017  but less than what was witnessed a year ago  Non residential construction indicators are showing signs of marginal improvement compared to activity levels in 2016 Moreover  Nucor Steel Louisiana was affected from unexpected outages for most of third quarter 2017  which caused the company to lower its forecasted earnings estimate for the raw materials segment  The unit halted production in late July for repairing materials handling systems and to address other equipment issues   Despite the punitive trade actions in the recent past  in the form of imposition of heavy tariffs on imports   the U S  steel industry still remains under the risk of cheaper imports  Despite the U S  steel industry s low capacity utilization  imports continue to flow into the domestic market due to foreign producers  overcapacity  In the first eight months of 2017

115834,337349,APD,Stocks Snap 3 Day Losing Streak,opinion,"Stocks didn t even come close to making up all of yesterday s sharp losses  but it was nonetheless an encouraging end to a very rough week  Each of the major indices finished slightly on the positive side  which broke a three day losing streak among rising geopolitical concerns  The S P was up 0 13  today to 2441 3  while the Dow inched forward 0 07  to 21858 3  The NASDAQ had the best performance with an advance of 0 64  to 6256 6   There is a strong belief that this market will finish at the highs of the year  As long as North Korea blows over  everything will be fine   said Jeremy in Counterstrike  The war of words between the U S  and North Korea took a heavy toll this week  as each of the indices were down more than 1   It ended up being one of the worst weeks of the year so far  The S P declined 1 4   the Dow was off 1 1  and the NASDAQ slipped 1 5   However  as mentioned yesterday  these tensions knocked the complacency right out of the market and gave the editors plenty of chances to make moves  North Korea may be a problem for a while  but the market continues to be strong  In the highlights section below  you ll see a busy day for the portfolios as the editors took advantage of this new volatility by picking up a number of quality stocks at reduced prices  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Zacks Counterstrike  Jeremy has been waiting  hoping  even begging for some volatility in this boring market for a long time now and he s finally gotten it  This North Korea stuff has the fear rising and this editor buying  On Friday  he added these three positions    Applied Optoelectronics  AAOI   This is a  dead cat bounce play   as shares of this stock have plunged from  100 to  60  However  Kevin isn t expecting AAOI to get back to triple digits  just bounce back to around  74 on short covering  It s a move for some quick profits    ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures ETF  SVXY   The editor does NOT think we are headed to war with North Korea  which means the VIX s recent surge to 17 needs to come down  SVXY is a great way to short the VIX as it retreats to the 12 13 area    Canadian Pacific Railway  CP   Shares have dipped despite beating on EPS and revenue in its last report  It has now moved into a coveted Fibonacci long setup  so Jeremy added it and plans to ride the stock toward its long term target of  173  The portfolio is adding AAOI with a 7  allocation  while SVXY and CP each get 8  allocations  Read the complete commentary for a lot more on these moves  including a look at their charts  Insider Trader  The portfolio swapped out travel companies on Friday  as Tracey sold HGV due basically to a lack of interest for timeshares in the market  She replaced it by adding Summit Hotel Properties  INN   a REIT with 79 upscale hotels that includes brands like Marriott  Hilton and Hyatt  Shares are down more than 15  in the past month following a soft second quarter report  However  the CEO and the EVP   COO obviously feel that the selloff is overdone since they both bought shares of their own company recently  The complete commentary has a lot more info on this new addition  Options Trader  The portfolio s bull call spreads in Dover  DOV  have declined to breakeven due to the market s recent pullback  Kevin still likes the name  but now he needs more time since the Sept options only have about 30 days left before expiration  Therefore  he sold the soon to expire options and added a couple new bull call spreads by buying to open 2 Dec  85 00 Calls AND selling to open 2 Dec  90 00 Calls  With these December options  the portfolio has now extended its chances for profit by an extra 3 months  In addition  Kevin has been looking to add an energy company to the portfolio  and this pullback opened up a great opportunity  He decided to add a couple bull call spreads in Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  by buying to open 2 Jan 85 00 Calls AND selling to open 2 Jan 90 00 Calls  Get more specifics on both of these moves in the full write up  Income Investor  Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  is a leading industrial gases company that recently reported a strong quarterly report  including an earnings beat  a revenue beat and a raised guidance  In addition to all of this  Neena likes that the company is a  dividend aristocrat   which means it has grown dividends for a least 25 straight years  Its dividend yield is currently 2 6   As announced yesterday  the editor added APD to the portfolio on Friday  The full write up has more on this new pick  Stocks Under  10  Like most biotech companies  ImmunoGen  IMGN  isn t profitable at the moment  But what caught Brian Bolan s attention was two straight better than expected quarters and rising earnings estimates  Plus  the stock was down approximately 5  in yesterday s pullback  so the editor got a bit of a bargain when he bought a position early this morning  Make sure to read the editor s full commentary on this new pick  Momentum Trader   Another day  another headlining tweet  but still  no World War 3  After a few tense sessions the market came to its senses a bit today with stocks rebounding a bit to close out the week   It wasn t a banner day by any stretch of the imagination but I ll take it as a victory  Volatility calmed down a bit and may have stopped its forward progression  I m sure after a weekend off that cooler heads will prevail into next week and we can get back to counting money   For the record  I m short WW3  That means I don t expect to see a war breakout here  Yes there is incendiary rhetoric but at the end of the day I believe that s all it really is  Barring a conflict  I expect the market to return to its winning ways as the NASDAQ bounced on the 50 day      Dave Bartosiak Have a Great Weekend

115865,337380,APD,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Dow Chemical  DuPont  Eastman Chemical  Celanese And Air Products,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL  July 25  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Oil   Gas  Part 2  including Dow Chemical  NYSE        DuPont  NYSE DD   NYSE       Eastman Chemical  NYSE        Celanese  NYSE       and Air Products  NYSE       

	Industry  Chemicals  part 1

	Link  

	The chemical industry is getting its mojo back after a long dry spell  The highly cyclical industry is finally finding traction again after bearing the brunt of the global economic crisis 

	The industry got off to a buoyant start to the year with a strong performance in the first quarter  notwithstanding a few headwinds  The March quarter showed strong demand trends for chemicals across key end use markets such as construction  automotive and electronics 

	A host of companies in the space including prominent names  such as Dow Chemical  NYSE         DuPont  NYSE       Eastman Chemical  NYSE         Celanese  NYSE        and Air Products  NYSE         produced earnings beats in the quarter  many benefiting from strong volume gains  The outperformance was driven by solid demand across construction and automotive markets as well as strategic measures including productivity improvement  pricing actions  portfolio restructuring and earnings accretive acquisitions 

	Second quarter earnings season is currently underway  with most of the major chemical players yet to come up with their quarterly numbers as of this write up  The earnings momentum is expected to continue in the June quarter as the fundamental driving factors remain firmly in place 

	The Chemicals industry has also outperformed the broader market year to date  The industry returned around 13  over the same time frame  while the S P 500 index advanced nearly 11  

	Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on attractive  growth markets in an effort to whittle down their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand  The industry is also seeing a pick up in consolidation activities    exhibited by a wide swath of deals in the recent past    as chemical makers are increasingly looking diversify their business and enhance operational scale 

	Moreover  cost cutting measures  including plant closures and headcount reduction  and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to continue to yield industry wide margin improvements 

	Notwithstanding some lingering headwinds  the industry s momentum is expected to continue through the balance of 2017  supported by continued strength across key end use markets  an upswing in the world economy and significant shale linked capital investment 

U S  Chemical Industry Set to Ride High

	The prospects for the U S  chemical industry look bright  The American chemical industry is set for strong growth this year and the next despite several challenges  including a strong dollar  soft export markets and a low oil price environment 

	The American Chemistry Council   ACC    an industry trade group  envisions accelerated growth for the domestic chemical industry on the back of an improving global economy and a surge in shale linked capital investment 

	The ACC  in its year end 2016 outlook  said that it expects national chemical production to rise 3 6  in 2017  further accelerating to 4 8  growth in 2018  The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to expand 4 2  in 2017 on the back of advances in manufacturing and exports  Moreover  production in the specialties chemical segment is expected to pick up pace and rise 3  in 2017 

	The ACC also expects American chemical industry s growth to transcend the nation s overall economic growth in the long haul  It sees domestic chemical sales to cross the  1 trillion milestone by 2020 

	The shale gas boom in the U S  has also been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country and has provided domestic petrochemicals producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts  The shale revolution has made the U S  an attractive investment hotspot and incentivized a number of chemical companies including industry heavyweights such as Dow Chemical to pump in billions of dollars to beef up capacity  The ACC expects domestic chemical industry capital spending to increase at a 7  annual rate through 2021

   Factors to ConsiderLyondellBasell  in its fourth quarter 2016 earnings call  said that the industry outlook for 2017 has improved over the past several months  LyondellBasell believes that its significant investments in its 2016 maintenance programs have favorably placed it for 2017 LyondellBasell continues to benefit from the favorable North American natural gas environment  It should also gain from its ethylene and polyethylene expansion moves  The company is executing its expansion projects to leverage the U S  natural gas liquids  NGLs  advantage LyondellBasell  in Jan 2017  completed the 800 million pounds per year ethylene expansion project at its Corpus Christi  TX facility  The project expands ethylene capacity at the site by 50  to 2 5 billion pounds per year from 1 7 billion pounds per year The conclusion of the expansion at Corpus Christi marks the completion of LyondellBasell s multi year plan to boost annual ethylene capacity in the U S  by 2 billion pounds and is also another key milestone in the company s organic profit generating growth strategy LyondellBasell is also advancing plans to build a world scale plant on the U S  Gulf Coast for producing propylene oxide   PO   and tertiary butyl alcohol   TBA    leveraging the shale gas boom in the region  The new PO TBA facility  considered to be the largest of its kind  will be built in the Houston area  Moreover  the company has decided to build a high density polyethylene   HDPE   plant on the U S  Gulf Coast  The facility  which will have an annual capacity of 1 1 billion pounds  500 000 metric tons   will be the first commercial plant to employ the company s new proprietary Hyperzone PE technology However  LyondellBasell s operations are subject to interruptions including maintenance outages which is affecting its production capacity and results  Planned maintenance on a co product processing unit at the Channelview facility is expected to have a  40 million impact on first quarter 2017 results  Moreover  planned maintenance on the fluid unit at the refinery is expected to impact first quarter results by roughly  80 million LyondellBasell also faces volatility in raw material and energy costs that account for a major portion of its operating costs  The low oil price environment remains a headwind for the company  LyondellBasell has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over a year  The company s shares lost 2 4  during the period while the industry saw a gain of 15 8

Last quarter  the industrial gases giant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0 52   Air Products has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1 86   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Consider
Air Products  industrial gases business in the EMEA region is under pressure from a weak operating environment  Sluggish global economic conditions are likely to continue impacting the demand for the company s productsThe company is also seeing lower volumes in Latin America due to weak demand  Volumes in packaged gases continue to be weak 
Air Products is also exposed to currency headwinds  stemming from weakening of most currencies against the U S  dollar  Unfavorable currency translation weighed on its sales in the third quarter and is expected to remain a headwind in the fourth  The company currently sees currency headwinds of around 20 cents per share for fiscal 2016 
However  Air Products is well positioned to capitalize on the cyclical recovery in its core industrial end markets  The company has built a strong project backlog  These projects are estimated to be accretive to earnings and cash flow as they come on stream over the next few years 
Acquisitions  new business deals and strategic investments are also expected to support the company s results in fiscal 2016  The acquisition of a 67  stake in Chilean industrial gas company  Indura S A  has ushered in substantial growth opportunity for Air Product  placing it as Latin America s second largest industrial gas producer  The acquisition opened up a  1 5 billion opportunity in Latin America  the second highest growth region in the world following Asia Air Products is also keeping a tight control on expenses and undertaking work process improvement initiatives  The company remains on track in delivering on its cost reduction programs  which should support its margins Air Products has wrapped up the separation of its Electronics Materials Division through the spin off of Versum Materials  Inc  Air Products will direct resources to grow its core and stable industrial gases business  These actions  part of the company s strategic five point plan  are expected to enable the company to achieve its goal of becoming the safest and most profitable industrial gas company globally and create shareholder value in the longer term AIR PRODS   CHE Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers

115971,337486,APD,The Week Ahead  Has The  Earnings Recession  Ended ,opinion,"We face a modest week for economic data  While equity markets remain open  bonds will not trade on Monday  Columbus Day   Yom Kippur begins Tuesday at sundown and extends through Wednesday  The punditry  fueled by recent revelations as well as Sunday s debate  will pounce on the election news  With the official start of earnings season on Tuesday and important reports by the end of the week  perhaps we can hope to see a serious market discussion before the week ends  I expect the punditry  eventually  to be asking 
Is the earnings recession over  
Last Week
Last week s news was very good  although there was little reaction in stocks 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted a shift from the gloomy outlook might be improving as some of the current worries were reduced  That was a good guess for an overall theme  There were quite a few  looking ahead  pieces both on TV and in print  The other news   the election  Brexit  and flash crash news was featured on some days  but it is difficult to plan for that 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short  Stocks had a flat week  and stayed within a range of about 1   CNBC breathlessly noted the  triple digit moves  on several occasions  This is a great illustration of making something out of nothing 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective 
Personal Note
The market is at a crucial point  It is not a time for sitting on the fence  Next weekend Mrs  OldProf  hometown Green Bay  and I are headed to visit her family in Wisconsin  so maybe I should say not a time for being a  deer in the headlights   I am planning to write next week  but I can t be sure  Meanwhile  we have a family fight brewing for tomorrow night  with the Presidential debate at the same time as a football game 
Because of the importance  I put extra effort into this week s WTWA edition  and I hope it is helpful  People are sometimes bashful about reaching out to us with questions  Please feel free to get in touch via main at newarc dot com 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
The Good 
Auto sales beat expectations  up 4 7  to an annualized rate of 17 8M   puts this into perspective 

High frequency indicators remain strong  New Deal Democrat does an   which I follow regularly  His latest report shows the strength in both long leading and short term indicators  The concurrent indicators are mixed  Reading this post helps to understand why many using less data are more confused about the market 
A shortage of truck drivers  A  5000 bonus is available  Another among the many small  unremarked indicators which I follow    
Home prices up 6 2  over last year according to the CoreLogic index    
Employment reports were generally positive  
The headline payroll number was slightly positive  including revisions  Bob Dieli s excellent  captures the conclusion widely shared by other top economists    steady as she goes  


Jobless claims dropped to 249K 
Labor participation increased  while the unemployment rate also increased from 4 9  to 5  
The work week moved higher 
Best of all  hourly earnings increased 0 2  over August and 2 6  year over year 
The median duration of unemployment is down to 10 3 weeks    

ISM Non Manufacturing made a big jump to 57 1  almost 6 points higher than last month and four points higher than expectations 
The Bad 
Construction spending fell 0 7   
ADP Private Employment gained only 154K  down from 175K in the prior month and missing expectations  This was worse than the  official  private employment estimate 
Commercial real estate index stumbles   and provides a good update 

The Ugly 
My original plan was the poll showing that over  could not name the Vice Presidential candidates  With the Presidential campaign in a descending spiral and a violent hurricane  my original idea seems lame  There is plenty of ugly news  We can all hope for a better week ahead 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s award goes to Justin Lahart of the Wall Street Journal for his article    The article has an excellent discussion of alternative methodologies  including an alternative profit measure that matched the results quite well until 2008  The Shiller CAPE is widely cited as a justification for not owning stocks  but both Prof  Shiller and his co developer Prof  Harvey do not use it that way themselves  Here is the key conclusion  drawing upon the work of Prof Damodaran the leading expert on corporate valuation 

For New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran  this is the real sticking point  He  to see if there was a way that using the CAPE could boost returns  When the CAPE was high  it put more money into Treasurys and cash  and when it was low it put more into stocks 


He fiddled with it  allowing for different overvaluation and undervaluation thresholds  changing target allocations  And over the past 50 odd years  he couldn t find a single way he could make CAPE beat a simple buy and hold strategy  In the end  he doesn t think it represents an improvement over using conventional PEs to value stocks 


 This is one of the most oversold  overhyped metrics I ve ever seen   says Mr  Damodaran 


Mr  Shiller agrees that the CAPE can t be used as a market timing tool  per se  Rather  he thinks that investors should tilt their portfolios away from individual stocks that have high CAPEs  But he says he isn t ready to modify his CAPE for judging the overall market

The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have a modest week for economic data  with some holiday effects included  While I watch everything on the calendar  you do not need to  Check out WTWA to focus on what is really important   and ignore the noise 
The  A  List 
FOMC minutes  W   Unlikely to provide fresh news  but will still be watched closely 
Michigan sentiment  F   Good read on current employment and spending 
Retail sales  F   Rebound in store 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
PPI  F   Not much is expected  This will not be important until we have a few  hot  months 
Business inventories  F   August data  but relevant for GDP calculations 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
Other news includes the Presidential debate on Sunday night and the start of earnings season  And of course  near daily servings of FedSpeak 
Next Week s Theme 
The revelations surrounding the Presidential election campaign are going to dominate the news cycle  Sunday night s debate will probably fan the flames  With bonds not trading on Monday  stocks will not have that cue  It is possible that these stories will persist  but there is a more important matter  Corporate earnings 
This earnings season could well be a turning point after a long  earnings recession  and a sluggish economy  Stocks have been resilient in the face of bad headlines and seasonal headwinds  Could stronger earnings be the spark for an upside breakout  I expect the pundits to be wondering 
Is this the end of the earnings recession  
There are three basic positions 
Negative   the declining estimates for the quarter and sees parallels to 1987  To be fair  he represents many taking this position  Here is his evidence of the plunging estimates 


Eddy Elfenbein takes a   noting the trend toward lower earnings  He notes that the picture is much better if you exclude energy 
Brian Gilmartin and FactSet see a possible inflection point  Brian has been the first on this story  Here is his latest analysis  While he is always a good read  it is especially important during earnings season  He provides a lot of analysis on specific stocks   that earnings estimate fall before the season begins  but the final returns beat estimates  Their expectation is that the final reports will break the streak of lower earnings 

The Bianco report seems strange  Surely he knows about the lowered bar and beating expectations  His squiggle chart starts in irrelevant territory and excludes the tail that is obvious in every other quarter  It is difficult for most people to see  exhibiting what I call a high coefficient of obfuscation  TM OldProf   Let us see what really happens  Like 1987  Really 
As always  I ll have a few ideas of my own in the conclusion

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be JP Morgan s wonderful quarterly   Budget fifteen or twenty minutes to page through this carefully  My guess is that you will lose track of time as you enjoy the objective presentation of data  While it is difficult to find favorites  here are two that can have the biggest payoff for investors 
First  do not expect stocks to fall as rates move higher  As long as the starting yield is low  increased rates are associated with better earnings  a better economy  and higher stock prices 

And second  interest rates at the long end are not all about the Fed  Inflation is the key for the ten year note  The Fed controls the short end  Look at the evidence 

Stock Ideas 
When you read Chuck Carnevale s articles  prepare for a stock idea combined with a great lesson  I am amazed at how well he does this  week after week  Following up on his analysis of Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED   he uses the same techniques on Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Even if you are not one of the many investors who own these stocks  you will learn a great deal from Chuck s process 
Our newest trading model  Holmes  has joined our other models in a weekly market discussion  Each one has a different  personality  and I get to be the human doing fundamental analysis  We have an enjoyable discussion every week  with four or five specific ideas that we are also buying  This week Holmes likes Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD   Check out the post to see the other picks  ask questions  and choose your favorite model 
While we cannot verify the suitability of specific stocks for everyone who is a reader  the ideas have worked well so far  My hope is that it will be a good starting point for your own research  Holmes may exit a position at any time  If you want more information about the exits  just sign up via holmes at newarc dot com  You will get an email update whenever we sell an announced position 
Tech assumes the sector leadership  Jim Picerno has the story 
Energy seems to have stabilized in the range I identified a couple of months ago   the OPEC deal has provided a floor  This is important as a place for picking up a few beaten down names as well as the implications for the overall market  I am doing more research on this topic 
Personal Finance 
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read AR every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  There are always several great choices worth reading  My personal favorite this week is Jonathan Clements   MarketWatch  warning about seven key mistakes  Read them all  but here is a sample 

1  Stocks are risky 


Reality  Sure  they re risky  But the implication   that other investments are less risky   simply isn t correct  Bonds and cash investments may not offer the rollercoaster ride that you get with stocks  But they leave you vulnerable to inflation  which is arguably an even bigger threat 

Gil Weinreich had  in his series that explores the intersection between clients and advisors  He includes a description of the qualities that an advisor needs 

The ability to listen  question and analyze  professional knowledge and core beliefs  knowledge of what one doesn t know  or what is unknowable  a positive attitude  peer relationships that would allow the advisor to test the value of his ideas or seek needed advisor  a propensity to share knowledge with others  discipline  sense of responsibility  and sensitivity to others  pain 

This may seem simple and obvious  but it is very strong and helpful  Many investors ask the wrong questions and many advisors just try to maximize fees with high profit products 
Morgan Housel has   explaining why good advice is important

Final Thoughts 
To many investors it may seem like nothing is happening  If you follow our indicators you will see significant changes  Stocks are both safer and more promising and there are signs of sector rotation  What do you think will happen when those invested in bond funds learn that the values do not always rise 
If the  earnings recession  ends  that will accelerate the current change in tone  We all know that seasonality improves as the year nears its end  but no one has a good explanation  Here is my hypothesis 
Market participants start thinking in terms of a multiple of the next year s earnings  
I know it seems silly  but just watch those commenting or writing  You will see it  They will begin to describe stocks of interest in terms of multiples of 2017 earnings 
They will not mention Dr  Shiller s method of looking at historical earnings  They certainly will not discuss Tobin s Q   Imagine  Well  Joe  we analyzed the replacement value for Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and found it to be vastly overvalued  We could replace their buildings  their fleet  and their workforce for 15  of their market cap   Or Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   or Facebook  NASDAQ FB   or IBM  NYSE IBM   or Accenture  or any non manufacturing company  I have never seen Tobin s Q cited in the context of valuing a specific stock 
My own method is a constant revision of estimates using a slightly modified CAPE approach to get my own expected multiple  Since I am always looking twelve months ahead  the calendar changes are not important  This is why tracking forward earnings is so important  In particular  we have an opportunity to look for stocks with improving outlooks matching the improving economy

Their methods are excellent  as you will learn if you follow us for a few weeks  The entire group had a winning call on energy three weeks ago  without any from the fundamentals

That is the ongoing debate at the Stock Exchange 
This Week s Ideas 
Our technical experts have varying ideas this week  As usual  I am skeptical  but let us give each of them a chance 
Felix
I look for long term themes  and I have a great one this week  I see a great chart for Banco Bradesco  NYSE BBD   The YTD is strong and steady  Brazil is as tumultuous as ever  except this time they might be improving their banking system 
 Jeff  How do you know about bank reform  Have you been fraternizing with those foreign models again 
 Felix  Would you believe it is just a conclusion from the chart 
 Jeff  Also  the CEO is under indictment for tax fraud 
 Felix  The chart tells you that the company and the market have moved past that issue  Take a look 

 Felix  I also had more questions for this week s post  I thank my fans  and I am happy to answer 
 of SeekingAlpha asks 

I ve wrestled myself to a draw regarding my 4 5 year position in RDS B  i e   I can make about equally strong bull and bear arguments   I m asking how your models and yourself view it 

As usual  I answered through Jeff Miller  who could not resist adding his own comment 

RDS B in the top half of our 700 stock universe  I think there are better energy plays right now  I ll write something more on that when I have finished some research 

Another question from Seeking Alpha s  

Jeff   Love your work  Since you asked for questions about specific stocks or sectors I d like to throw a question out to you  and Felix  since you describe him as an investor who thinks long term  about Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  
WFC is technically breaking down while at the same time the bank sector looks like it might be entering an uptrend  I know you ve liked the Bank sector right along  so what would you say to a long term holder about continuing to hold WFC for the long term 

Jeff Miller and I responded 
Felix does not like WFC at all  We own it as part of our enhanced yield program  which means dividends and writing calls against the position  For long term investing I prefer regional banks like STI 
Thanks for the kind words and for joining in our discussion 
 Felix  Please keep your questions coming  I could use the overtime pay 
Oscar
It s been a tough month for Odell Beckham Jr  In a stark contrast to last year s superstar performance  he s slumped his way through the first 4 weeks of the NFL season without a single touchdown  However  sharp eyed analysts see Sunday night s matchup against the Green Bay Packers as a chance to get back on track 
What we re really talking about here  of course  is mean reversion  When you have a promising player who is underperforming  you don t expect them to flame out entirely  You re looking for the big comeback game 
 Jeff  Do you have some stock advice here 
 Oscar  Of course  I was just explaining how you should look at stocks  Take a look at the Guggenheim Solar ETF  NYSE TAN   It s been a rough year to be sure  but I can t possibly imagine this sector limping along at  20 indefinitely 

First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  is one of the key holdings in TAN as well as in our custom sector basket  It is a great example  We re starting to see rebounds here after a possibly overdone correction in early August  I m expecting to see significant gains over the next 4 week period 

 Jeff  Your pick this week is also attracting some fundamental analysts who calls FSLR a  unique value and growth play  
 Oscar  What does he think about the Cubs 
 Jeff  You are incorrigible  Let s see what Holmes has for us this week 
Holmes
Oscar is looking for a rebound in his pick  but I am the rebounding specialist  Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  came of its recent high of 145 72  and went straight down 7 straight sessions before bottoming and starting a nice little zig zag run up and to the right  That is a stock with rebound potential  I would look for this stock to get back to its highs with a downside stop at 133 75 

 Jeff  it is a bit over valued  but it does have a 2 5  yield  To get the rebound you expect you will need yield seekers who are not that sensitive to valuation 
 Holmes  There are plenty of those folks around 
Athena
I have a great choice this week  Advance Auto Parts  NYSE AAP   This one s been in the doghouse following an 18  drop last November  but I m predicting an upside here 

 Jeff  Even after the drop  the stock is still overvalued by 30  or so according to Chuck Carnevale s  
 Athena  I am sure that Mr  Carnevale is very nice  but my wisdom has been accurate for many centuries 
 Jeff  It might be a bit out of date  I have been looking for some guests to help keep this group in line  Perhaps we can persuade him to visit 
 Athena  That would be fine  I am always willing to share my wisdom 
Questions

Cast of Characters
Felix is fussy  precise  and very cautious  He looks for what is working  but it also must have upside potential  He is an investor who thinks long term  Felix will not usually announce new picks  but he will answer questions  saying what he thinks about specific stocks  He will also comment on favorite themes and sectors 
Oscar is naturally optimistic and a bit excitable  He definitely likes to go with winners  and focuses on a one month time frame  He trades either sector ETFs  or a basket of stocks  equally weighted  that reflect a sector  Oscar will mention a favorite sector each week  and will also answer questions about sectors 
Holmes is a trader  but a cautious one  Holmes emphasizes asset protection through profit taking  stops  and trailing stops  He is careful in selecting new positions  and generally looks at an intermediate time frame  While he does not know the definition of  mean reversion  he loves rebounds  There is no set holding period  but two or three months is not unusual  Holmes will tell us one stock recommended that week  For those who sign up for his email list  no charge  privacy respected  holmes at newarc dot com  he will report exits with a one day delay 
Athena trades more frequently than the others  but still limits risk  Her inspiration helps to find good ideas  Her excellent quant skills find attractive risk reward opportunities  Her wisdom leads her to exit trades that are not working  Athena will provide a new idea each week 
Jeff usually has some comments about stock or market fundamentals  Unlike the other witty participants  he sounds like an old prof

116010,337525,APD,Air Products  APD  Q3 Earnings  Will The Stock Surprise ,opinion,"Air Products   Chemicals  Inc    NYSE APD   is set to release third quarter fiscal 2016 results  ahead of the bell on Jul 28 
Last quarter  the industrial gases giant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 11   Air Products has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2 84   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Consider
Air Products surpassed earnings expectations in second quarter fiscal 2016  ended Mar 31  2016   backed by its restructuring and self help actions  However  its sales fell year over year and lagged expectations 
The company expects earnings from continuing operations for third quarter fiscal 2016 to be in the range of  1 87  1 92 per share  up 13  16  from the prior year quarter  It also raised its earnings guidance for fiscal 2016 to the band of  7 40  7 55 per share from the earlier view of  7 25  7 50 
Given its leading position in the gases business  Air Products is well positioned to capitalize on the cyclical recovery in its core industrial end markets  The company has built a strong project backlog  These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow as they come on stream over the next few years 
Acquisitions and new business wins are expected to continue to drive the company s results  Air Products is also keeping a tight control on SG A expenses and undertaking work process improvement initiatives  The company is making a good progress with its  600 million cost cutting program and has already achieved  300 million of cost savings 
However  sluggish global economic conditions may continue to hurt demand for the company s products  Challenging conditions in Europe are expected to keep industrial gases volumes under pressure in the region  Moreover  Air Products generates a considerable amount of revenues outside the U S   and is therefore  remains exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations AIR PRODS   CHE Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Air Products is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Air Products is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 91  The company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Zacks Rank  Air Products carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies in the basic materials sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

116013,337528,APD,Factors Supporting The Bullish Case For Chemical Stocks,opinion,"The chemical industry remains besieged by a number of challenges  including weak demand in agricultural and energy markets  a sluggish Chinese economy and headwinds from a strong dollar  Nevertheless  the industry remains on the road to recovery  gaining from healthy momentum across automotive and construction markets  There are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul  which we have highlighted below 
Shale Abundance Driving Chemical Spending
The shale gas revolution in the U S  has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country  According to the American Chemistry Council  ACC   the U S  has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas  New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  are boosting shale production  bringing down prices of ethane  derived from shale gas  in the process 
Driven by the abundant natural gas supply  chemical makers are ratcheting up investment on shale gas linked projects which is expected to beef up capacity  The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the U S  to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way 
Per ACC  domestic chemical investment related to shale gas has reached as high as  164 billion  more than 60  of which are from firms outside the U S  Already 264 projects    many backed by the Federal government    have been announced by chemical makers to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies with 40  of them already complete or under construction  Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years  The ACC expects average annual gains of more than 8  in U S  chemical industry capital spending through 2018 
Automotive in High Gear
The automotive sector    a major chemical end use market    is witnessing significant momentum  The sector is enjoying the fruits of low gasoline prices  Outlook paints a rosy picture as global automotive sales are expected to rise 2 7  to 89 8 million units in 2016 on the back of strong volume growth in the U S  and Europe  according to IHS Automotive 
The U S  auto industry also remains in top gear  U S  light vehicles  a key end user market for chemicals  sales hit all time high of around 17 5 million units in 2015 and are expected to rise further this year  aided by an improving job market  rising personal income  lower fuel prices and attractive financing options  New car and light truck sales are expected to reach to 17 7 million units in 2016 on the back of reduced gasoline prices and rising employment  as per The National Automobile Dealers Association  NADA  estimates 
The Auto industry in Asian countries  especially China  is also expected to thrive over the next several years  As such  chemical makers are expected to gain from higher demand from this important end market 
Strategic Moves
Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on high growth markets  driven by megatrends  in an effort to whittle down their exposure on other businesses that are struggling with weak demand and input costs pressure  Moreover  cost cutting measures    including plant closures and headcount reduction    and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to yield industry wide margin improvements  Several chemical makers are also disposing non core assets as they shift their focus on high margin businesses 
Consolidations Gathering Steam
Chemical makers remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth in a still difficult global economic environment  These companies continue to explore growth opportunities in the fast growing emerging markets  particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America  The industry saw a pick up in consolidation activities in 2014 and the momentum continued in 2015 
Chemical companies are increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations  The  130 billion proposed mega merger of Dow Chemical  DOW  and DuPont  NYSE DD   DD     the biggest chemical deal ever    is a huge testimony to these strategic moves 
Other major deals that have taken place in the chemical space in the recent past include Albemarle Corp  s  ALB   6 2 billion buyout of Rockwood Holdings  Inc   Eastman Chemical Company s  EMN  purchase of specialty chemical company Taminco Corp  for  2 8 billion  PPG Industries Inc  NYSE PPG   s  PPG  acquisition of Mexican paint company Comex  Olin Corp  s  OLN  acquisition of a significant portion of Dow Chemical s chlorine business for  5 billion  Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA s  17 billion acquisition of Sigma Aldrich and FMC Corp  NYSE FMC   s  FMC  acquisition of Cheminova A S 
Construction Sector Gaining Momentum 
A recovery across housing and commercial construction    major chemical end markets    has been another tailwind for the chemical industry  After being hit hard in the recession  the construction sector has recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals 
The U S  housing sector saw steady recovery in 2015 backed by stabilizing mortgage rates  improving job market and moderating home prices  and the momentum continues this year  The underlying demand trends in the housing space remain strong  supported by an improving employment levels  affordable interest mortgage rates  rising consumer confidence and a recovering economy 
Recent housing data has been fairly upbeat with reports of higher sales of new single family houses coupled with mid single digit growth in housing starts  Moreover  the home remodeling market is also picking up pace 
The renewal of long stalled construction projects and long awaited access to credit from lending institutions has also helped invigorate the commercial construction sector  U S  architecture firm billings continue to rise  The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an indicator that offers a glimpse into the future of U S  non residential construction spending activity  clocked 50 6 in April 2016  a reading above 50 indicates an increase in billings  
Moreover  the American Institute of Architects  AIA  expects healthy growth in non residential construction spending this year based on strong demand for hotels  office space  manufacturing facilities and amusement and recreation spaces  The AIA sees spending to go up 8 3  in 2016  This augurs well for demand for chemicals in the construction markets 
Wrapping Up
As you can see from the above mentioned factors  there are a few good reasons to be optimistic about the chemical industry  Chemical stocks that are well placed in the current operating backdrop include DuPont  FMC Corp   Air Products and Chemicals Inc  NYSE APD    APD   The Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW   PPG Industries Inc  and Celanese Corp   CE

116056,337571,APD,Air Products  Spin off Headquarters In Tempe,opinion,"Air Products and Chemicals   NYSE APD   has taken another step towards the separation of its Materials Technologies  Electronic Materials Division   EMD    which will become Versum Materials  The company announced that the standalone company  Versum Materials  will be headquartered at Tempe  AZ  
Co locating Versum Materials  headquarters near its customer companies is in accordance with Air Products  strategy of getting closer to the consumer market through the spin off  The company already has a manufacturing and research and development facility as well as a workforce in Tempe for the Electronic Materials Division  Considering growth in Asia  where over 70  of the market exists  the company also intends to maintain better connectivity with the Asian team and customers  which is likely to improve from the new location 
Although Air Products has decided to move the headquarters for Versum Materials   the administrative work will continue to be carried out from Allentown  PA   the company s current headquarter  Management intends to fully utilize the experience and knowledge of the existing employees in the administrative departments  Thus  the new company will have a significant presence at both locations 
Air Products looks forward to complete the spin off by Sep 2016 and has made several other announcements regarding the new company  The research and development units for the company will be located at Tempe  Taiwan  Korea and Hometown  PA

116081,337596,APD,Fed Creating Dividend Stock Valuation Extreme,opinion,"On Wednesday  a journalist asked Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen an important question  Could she give any assurances to savers who think the Fed is never going to raise short term interest rates 
Chair Yellen  almost grinning  answered   I can t give an ironclad promise  
She went on to say that the appropriate conditions for a rate increase should be in place later this year  but stressed throughout the press conference that the pace of rate increases would be slow 
But after 52 consecutive regularly scheduled Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meetings without a rate hike  do we really need promises that the Fed will move at a glacial pace 
Basically  the markets are still being coddled  That s a problem  because the incessant easy money policies are creating massive distortions  For instance  I m seeing some dividend paying stocks trading at ludicrous valuation multiples 
Air Products and Chemicals Inc  NYSE APD  is a prime example 
APD s  multiple has eclipsed 16x this year  and its price to sales ratio has risen above 3 0x  For comparison s sake  the median EV EBITDA multiple in the S P 500 is 12 2x  and the median P S is 2 2x 
As you can see below  APD s valuation has risen to its highest level in the past 10 years 

But no one really cares about valuation in this low rate environment  as long as a company has a long history of raising its dividend payment 
Air Products  for instance  has increased its dividend for 33 consecutive years  making it a Dividend Aristocrat and a constituent of the SPDR S P Dividend  NYSE SDY   APD is also a holding in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation  NYSE VIG   the largest dividend ETF 
Clearly  APD has benefited from dividend ETF inflows over the past few years  A high valuation is the quantitative manifestation of popularity  and  therefore  we know that APD has become exceptionally popular 
However  APD s 2 2  dividend yield could hardly be considered high yield  And its dividend growth is lackluster  The latest dividend hike was only 5   compared with 8  and 11  in 2014 and 2013  respectively 
Making matters worse  Air Products  free cash flow  operating cash flow minus capital expenditures  has been insufficient to cover its dividend payments the past couple of years 
Again  investors don t seem to care because incessant Fed stimulus has helped make the cost of debt capital so cheap that virtually all dividends have become sustainable  unless there s a serious problem at a company 
The longer zero interest rate policy  ZIRP  goes on  the more complacent investors will become  and the more unassailable consistent dividend raisers become in their minds 
We need to be vigilant and stay away from uber expensive dividend payers such as APD   they offer neither safety nor the likelihood of outperformance

116083,337598,APD,Profit From Helium s Price Ascent,opinion,"When you think of helium  you may envision buying a bunch of balloons for a party  or uttering something in a goofy  high pitched voice  or perhaps pointing out an occasional blimp hovering overhead 

What you might not know is that while helium is the second most abundant gas in the universe  behind    on Earth  it s considered a rare element 

You see  even though most natural gas contains traces of helium  it s unusual to find it in concentrations that are commercially viable to extract  capture  and store 

The gas has proven to be essential in military  medical  and industrial applications  all of which far exceed its use as a lifting medium  And it s in high demand all over the world 

Now  there are plenty of known reserves on the Moon  but supplies of helium on Earth will last only another 25 years or so 

The United States had the foresight to start storing helium back in the 1920s  but changing policies are inflating prices for this sought after element 

Highly Useful

Helium is one of the most unique elements on the periodic table  there s simply nothing else like it  It has the lowest boiling point of any other element and won t solidify or freeze  even at temperatures near absolute zero  In fact  helium is the most important element in understanding super cold conditions 

Furthermore  its inert properties  meaning that it doesn t react to other elements or chemicals  make it the only gas that can pressurize and purge the liquid engines of super colliders and even rockets 

Helium is also fantastically light  but it won t explode like other gases  such as hydrogen  The Hindenburg most likely wouldn t have exploded in 1937 had it been filled with helium instead of hydrogen 

Helium is also useful as a liquid coolant for superconducting magnets like those used in magnetic resonance imaging  or MRI  machines  Its inertness makes it useful as a shielding agent in arc welding  And it prevents contamination with oxygen in air  making it pertinent in semiconductor and fiber optic manufacturing 

Helium can also replace nitrogen in deep water diving to help prevent  the bends   It supports nuclear reactors  helps some newborn babies breathe  and is good at preserving historical documents 

But  there are still some challenges that come with this miracle gas 

The Balloon Toss

Storing what s left of the helium we have  a gas that s lighter than air  is difficult 

To deal with this problem  the U S  government mandated the creation of the 1921 Federal Helium Reserve  a long term storage facility for unrefined helium  The first helium production plant established the beginning of a formal U S  program to create a domestic source  whereby the government became the helium buyer of last resort  But with the government controlling the market  the business of helium wasn t a lucrative one  and thus didn t attract entrants 

The 1966 Helium Privatization Act set a price for the share of helium in the government reserve and mandated that government entities using helium had to purchase the gas from the stockpile  The price was fixed at  43 per 1 000 cubic feet  25  above the market price  with the logic being that government entities would purchase from the stockpile and that such pricing would recoup the outstanding debt from helium operations 

The controversy surrounding the price ceiling encouraged the government to raise the price to  64 75 in 2010   75 00 in 2011  and  75 75 for the 2012 fiscal year 

The 1996 Act also dictated that the Government would sell off all of its helium reserves by 2015 to retire its debt  which was frozen in 1996 as a result of the Act  Thus  the government has been selling off its helium stockpile over the past two decades  at Congress  insistence 

Then  last year  an auction of helium from the national reserve outside of Amarillo  Texas didn t go as expected 

Popping the Government Bubble

A number of problems were addressed on July 8 at a meeting of the House committee s National Research Council  which invited dissatisfied participants to comment  Many felt that the government made a lot of money at the sale because auction winners were able to afford higher prices as they had special access to the reserve via pipeline 

Complaints focused on the industry s hierarchical distribution system  which supported deliveries based on such factors as how a given customer plans to use the gas as well as the depth of their pockets 

Helium s supply is rationed when periodic shortages occur  Military and medical users sit at the top of the priority list  as do large consumers with long term  fixed contracts  Meanwhile  mom and pop retailers can t blow up their balloons 

Up  Up  and Away

At this stage  it s tricky to determine an actual fair price for helium  What we do know is that helium is both limited and irreplaceable 

With the U S  government s diminishing role in helium production  industrial gas companies have continuously raised retail helium prices  even though demand continues to rise globally 

It makes one wonder  with no market driven mechanism being used to establish the price of helium  what would it be without government influence  Industry experts say is could be double or triple the current price 

The result of the hearing was that the committee recommended that  the Bureau of Land Management  BLM  should adopt policies that open its crude helium sales to a broader array of buyers and make the process for establishing the selling price of crude helium from the Federal Reserve more transparent  

In the meantime  there are some opportunities for investors 

Get a Lift

Because helium is hard to obtain  transport  and store  there are only a limited number of companies and countries involved in its production  Currently  the United States is the largest global producer of helium 

Although new helium extraction purification plants have come online in countries such as Australia  Poland  Russia  Qatar  and Algeria  they still aren t able to meet their own demand  and continue to rely on U S  imports 

Unlike other commodities  there s no futures market on which helium is traded  But there are opportunities in the equity space with companies that extract  process  and sell helium 

All helium consumed today is extracted from natural gas streams where concentrations are high enough to economically separate  Practically all the helium found in the earth derives from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium rich minerals 

As such  it pays to look for companies with knowledge in oil exploration and production  geochemical analysis  and field experience 

The biggest players do more than just sell helium  Air Products and Chemicals Inc  NYSE APD  is the world s largest supplier  Others include Praxair  NYSE PX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   which  along with BP  LONDON BP   have taken a beating from the fall in crude oil prices this year  BP also fell this week when it missed profit estimates due to its Libyan write offs 

There are also a number of smaller players  including The Linde Group    and Pioneer Natural Resources Company  NYSE PXD  

Bottom line  Helium is a vital element that s quickly disappearing  While we aren t going to run out of helium as an element  we re still unlikely to uncover a hidden cache that will force prices lower

116084,337599,APD,APD  Distributing Higher Dividends For 38 Years,opinion,"Air Products  N APD  has rewarded shareholders with 38 consecutive years of dividend increases and is in the process of spinning off a non core business to create further value 
This industrial gas business shares many competitive advantages with other stocks we own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  but is now the time to buy it Business OverviewAPD was founded in 1940 and has grown to be a world leading industrial gas company  APD provides atmospheric and process gases and related equipment to manufacturing markets  including refining and petrochemical  metals  electronics  and food and beverage  The business is also very international   sales in North America accounted for just 42  of APD s total revenue last year 
The company is in the process of spinning off its Materials Technologies business by September 2016  This business accounted for 21  of APD s sales last year and serves the semiconductor  polyurethanes  cleaning and coatings  and adhesives industries  After the spin off  APD will be focused completely on industrial gases Business AnalysisIndustrial gases are a commodity  which means that the lowest cost provider usually wins out  However  as we noted in our analysis of Praxair  N PX   industrial gas providers actually have strong moats in their areas of service 
Gases are hard to ship  For example  liquid oxygen put in a tanker will evaporate after 200 miles  As a result  industrial gas is a local business with competition limited to a radius no greater than a couple hundred miles 
Furthermore  APD has long term contracts and relationships with many customers  making it challenging for new entrants to crack into its markets  Start up costs are also very high  large manufacturing plants take around three years to construct   and there are many technical regulations that must be complied with 
Industrial gas companies are also attractive businesses because most of their products use a very cheap raw material   air  Even better  gas typically accounts for just a small portion of a customer s total manufacturing costs and is a non discretionary expense  creating pricing power for APD  The industry is also characterized by a very slow pace of change  resulting in less risk of disruption 
APD is also taking self help measures to improve its operations  in large part driven by pressure from an activist investor in 2013 and a new CEO starting in 2014  The company launched a strategic Five Point Plan two years ago that is intended to help it achieve its stated goal of being the most profitable industrial gas company in the world 
The plan s key points are to focus on the core industrial gas business  APD is spinning off its Materials Technologies business   restructure the company  APD embarked on its largest organizational restructuring ever last year   improve the company s culture  better control capital and costs  APD targets  300 million in operational cost savings over the next four years   and create better incentive systems at the business unit level 
APD s actions are working   the company recently reported its highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years  However  the company still has several risks to consider Air Products  Key RisksAPD s business is sensitive to the economy  When global economic growth slows and commodity prices drop  fewer metals need to be manufactured  demand for chemicals drops  and gas and oil refining activity slows 
APD is also the world s largest supplier of hydrogen gases  which accounted for about 20  of sales last year and will be closer to 25  of total revenue after the Materials Technologies spin off is completed  Hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels  The plunge in oil prices will likely have some impact on APD s hydrogen business 
With the majority of its sales taking place overseas  APD s near term results are also impacted by currency fluctuations  Altogether  the risk is that many of the growth drivers for industrial gases are heading the wrong way and could persist for quite some time 
If growth prospects remain low  bidding for incremental projects could intensify  If conditions became really bad  some customers in industries plagued by excess capacity could see their credit conditions deteriorate 
If some customers cancel projects or are unable to make full payments to APD  the company could run into some cash flow problems because of its low cash balance   279 million  relative to its debt on hand   4 3 billion  and dividend commitments  about  700 million   This is a very low probability type of risk  but it shows the potential dangers of a highly geared balance sheet Dividend Analysis  Air ProductsWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
APD has a Dividend Safety Score of 45  which suggests that its dividend safety is about average  The company s earnings and free cash flow payout ratios are reasonable at 54  and 64   respectively  As seen below  APD s earnings payout ratio has increased by about 10  over the last decade but has generally remained stable 
However  we can see that its payout ratio spiked up in 2009  highlighting the cyclicality of the business  We would prefer APD s payout ratio remain below 50  because of its sensitivity to the economy  but its situation could be much worse Source  Simply Safe Dividends
APD s sales fell by 21  in 2009  and its free cash flow per share plunged by more than 50   The company is obviously not resistant to recessions  and its stock returned a very disappointing  48  in 2008  This sensitivity lowers APD s Dividend Safety Score Source  Simply Safe Dividends
However  regardless of business conditions  we can see that APD has generated very reliable returns on invested capital  Management claims that every capital investment of more than  3 million is reviewed at the corporate level and must meet a strict 10  internal rate of return  The company appears to be allocating capital reasonably effectively Source  Simply Safe Dividends
APD has generated free cash flow every year  which is great  but it s been volatile  This is because the projects APD invests in are very expensive and lumpy   they take years to build before generating any meaningful amount of cash flow  We expect free cash flow to keep trending higher as the company s productivity improvements are made Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Reviewing APD s balance sheet is very important given the company s cyclicality  APD says it is committed to maintaining a balance sheet that deserves an A credit rating  but it has more debt than we like to see  The company will use some of the proceeds from the Materials Technologies spin off to reduce debt Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  APD s Dividend Safety Score is only about average because of the company s cyclicality  high debt  and relatively high payout ratios  by our standards for a cyclical business  Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
APD has increased its dividend for 38 straight years and is a dividend aristocrat  The company has a Dividend Growth Score of 56  which suggests its dividend growth potential is about average 
It s uncertain how APD s current dividend will be split between its Materials Technologies spin off and its industrial gases business  However  management has stated that the total amount of dividends will be the same and that the company will continue targeting a 2 5  to 3  yield 
As seen below  APD s dividend has grown at a high single digit rate over the last decade  although growth has slowed into the mid single digits more recently  Until we have more clarity on the spin off s impact on the dividend  we expect no more than a mid single digit growth rate going forward Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationAPD trades at 18x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 2 5   which is slightly lower than its five year average of 2 7  
We believe this business can compound its earnings by 5 7  per year over the long term  resulting in a potential total return of 8 10  per year 
However  at 18x earnings and a dividend yield somewhat below its five year average  we believe the stock is at least fairly valued today  We would be more interested in owning it below  120 per share ConclusionAPD is a durable business with numerous competitive advantages  We would be interested in owning this blue chip dividend stock at a better price  which would potentially be caused by a continued slowdown in global growth prospects ",2016-02-10,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/apd:-distributing-higher-dividends-for-38-years-384120,384120
116088,337603,APD,DuPont  DD   Can Q1 Earnings Pull a Surprise Amid Headwinds ,opinion,DuPont   NYSE DD   is set to release its first quarter 2016 results ahead of the bell on Apr 26 The Delaware based company swung to a loss in fourth quarter 2015 on weak results in its agriculture business  unfavorable currency swings and charges related to restructuring actions  Adjusted earnings for the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues declined year over year on lower sales across all businesses  and missed expectations Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement  Factors to Watch ForDuPont  in its last earnings call  said that it expects operating earnings of  2 95 to  3 10 per share for 2016  It includes expected benefit of  0 64 per share from the company s 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan DuPont expects sales growth to be challenging in 2016 due to difficult conditions in agriculture   emerging markets and currency headwinds  Unfavorable currency impact on full year operating earnings is expected to be 30 cents per share  reflecting continued strengthening of the U S  dollar  Most of the impact is expected in the first half of 2016 DuPont is faced with several headwinds that could affect its March quarter results  As the company derives more than 60  of its sales from overseas markets  a stronger dollar is expected to continue to weigh on its top line in the first quarter with the most significant impact expected in the agriculture business DuPont is also reeling under the effects of lower farm commodity prices and weak agricultural market conditions  It is seeing soft insecticide demand in Latin America  In particular  tighter profit margins and credit are making growers in Brazil more cautious in their spending  Lower insect pressure in Brazil and abundant inventories in the Americas present headwinds in crop protection markets  The company sees continued challenges in its agriculture business in 2016  as reflected in its guidance for the year Nevertheless  DuPont is taking aggressive cost cutting actions amid a challenging backdrop  The company  in Dec 2015  divulged its plans to cut 10  of its global workforce as part of its 2016 cost savings and restructuring program  The 2016 restructuring program  which builds on the company s operational redesign initiative  is expected to deliver cost reductions of  730 million in 2016 The company s operational redesign actions delivered savings of around 40 cents per share in 2015  DuPont plans to deliver around 64 cents per share in cost reductions in 2016 through its global cost savings and restructuring program In a historic move  DuPont and Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW   agreed to combine their businesses in Dec 2015 in an all stock deal to create a chemical titan dubbed  DowDuPont  with a combined market value of around  130 billion  before eventually breaking up into three independent companies through tax free spin offs The combined company would split into pure play agricultural  material science and specialty products businesses that will be leading players in their respective fields  The breakup is expected to take place 18 24 months after the completion of the deal  which is expected in second half 2016 The companies  in February  declared that the corporate headquarters for the proposed Agriculture company   which will feature DuPont in its name after the completion of the corporate naming and branding process   will be based in Wilmington  DE  The companies also reaffirmed that the corporate headquarters for the combined specialty products business will remain in Wilmington  The Material Science company  which will feature Dow in its name  will be housed in Midland  MI The proposed mega merger is projected to deliver cost synergies of around  3 billion  expected to be achieved with the first two years after the deal closure  The deal  however  would need regulatory clearances in several countries and is expected to face a tough antitrust scrutiny due to competitive concerns given its massive size and scale  We expect DuPont to provide an update on the planned merger in its first quarter call Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DuPont is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive   Expected Surprise Prediction  and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for DuPont is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  1 02 Zacks Rank  DuPont s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   when combined with a 0 00  ESP  makes surprise prediction difficult  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a Look Here are some stocks in the basic materials space that you may want to consider  as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Air Products and Chemicals

116116,337631,APD,The Impact Of Dividend Reinvesting,opinion,IntroductionThere is a growing trend towards doing it yourself  DIY  portfolio management  Many individual investors have become disillusioned with professional investment management at various levels  to include mutual funds as well as custom designed professionally managed portfolios  Consequently  they have become motivated to take their financial futures into their own hands and manage their own portfolios Generally  I am in favor of this action as long as several conditions are met  First of all  the individual do it yourself investor  DIY  must be willing and able to commit the time  work and effort necessary to effectively manage a portfolio  They also need to have the proper tools and research at their disposal  In our Internet age  there are numerous free financial blogs and websites at the do it yourselfer s disposal  However  there are also many reasonably priced research subscription sites that ought to be considered as well But perhaps most importantly  I believe that the individual do it yourself investor  DIY  must have accurate and relevant information and knowledge at their disposal  Frankly  I believe that this particular requisite is challenging to get right for professional and lay investors alike  My reasoning is based on my experience that many widely accepted  sacred cow  investing theorems and concepts are  in fact  either flawed   inadequate or plain wrong  Consequently  their erroneous conclusions and mistaken notions offered as facts could lead investors down the wrong paths In my experience  there are a couple of primary reasons for the deficiencies that many investment axioms often contain  First and foremost  much of what is promoted as truth is often based on numerous studies that are conducted utilizing data that is too generalized to be of value  For example  there are many studies debating broad concepts such as value versus growth  or the merits of dividend paying stocks versus non dividend paying stocks  My problem with these studies lies in my observation that they are often comparing apples to oranges  Moreover  they often confuse correlation with causation  which is a major fallacy in logic Allow me to elaborate in order to make my point more clearly  A study conducted comparing dividend paying stocks versus non dividend paying stocks could lead to very erroneous and even unreliable conclusions  For example  there are many categories  classifications and distinct differences among dividend paying stocks  Some grow very fast  some slow  some have higher yields and large payout ratios  and others lower yields and low payout ratios  Moreover  there are numerous differences and nuances between the two extremes To put it simply  I believe it is unfair and even possibly misleading to conduct a study that is so overly general that vague conclusions are derived and presented as fact  For example  turning to non dividend paying stocks  some don t pay a dividend because they are not financially strong enough  while others don t pay a dividend because they are growing so fast that they need every dime of earnings and capital they can get their hands on to continue to feed their growth  Putting these two extremes in the same study cannot help but produce misleading conclusions  When attempting to explain this  I like to reframe an old adage where I say  the Angels are in the details   In my experience  true information and knowledge that can be applied as wisdom will most always come from a more individualized detailed analysis  In other words  individual investors would be better served by understanding all the differences and nuances of various classes of dividend paying stocks over having a general notion that dividends are either good or bad Consequently  the goal of this article is to elaborate  by example  on the many different kinds of dividend paying stocks that are available for investors to invest in  With a deeper understanding of the differences within the broad classification  dividend paying stocks  individual investors should be empowered to make more intelligent decisions regarding whether or not a specific type of dividend paying stock fits in with their investment profile or not But equally as important  my goal is to squelch many of the myths associated with dividend growth investing specifically  and or investing in dividend stocks in general  For example  there are widely held notions such as  The majority of stock returns come from dividends  or that dividend paying stocks perform better than non dividend paying stocks  In truth  both of the foregoing statements are true and false at the same time  Because the true answer is  it depends on the individual stock  dividend paying or not  As Mark Twain so eloquently put it  it isn t what we don t know that gets us in trouble  It s what we do know that just ain t so  What I believe Mark Twain was basically telling us is that if we hold falsehoods as absolute truths  we can be prone to making egregious errors  When dealing with something as important as managing your own money  you literally cannot afford to make mistakes  especially obvious ones  based on over generalizations of the facts  Nor does it serve us to believe something that is not true Therefore  what follows will be several examples of different kinds of dividend paying stocks offered in order to provide deeper insight into several commonly held notions  As I examine each example  I will ask and answer important questions that I believe will provide greater investor insights into the actual importance and contribution of dividends versus capital appreciation  With each example  I will focus on how much return comes from dividends and how much comes from capital appreciation  I will also illustrate the precise benefits and effects of dividend reinvestment as it applies to different types of dividend paying stocks The Many Faces Of Dividend Paying StocksThere are many dividend growth investors who are practitioners and enthusiasts of dividend reinvestment in one form or the other  Some will use automatic DRIP  dividend reinvestment programs   while others will collect dividends and reinvest them at their discretion  Personally  I think both approaches are valid  but I personally tend to follow the latter of collecting dividends and reinvesting them at my own discretion  Once again  there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches  but I feel that both work very well  Discipline is the key to any successful dividend reinvestment program Regardless  and more to the theme of this article  one of my primary objectives is to provide the reader deeper insights into how much contribution to total return that dividend reinvesting makes  And secondarily  how big a part of total return should investors expect to receive from dividends versus capital appreciation  Furthermore  I will illustrate that this varies based on the growth potential of the unique individual categorization of the dividend stock being examined  Moreover  I want to illustrate how wide ranging the differences are among the various types of dividend paying stocks In order to answer these important questions and illustrate these points  I will utilize F A S T  Graphs   the fundamentals analyzer software tool and its recently added reinvestment of dividends performance calculation option  But before I do  there are a few positioning statements and qualifiers that the reader should be aware of  With each example  I utilize time periods where beginning valuation was more or less at earnings justified levels  I did this to eliminate as much bias as I possibly could  An underlying objective of this article is to illustrate that fair valuation and earnings growth will be the primary drivers and determinants of return  This applies to both capital appreciation and dividend income Consequently  the contribution that dividends offer will be a function of several characteristics  First of all  the relative level of the initial yield will be a major contributing factor  The higher the initial yield  the bigger the dividends  contribution will be to total return  In contrast  the lower the initial yield  the smaller will be the dividends  contribution to total return  On the other hand  the rate of change of earnings growth accomplished by each company will also be the major determinant of capital appreciation  and how fast the dividend of each respective company will grow NOTE  With each example I will present performance in two iterations  First  I will present performance where capital appreciation and dividends are calculated separately  In other words  with no reinvestment of dividends  In this iteration the reader will be able to precisely see exactly how much return comes from dividends and precisely how much return is generated by capital appreciation  With the second iteration I will utilize the dividend reinvestment option in order to illustrate the effects and benefits of dividend reinvestment as it applies to each classification of dividend paying stock   For efficiency purposes  readers might want to spend more time examining the performance tables than reading the rhetoric associated with them  Average Yield Average GrowthMy first example  Pentair Ltd  PNR   represents a company with an average dividend yield of 1 7  and an average operating earnings growth rate of 8 4    In each example  these facts will be found to the right of the graph in the FAST FACTS   The following performance results with dividends paid but not reinvested are based on a  10 000 investment on 12 31 2002 and held to 04 09 2013  The original  10 000 investment appreciated to  30 842 19  representing a profit of  20 842 19   30 842 19    10 000 original investment    20 842 19   This is the capital appreciation component resulting from earnings growth of 8 4  enhanced by ending overvaluation From the dividends paid column  we see that total dividends paid were  3 816 20  Consequently  it is clear that the majority of the total return of  34 658 39 came from capital appreciation   20 842 19 profit versus  3 816 20 dividends   However  the inclusion of dividends increased the return from an annualized 11 6  to an annualized 12 9   Furthermore  by viewing these items separately  we separately see the precise contribution from price appreciation versus from dividends paid  With our next performance calculation we reinvest dividends at the end of each quarter  The reader should note from the performance report above  that the first year s yield  2003  was 2 4   Consequently  only  6   or   of the annual dividend  rate  is invested each quarter  Furthermore  it should be recognized that the annual dividend being reinvested each year  is only a fraction of the  10 000 originally invested As you review the following dividend reinvestment report  take note of the column marked  End of Period  Shares  where the increase in the number of shares owned at the end of each year is shown  In this example  there were approximately 12 shares purchased in 2003 versus the original beginning shares of 578 87  By reinvesting dividends available from this average yield average growth example  the total annualized rate of return increased from 12 9  per annum to 13 7  per annum  Note that at the top right of the performance report  that the capital appreciation on the original shares at the closing price on 04 09 2013 of  30 842 19 are retained for comparison sake versus the  37 473 88 total investment  plus appreciation  with reinvestment of dividends  I also suggest spending some time examining the performance results for other important dividend metrics  Under the Dividend Growth  column  the company s average dividend growth rate is presented  Also  the EPS Payout   the payout ratio  is also displayed  as well as  Yield On Cost High Yield Moderate GrowthOmega Healthcare Investors  OHI  is a healthcare REIT with moderate Funds From Operations  FFO  growth of 8 3  and an above average dividend yield of 5 6   With this example  we will be reviewing the impact of reinvesting dividends when the dividend yield is higher than average  The following performance results with dividends paid but not reinvested  are based on a  10 000 investment on 12 31 2004 and held to 04 09 2013  The original  10 000 investment appreciated to  27 101 77  representing a profit of  17 101 77  This is the capital appreciation component resulting from Funds From Operations  FFO  growth of 8 3  enhanced by slight ending overvaluation From the dividends paid column  we see that total dividends paid were  8 762 74  Consequently  it is clear that the majority of the total return of  35 864 51 came from capital appreciation  However  the inclusion of dividends increased the return from an annualized 12 8  to an annualized 16 7   Consequently  the higher dividend yield had a much greater impact on total annualized return than we saw with our previous average yield example  As we saw with our first example  by viewing these items separately  we see the precise contribution from price appreciation and separately from dividends paid  With our next performance calculation we reinvest dividends at the end of each quarter  The reader should note from the performance report above  that the first year s yield  2005  was 7 2   Consequently  1 8  additional capital  or   of the annual dividend  rate  is invested each quarter  Furthermore  it should be recognized that the annual dividend being reinvested each year  is a larger portion relative to the original  10 000 invested than we saw with our first example Once again  as you review the following dividend reinvestment report  take note of the column marked  End of Period  Shares  where the increase in the number of shares owned at the end of each year is shown  In this example  there were approximately 59 shares purchased in 2005 versus the original beginning shares of 847 46  and each year additional shares are purchased and reported in this column  By reinvesting dividends available from this high yield moderate growth example  the total annualized rate of return increased from 16 7  per annum to 20 7  per annum  Once again  note that at the top right of the performance report  that the capital appreciation on the original shares at the closing price on 04 09 2013 of  27 101 77 are repeated for comparison sake versus the  47 371 52 total investment  plus appreciation  with reinvestment of dividends  I also suggest spending some time examining the performance results for other important dividend metrics  Under the Dividend Growth  column  the company s average dividend growth rate is presented  Also  the EPS Payout   the payout ratio  is also displayed  as well as  Yield On Cost  etc Moderate Yield Moderate GrowthAir Products   Chemicals  APD  is an example of a company with a moderate to high dividend yield of 3 3  and earnings growth of 8 4   With this example  we will be reviewing the impact of reinvesting dividends with a moderate to high dividend yield  The following performance results with dividends paid but not reinvested are based on a  10 000 investment on 12 31 2002 and held to 04 09 2013  The original  10 000 investment appreciated to  20 117 12 representing a profit of  10 117 12  This is the capital appreciation component resulting from earnings growth of 8 4  From the dividends paid column  we see that total dividends paid were  3 922 76  Consequently  it is again clear that the majority of the total return of  20 117 12 came from capital appreciation  However  the inclusion of dividends increased the return from an annualized 7  to an annualized 8 9   Again  by viewing these items separately  we see the precise contribution from price appreciation and separately from dividends paid  With our next performance calculation we once again reinvest dividends at the end of each quarter  The reader should note from the performance report above  that the first year s yield  2003  was 1 5   Consequently  only  375   or   of the annual dividend  rate  is invested each quarter  Furthermore  it should be recognized that the annual dividend being reinvested each year  is only a fraction of the  10 000 originally invested By reinvesting dividends available from this moderate to high yield  moderate growth example  the total annualized rate of return increased from 8 9  per annum to 9 4  per annum   Again  note that at the top right of the performance report  that the capital appreciation on the original shares at closing price on 04 09 2013 of  20 117 12 are repeated for comparison sake versus the  25 237 68 total investment  plus appreciation with reinvestment of dividends  Again  I also suggest spending some time examining the performance results for other important dividend metrics  Under the Dividend Growth  column  the company s average dividend growth rate is presented  Also  the EPS Payout   the payout ratio  is also displayed  as well as  Yield On Cost  etc Low Yield High GrowthWith my next two examples the focus turns away from dividends and on to strong operating earnings growth  Ross Stores  ROST  has a modest 1 1  dividend yield  but a 17 7  average operating earnings growth rate  Perrigo Co  PRGO  in contrast has a very modest  3  dividend yield  and a very strong operating earnings growth rate of 22 6   When examining Ross Stores  performance without dividends reinvested  we see a significant amount of capital appreciation  from a  10 000 original investment growing to  56 249 19 by 04 09 2013  Dividends only contribute  2 132 35  Consequently  we see the power of earnings growth as a significant generator of total return  Dividends contribute  but their impact is dwarfed by capital appreciation When Ross Stores  dividends are reinvested  we do see that the total investment  plus appreciation  with reinvestment of dividends  increases to  61 609 36  Consequently  total return is modestly increased from 18 7  per annum to 19 3   This example illustrates the power of capital appreciation over dividend reinvesting when earnings growth is high and yield low Perrigo Co in comparison to Ross Stores has a lower dividend yield of only  3  per annum  but a faster operating earnings growth rate of 22 6  per annum  Therefore  although Perrigo Co pays a dividend  as we will soon see  shareholder returns are primarily driven by earnings growth  and only modestly enhanced by dividends Perrigo Co turns  10 000 on 12 31 2002 into  97 440 89 by 04 09 2013   Note  this is the highest total return of all the examples presented in this article   That is a compound annual rate of return of 24 8   which is very consistent with its operating earnings growth rate of 22 6   Because dividends grew in high correlation to earnings growth  Perrigo Co did distribute  1 716 05 through dividends paid  However  this clearly is dwarfed by the enormous capital appreciation of its shares  When Perrigo Co s dividends are reinvested  the total rate of return increases from 25  per annum to 25 6   Although dividends do enhance returns  it is modest in comparison to capital appreciation available from such high growth  High Yield Low GrowthConsolidated Edison Inc  ED  is an example of a classic utility with a high yield and low growth  In this example  we will discover that dividends make a much larger contribution to total return  When dividends and capital appreciation are viewed separately  we discover that Consolidated Edison Co turned  10 000 originally invested on 12 31 2002 into  14 360 37 on 04 09 2013 for a total profit of  4 360 37  However  and in contrast to our previous examples  we discover that total dividends paid equal  5 441 48  or approximately  1 081 more than shareholders received form capital appreciation  Consequently  the impact of dividend reinvesting in this example has a material effect on total return  increasing it from 6 9  per annum without reinvesting  to 8 8  when dividends are reinvested  Here we see that dividends are increasingly more important when growth is low and yield is high Very High Yield Low GrowthAnnaly Capital Management  NLY  is a high yielding mortgage REIT that has shown negative growth in Funds From Operations  FFO  since 2003  However  it currently offers investors a dividend yield of 11 3   On the other hand  prospective investors should be aware that Annaly has cut their dividend no less than six times since 2003  Nevertheless  and as we will soon see  this high yielding mortgage REIT has generated a significant amount of total dividends paid since 2003 When the returns from capital appreciation  depreciation  versus dividends are viewed on Annaly Capital Management  we discover that it s all about the dividend  An original  10 000 investment on 12 31 2002 would have depreciated to only  8 441 41 by 04 09 2013  This represents a  1 558 loss of captial  In contrast  Annaly Capital Management threw off  9 936 07 of total dividends paid  bringing the total annualized rate of return from the combination of capital loss  plus dividends  to  18 377 48  for a 6 1  compounded annual rate of return When dividends are reinvested in Annaly Capital Management  we discover that this high yielding security purchases a significant number of additional shares  each offering a high yield  Therefore  the reinvesting of dividends with this high yield example turned  10 000 originally invested into  25 109 16  for a compounded annualized return of 9 4  per annum  On the other hand  the numerous dividend cuts could have been very troubling to shareholders depending on the income to live on  even though the yield was generally high Above Average Yield Above Average GrowthVF Corporation  VFC  represents an example of a dividend paying stock with an above average current yield coupled with above average earnings growth  As we will soon see  this represents an example of a company that simultaneously offers above average total dividends and significant capital appreciation When viewed separately  we see that VF Corporation generated  5 575 54 in total dividends paid since 12 31 2002  This is significantly more than the average of  2 391 76 that investors in the S P 500 would have earned  But  since this company generated both above average yield and above average growth  capital appreciation was also significant  A  10 000 investment in VF Corporation on 12 31 2002 would have grown to  46 865 04 by 04 09 2013  Add in the  5 575 54 of dividends  and the total investment plus appreciation  plus dividends paid  not reinvested  equals  52 440 58 for a compounded return of 17 5  per annum  Consequently  strong earnings power  plus a generous dividend  rewarded shareholders at above average levels  However  I once again focus the reader on the fact that the majority of return came from capital appreciation On the other hand  the benefits of reinvesting the generous and rapidly growing dividend  13 6  10yr  average dividend growth rate  are clearly apparent  With dividends reinvested  capital appreciation  plus dividends reinvested  equals  61 183 20 for a compounded annual rate of return of 19 3  per annum Cyclical Growth Moderate YieldThis next example  American Greetings  AM   represents a very cyclical company with virtually no growth   2  per annum  since 2003  However  the company did institute a dividend in 2004  and its impact is significant for a cyclical no growth company like American Greetings Since 12 31 2002 a  10 000 investment in American Greetings would have grown to  11 550 61  That represents a profit of  1 550 61  which turns out to be less than the  2 455 70 of total dividends the company paid  Consequently  the major contributor to total return in this example is clearly the dividend income  This also represents a case where dividends greatly reduce the risk of owning this cyclical When American Greetings  dividends are reinvested  a  10 000 investment turns into  14 685 28 from the combination of capital appreciation and dividend income  However  in this case  it s the dividend that is primarily responsible for providing shareholders the modest 3 8  annualized total return High Yield Falling EarningsIn the spirit of balance  and in order to point out that dividend investing can be a bad idea under certain circumstances  my last example looks at Pitney Bowes Inc  PBI   Since calendar year 2008  Pitney Bowes  earnings have been in a steady decline and their stock price has followed suit  In spite of this  the company was able to maintain very modest dividend growth  But as we will soon see  dividends did not protect shareholders from losses Because earnings and price have both fallen so precipitously since 2008  a  10 000 investment in Pitney Bowes on 12 31 2002 would have depreciated to  4 577 39  This represents a compound annual loss averaging  7 3   However  even though the company did manage to pay  4 145 68  shareholders still saw their original  10 000 investment worth only  8 723 07  This worked out to an annualized loss equaling  1 3   including dividends Now  here is the important lesson that the Pitney Bowes  example offers  Since the stock price was in a free fall since 2008  any dividends reinvested were buying a continuously depreciating share value  Consequently  even with a generous dividend payout  reinvesting your dividends in Pitney Bowes actually increased your annualized loss from  1 3  per annum without reinvesting dividends to  2 8  with dividends reinvested  In other words  reinvesting of dividends in a depreciating asset expanded losses and generated a worse return as a result Summary and ConclusionsIn closing  I want to be very clear that I am very much in favor of investing in dividend paying stocks  Moreover  I am also very much in favor of reinvesting dividends if the long term accumulation of wealth at reasonable levels of risk is your objective  Therefore  nothing that was written in this article should be considered a criticism of dividend growth investing or dividend paying stocks  Instead  I would hope that this article is accepted as the opportunity to gain deeper insights into the many facets that dividend investing offers My motivation was to dispel widely accepted myths such as the majority of return comes from the dividends  In truth  that actually depends on the individual company  With some dividend paying stocks  and perhaps even with most dividend paying stocks  the majority of return will come from capital appreciation  even when dividends are reinvested  However  it should also be understood that beginning valuation will also have a major effect on return  Moreover  the beginning valuation  valuation at time of purchase  will have a greater effect than ending valuation due to the forces of compounding Dividends clearly make a significant contribution to total return  However  the growth of the business is without a doubt the most important factor  again  as long as the principles of fair valuation are adhered to  Likewise  the reinvestment of dividends will almost always increase the annual rate of return that shareholders will receive  On the other hand  the impact of dividend reinvestment may not be as great as many believe  Nevertheless  it is a powerful and safe way for investors favoring dividends to get better returns Finally  there are many additional benefits to dividends that this article did not specifically address  For example  it should be understood that the shareholder is  in effect  getting a return of the original capital investment every time they receive a dividend  Therefore  it can be logically concluded that with each dividend they received they have less capital at risk in the stock  Similarly  each time they reinvest dividends they increase their capital at risk in the stock  Dividend reinvestment applies to the accumulation phase of portfolio management  Once an investor is retired  the harvesting of dividends comes into play  All the dividends reinvested over the years  will thus have contributed to the amount of income the portfolio produces during the distribution phase Disclosure  Long OHI  ROST at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are
