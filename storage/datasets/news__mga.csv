33574,255089,MGA,U S   Mexico reach NAFTA deal  turn up pressure on Canada,news,"By Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States and Mexico agreed on Monday to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   putting pressure on Canada to agree to new terms on auto trade and dispute settlement rules to remain part of the three nation pact  Auto stocks soared and the S P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied to record highs on the expectation that Canada would sign onto the deal and ease the economic uncertainty caused by U S  President Donald Trump s repeated threats to ditch the 1994 accord  Details of gains and concessions in the deal were only starting to emerge on Monday  Trump threatened he still could put tariffs on Canadian made cars if Canada did not join its neighbors and warned he expected concessions on Canada s dairy protections   I think with Canada  frankly  the easiest we can do is to tariff their cars coming in  It s a tremendous amount of money and it s a very simple negotiation  It could end in one day and we take in a lot of money the following day   Trump said  Negotiations among the three partners  whose mutual trade totals more than  1 trillion annually  have dragged on for more than a year  putting pressure on the Mexican peso  and the Canadian dollar   Both currencies gained against the U S  dollar after Monday s announcement  The political stakes are high for all three countries  Trump and Republicans in the U S  Congress up for re election in November want to ensure farmers and other voters whose jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico that the deal is sealed  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto wants to sign the agreement before leaving office at the end of November  and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces a national election expected by October 2019  Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is expected to travel to Washington for talks on Tuesday  Her spokesman said Canada would sign only a new agreement that is good for the country  Trump spoke with Trudeau on Monday  his economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters  The deal with Mexico should serve as a  reset  for talks with Canada  Kudlow said  90 DAY WINDOW Officials said they hope Canada will agree to the terms by Friday  when the White House plans to notify Congress formally that Trump will sign the deal in 90 days  Congress has to approve it   There are still issues with Canada but I think they could be resolved very quickly   a senior trade official told Reuters in an interview  If talks with Canada are not wrapped up by the end of this week  Trump plans to notify Congress that he has reached a deal with Mexico  but would be open to Canada joining  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters  Some Republicans in the U S  Congress called the deal a positive step but said Canada must be part of the new pact  Trudeau spoke to Pena Nieto on Sunday and shared their commitment to reaching a successful conclusion of NAFTA  for all three parties   the prime minister s office said  Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told a news conference in Washington that if Canada and the United States do not reach an agreement on NAFTA   we already know that there will still be a deal between Mexico and the United States   NEW AUTO RULES The Mexico U S  discussions focused on crafting new rules for the automotive industry  which Trump has put at the heart of his drive to rework a pact he has repeatedly described as a  disaster  for American workers  Matt Blunt  president of the American Automotive Policy Council  which represents General Motors Co  N GM    Ford Motor Co   N F  and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV  MI FCHA   said the group was optimistic about the new deal  though it was still reviewing the details  The deal would require 75 percent of auto content to be made in the NAFTA region  up from the current level of 62 5 percent  a U S  trade official said  A fact sheet describing the bilateral agreement specified the content would be made in the United States and Mexico  That requirement could shift some auto parts manufacturing to Mexico from China  a White House official told Reuters  speaking on condition of anonymity  The Trump administration said the deal improves labor provisions  in part by requiring 40 percent to 45 percent of auto content to be made by workers earning at least  16 per hour  That measure could move some production back to the United States from Mexico and should lift Mexican wages  the White House official said  The United States relented on its demand for an automatic expiration for the deal  known as a  sunset clause   Instead  the United States and Mexico agreed to a 16 year lifespan for the deal  with a review every six years that can extend the pact for 16 years  U S  Trade Representative Lighthizer said   Mexico agreed to eliminate dispute settlement panels for certain anti dumping cases  a move that could complicate talks with Canada  which had insisted on the panels  Monday s announcement lifted equity markets in all three countries  with shares in automotive companies standing out on relief that the deal appeared to end the uncertainty that has dogged the sector for months

33576,255091,MGA,Fast and serious  Vietnam s first domestic car manufacturer bets big,news,"By James  Pearson   LON PSON  HAIPHONG  Vietnam  Reuters    At a time when auto companies in the developed world are facing a squeeze on their profits from cash rich tech firms  Vietnam is betting car making can be a ticket t o a more prosperous economy  just as it was for the likes of Japan and South Korea  VinFast  a unit of Vietnam s largest conglomerate  Vingroup JSC   HM VIC   is set to become the country s first fully fledged domestic car manufacturer when its first production models built under its own badge hit the streets next August   Where else in the world can you do this with this sort of speed   said Shaun Calvert  vice president of manufacturing at VinFast Trading and Production LLC  looking out over an area of factory floor where nine months earlier there was only sea  Calvert was speaking on a recent tour of the company s new plant  a sprawling island complex in the northern Vietnamese port town of Haiphong  where the two models will be built   From a standing start  VinFast will have the capacity to produce 250 000 cars annually in the next five years or so  equivalent to 92 percent of all the cars sold in Vietnam last year  according to data collated by the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers  Association  VAMA   Vingroup says it only embarked on creating VinFast a little over a year ago and has earmarked about  3 5 billion for the project   We are driving the rapid expansion of the domestic automobile market so we are absolutely focused on winning here first   CEO Jim Deluca said ahead of the Paris Motor Show this week  where VinFast will reveal its first export markets   We re looking to expand both within ASEAN and outside   Most cars sold in Vietnam are foreign brands assembled in the country from kits  But a series of free trade agreements have reduced import duties and are opening up the market  A 30 percent import tax on cars from other Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  countries was scrapped this year  ELECTRIC SCOOTERS Vingroup already dominates the real estate market in Vietnam with Vinhomes  has entered the healthcare market with Vinmec  runs a chain of supermarkets called Vinmart  and entertains tourists at Vinpearl resorts   There s probably 4 million customers today who are associated with Vingroup in one way or another so it s a huge brand  it s an aspirational brand  and those customers are ready for a domestic VinFast product   said Deluca  In a country synonymous with the motorbikes that zip around the clogged streets of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City  VinFast will also produce 250 000 electric scooters a year alongside the 250 000 cars  in an ambitious production target that s set to eventually increase to 1 million units each a year   VinFast has also started on the development of a battery electric vehicle with Germany s EDAG Engineering  DE ED4   to be introduced in the future  Deluca added   We felt on the car portfolio it was best to start with an internal combustion engine and then soon after that launch the battery electric vehicle   said Deluca   From an infrastructure perspective  it s a lot easier to charge a scooter than it is an automobile   The speed with which VinFast has moved has partly been possible due to a reliance on off the shelf parts  VinFast s first two models  an SUV and a small sedan  are being built on a frame from BMW  DE BMWG   The components have been engineered by Canadian firm Magna International s  TO MG  Magna Steyr  while design work has been done by Italian design house Pininfarina  MI PNNI    That gives us the ability to move very  very quickly and to come out with a vehicle that is 100 percent ours and looks like no other vehicles that are on the road today   Deluca said   NATIONAL PRIDE  The company has also imported foreign expertise  At least five of the VinFast leadership team  including Deluca and Calvert  are veterans of General Motors Co  N GM    In June  the U S  automobile giant agreed to transfer full ownership of its Hanoi factory to VinFast for the Vietnamese firm to produce small cars under a GM global license from 2019  But  despite the institutional experience VinFast has acquired  a move into the highly competitive automobile industry is not without significant risks  Local auto assembly companies have tried   and failed   in Vietnam to sell home grown models to the masses  Regionally  companies such as Malaysia s Proton or Australia s Holden have struggled to gain traction outside their home countries   The key question is why the world needs yet another car brand in a era when hardware is commoditising   said Bill Russo  head of Shanghai based consultancy Automobility Ltd and a former Chrysler executive   The fact that they have outsourced design and manufacturing and are relying on foreign R D tells me they are following a traditional path that may not be competitive in an era of digital mobility services    Bui Ngoc Huyen  chairman of Vinaxuki  which tried to establish a domestic automaker but ceased production in 2012 before its first car was officially launched  said Vingroup s deep pockets should help  but warned that building a brand would take time   You have to move from producing small and cheap cars to luxury ones   he said   It will take several years for a new carmaker to fine tune its products and win the confidence of consumers  It will take between 10 and 20 years   Deluca said VinFast s early models would be  very affordable  to lure local buyers  but declined to give details of pricing  But in Vietnam  where hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets with flares and flags to celebrate moderate success after under 23 football games  VinFast is banking on an additional competitive edge 
 We think national pride is a tremendous advantage for VinFast   said Deluca   What we re doing here is something special for the men and women of Vietnam  ",2018-10-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fast-and-serious-vietnams-first-domestic-car-manufacturer-bets-big-1629563,1629563

33578,255093,MGA,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Magna International,opinion,"Magna International Inc    NYSE MGA   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for MGA broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 20  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for MGA stock 
If that wasn t enough  MGA isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  6 estimates have been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for MGA  You can see

33582,255097,MGA,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow  
1  Consumer in Focus
The economic calendar winds down on the final trading day of the week with another update on the U S  consumer from the University of Michigan 
The University of Michigan s preliminary November consumer sentiment index  due at 10 00 am ET  is forecast to show a reading of 95 9  up slightly from the last month s reading of 95 5  while consumer expectations data will also be in focus 
With the holidays not far away  the U S  consumer  the backbone of the economic growth this year  is set to come under increased scrutiny 
2  Oil Rig Count Rolls In
Traders will look to the latest rig count data due Friday for insight into whether U S  producers continue to relentlessly pump out millions of barrels of oil 
Data last week showed the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the U S  fell by 8 to 822  The count was also down nearly 23  from a year ago 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand 
Fears that a slowing global economy  buffeted by trade tensions  would keep a lid on oil demand has been a big factor limiting upside in oil prices   
But with the U S  and China inching ever closer to a trade deal  those fears have receded slightly  helping crude prices find their footing 
3  Magna Earnings Puts Autos in Focus
  Magna International    NYSE MGA   suppier of mobility technology to the automative industry  reports earnings before the opening bell 
The auto supplier s earnings will also be closely parsed at a time when a slowing global economy has stifled demand for autos  keeping production in check  particularly in North America and Europe  
During the company s post second quarter earnings call  Magna CFO Vince Galifi warned of further softening in North America and Europe  amid heightened macroeconomic uncertainty 
Magna is expected to report earnings of  1 34 a share on revenue  9 31 billion  Those results would be down from a year ago s earnings of  1 56 a share on revenue of  9 62 billion

I have never been a fan of investing in automotive manufacturers like Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  or General Motors Company  NYSE GM   I ve always found the industry much too cyclical and too difficult for the companies to make any money   However  automobiles are certainly a major purchase for almost every person and family  not only in America but throughout the world  Consequently  the importance of this industry cannot be denied 
Therefore  instead of investing directly into automobile manufacturers  investors might consider companies such as  Magna International  Inc  NYSE MGA  one of the largest and most respected automotive suppliers in the world  I produced a video and a short write up on this company about a year ago  August 27  2018   and was recently asked to do a follow up 
Here is what I found when I went back to revisit the company   The company did go on to report good earnings growth for 2018  However  earnings and revenues disappointed for the 1st quarter of 2019 and the stock price has been flat to down so far this year   On the other hand  they just reported a strong 2nd quarter where both earnings and revenues beat estimates 
Magna International is a Canadian based Auto Parts Equipment company that has had excellent growth over its lifetime  but the market has generally valued it at a low P E ratio of 9 to 10  In this video  I will analyze the company and identify possible return opportunities using these historical norms and earnings forecasts based on analysts  consensus estimates

33586,255101,MGA,Is Magna International  MGA  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Magna International Inc    NYSE MGA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Magna International has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 50  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 52  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Magna International s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 8 68  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Auto Tires  Trucks sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 95  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Magna International has a P S ratio of about 0 38  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 09 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Magna International currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MGA a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Magna International might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D  This gives MGA a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and four downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 3 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen 2 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Magna International Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMagna International is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 24  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ,2019-08-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-magna-international-mga-a-great-pick-for-value-investors-200459066,200459066
33587,255102,MGA,Magna Outlines 2020 2022 Outlook  What Investors Need To Know,opinion,Magna International Inc    NYSE MGA   recently provided financial outlook for 2020 and 2022  While the Canadian auto equipment supplier forecasts revenue and profit growth through 2022  it anticipates sales to decline in 2020 amid macro economic headwinds  Further  Magna is calling off the self driving technology partnership with Lyft  NASDAQ LYFT  Why Magma Expects a Sales Dip in 2020Strengthening U S  dollar and production cuts by automakers across Europe are likely to weigh on Magna s top line in 2020  The firm forecasts 2020 sales in the band of  38  40 billion compared with the 2019 guided range of  38 7  39 8 billion Revenues for 2020 from Body Exteriors   Structures and Power   Vision units are forecast in the range of  16  16 8 billion and  10 7  11 3 billion  respectively  Sales from Seating Systems and Complete Vehicles segments are anticipated in the band of  5 7  6 1 billion and  6  6 4 billion  respectively  Capex for 2020 is projected at  1 7 billion While stronger U S  dollar  sale of the fluid pressure and controls business  along with lower expected light vehicle production in Europe will likely result in a year over year decline in 2020 sales  the company does not anticipate a fall in profit margins Net income for 2020 is expected between  1 8 billion and  2 billion compared with 2019 guided range of  1 8  1 9 billion  Magna s CFO Vince Galifi expects unfavorable foreign exchange transactions to cost the company  700 million in 2020  However  it expects to offset these costs with ongoing margin improvement efforts  Lower spending on advanced driver assistance systems  ADAS  and autonomy along with operational efficiency in various facilities will likely aid its margins in 2020  EBIT margins for 2020 are expected within 6 7 7  vis a vis 6 3 6 5  expectation for full year 2019 Prospects Likely to Improve by 2020Magna expects sales and EBIT margin growth in 2022 on the back of product launches and business expansion efforts  The firm has been actively concentrating on innovation and technology development for growth across all business segments  Products associated with lower emissions like hybrid dual clutch transmissions  e drives  battery frames and lightweighting solutions position it well for future growth  Expansion of the vehicle assembly business in China  and focus on the seating systems unit and ADAS technology bode well Revenues and EBIT margin for 2022 are anticipated in the band of  40 5  43 5 billion and 7 6 8   respectively  suggesting an uptick from 2020  During the 2020 2022 timeframe  Magna forecasts to generate  5 5 billion of free cash flow  The company is committed toward returning cash to its shareholders through share buyback programs and regular dividend payouts  In this respect  strong cash flow is likely to help the firm treat them well Magna Scraps Partnership With Lyft After almost two years of collaboration  Magna is ending the partnership to co develop self driving technology with ride sharing upstart  Lyft  in a bid to focus R D spending on more near term programs  These would include front and rear cameras  surround view systems  and advanced radar systems  The company will continue working on lightweighting and electrification programs  especially in Europe  as tougher emission standards in the continent are pushing automakers to sell fuel efficient vehicles Magna had stepped into the self driving fray in 2017 via entering into an existing partnership led by BMW AG   Intel Corp   NASDAQ INTC   and Mobileye  F 0ME  to develop a self driving platform by 2021  In 2018  it had inked a deal with Lyft to co develop self driving cars  In 2019  Magna had also teamed up withthe self driving vehicle technology startup Alphabet Inc  s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Waymo to build self driving cars in southeast Michigan  Magna has chosen to end the partnership with Lyft as it views fully driving systems as a longer term and expensive prospect  and is instead focusing on operational efficiencies While Magna is scaling back the ambitious partnership with Lyft to manufacture self driving systems at scale  it remains open to collaborate with Lyftin the future in several areas related to autonomous developments  including manufacturing hardware and software components for self driving vehicles Last WordsWith the auto industry being consumer cyclic  growing consumer spending in the United States bodes well for major auto industry suppliers like Magna  While vehicle sales in the United States have remained strong  weaker demand in China and Europe is a concern  To add to that  growing technology costs in the electric and autonomous era seem to put pressure on Magna s bottom line   Even amid the headwinds  Magna seems to have navigated well  surpassing earnings estimates in three out of four trailing quarters  While 2020 may not turn out to be eventful for Magna  the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  firm is on track for top  and bottom line growth over the next three years  You can see  More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the

33644,255159,MGA,7 Rewarding Low Price to Sales Stocks To Buy Right Away,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying  that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity

33654,255169,MGA,Rebates protect Canada s auto industry from retaliatory tariffs,news,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO  Reuters    Canadian government customs provisions are expected to soften the blow on the country s powerful automotive industry from retaliatory tariffs on U S  steel  according to trade lawyers and industry leaders bracing for higher costs 
Decades old programs reduce or refund import duties on supplies like steel when companies in Canada can show the material is used in export products  They could protect the auto industry s supply contracts covering raw materials and parts  which often cross borders several times before a vehicle is finished 
While imposing tariffs against a long list of U S  products this month  Canada clarified that  duties relief  and  duty drawback  programs would be available to Canadian exporters 
 That provision in the notice is overwhelmingly directed at the auto industry   said Jesse Goldman  a trade lawyer at Borden Ladner Gervais  Without drawbacks  Goldman said  the Canadian retaliation would have  very significantly and very quickly  hurt the industry 
Some 85 percent of vehicles built in Canada in 2016 were exported  meaning duty relief programs could refund roughly 85 percent of retaliatory tariffs paid by automakers 
Canada has vowed to defend the steel and aluminum industries  but vehicle manufacturing employs some 136 000  according to Statistics Canada  whereas only about 22 000 work in the steel sector  giving the government an incentive to shelter vehicle and parts makers from rising costs 
 These existing programs continue to be in place and any changes would be done in consultation with the relevant stakeholders   federal Finance Department spokesman Jack Aubry said when asked whether the programs would continue 
BIG OPERATORS
Automakers with operations in Canada include General Motors Co  N GM    Ford Motor Co   N F    Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles  MI FCHA   Toyota Motor Corp  T 7203  and Honda Motor Co  T 7267  which assemble vehicles  as well as parts makers Magna International  TO MG  and  Linamar Corp   TO LNR  
Linamar Chief Executive Linda Hasenfratz said in an emailed statement the drawback programs are of particular benefit to her company  Canada s second largest auto parts maker  since substantially all the steel that the company imports is later exported 
Honda said it was still assessing the impact of the tariffs  GM  Fiat Chrysler and Magna declined to comment  Ford and Toyota did not respond to requests for comment 
The Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers  Association needs to do more analysis before commenting on whether drawbacks could protect his industry  President Mark Nantais said   There are various options that could be used   that would be one of them   he added 
But any relief would be temporary if U S  President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on Canadian made vehicles after the administration s Section 232 national security probe into autos wraps up  The rebate programs limit the impact of tariffs on raw materials  not finished products 
Flavio Volpe  president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers  Association  said some companies that make stainless steel parts or hardened steel tools in Canada could benefit 
Volpe said just over half of Canadian made auto parts are exported 
John Boscariol  who leads McCarthy Tetrault s international trade and investment law group  said access to the duty relief programs had not been a foregone conclusion before the government s notice  because Canada s retaliation is technically a  surtax   not a normal duty 
Some uncertainty remains as companies must apply individually for the refunds  and carefully document how imports are used  he added 

 It introduces costs and complications  and it introduces a likelihood that you might not get that relief   Boscariol said   That s not without cost  ",2018-07-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rebates-protect-canadas-auto-industry-from-retaliatory-tariffs-1530474,1530474
33660,255175,MGA,Exclusive  GM  DHL use a Chinese plant to lead manufacturing change,news,"By Norihiko Shirouzu LIUZHOU  China    Reuters    Inside General Motors Co s vehicle assembly plant in this southern China city  many workers wear the red and yellow uniforms of DHL  the logistics company  The DHL employees work side by side with GM workers handling the flow of parts within the plant  which builds about 400 000 Baojun brand vehicles a year and is owned jointly by GM  N GM   Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp  SS 600104  and Guangxi Automobile Group  DHL assembles thousands of kits of parts daily in a strategy to avoid assembly errors  and reduce costs  At some GM run final assembly plants in China  seats are unloaded from delivery trucks  put on a conveyer system that runs underneath an assembly line  and are delivered to the assembly line operator untouched by human hands  Some parts are delivered by small self guided robots that would be at home on the set of a  Star Wars  movie  GM is now deploying third party logistics contractors inside all 17 of its joint venture general assembly plants in China to transport materials  and manage parts warehousing outside the plant and delivery to the plant  a senior GM executive told Reuters  Outsourcing in plant material handling jobs  traditionally done by GM workers  allows the automaker s workforce to focus on the more critical work of improving quality and efficiency  GM China s manufacturing chief Paul Buetow said  GM has not previously shared details of its strategy for using DHL and other contractors in its Chinese joint venture factories  Early on in developing its Chinese manufacturing  GM used relatively simple manufacturing systems  relying more on cheap labor than advanced technology  CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING Now  GM s Chinese operations are deploying advanced manufacturing systems ahead of many factories in mature markets  and leading the way in many aspects of factory floor innovation  GM s increasing use of contractors in China points toward a future where much more of the work involved in producing vehicles  or even all of it  could be handed over to third party specialists  as Apple Inc  O AAPL  does by outsourcing production of its devices  Established automakers have used contract assemblers  such as  Magna International Inc   TO MG   to build small numbers of niche models   But union agreements have limited the use of outside contractors within many plants run by global automakers in Europe and the United States  Some electric car startups  including NIO  formally known as NextEV  are already experimenting with handing over the bulk of production work to third parties  NIO s founder and chief executive William Li  who has his entrepreneurial roots in e commerce  has been lobbying China s industrial policymakers to allow existing automakers to subcontract for electric car ventures such as his  so that startups could channel limited resources into technology and product development  Under current policy  EV startups in China are required to have their own manufacturing capacity  Buetow said he has  thought about  the possibility of fully outsourcing production  but has concluded the automaker should still control manufacturing   The building and assembling of vehicles is still a core competency for General Motors   Buetow told Reuters in an interview in Liuzhou   I am not sure we would ever contract that out   It is critical  he said  to have the  technical control  necessary to build vehicle bodies with precision in order to assure crashworthiness  EFFICIENCY GAIN GM and SAIC  and Guangxi Automobile have roughly 6 000 employees at the Liuzhou manufacturing complex   To support them  DHL has deployed 1 500 of its own workers according to DHL  Cars have 20 000 to 30 000 parts  and modern auto factories often produce multiple models on the same assembly line  The parts kits  delivered in the proper order according to computerized schedules  help reduce errors   Assembly line workers  for example  do not have to decide what color sun visor to use in a car  That choice is made by the people assembling the kit  Parts kits put together by DHL are delivered by DHL workers just in time for a given vehicle coming down the assembly line  DHL uses a system for creating kits of parts that was pioneered by Toyota and later shared with GM  According to GM  most of these DHL workers are doing warehousing and parts delivery to the plants  DHL workers who handle parts kitting and just in time delivery to the assembly line are much fewer in number than those working outside the assembly plants and they do not engage in vehicle assembly work  the company said  Similar outsourcing arrangements are being carried out on a small scale in GM s North American manufacturing facilities and elsewhere  but  what we have done in China is more  evolved    Buetow told Reuters  without elaborating  GM declined to provide detailed information on the presence of third party logistics service providers inside its Chinese plants  saying that is competitive information  GM China manufacturing facilities also have adopted technologies such as  zero downtime  welding and other robots  as well as collaborative robots which work side by side with human operators on the assembly line  Buetow said  As a result  GM s Chinese production facilities have enjoyed a big jump in efficiency  Buetow said  Buetow and GM declined to give specific data  but Buetow said the number of vehicles assembled with the wrong components has fallen to a quarter of the level seen a decade or two ago  
 You rarely see any vehicles that are mis built at the end of the line these days   Buetow said ",2018-01-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-gm-dhl-use-a-chinese-plant-to-lead-manufacturing-change-1112643,1112643

stocks are up 13 5  off the lows  While it may be tempting to close your eyes and buy everything that s moving  you may be headed for disappointment when the market run finally tapers off  Regardless of what happens with the market in the short term  there are long term recipes for success you can apply in any market  Among them  looking for stocks with earnings estimates that are moving in a positive direction over time  One way to do that  is to look for stocks that are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  These are stocks that have seen analysts make bullish moves  increasing their profit estimates quarter after quarter One of these stocks is today s Bull of the Day  Office Depot  Office Depot  Inc   together with its subsidiaries  provides various products and services  It operates in

supplies  print  cleaning  breakroom  and facilities products  and office furniture in the United States  Puerto Rico  and the U S  Virgin Islands  Its stores also provide printing  reproduction  mailing  and shipping services  As of December 31  2017  this division operated 1 378 office supply stores  The reason for the positive Zacks Rank lies in the recent earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts  Over the last sixty days  analysts have increased their estimates for the current year and next year  The bullish sentiment has increased the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate from 33 cents to 34 cents while next year s number has gone up from 37 cents to 40 cents  These bullish revisions have helped underpin a move off the lows recently  The market has been en fuego since bottoming out on Christmas Eve  So far  2019 has seen a barrage of positive days and green candles for the broad market  With stocks behaving so well  you may be tempted to jump on in and buy stocks

over the long term  Avoiding stocks in negative earnings trends can save you from headaches down the road One stock with a negative earnings trend you may want to avoid for now is Zacks Rank  5

products through golf retailers  sporting goods retailers  mass merchants  Internet retailers  department stores  field representatives  and in house sales representatives  as well as to third party distributors in the United States and approximately 100 countries  The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank lies in the recent negative earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts  Over the last sixty days  five analysts have cut their estimates for next year  while this year s number has remained the same  Those negative revisions have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year from  1 12 to  1 08  That would peg EPS growth down at 3  Additional content Will the F Series Salvage Ford s Q4 Earnings Ford Motor Company is scheduled to announce fourth quarter and 2018 results on Jan

Ford s earnings in 2018 has moved 0 7  downward In recent times  rising demand for spacious and comfortable vehicles led to augmented truck  crossover and SUV sales  In fact  this continued shift can be witnessed from Ford s three quarterly sales of 2018  During these quarters  the company s automotive revenues were majorly driven by growing truck and SUV demand  majorly offset by waning traditional sedan sales  Among the top players  a few models of Ford that deserve mention are F Series  Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator In 2018  Ford s F Series maintained its position of being the best selling pickup in America for the 42nd year in a row  Light weight and sturdy vehicles in the lineup are decent options to choose from a variety of pick up trucks available in the market  In fact  immense demand aided the automaker to sell nearly 1 1 million F Series vehicles globally in the last year compared with its target of 1 million  Further  considering the U S  average transaction price of  46 700 on these vehicles  Ford is expected to generate  50 billion in revenues by selling more than 1 million pickups Despite such high annual sales of F Series trucks  the company s truck segment reported a sales decline in the last three months of 2018  In October  November and December  the segment s sales fell 4 9   2 3  and 3 8   respectively  With most of the company s sales depending on its pickup line  a continuous decline in monthly sales recorded by the truck segment is a concern for Ford In the preliminary report  the automaker anticipates revenues of  41 8 billion and adjusted earnings of 30 cents per share for fourth quarter 2018  For the quarter under review  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford s automotive revenues is pegged at  37 6 billion   For details refer   Frequent vehicle recalls to fix Takata airbags or other faulty vehicle parts are elevating expenses for Ford  Further  high import costs on steel and aluminum  along with weakening demand in China and stressed business in Europe  are expected to majorly hamper the company s bottom line in fourth quarter 2018 Earnings Schedules of Other Major Auto CompaniesAmong other automotive companies  General Motors Company is scheduled to release results on Feb 6  whereas Magna International Inc  are expected to report earnings on Feb 19 and Feb 28  respectively General Motors currently sports a

33726,255241,MGA,Is Magna  MGA  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Magna International Inc    NYSE MGA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Magna has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 16 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Magna s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares slightly favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 8 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Magna has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 6 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Magna stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Magna has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 9 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MGA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Magna currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Magna a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Magna is 0 8  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 0 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 7  which is better than the industry average of 5 0  Clearly  MGA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Magna might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A  This gives MGA a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and three downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 6 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Magna International Inc  Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMagna is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 7   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that

33748,255263,MGA,PSA targets Opel turnaround as GM exits Europe,news,By Laurence Frost and Edward Taylor PARIS FRANKFURT  Reuters    France s PSA Group  PA PEUP  has agreed to buy Opel from General Motors  N GM  in a deal valuing the business at 2 2 billion euros   2 3 billion   creating a new European car giant to challenge market leader Volkswagen  DE VOWG p   The maker of  Peugeot  and Citroen cars vowed to return Opel and its British Vauxhall brand to profit  targeting an operating margin of 2 percent within three years and 6 percent by 2026 underpinned by 1 7 billion euros in joint cost savings  PSA shares jumped as much as 5 2 percent after Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said GM s European arm could be turned around using lessons from the French group s own recovery  Opel recently recorded its 16th consecutive full year loss   We re confident that the Opel Vauxhall turnaround will significantly accelerate with our support   he said  By acquiring Opel  PSA leapfrogs French rival  Renault   PA RENA  to become Europe s second ranked carmaker by sales  with a 16 percent market share to VW s 24 percent  The disposal seals GM s exit from Europe and ends a relationship dating back to the 1920s  Eight years after coming close to a sale to Canada s Magna  TO MG   the Detroit car giant has faced renewed investor pressure to offload the business to raise profitability  rather than chase the global sales crown currently held by VW  Last year  PSA and GM Europe recorded a combined 72 billion euros in revenue and 4 3 million vehicle deliveries  GM will receive 1 32 billion euros for the Opel manufacturing business in the form of 650 million euros in cash and 670 million in PSA share warrants  An additional 900 million euros will be paid by the Paris based carmaker and  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  for Opel s financing arm  to be operated jointly and consolidated by the French bank   PROUD NOT RELIEVED  After fending off 2015 merger overtures by  Fiat  Chrysler  MI FCHA  with support from her board  GM boss Mary Barra agreed to target a 20 percent return on invested capital and pay out more cash to shareholders   The way I look at this is positioning Opel Vauxhall to be incredibly successful in the future   Barra said on Monday when asked by a reporter whether she was relieved   General Motors doesn t have to be relieved   PSA s Tavares interjected   They can be proud of giving Opel Vauxhall a better future   PSA shares were up 2 2 percent at 19 49 euros as of 0939 GMT  after reaching 20 06 euros earlier in the session  GM shares closed 1 2 percent higher on Friday after Reuters reported a deal had been struck  The two carmakers  which already share some production in an existing European alliance  confirmed last month they were negotiating PSA s outright acquisition of Opel  sparking concern over possible job cuts  Tavares said on Monday the targeted savings would come from purchasing and research and development   avoiding plant closures   as the Opel lineup is redeveloped with PSA technology and vehicle architectures  An ambitious technical convergence push will begin with the Opel Corsa  the CEO indicated  as earlier reported by Reuters  The next version of the popular subcompact will be delayed by a year to 2020 as it goes back to the drawing board  according to presentation slides shown to analysts   Our planning teams are already working on that   Tavares said when questioned about the model  Another five PSA based Opel vehicles will follow by 2023  LABOR COSTS The Opel deal caps a stellar two year recovery for PSA  which avoided bankruptcy in 2014 by selling 14 percent stakes to the French state and China s Dongfeng  HK 0489   matching the Peugeot family s diluted holding  Tavares has since cut about 3 000 French assembly line jobs each year through voluntary departures to trim the wage bill to 11 percent of revenue from the 15 percent level he inherited   which is roughly where Opel s labor costs stand today   PSA reiterated pledges to run Opel as a distinct German subsidiary and honor existing job guarantees  which tend to cover production plans for existing models   Beyond those horizons  however  the outlook for Opel plants may be less certain   Tavares wants to create healthy competition between the plants   said one person involved in the tie up talks   They will be competing for workload   With Europe s auto market near a peak  some analysts expect the new group to close two or three plants within five years  Britain s European Union exit adds to the uncertainty over Vauxhall s UK plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton  But Tavares said exports could help fill Opel plants  adding that UK manufacturing brought opportunities as well as risks in the event of a  hard Brexit  in which Britain leaves the EU without a free trade deal   This may look to you a little bit romantic   he conceded  The transaction also sees GM retain most of Opel s pensions deficit  estimated by analysts at  10 billion  Earlier in the talks  the U S  carmaker had sought to offload a larger share of the liabilities  sources said  Some smaller pension funds will be transferred to PSA  along with a 3 billion euro payment to cover their full settlement  the companies said on Monday  Existing Opel models will be barred from entering new overseas markets under  non compete  agreements that had also complicated negotiations   while GM will be similarly excluded from marketing the same underlying technologies in Europe  The PSA warrants  exercisable in five years and maturing in nine  provide a financial incentive for GM to continue cooperating  The U S  carmaker has agreed to sell the shares received upon exercise  keeping no stake in PSA  The Opel sale cuts GM s cash balance requirement by  2 billion  the company said  allowing it to accelerate share repurchases  GM will also take a charge of  4 billion to  4 5 billion on the deal  expected to close in late

of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Escape Market TurmoilDividend investing is once again in vogue thanks to growing political and geopolitical tensions as well as renewed concerns of trade war  In fact  investors are chasing both growth and income in their portfolio  This can be achieved by zeroing in on companies that not only offer dividends but have also have consistently increasing their payout   Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth make an investor s portfolio immune to large swings in stock prices in turbulent times  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks pose a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth a promising investment as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe Furthermore  these have a long history of outperformance over the long term  When compared with the ones that pay out high yields  dividend growth stocks form a healthy portfolio  with more scope for capital appreciation  However  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week

IncreaseRetail sales data released last Friday showed an increase for the third consecutive month in March  with a 0 6  rise to  50 2 billion  per Statistics Canada  Higher sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers more than offset lower sales at food and beverage stores and gasoline stations Sales were up in six of 11 subsectors  representing 53  of retail trade  The strength in retail sales points to solid demand in the economy Inflation Within RangeThe annual inflation rate in Canada eased to 2 2  in April 2018 from 2 3  in March and was below market expectations of 2 3   With the

wage gains above the 3  mark  rising to 13 of 16 in the weekly wage data Strong employment and wage growth should provide further support to consumption and fuel demand for various goods and services

the third quarters after soft first quarter growth which is expected to have been below 2    First quarter GDP numbers will be released on May 31   The headwinds of the first quarter such as plant shutdowns in the auto sector and disruptions to pipeline operations in the energy sector  temporarily restrained the goods sector output  So exports should reverse and turn into tailwinds later in the

33873,255388,MGA,Is Magna International  MGA  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Magna International Inc    NYSE MGA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Magna International has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Magna International s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 10 1  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Magna International has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Magna International s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Magna International has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Magna International currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MGA a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Magna International is just 0 9  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 9  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 8 2  Clearly  MGA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Magna International might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C  This gives MGA a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has slipped nearly 1 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Magna International Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMagna International is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 22  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out

33945,255460,MGA,6 Cheap Dividend Growth Stocks For Long Term Rewards,opinion,"Though rising yields have dampened the appeal for dividend investing  a niche corner of this space is still in vogue  This is none other than the dividend growth strategy  Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those that pay high yields Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model  a long track record of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields  All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe  Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks

33946,255461,MGA,4 Low P CF Stocks Ready To Add Value To Your Investment,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are four of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening Vishay Intertechnology  Inc    NYSE VSH    which manufactures and supplies discrete

as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative Price to Earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its Price to Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s Price to Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the Price to Sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So it goes without saying that a stock with Price to Sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower Price to Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price to Sales ratio Price to Sales is often preferred over Price to Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price to Sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price to Sales ratio In any case  the Price to Sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book

34010,255525,MGA,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include Vishay Intertechnology  ON Semiconductor  Magna International And AerCap Holdings,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 9  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Vishay Intertechnology  Inc   NYSE    NYSE VSH       ON Semiconductor Corporation  Nasdaq    NASDAQ ON        Magna International Inc   NYSE    NYSE MGA       and AerCap Holdings N V   NYSE    NYSE AER       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 4 Stocks Flaunting Low Price to Cash Flow Ratios  It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price      Warren Buffett  The strategy is very simple    find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening Vishay Intertechnology  Inc   NYSE

34011,255526,MGA,Should Value Investors Pick Magna International  MGA  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Magna International Inc    NYSE MGA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Magna International has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Magna International s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 10 1 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Auto sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Magna International s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Magna International has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this stands below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Magna International currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Magna International a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Magna International is roughly 1  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 5  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 4  which is better than the industry average of 8 7  Clearly  MGA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Magna International might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives MGA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 4 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 2 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Magna International  Inc  Price and Consensus    Given this bullish trend  the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which indicates why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMagna International is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  this Zacks Rank  2 company has a solid Zacks Industry Rank  among Top 17  of more than 250 industries   which hints at favorable broader factors  In fact  over the past year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana       Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act

34031,255546,MGA,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include Synnex  ArcelorMittal  Principal Financial Group  Magna International And Citizens Financial Group,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 27  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Synnex Corporation  NYSE    NYSE SNX        ArcelorMittal  NYSE    NYSE MT        Principal Financial Group  Inc   NYSE    NYSE PFG        Magna International Inc   NYSE    NYSE MGA       and Citizens Financial Group  Inc   NYSE    NYSE CFG       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by 5 Stocks with Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios to Scoop Up NowPrice to earnings  P E   without a shadow of a doubt  is the most popular metric used by investors to handpick stocks that are trading at a discount  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase for stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its  is a Better Approach  But Why While P E enjoys huge popularity in the value investing world  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer image of a firm s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also referred to as enterprise multiple  determines the total value of a firm while P E just considers its equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents EBITDA  the other component of the multiple  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  Moreover  a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA has its limitations too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  a strategy entirely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired results  But you can combine it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen value stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or

34038,255553,MGA,5 Price to Book Value Picks To Buy In August,opinion,In value investing  it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong  There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks Among them  price to book ratio  P B ratio  is an easy to use tool for identifying low priced stocks  which have high growth prospects The P B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock  It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter s book value per share P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equity Understanding Book Value There are several ways by which book value can be defined  It is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this would equate to common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value Explaining the P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s share price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditures  high debt companies  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform

significant variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a vital role in determining share price movement Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations So  what are earnings estimates  It embodies analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost controls  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while taking investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm As the second quarter earnings season is almost coming to an end  we have picked stocks that have displayed historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates  As of Aug 16  462 S P 500 members have reported their earnings figures  Earnings for these members are

34041,255556,MGA,4 Stocks To Buy As Q2 Earnings Season Nears Close,opinion,Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  But the question here is why  This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings This metric is also considered the most significant variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a vital role in determining share price movement Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations So  what are earnings estimates  It embodies analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost controls  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while taking investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm As the second quarter earnings season is almost coming to an end  we have

34059,255574,MGA,Add Value To Your Investment With These 4 Low P CF Stocks,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening Magellan Health  Inc    NASDAQ MGLN    which is engaged in healthcare management business  delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23 9  in the trailing four quarters  The stock has an expected EPS growth rate of 18  for 3 5 years and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can

34061,255576,MGA,5 Stocks With Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios To Scoop Up Now,opinion,Price to earnings  P E   without a shadow of a doubt  is the most popular metric used by investors to handpick stocks that are trading at a discount  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase for stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its  is a Better Approach  But Why While P E enjoys huge popularity in the value investing world  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer image of a firm s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also referred to as enterprise multiple  determines the total value of a firm while P E just considers its equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents EBITDA  the other component of the multiple  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  Moreover  a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful yardstick in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA has its limitations too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  a strategy entirely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired results  But you can combine it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen value stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential

34081,255596,MGA,Should Value Investors Consider Choosing Magna  MGA  A Great Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Magna International  Inc    NYSE MGA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Magna International has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 23  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Magna International s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Automotive   Original Equipment industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 21  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Magna International has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 73  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Magna International stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Magna International has a P S ratio of about 0 47  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MGA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Magna International currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Magna International a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Magna International is just 0 76  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 16  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  MGA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Magna International might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives MGA a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen only one estimate is going higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward movements in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower by 0 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has grown by 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Magna International  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMagna International is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 14  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over last one year  the Zacks Automotive   Original Equipment industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Best   Worst of ZacksToday you are invited to download the full  up to the minute list of 220 Zacks Rank  1   Strong Buys   free of charge  From 1988 through 2015

34101,255616,MGA,Will Delphi Automotive s  DLPH  Earnings Disappoint In Q3  ,opinion,"Delphi Automotive PLC   NYSE DLPH   is set to report third quarter 2016 results on Nov 2  In the last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2 58   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Influencing this Quarter
Delphi Automotive is one of the largest vehicle parts manufacturers in the world  The company s innovative products have helped it secure all 25 leading global automobile manufacturers as customers  Delphi Automotive regularly undertakes acquisitions and alliances to enhance its technological capability  increase operating scale  augment its client base and expand geographically  The HellermannTyton Group acquisition has been boosting the company s earnings  For 2016  Delphi Automotive expects revenues  adjusted earnings per share  adjusted operating income and operating cash flow to increase over 2015  This raises hopes for good results in the third quarter 
On the flip side  the absence of revenues from the Thermal Systems business and the stake in Shanghai Delphi Automotive Air Conditioning System Co   Ltd  both of which have been sold  has been negatively impacting Delphi Automotive s top line 
Moreover  economic weakness in South America is leading to lower production in the region by original equipment manufacturers  Delphi Automotive expects weak vehicle production in the second half of the year  particularly in China  It also projects weaker light duty diesel volumes in both Europe and the emerging markets this year  Even the global commercial vehicle market remains soft  These factors can adversely affect Delphi Automotive s sales 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Delphi Automotive is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Delphi Automotive  Earnings ESP is  1 41  because the Most Accurate estimate stands at  1 44  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 42  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises DELPHI AUTO PLC Price and EPS Surprise
    Zacks Rank  Delphi Automotive carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings Inc    NYSE AXL    which is expected to report third quarter 2016 results on Nov 4  has an Earnings ESP of  5 20  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Fox Factory Holding Corp   NASDAQ FOXF    which will report third quarter 2016 financial numbers on Nov 2  has an Earnings ESP of  2 56  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

34103,255618,MGA,5 Stocks With Exciting Price to Book Ratios,opinion,When you re an investor  the last thing you want is to pay too much for a stock or miss a bargain price  This is where value investing comes into play In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong  Among the various ratios to identify value stocks  investors often look at price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S   While P E is the ratio of annual earnings per share to stock price  P S is stock price divided by sales per share However  the underrated price to book ratio  P B ratio  can also do wonders if used properly to identify low priced stocks with high growth prospects  The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization   book value of equityWhat is Book Value There are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets of a company  In most cases  this would equate to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from total assets to determine the book value Explaining the P B RatioBy comparing book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative return on its assets  or the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s share price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without its limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with large R D expenditures or high debt companies or service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the P B is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F

34104,255619,MGA,Harley Davidson  HOG  Q3 Earnings  Stock To Disappoint ,opinion,"Harley Davidson  Inc    NYSE HOG   is set to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 18  In the last quarter  it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 31   Further  the company managed to beat earnings in three of the last four quarters with a positive average surprise of 2 95   Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Influencing this Quarter
Harley Davidson commands a large market share that provides scale advantages over most competitors  The company is expanding its product portfolio to increase its customer base  Its large share in the U S  motorcycle market  consistent capital deployment and favorable shipment guidance are positives  However  Harley Davidson expects stiff competition to hurt retail sales this year as competitors rely on discounting and product introduction to boost sales  Further  the company anticipates headwinds due to macroeconomic challenges in some regions 
In the third quarter of 2016  Harley Davidson expects to ship 48 500 53 500 motorcycles  compared with 53 472 motorcycles shipped in the year ago period  The company also reduced its guidance for motorcycle shipments in 2016 to 264 000 269 000 units from the prior range of 269 000 274 000 units  This implies that the year over year change in shipments will vary between a decline of 1  and a rise of 1   The lower guidance is due to softness in the U S  market  high competition and global economic uncertainty  Harley Davidson also expects a small decline in operating income for the Financial Services segment this year due to increased borrowing costs and unfavorable provision for credit losses  partially offset by higher revenues 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Harley Davidson is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Harley Davidson is currently pegged at  1 59   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 62 cents stands below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents

34161,255676,MGA,These 5 Low Price to Sales Stocks Can Garner Solid Returns,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest considering Price to Sales ratio as one of the key metrics A stock s Price to Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company  If Price to Sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with Price to Sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth What Makes Price to Sales Ratio Attractive You must be wondering what makes Price to Sales ratio attractive  when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  This is so because companies and managements can fiddle with their earnings using various accounting measures but sales are harder to manipulate and hence are relatively reliable Again  Price to Sales ratio helps to determine the value of stocks that are grappling with losses or are in the early stage of development  generating meager or no profits  While a loss making company with a negative Price to Earnings ratio falls out of investors  favor  its Price to Sales ratio could indicate the hidden strength in its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify recovery situations or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price to Sales ratio is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price to Sales ratio What s the Optimum Strategy In any case  Price to Sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios such as Price Earnings  Price Book  and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision  Let s check out the screening parameters for selecting true value stocks Price to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the Price to Sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry  A company with less debt should have a stable Price to Sales ratio Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to

34167,255682,MGA,An Opportunity In Magna,opinion,"Magna International Inc  NYSE MGA  makes auto parts  A lot of them  Headquartered in Canada  it is one of the largest auto parts makers in the world  The stock had a great run higher from late 2012 until September 2014  rising over 150   But then it stalled and has done nothing since  Dead money they call it  right 
Not so fast  Every stock goes through periods of trending and non trending price action  After a year of running hard to the upside  shouldn t Magna also be allowed to move sideways for a while 

To the technical investor  this sideways action can also tell a story  Not as obvious as a straight trend higher  but a story nonetheless  The chart above shows two patterns in the Magna stock price during the recent consolidation that bode for higher prices in the future 
The first is an ascending triangle  The two red lines show tightening price action with 5 touches before a break to the upside Monday  The target on the break of the triangle is a move to 69 50 
The second pattern is a bearish Deep Crab harmonic  This pattern carries a Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  at 66 70  What this means is that by passing the  B  point it can be traded to the upside to that PRZ before any bearish reversal is expected from the harmonics 
The momentum indicators are both bullish and supportive of continued upside as well  Using a stop under the triangle breakout  this gives a reward to risk ratio of better than 10 1 ",2015-05-12,Gregory W. Harmon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/an-opportunity-in-magna-251521,251521

34170,255685,MGA,The CFTC And Outlawing Algorithmic Trading,opinion,"May 6 was the the four year anniversary of the Flash Crash  It was a bitter anniversary for our S P desk  which has been on the floor since 1985  We took a big hit that day and still wonder why it happened  After working on the floor for 33 years the Flash Crash was not only a wake up call for us but also the industry and the world as a whole  It can and will happen again if something isn t changed 

While my background is in S P 500 index arbitrage  it s not the same as algorithmic trading where the program jumps in front of customer orders and runs buy and sell stops all day long  It is essentially computerized front running 
Index arb takes advantage of the spread difference between the price of the S P futures  CME SPM14  vs  the S P cash  Yes  it does move the index up and down  but when you add algorithmic trading on top of it  it s like throwing gas on a fire  There is an instant response 
CFTC raising the bar
A few years ago there really was not much said about the practice of algorithmic trading  but the Flash Crash brought a new awareness to the practice  A Google search of  cftc and algorithmic trading  shows that new awareness  Maybe investors and traders got sick of having their trading accounts attacked by algorithmic trading 
There are a lot of companies getting fined and forced out of the business but this week was big  The CFTC has finally said it is going to start  investigating   The current enforcement comes from the SEC but they have been  very ineffective  
The official  from the SEC  PDF  stated  in their words  that there were many causes of the Flash Crash  The first was worries about the stability of Europe  re Greece  the second part was the big institutional sell order in the CME s S P 500 e mini futures contract and thirdly  delay in data dissemination and of consolidated trade and quote information  What they failed to say was that the CME did not have adequate  circuit breakers  in place 
There are few people in the world  if any  who have the background and knowledge of program trading like Brain Shepard and me  There are few people if any in the world who set up one of the single largest S P floor desks like we did and there are even fewer that handled the business we saw going over our phones 
From the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority  ADIA  to the Union Bank of Switzerland  from Kidder Peabody to Drexel Burnham Lambert to all the big  10 to  20 billion hedge funds all the way down to the little guy  we fought our hearts out only to be hit by a  5 3 million loss  Sure  over the years we ve had some errors at the desk  some good and bad periods  but net net it was a career filled with doing the right thing and fighting for the customers 
Every system needs circuit breakers
The SEC and the CFTC can give all the reasons they like for what happened on May 6  2010  but I can tell you from the view we had at the  Top Step  of the S P pit all of it could have been avoided had the proper circuit breakers been in place  When that big sell order showed up  47 000 contracts of E mini S P 500 futures  ES  and other sellers caught on  the supposed  bids and offers  and all the liquidity the algorithms say they provide were nowhere in sight  They say there are new safeguards  but that s not going to stop it from happening again

Our view  There is a barrage of Fed speak today  After a big run on the upside the S P has pulled back for a few days  but with the exception of Tuesday s 11 5 handle drop  the other down days didn t provide much downside  May 1   20  May 2  3 3  May 5  1 4  May 6  11 5  May 7  9 9  and after Tuesday s selloff the ESM14 snapped right back yesterday 
Over the last week or so we have seen a huge uptick in algorithmic and program trading  running the upper end of the range s buy stops and then reversing and taking out the lower end of the range s sell stops  On some days the ESM14 did it two or three times in a day 
It s one thing to see that happen once in a day  but when you see that two or three times you know the algos are loading up  Our view is it looks like the S P is starting to firm up  We lean to buying the dips  You can take it from there 
As always  please keep an eye on the and please use stops when trading futures and options

34205,255720,MGA,Two Auto Parts Dividend Stocks With Undervalued Growth,opinion,Since the US auto industry had its best sales quarter in 4 years in Jan March  and overall world sales are also expected to increase in 2012  you d think that auto parts companies would be fairly valued already  But  that s not the case  even with standout growth apparent in some firms  We found 2 solid dividend paying stocks within this sub industry that are undervalued on many metrics  Magna International   MGA   a Canadian firm  and Standard Motor Products   SMP   a US firm  Magna sells its parts to Original Equipment Manufacturers  and Standard sells its parts in both the aftermarket segment and also to Original Equipment Manufacturers   More detailed profiles are at the end of this article  Both of these dividend stocks had strong growth in their most recent quarter  and have good growth forecasts for their next fiscal year  However  their P E s are way below industry avgs   making them look undervalued on a PEG ratio basis  MGA s current 10 72 P E is approx  in the middle of its historic P E range of 7 93   14 03  while SMP s 5 44 P E is actually below its historic range of  7 24   27 97  Both stocks are also cheap on a Price Book and Price Sales basis Even though it s up over 35  in 2012  MGA still looks undervalued   SMP is down over  24  this year Dividends  MGA and SMP both increased their quarterly dividends in 2011 and 2012   MGA went from   18 in 2009  to   25 in 2011  and raised it again  to   275  in 2012   SMP raised its dividend from   05 to   07 in 2011  and again to   09 in 2012 Covered Calls  Want to rev up the dividend yield on these stocks  You can do it via selling covered call options  Both stocks have relatively high options yields which you can use to turn them into short term high dividend stocks  MGA s call options yields outpay its next 2 quarterly dividends by over 5 to 1  Click here for a blow by blow outline of selling covered calls Cash Secured Puts  This is a strategy to use if you want to earn some option income now  with the potential of having a stock put   sold   to you in the future SMP has higher put options yields in the 2 trades listed below  SMP s August  15 00 put currently pays just over 10   on a 4 month term  for a very high annualized yield of over 33  You re basically getting paid to wait  with the possiblity of having SMP put sold to you at the  15 00 strike price  if SMP goes below  15 00 at or near expiration  However  your break even cost would be  13 45  due to the  1 55 put premium you received when you made the put sale  As with the calls  these put options pay a lot more than the dividends do over the next 4 5 months   Note  Put sellers don t receive any dividends  Unlike selling covered calls  when selling cash secured put options  you don t buy the underlying stock first  Instead  your broker will  secure   i e  hold  an amount equal to 100 times the strike price of the put option you sell  In the SMP example below  you d sell 1  15 00 put option Since each option corresponds to 100 shares of the underlying stock  your broker would hold  1500 00 for every  15 00 put option that you sell  At expiration time in August  you ll either end up with 100 shares of SMP being sold to you  or the  15 00 put will expire worthless Financials  Both firms have better Mgt   debt  and margin metrics

34206,255721,MGA,Pent Up Demand Driving Auto Rebound,opinion,The renaissance currently transpiring in the North American automotive sector will reward the investors that have the patience to see it through From 2000 to 2007  over 16 million vehicles were produced each year  In 2009  that number fell to a mere 10 million  Though it will take several more years to return to the production levels seen in the 2000s  analysts estimate that over 15 million vehicles will be produced next year What s driving the auto recovery is pent up demand  Consumers delayed large capital expenditures during the credit crisis  Now that economic conditions have improved  so too has consumer confidence and the decision to replace old vehicles  In 1995  the average vehicle on the road was 8 4 years old  Today it is almost 11 years old  Furthermore  favourable credit conditions have played a role in driving demand  In 2007  commercial banks in the US charged its customers 8  for auto loans but today that rate has dropped to almost 5  One way to participate in the auto rebound is through Magna International  MGA   With 47  of its 2011 revenues stemming from Detroit s General Motors  GM   Chrysler  and Ford  F   Magna is a direct play on the North American auto recovery  Though unattractive for years due to unfavourable corporate governance policies  the company today is unlike the one that existed before There are four company specific reasons for investors to be bullish First  the company has raised its dividend four times after reinitiating the payout back in 2010  Its current yield is 2 6   a full percentage point higher than a 10 year Canada bond  Because the company is paying out only 20  of its earnings to shareholders  there is room to grow the dividend down the road Second  management has its skin in the game  CEO Don Walker is the beneficiary to 617 142 common shares  including rights restricted shares   representing over  25 million Third  the company has a pristine balance sheet with  1 1B in net cash  This is equivalent to  4 29 per share  Without material long term debt and the interest payments that go along with it  Magna has greater flexibility that many other companies do not Fourth  after excluding the  4 29 in net cast from the  42 50 share price  the company is trading at only 6 8x its 2013 earnings  This is about half the S P 500 s 12 5x P E for next year Last  while Europe does indeed account for 30  of the company s revenues  90  of Magna s profits  before interest and taxes  emanate from North America Given these attributes  Magna is an undervalued stock that is attractive to value investors as the North American auto industry continues to rebound ,2012-10-02,Baskin Financial Blog,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pent-up-demand-driving-auto-rebound-138300,138300
