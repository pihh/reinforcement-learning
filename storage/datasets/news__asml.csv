4843,226358,ASML,Just How Cheap Is Applied Materials  AMAT  Stock ,opinion,"Shares of Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT   dipped recently on the back of weaker than expected guidance after the company reported its second quarter financial results at the end of last week  However  the chipmaking equipment power posted strong overall results  and the stock looks like a great value at the moment 
Recent Results
Applied Materials reported adjusted Q2 earnings of  1 22 per share  which not only topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents but also marked a 54  surge from the year ago period  Meanwhile  the company s revenues climbed by 29  to  4 57 billion  also beating our consensus estimate 
Investors reacted poorly to Applied Materials third quarter guidance  The company now expects to post adjusted earnings in the range of  1 13 to  1 21 per share  which  at the time  came in at the low end of our Zacks estimate of  1 14 per share  The firm also called for revenues to fall between  4 33 billion and  4 53 billion  which came in line with our  4 45 billion estimate 
Applied Materials  updated Q3 guidance is not devastatingly low  And the recent stock price dip  coupled with strong overall growth projections has made AMAT stock look rather attractive 
Recent Price Movement
Shares of Applied Materials are up roughly 11 7  over the last year  while the  Semiconductor Equipment   Wafer Fabrication  industry has surged nearly 30   Year to date  AMAT stock has dipped 1 8  against its industry s average climb of 8 6   Applied Materials stock closed Monday at  50 00 per share or almost 20  below its 52 week high of  62 40 per share With that said  AMAT stock is cheap at the moment based on its price alone  and also has a long way to go before it must face the added burden of having to jump into a new range  Furthermore  if we go back farther  investors will see that Applied Materials stock is on a stellar run 
 
Applied Materials stock has skyrocketed 243 8  over the past five years  which outpaces its industry s climb of 205   Investors will also see that during the last three years  AMAT stock has soared 149   against the S P 500 s 28  gain  Clearly  the stock has performed insanely well over the last several years  and its recent dip just makes it a bit more attractive on the value end 
Valuation
Coming into Tuesday  AMAT stock was trading at 10 9X forward 12 months earnings estimates  which marks a major discount compared the S P 500 s 16 9X average  Diving a bit deeper  Applied Materials has traded well below its industry s average over the last two years  This industry includes the likes of Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX    Advanced Energy Industries   NASDAQ AEIS    and ASML Holding  AS ASML  N V    NASDAQ ASML   
 
Applied Materials stock has traded as high as 17 4X over the past two years  with its median resting at 13 7X  The company is also currently trading almost directly in line with its two year low  which it touched briefly last week  Over the last five years  the lowest AMAT stock has ever traded at was 10 6X forward 12 months earnings estimates a figure it hit in late September of 2015 
Therefore  looking back over the last several years  investors can say with some degree of confidence that AMAT stock is attractive at its current valuation  if not downright cheap 
And a major reason that Applied Materials stock currently presents investors great value  on top of its recently declining stock price  is the company s earnings outlook  Applied Materials is projected to see its adjusted earnings surge by nearly 35  this quarter  while its full year EPS figure is expected to expand by nearly 41

4853,226368,ASML,StockBeat  Markets Rout as China Hints at Currency War,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Europe s stock markets faced a test of nerve on Monday   and resoundingly flunked it 
Markets succumbed to a general rout after China allowed its currency to fall below the closely watched level of 7 to the dollar for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008  a move aimed at neutralizing the effect of U S  tariffs on Chinese corporate profitability  Beijing also instructed state buyers to stop buying U S  agricultural produce for good measure 
China s step raises the risk of competitive devaluations elsewhere in a  race to the bottom   not least in the U S   where President Donald Trump has railed relentlessly against what he perceives to be the dollar s overvaluation and the Federal Reserve s unwillingness to end it by loosening monetary policy   
In signaling the breakdown of talks between the two countries on trade  it also makes it more likely that the 10  tariff hike on U S  imports of some  300 billion worth of Chinese goods will come into force in September  as threatened last week by Trump  At the very least  it pushes back the day when the U S  and China settle a trade dispute that has battered Europe s export sensitive blue chip boards 
By 5 AM ET  0900 GMT   the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 2 0  at a two month low of 370 40  while the German Dax was down 1 6   while the FTSE 100 was down 2 1  and the Italian FTSE MIB down 1 5

4856,226371,ASML,European shares tank after Trump threatens new China tariffs,news,"By Susan Mathew and Medha Singh
 Reuters    European stock indexes dived by as much as 2  on Friday as U S  President Donald Trump s warning of new tariffs on China sank stock markets worldwide and sent trade sensitive sectors like mining and carmakers into a tailspin 
Abruptly ending a temporary trade truce between the two countries  Trump said he would impose a 10  tariffs on  300 billion of Chinese exports to the United States from September 1 
Spooking investors further  Bloomberg reported that Trump is scheduled to make a statement on trade with the European Union at 1745 GMT on Friday 
That sent the pan European STOXX 600  STOXX  down 1 9  to a six week low  with the basic material sector plunging 3 9   and the auto  SXAP  and tech sectors  SX8P  sliding 2 7  
 The announcement will only serve to create additional downward pressure on business confidence   said Mark Haefele  chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management wrote in a note 
 If businesses stop hiring  as a result   this would greatly increase the risk of a recession  
Chipmakers Siltronic  DE WAFGn   Infineon  DE IFXGn   STMicro  MI STM  and ASML  AS ASML  dropped by 4  to 6  while France s CAC 40  FCHI  and Germany s DAX  GDAXI   often regarded as among the most sensitive markets to trade nerves  lost around 2 3  
Most of Europe s main markets were set for their worst week since a slide in May  when a sudden break down in trade talks between the two countries hammered markets 
A rally since then had been fueled by hopes that major central banks would adopt looser monetary policy to offset the trade war s impact on growth  but the European Central Bank and the U S  Federal Reserve both disappointed investors last month with stances that were more cautious than expected 
Adding to the auto sector s woes  Italian tyremaker Pirelli  MI PIRC  slipped 4 6  after cutting revenue guidance for the second time this year  joining a string of suppliers hit by a broader auto industry downturn 
 We now see a higher risk that tariffs could also be placed on auto imports   UBS s Haefele wrote   Back in May  Trump announced that a decision on auto tariffs would be delayed by six months to allow time for negotiations  and it appears that little progress has been made since then

4878,226393,ASML,Is Lam Research Overvalued ,opinion,"Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   shares have traded at a higher valuation than the S P 500 and also the industry to which it belongs  But in 2016  the shares started widening this lead  a trend that has continued through 2017 

 

 
The company s technological prowess is a given  which can generate solid growth  But given the sharp rise in prices  evident in the charts above   it makes sense to see if the shares are overvalued    
One thing to keep in mind in this respect is the general valuation of shares  The charts below illustrate that both the S P 500 and the industry are trading close to their respective 52 week highs  So LRCX trading in the same range isn t an anomaly 

 

 
P E
The forward 12 months price to earnings ratio for LRCX is currently 13 04 compared to the S P 500 average of 18 24 and the X industry average of 16 91  Highs and lows are also lower  The median P E is also lower at 13 73  Moreover  the trend lines indicate that LRCX is clearly undervalued both with respect to the S P 500 and the industry 

 

 
P S
The trailing 12 months price to sales ratio tells a slightly different story  The P S ratio for LRCX is currently 3 86  which is higher than the S P 500 s 3 15 but much lower than the X industry s 6 25  The median of 3 34 is slightly ahead of the S P 500 s 3 04 but well below the industry s 5 78  The highs and lows also indicate that LRCX is overvalued with respect to the S P 500 but undervalued with respect to the industry 

 

 
How About Its Peers 
Lam Research s closest competitor is Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT   so let s consider that first  Historically  AMAT has traded well below its 52 week high  but the current level of demand has changed that  So it is also trading at around its 52 week high  AMAT s current P E is lower than LRCX but the median is same  Both the high of 16 50 and the low of 12 37 exceed Lam s  This indicates a similar valuation for the two peers 

 

 

 
LRCX also compares favorably with ASML Holding  AS ASML  NV   NASDAQ ASML    another semiconductor equipment maker  ASML  which is also trading very close to its 52 week high  has a current P E of 26 68 and median P E of 26 63  both of which are significantly higher than LRCX  The price to sales ratio tells a similar tale 

 

 

 
Conclusion
From the above  we can conclude that Lam Research  which carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is undervalued  You can see the   Applied Materials also has a Zacks Rank  1 while ASML is ranked  2  Buy

4879,226394,ASML,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include Include LivaNova  Chatham Lodging  ASML  Heico And Etsy,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 20  2017   Stocks in this week s article include LivaNova  Nasdaq    NASDAQ LIVN        Chatham Lodging Trust  NYSE    NYSE CLDT        ASML Holding  AS ASML   Nasdaq    NASDAQ ASML        Heico  Corp  NYSE    NYSE HEI       and Etsy  Inc   Nasdaq    NASDAQ ETSY       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin Matras The Power of New Analyst CoverageBroker recommendations    love them or hate them  they do have their place  And we all look at them eventually Whether you re a small individual investor or a large institutional portfolio manager  or somewhere in between   who doesn t like it when a stock gets an upgraded rating or sees a new analyst jumping in with coverage  We all do   Although I should note that  in general  the change in the average broker recommendation is a better indicator than the actual recommendation itself  Anyway  today I want to talk about companies that receive new analyst coverage One of the things that generates analyst coverage is investor interest  How else can you explain the increased analyst coverage for Facebook  NASDAQ FB   a company that s only been public for 2 1 2 yrs   in comparison to a company like GE  public for more than 40 yrs   And as new coverage is initiated  it becomes more visible  which in turn means potentially more demand  read higher prices  This is often the case because analysts almost always initiate coverage with a positive recommendation   Why write a research report on a company not widely followed only to say it stinks  And when it comes to companies with little to no analyst coverage  that one new recommendation can sometimes give portfolio managers the validation they need to build a position   And the more money they can invest  the more they can potentially influence prices  The best way to use this information is to look for companies with analyst coverage that has increased over the last 4 weeks Simply look at the number of analyst recommendations now in comparison to the number of analyst recommendations 4 weeks ago  An increase in coverage is bullish whereas a decrease in coverage is bearish It s typically more bullish if the increase went from none to one or if the coverage was minimal to begin with   Going from 25 to 26 isn t going to have the same impact because that 26th analyst isn t discovering something  new    But increased coverage is better than decreased coverage    assuming the coverage is positive of course Here s a screen to try   Number of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago This shows stocks where new coverage has recently been added    Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago By  less than   I mean  better than  four weeks ago    And I m applying all of the above parameters to stocks with Prices greater than or equal to 5  most money managers won t even look at a stock under  5  and Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if there s not enough volume  even individual investors won t want it  Here are 5 stocks from this week s screen  Nasdaq       LivaNova from 2 analysts four weeks ago to 5  NYSE       Chatham Lodging Trust from 3 analysts four

4880,226395,ASML,Here s Why On Semiconductor  ON  Should Be In Your Portfolio,opinion,"On Semiconductor Corp    NASDAQ ON   is currently a well performing technology stock and a increase in share price and strong fundamentals signal its bullish run  Therefore  if you haven t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet  it s time you add the stock to your portfolio 
The company has performed well so far this year and has the potential to carry on the momentum in the near term 
Here are a few reasons why the stock is worth a buy 
An Outperformer
A look at the company s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse year to date  On Semiconductor has gained 50 7   significantly outperforming the  s gain of 24 0  

Solid Rank   VGM Score
On Semiconductor currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a VGM Score of A  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors  Thus  the stock appears to be a convincing investment proposition at the moment 
Northward Estimate Revisions
For the current year  eight estimates have moved north over the past 90 days against no southward revisions  reflecting analysts  confidence in the company  Over the same period  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 6 1  
Strong Growth Prospects
The company s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings of  1 39 reflects year over year growth of 75 95   Moreover  earnings are expected to register 13 73  growth in 2018  The stock has long term expected earnings per share growth rate of 18 1  
Solid Growth Drivers
On Semiconductor is an original equipment manufacturer  OEM  of a wide range of discrete and embedded semiconductor components 
Notably  the company s acquisition of Fairchild  which was completed on Sep 2016  has aided top line growth  Management expects to witness further growth in Fairchild s revenue contribution in the near term  driven by the company s strong foothold in the power semiconductor market post the acquisition 
Moreover  the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems  ADAS  is growing at a steady pace and is expected to reach  42 4 billion by 2021  per MarketsandMarkets  We believe the accelerated growth of the ADAS market has increased the adoption rate of the related applications provided by On Semiconductor  thereby improving its growth opportunity in the automotive market 
Further improving end markets  less customer and product concentration have aided the company s impressive performance  Growing demand for the company s CMOS image sensor is also a key catalyst ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and Consensus

4886,226401,ASML,Make or break  second quarter results will test Europe s confidence,news,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan  Josephine Mason and Danilo Masoni
LONDON  Reuters    Second quarter earnings in Europe could turn be a reality check for the stock market after its biggest rally in more than two decades 
European stocks  STOXX  have risen 15  so far this year  fueled by hopes for a U S  China trade truce and by a shift to dovish monetary policies at U S  and European central banks 
Investors will now check the pulse of corporate Europe as the second quarter results season gets under way  Europe s most valuable technology company  SAP  DE SAPG   semiconductor company ASML  AS ASML  and Swiss drugmaker  Novartis   S NOVN  are all due to report next week 
With valuations stretched in many sectors and signs that the gains are running out of steam    the pan European STOXX 600  STOXX  is set for its first weekly drop in six weeks    positive earnings will be critical to sustain the rally  analysts  strategists and asset managers said 
With some growth and quality sectors  priced for perfection   investors may not be in a forgiving mood if results disappoint  said Barclays Capital equity strategist Emmanuel Cau 
 What I fear is we have more companies saying  well  we got through the first half but we have got no idea what s happening in the second half   said Neil Dwane  global strategist and portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors 
 And then the market is going to say  Blimey  Why am I all the way up here if I can t see the rolling hills of 11  earnings growth in the next 12 months   
Companies listed in Europe benchmark STOXX 600 will report earnings growth of 0 8  for the quarter  according to the most recent consensus compiled by I B E S Refinitiv 
That marks an improvement from the first quarter  when earnings fell 2   but it s a big decline from the same quarter of last year  when earnings rose 9 7  
It s also down from growth of more than 3 6  expected for the quarter two months ago  In the past week alone  1 percentage point has been cut from the consensus 
A warning this week from BASF  DE BASFn  sent shivers through stocks  underscoring concern about the region s corporate health amid worries about an economic slowdown and damage from the prolonged U S  China trade conflict 
Companies in defensive and growth business  from consumer staples to technology have been investor favorites during the rate euphoria  but they look particularly vulnerable  Cyclical stocks like autos and banks already reflect a grim outlook

OUTPERFORMING U S 
There is a silver lining  For the first time since late 2017  European companies will outperform their U S  counterparts  which are expected to show an earnings contraction  A lot of that stems from skewed year on year comparisons after the White House introduced hefty tax cuts 
Europe s economy has also started surprising to the upside  while the U S  economy has underwhelmed  according to Citigroup analysis 
 Graphic  Citi   
But otherwise things have been increasingly downbeat  Heading into the earnings  3 5 times more companies have been making negative announcements than positive for the second quarter  the highest since the first quarter of 2016  according to Cau 
 Q2 earnings are unlikely to impress  and despite lower expectations  stocks may not all be immune to disappointment   he said 
Aside from BASF  airlines from Lufthansa  DE LHAG  to Ryanair  I RYA   German carmaker  Daimler   DE DAIGn  and chipmaker Siltronic  DE WAFGn  have all warned of weaker than expected results 
After a brief hiatus in May  analysts have resumed cutting earnings forecasts even as stock markets have rallied  Expectations for full year growth are dimming as well    the consensus is 4 1   the lowest since 2016 and half the levels forecast at the start of the year

CAPEX AND OUTLOOKS
Aside from headline numbers  investors will also be keeping tabs on capital expenditure plans for signs that the protracted U S  China trade conflict and worries about trade threats spreading to Europe are curbing spending 
 We find there are very clear spillovers from Chinese economic activity toward  developed market  capex   said Elga Bartsch  head of macro research at BlackRock 
Even with the reduced expectations for the second quarter  don t rule out bad surprises in the second half 




 We re likely to witness more warnings in the later part of the year than during the second quarter reporting season    said Vincent Manuel  chief investment officer at wealth manager CA Indosuez ",2019-07-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/make-or-break-secondquarter-results-will-test-europes-confidence-1921643,1921643

4912,226427,ASML,U S  court rules in favor of Dutch ASML in IP theft case against Xtal,news," Reuters    Dutch chip equipment maker ASML Holding  AS ASML  NV said on Saturday a U S  court had issued its final judgment in favor of ASML in an intellectual property theft case against U S  software maker Xtal 
The Santa Clara County Superior Court in California awarded ASML  845 million along with an injunction  ASML said 
The Netherlands based company said the judgment would be uncollectible as Xtal is in bankruptcy  but under a settlement arrangement ASML will end up owning most or all of Xtal s intellectual property through the bankruptcy process 
As part of the injunction  the court ordered Xtal not to conduct development activities on its software products that ASML says contain the Dutch company s intellectual property 
ASML said the injunction also bars Xtal from continuing to work in the same field of business as Brion  ASML s computational lithography product  for a period of time 
In April  ASML disclosed that former employees took company secrets to Xtal  which is funded by entities in South Korea and China and set up to sell a competing product to an existing ASML customer in South Korea ",2019-05-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/us-court-rules-in-favor-of-dutch-asml-in-ip-theft-case-against-xtal-1856485,1856485

4914,226429,ASML,Q4 Earnings Season  Revenues On The Weak Side,opinion,"The picture emerging from the 2014 Q4 earnings season at this admittedly early stage is one of weakness  with earnings and revenue growth rates tracking below levels that we have been seeing in other recent periods  But weak results from the Finance sector has an outsized effect on the aggregate earnings picture results at this stage  We don t have as representative a sample of results outside of the Finance sector  but the picture isn t that bad once Finance is excluded from the aggregate picture  That said  revenues are on the weak side  whether looked at with or without the Finance sector 
The rest of this week is the busiest of this reporting cycle thus far  with 37 S P 500 members reporting Q4 results in the next three days  The reporting cycle really accelerates next week  with more than 140 S P 500 members coming out with results  This week s reporting docket is comprised of a diverse group of operators  ranging from General Electric  NYSE GE    to Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX     and Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ     
The Q4 Scorecard  as of 1 20 2015 
 We have seen Q4 results from 52 S P 500 members that combined account for 16 3  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are down  0 2  from the same period last year  with 73 1  beating EPS estimates  Total revenues are up  0 9  from the same period last year and 42 3  of them are coming ahead with top line estimates  The table below shows the current scorecard for the S P 500 index
 This is weak performance than we have seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters  The charts below compare the Q4 growth rates and beat ratios for these 52 companies with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters  As you can see  the earnings and revenue growth rates are weaker than what we have been seeing in other recent quarters  With respect to positive surprises  they are more numerous for earnings and less so for revenues 
The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of companies in 2014 Q3 and the average for the preceding four quarters 
 Finance has the most weightage in the results thus far  with Q4 reports from 36 8  of the sector s total market capitalization already out  Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are down  10 5  on  3 9  lower revenues  with 64 3  beating EPS estimates and only 28 6  coming ahead of top line expectations  This is the weakest performance that we have seen from these Finance sector companies in other recent quarters  thanks to tough comparisons at Citigroup  NYSE C     and J P  Morgan  NYSE JPM     Had it not been for Citigroup and J P  Morgan  the Finance sector earnings would be up  2 3  from the same period last year  Keeping the Finance sector out of the results thus far  total earnings for the rest of the S P 500 companies are up  8 8  on  3 5  higher revenues  which is actually better than what we have seen from the same group of ex Finance companies in other recent quarters  The charts below present the aggregate data thus far on an ex Finance basis

What this shows is that the Q4 growth rate would be a lot better had it not been for the drag from the Finance  That said  the growth rates would still be on the weaker side relative to other recent quarters   the Q4 ex Finance earnings growth rate is better than Q3  but below what these same companies reported on average in the preceding four quarters  The revenue growth rate is weak relative to Q3 as well as the 4 quarter average 
The Composite Q4 Picture
 Combining the actual results for the 52 S P 500 companies that have reported with the 448 still to come reports  total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  1 6  on  0 7  lower revenues  Four sectors   Transportation  Medical  Utilities and Business Services  are expected to have double digit earnings growth in Q4  while five sectors are expected to have lower total earnings this quarter relative to the year earlier period  The Energy sector has the weakest growth profile for understandable reasons  with total earnings for the sector expected to be down  22 8  on  15 9  lower revenues  The table below presents the summary picture for Q4 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the Q3 earnings season 

Falling Estimates
 Estimates for the current period  2015 Q1  have started coming down at an accelerated pace  with total earnings for the quarter now expected to be up  1 3   down from the  4  growth rate expected in mid December  As was the case in Q4  Energy is the biggest driver of this negative revisions trend  While total Q1 earnings for the energy sector were expected to be down  only   35 6  in mid December  they are now expected to be  52 4  year over year  Given the persistently weak oil prices  there is likely more room for downward adjustments to these estimates  Estimates for Q4 went through an even sharper negative revision process  though almost half of the drop in estimates was due to developments in the energy sector  The Q4 energy sector results that we have seen thus far are fairly strong  with total earnings for the 11 5  of the sector s market capitalization that have reported results are up  25 1  on  10 4  higher revenues  But this growth picture will look very different once the major oil companies come out with Q4 results in the coming days  
Here is a list of the 152 companies reporting this week  including 48 S P 500 members

5035,226550,ASML,U S  chipmakers may give clues on China hazard,news,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters     Intel Corp   O INTC  operates mostly outside the Apple sphere  and that is exactly why whatever it says next week about business in its vital Chinese market matters so much for investors  Apple  O AAPL  rattled global markets this month when the iPhone maker cut its revenue outlook for the first time in 15 years  blaming factors like the U S  China trade dispute and a slowdown in the Chinese economy  Upcoming quarterly scorecards from Intel  Texas Instruments  O TXN  and other chipmakers  as well as  Ford Motor Co   N F   will shed light on whether Apple made a convenient excuse for its own troubles or revealed a strengthening headwind faced by global companies that rely on China for a big chunk of their sales   They should give us a good gauge of what is happening in China beyond smartphones because Texas Instruments is mostly industrials and autos  and Intel is PCs and servers  and they re not being driven by the Apple smartphone situation   said Daniel Morgan  a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta   Underscoring Wall Street s sensitivity to China trade  the S P 500  SPX  jumped 1 3 percent on Friday after a report that China has offered to go on a six year buying spree to ramp up U S  imports in order to reconfigure the relationship between the two countries   N   U S  stock markets will be closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr  holiday   China accounts for almost a quarter of Intel s revenue  while modem chips for iPhones  the focus of recent concerns about Apple  account for just a tiny part of Intel s business   While most Intel processors sold in China are used to build laptops and servers for export  Chinese consumers and companies also purchase many of those devices  With the tariff war already taking a toll on China s trade sector and increasing the risk of a sharper slowdown in the world s second largest economy  U S  multinationals will face pressure to be cautious about their outlooks for 2019   Anyone doing business in China  especially if you are an American company   I don t think you can come out with super positive guidance   said Stephen Massocca  Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco   Texas Instruments and programmable chipmaker Xilinx  O XLNX   both reporting on Wednesday  and Intel  reporting on Thursday  are among the S P 500 companies most reliant on China for their revenue  Investors will listen closely to what those companies may say about how the China trade dispute and the country s cooling economic expansion are affecting demand for their products  Also on Wednesday  Ford s quarterly report will give investors a glimpse of the automaker s progress trying to reverse a sales slump in China  the world s biggest car market  Other chipmakers and related companies reporting next week include ASML Holding  AS ASML   Lam Research  O LRCX   SK Hynix  KS 000660  and  Western Digital   O WDC    LOWER EXPECTATIONS Fears about the impact of the trade conflict on U S  technology companies crystallized this month after Apple  O AAPL  cut its sales forecast  blaming China s economy  Diminished expectations for chipmakers account for most of a recent steep drop in expectations for tech sector earnings growth in 2019  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  In October  analysts on average forecast S P 500 technology companies would increase their earnings per share by 8 5 percent in 2019  according to Refinitiv  But expectations for 2019 tech EPS growth have since withered to just 2 2 percent  Still  many Silicon Valley companies remain in favor among investors  Technology was the third most recommended sector among 13 big research firms recently surveyed by Reuters  behind healthcare and financials  With the S P 500 recently trading at 15 times expected earnings  down from 18 times a year ago  a key argument for Wall Street bulls is that the stock market has become undervalued after December s selloff  But if Apple s warning about slow China demand is repeated by Intel  Texas Instruments and others  the S P 500 may appear less of a bargain at current levels  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  SOX  is down about 15 percent from its high in March 2018  as chipmakers struggle with a cooling smartphone industry and slower demand for memory chips used in cars  industrial equipment and other markets   While Wall Street gained this month due to optimism that the trade dispute will be resolved  China for years has struggled to maintain its pace of economic growth  Even a quick end to the trade dispute would not guarantee a return to strong results from U S  companies  China operations   Trade may be pointed to as a reason for issues with input costs or weakness in sales  but I think that just as important is the fact that the economy in China is slowing  and they are incremental buyers for both semiconductors and cars   said Patrick Palfrey  an earnings analyst at  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN   In Intel s October quarterly conference call  Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said the company was working to reduce the impact on its supply chain from potential new tariffs  Analysts  on average  expect Intel to report fourth quarter revenue up 11 percent to  19 billion  and to forecast 2019 revenue will rise 3 percent to  73 2 billion  according to Refinitiv  
Analysts expect Texas Instruments to grow net income by 10 percent in the December quarter then shrink in 2019  according to Refinitiv ",2019-01-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-chipmakers-may-give-clues-on-china-hazard-1751169,1751169

5069,226584,ASML,Semiconductor Stock Outlook,opinion,"The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver  enabler and indicator of technological progress  Developments in the industry determine the way we work  transport ourselves  communicate  entertain ourselves and respond to our environment  The PCs we work on  the cars we drive  the phones we communicate with  the electronic gadgets on which we watch movies  listen to music and play games on  and the planes and weapons used to transport or protect us use semiconductor devices 
 As environmental issues have become more of a concern today  semiconductor devices are being made to reduce power consumption  reduce heat dissipation  capture solar energy  create more efficient lighting solutions and so forth Current Drivers Considering the broad application of semiconductor devices  end markets have a significant impact on the industry  Very significant among these is the emerging Internet of Things  IoT  market  which has grown on the back of cloud storage and the growing interconnectedness of things  IDC estimates that the market will grow at a 7 9  CAGR from 2013 to 2020  Prime beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry are likely to be Intel Corp  ARM Holdings and STMicroelectronics  
The most important traditional markets that have been converging to a certain extent over the past few years are computing and consumer  Of these  PC and notebook growth has been contained by the advent of tablets  but this is less of a factor in developed markets today  So upgrades in these markets will lead to some growth  offsetting the tablet pressure in developing markets and boosting semiconductor sales 
Intel is the prime beneficiary here  although others will benefit to varying degrees  Intel is also the prime beneficiary of the strength on the cloud data center storage networking side  but ARM and Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  are expected to find niches 
Important drivers here include the need for denser  lower cost and more secure data centers and networks  and more intelligent network control  leading to the growth of software defined networking  SDN   Spending on smart grids and intelligent metering applications is expected to see particularly strong growth  19  CAGR through 2016 according to IC Insights  
Tablets  phones and other mobile devices primarily run on ARM designs that are licensed by companies like Broadcom  NASDAQ BRCM   Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD   Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  and Samsung LONDON 0593xq  to make semiconductor devices  But consumer also includes many other items  such as 3D printers  health and fitness devices  smart watches  Ultra HD television displays and smart thermostats that will see the strongest growth this year  108    albeit off a small base  CEA estimates  
Smartphone revenue  the single largest driver of CE sales  will grow 5  while tablets will see a 1  decline  But both smartphones and tablet units will grow  meaning greater chip consumption 
Wireless infrastructure builds  3G  4G LTE  are driving the communications market  Increasing data volumes and connectivity issues  network congestion  power reliability  privacy and security  drive semiconductor sales 
Another market with good prospects is automotive  where safety  infotainment  navigation and fuel efficiency requirements continue to drive demand for semiconductors  Growth in industrial applications is related to automation in the manufacturing process and largely tied to GDP growth  so this is less of a driver today 
Medical is something of a niche market  so it has a limited impact on overall semiconductor sales  The previous cycle had many players diversifying into these slower growing but less volatile markets  This has resulted in a large number of slower growing players within the industry that generally continue to generate decent cash flows  Other secular growth markets include aerospace and defense that are  however  dependent on government decisions and policies  The need to lower costs and generate stable profit margins led many device makers to focus on the development of designs while outsourcing fabrication to Asian players  Intel  NASDAQ INTC  and Texas Instruments Incorporated  NASDAQ TXN  are the most notable exceptions and were later followed by Globalfoundries  which was formed out of AMD s manufacturing operations  This led to the growth of major Asian foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  NYSE TSM   United Microelectronics  NYSE UMC  and Semiconductor Manufacturing  NYSE SMI  as well as a large number of companies involved in backend operations like packing and assembly  IC Insights estimates that the pure play foundries grew 16  in 2013 and will grow another 14  in to generate  41 2 billion  Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex process and requires specialized machinery  So equipment makers comprise an important segment where revenues will grow 23 2  in 2014 according to SEMI  Gartner estimates that Applied Materials Inc  NASDAQ AMAT   ASML Holding  NASDAQ ASML   Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   Tokyo Electron and KLA Tencor  NASDAQ KLAC   remain the top foundries with Intel  Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung being the top spenders on equipment over the next few years Component Forecast IC Insights estimates that a modest recovery in the PC market will help drive a 3  increase in microprocessor sales for PC server embedded markets in 2014 after two years of decline  On the other hand  cell phone application processors will grow 19  with total microprocessor sales growing 9   DRAM supply is likely to be short of demand this year because of its application in mobile devices like tablets and smartphones on the one hand and the limited investment in manufacturing facilities on the other  This is expected to strengthen prices  NAND demand is expected to remain very strong again in 2014  but considering the fire at Hynix that diverted some capacity to DRAM  there could be some supply constraints despite the fact that NAND manufacturers are adding capacity as well  So prices may be expected to remain strong  SSD demand will also spike  as will its supply  iSuppli expects growth in the standard logic market  and considering the slight recovery in the PC market  which uses the most standard logic   this may be correct  Stronger automotive and industrial sales  which while much smaller than the PC market will also continue to push consumption of standard logic components  Earnings reports and outlooks from leading companies indicate that the market remains strong overall with limited chances of channel stuffing 
 Gartner says that memory will be the strongest driver through 2018 driven by SSD adoption at the data center and favorable DRAM pricing for now  Logic  driven by smartphone and ultramobile demand  and FinFET transition over the next few years  will be the second largest driver  According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics  WSTS   there should be positive worldwide semiconductor sales growth of 6 5  in 2014  previous 4 1    followed by 3 3  growth in 2015  previous 3 4    Asia  Europe  the Americas and Japan will grow 9 3   7 9   2 1  and  1 3   respectively  The semiconductor industry is made up of 11 sub sectors within the Technology sector  which is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The following table seeks to explain the position of companies in the semiconductor market in the context of the Zacks Industry Rank  We rank the 264 industries across the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit    The outlook for industries positioned  88 or lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative   As indicated in the table above  the first 5 semiconductor segments are positive  the next 4 are neutral  while the rest are negative  The average rank of stocks in each sub sector is indicated in the last column  Note  Zacks Rank  1 for individual stocks denotes Strong Buy   2 is Buy   3 means Hold   4 Sell and  5 Strong Sell  Earnings Trends The broader Technology sector  of which Semiconductors constitute a part has just started reporting Q4 results  While the revenue beat ratio of 42 9  was just short of the S P 500 average of 44 4   the earnings beat ratio of 71 4  bettered the 69 4  average for the industry  It is too early to tell a trend at this stage  but financial discipline and generally strong demand are the likely reasons for the positive comparison  Total earnings for the sector were up 18 5  year over year  5 6  in Q3   Total revenues were up 6 4  from last year  6 9  in the Q3   Technology sector earnings are expected to be up 8 5  in 2014 and 12 3  in 2015  Revenues are expected to grow 6 6  and 5 8   respectively ",2015-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/semiconductor-stock-outlook-238983,238983

5114,226629,ASML,Take Five  World markets themes for the week ahead,news,"By Marc Jones LONDON  Reuters    Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them   1 TRADE WAR GAMES  China releases quarterly GDP data next week and it should make interesting reading now that the first salvos have been exchanged in a trade war with the United States   It is expected to show growth easing very marginally to 6 7 percent    no big deal of course and perhaps even a positive if it is part of China s multi year drive to rein in over zealous credit expansion and force discipline in less regulated parts of the banking industry   But the broader backdrop is the simmering trade tensions  Economists suspect the direct impact from the two sets of U S  tariffs aimed at Beijing    the  50 bln underway and another set of targeted tariffs on  200 bln of imports    could drag China s GDP down by 0 3 percentage points in the longer run  It comes too after data on Friday showed that China enjoyed its biggest ever trade surplus in dollar terms with the United States last month  and following a 6 percent fall in the yuan since late March    GRAPHIC  China s trade has limited role in GDP     2 FLAT OUT U S  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee on July 17  Powell s testimony will be closely watched as the Fed tries to navigate towards higher interest rates at a pace that keeps inflation under control but without going so far or fast that it slows the economy   Already  investors have been raising red flags about the U S  Treasury yield curve  which is at its flattest in nearly 11 years and at risk of inversion  An inverted yield curve involves short term interest rates rising above long rates  which is typically a precursor of recession as it reflects tightening monetary policy   Powell s last response on the yield curve was   It s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles   before suggesting that this time was different  Investors will see if he has changed his tune   GRAPHIC  U S  yield curve      3 UNFINNISHED BUSINESS U S  President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin hold their first summit in Helsinki on Monday  Geopolitical analysts expect Putin to urge Trump to soften sanctions imposed over Ukraine  while Trump has said he will press Putin on everything from allegations of meddling in the 2016 U S  election to the war in Syria  European leaders will be watching the outcome closely  especially after Trump called Germany a  captive  of Russia at a testy NATO summit in Belgium  due to its plans for a major new gas pipeline  EU chiefs have their own plans too  Jean Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk head to China on Monday for meetings with its leaders where there might be a show of unity against Trump s trade war maneuvers   GRAPHIC  Russian rouble vs the dollar     4 EUROPE S FINAL COUNTDOWN Europe s second quarter corporate earnings season begins in earnest next week with analysts predicting robust average growth of 8 1 percent year on year   The figures will be heavily flattered by the energy sector  where profits have been turbo charged by the near 50 percent leap in oil prices over the last year   To show just how good it has been  oil and gas firms are expected to report earnings growth of 72 percent  according to data from Thomson Reuters I B E S  Stripping that out would see overall European estimates drop to more modest 2 9 percent   The 8 1 percent headline figure is also well below the 20 9 percent growth expected from U S  earnings season which is already into its stride  But as in the United States  investors will be watching for any signs that trade war worries have dented confidence  particularly if firms delay capital expenditure plans   Those that will set the tone next week include industrial firms  Sandvik   ST SAND  and SKF  ST SKFb   tech firms SAP  DE SAPG  and ASML  AS ASML  and miners BHP Billiton  L BLT  and  Anglo American   L AAL   which both report sales figures   GRAPHIC  Stoxx 600 Q2 earnings IBES     5 LIRA UNDER PRESSURE Turkey s new finance minister Berat Albayrak  son in law of the country s President Tayyip Erdogan  is expected to travel to Argentina next week for the G20 finance ministers meeting on Friday  The trip will be his first international outing since Erdogan gave him the job as one of his first moves when he got his new powers as executive president  Turkey s lira crashed to a record low after that decision and markets will be watching Albayrak s performance in Buenos Aires closely  Any sign of a slip up likely to crank up the pressure on the lira ahead of Turkey s next central bank meeting on July 24

5165,226680,ASML,Top Trade Ideas For The Week Of February 1  2016,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
ASML  O ASML 
ASML  fell hard out of a consolidation zone at the end of the year  It made a bottom in the middle of January and then bounced  that was followed by a short consolidation and then a bullish Marubozu candle Friday to resistance  The RSI is moving into the bullish zone and the MACD is rising and bullish  Look for follow through Monday to participate 
BP  L BP 

BP staged a rally in October that fizzled out before the 200 day SMA  It then pulled back and bottomed again  at a lower low in January before the latest leg higher  Friday it ended at resistance again  but with a rising RSI and MACD  Look for follow through Monday to participate 
Fifth Third Bancorp  O FITB 
Fifth Third Bancorp flirted around 21  an important level for a long time  all of 2015  Some times a bit below and sometimes a bit above  But that changed when the calendar turned to 2016 and the stock started a nosedive  losing 25  in 3 weeks  That resulted in an oversold condition on the RSI and MACD  Now it is consolidating as the RSI and MACD turn back up  Look for a move over the consolidation to participate for a move higher 
Goldman Sachs  N GS 
Goldman Sachs is a bottoming and reversal trade as well  This one has already stated higher and has a MACD that is crossed up with an RSI that is climbing near the mid line  The bullish candle Friday finishing near the high supports more upside  Look for follow through to participate 
Tractor Supply  O TSCO 
Tractor Supply fell out of a rising trend in August with the market  From there it consolidated before a failed break to the upside and return under resistance  Now a possible double bottom has formed and the stock is back at resistance with a rising RSI and MACD  Look for a move higher to participate 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  after completing a horrible January at least saw it end on a good note in the equity markets 
On to February and look for gold to continue higher in the short run while crude oil maintains a short run bias higher in the downtrend  The US Dollar Index continues to look ready to explode higher while US Treasuries may be ready to consolidate in the uptrend  The Shanghai Composite still looks like it is headed lower while Emerging Markets are biased to the upside in their downtrend 
Volatility is drifting lower towards normal levels relieving some of the pressure on the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts all had great moves higher Friday and look to continue in the short term  while the weekly charts showed strong signals of reversals higher  The QQQ is the only short term chart that did not break resistance  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

5167,226682,ASML,These 2 Semiconductor Stocks Are Still Hot Post Earnings,opinion,"Investors with a short term investment plan may not be interested in semiconductor equipment stocks  They rarely see news making variation quarter to quarter and the direction of their results can be predicted in advance  That s because major equipment buyers  their customers  offer capex estimates which in combination with market research data on new fabs coming to market leave little to imagination 
But that just means they are suitable for longer term calls on whether to buy or sell 
A negative sentiment follows when individual memory and logic makers and specialized foundries have equipped their fabs and will only make moderate purchases to supplement existing equipment  They will try to make their fabs as efficient as possible to continue without major investment for as long as possible because building fresh capacity is extremely expensive 
But things turn positive when there s good reason for customers to upgrade existing equipment either due to technology inflections like shrinking geometries  3D NAND  etc or due to increasing demand  So that s when we need to take a look at the markets driving the demand for such technologies  whether such demand is likely to sustain and for how long 
Since foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor   NYSE TSM    logic makers like Intel   NASDAQ INTC    memory makers like Samsung  KS 005930  and Micron   NASDAQ MU   are all trying to bring to market products based on new technologies and China is trying to get a number of fabs and foundries online both this year and the next  the spending environment remains positive 
Add to this the fact that concepts like cloud computing  machine learning and artificial intelligence are greatly increasing the need for computational efficiency in data centers while the concept of IoT and the resultant data that is generated is raising demand for a humongous number of chips that must be manufactured  Besides  industries that have thus far stayed away from automation and technology  mining is an example  are beginning to consider the investment to drive efficiency in operations 
Unlike semiconductor makers  semiconductor equipment makers still aren t too many and it s still a handful of companies that rake in most of the revenue and profits  Because semiconductor equipment is extremely expensive to develop  this concentration of capabilities is not likely to go away any time soon 
Of course  China does have a semiconductor focus  but current efforts are focused on internal production of its huge chip consumption  So it remains a buyer of equipment and will remain so for a few years   
With that backdrop  let s jump to the stocks 
Three semiconductor equipment companies have reported September quarter results and there s a couple more left to round out the top five  Of the companies that reported  Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   and KLA Tencor   NASDAQ KLAC   beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while ASML Holding   NASDAQ ASML   missed 
Lam has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   you can see   and VGM score  A   Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved up 21 6  since it reported results last week  The March quarter estimate is up 12 0  LAM RESEARCH Price and EPS Surprise    
KLA has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and VGM score  A   Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved up 10 3   Since it reported results last week  estimates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are up 2 4  and 2 1   respectively KLA TENCOR CORP Price and EPS Surprise   ASML may have missed estimates and seen moderate correction in forward estimates  but the company has received a number of orders for EUV machines that will be a positive going forward  Growth can be a challenge however since EUV machines generate lower margins  so can result in a negative mix if legacy products see weaker sales 
The company has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and VGM score  F   Growth can be a challenge  however  since EUV machines generate lower margins  so can result in a negative mix 
Last Words
Investors should note that the Zacks Rank is a short term recommendation covering the next 1 3 months although today s picks also look good as long term investments

5169,226684,ASML,Opening Bell  Global Tech Sell Off Resumes  USD  Pound Pressured,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Key Events

Friday s US tech selloff survived the weekend and has spread to the Asian markets from Seoul to Hong Kong  and continued straight into European trading 
The pound stabilized  after Friday s crash on the UK s mixed election results  However it failed to bounce against resistance  suggesting it may continue to decline 
The dollar s rise on Friday against a weak euro and pound is proving to be nothing more than a correction  it is trading according to its downtrend 

Global Affairs
The tech sector selloff  that started in the US on Friday  when FANGs and related NASDAQ stocks fell  continued this morning in Asian markets  led by Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  and Tencent Holdings  HK 0700  

Friday s tech sell off was ignited by Robert Boroujerdi  global chief investment officer at  NYSE Goldman Sachs   who warned that extremely low volatility after high valuations may leave investors holding assets that are overvalued  While a negative volume divergence is a red flag on any day  when the US s US s FAAMG tech leaders  Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  became heavily overvalued  it becomes an extreme risk 
Note however  that this may not be as extreme as it seems at first glance  traders often sell their stakes in an overbought asset and choose to reinvest into stocks that have a lower valuation and lower volume of shares  The FAAMG s remain reliable assets overall  but traders may be shifting out of mega cap techs for now  on possible profit taking 

Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  for example  is the biggest non tech stock in the S P 500 index  In stark contrast to Apple s diminishing volume on its price rise  Johnson   Johnson s volume has risen together with the price  demonstrating that a rising interest in the stock can support the rising price  When a rising price is followed by diminishing interest  fewer investors will be left holding devalued stocks 

Tech stocks are also the worst performing sector in Europe this morning  down by more than 2 percent on the STOXX 600 

The market narrative has it that European stocks are declining on the UK s political risk  but in our view  a weaker UK gives the EU the upper hand in the Brexit negotiations 
It was no surprise then that the dollar s jump on Friday wasn t on the greenback s strength  but on euro and pound weakness  Draghi s lower inflation projection for the eurozone and the political chaos that is expected to ensue in the UK led to the weakened status of both European currencies  Today  the dollar reached its downtrend line and sharply declined  suggesting that Friday s jump was nothing more than a correction 
The US dollar is still subject to considerable political headwind at home  after Attorney General Jeff Sessions offered to testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee to answer questions about alleged Russian involvement in President Donald Trump s campaign 
Up Ahead
We may get our first clues on Theresa May s chances of keeping her job when she addresses the 1922 Committee of rank and file Tory lawmakers on Monday  Short term traders of the pound should pay attention  Every word and reaction will almost certainly have a strong impact on cable s value 
The FOMC s quarter percent hike  for the second time this year  is already priced in  but what will make the dollar move is the Fed s response on the recent string of disappointing economic data and details regarding rolling back the US s  4 trillion balance sheet 
Central banks in Japan and the UK also will be holding policy meetings this week  The former has been under a lot of pressure to start talking   on any level   about its balance sheet  and the UK is forecast to keep its interest rate unchanged at a record low  The overwhelming political and economic future vis a vis the Brexit uncertainty is not the time for the BOE to make any changes

Shares in Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  tumbled around 9  in premarket trade Friday as the company forecast a slowdown in demand for chips  blaming the trade dispute between the U S  and China as well as the export ban on Huawei

The Commerce Department will release retail sales for May at 8 30 AM ET  1230 GMT   while the University of Michigan will publish its preliminary data on consumer sentiment for June at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT

5  U S  futures dip on China worries  Chewy rounds off strong week for IPOs

5338,226853,ASML,Investors bet on a quiet tech revolution in Europe,news,"By Kit Rees LONDON  Reuters    It s not banking or mining shares  but rather technology stocks  that have come up trumps in Europe this year and are poised to end the first quarter as the best performing sector  European tech companies often pale in comparison to the glamor of peers across the pond such as Facebook  O FB    Snap Inc   N SNAP  and Amazon  O AMZN   and are dwarfed in terms of market value  The U S  sector  at  4 3 trillion  is worth more than eight times Europe s   Investors  however  have been quietly buying into a European industry they see as being at the heart of disruptive digital developments across a slew of sectors  Tech stocks  SX8P  in Europe have risen nearly 12 percent in the first quarter  outstripping the broader market  STOXX   which is up 4 8 percent  and also their performance in the first three months of last year when they fell 5 4 percent  Driverless cars  iris scanning technology and augmented reality are just a handful of the themes at play globally in which European companies such as STMicroelectronics  MI STM   Infineon Technologies  and SAP  DE SAPG  are involved   Many European software firms are involved in corporate back offices  keeping systems efficient and running   a less headline grabbing side of the tech sector but one that can be important for companies across all industries looking to cut costs   Every consumer is exposed to Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   or Facebook  or Twitter     something like SAP  which actually is in most corporations  is less visible to the end consumer   said Marcus Morris Eyton  European equities portfolio manager at Allianz  DE ALVG  Global Investors  Tech now accounts for nearly a quarter of Morris Eyton s portfolio  and SAP is his biggest position   AUTOMATION The mining sector was the standout performer in Europe over the course of 2016  gaining 61 9 percent  followed by oil stocks which rose 22 9 percent   far ahead of technology firm shares which were up 3 4 percent   Banking stocks endured a turbulent first half  dragged down by problems in the Italian sector  but after hitting a low in July they rallied almost 47 percent to the end of the year  These trends were expected to continue into 2017  but so far banks are only up 4 6 percent in the first quarter  miners are up 6 2 percent and oil stocks are down more than 3 percent  Like many sectors  the commodities and financial industries have since last week been hit by investor concerns that U S  President Donald Trump may not be able to deliver on all his tax and infrastructure pledges  after his healthcare plans were blocked  Tech is less exposed to immediate political and economic developments  according to analysts  and are more governed by long term global trends in technologies such as automation  driverless cars and augmented reality    In tech  there s always this level of innovation that keeps people engaged and keeps people investing for those opportunities almost irrespective of the economic cycle   said Steve Sherman  senior portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP   Flows into tech have been strong globally  with tech sector focused funds seeing the biggest inflows year to date since 2009  according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC   Likewise Europe listed robotics and automation exchange traded fund  ETF  ROBO  ROBOT  hit a new record high last week and saw record monthly inflows in February of  80 6 million  ABB  S ABBN  and  Krones   DE KRNG  are among its top 10 holdings   TIME OF FLIGHT The move toward digitization across industries has market participants particularly excited   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  analysts highlighted SAP s S 4 HANA enterprise cloud software which helps integrate data and applications  and also its new product line for the  internet of things   IOT    where everyday objects are connected to networks to send and receive data  At Evenlode  one of Britain s best performing investment funds last year  portfolio manager Hugh Yarrow holds stocks such as Sage  L SGE  and Relx  L REL  whose digital analytics are being increasingly used in law  accountancy and finance  In more traditional sectors of tech  chip makers such as Infineon   STMicroelectronics  MI STM  and ASML  AS ASML  are closely linked to Apple  O AAPL  and the iPhone cycle  Infineon shares have surged to a record high  Stuart Mitchell  manager of the SWMC European Fund at S W  Mitchell  is betting big on STMicro  The stock  up 33 percent this year  is the fund s biggest holding  Mitchell said that he became interested in the stock when its share price fell after its loss making set top boxes business went belly up last year  He reckons STMicro s role in the auto industry with its car chip business and time of flight  TOF  technology   which is used in sensors   means it will surprise with its quick growth   Neil Campling  global head of TMT Research at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Capital Markets  said he expected opportunities in areas such as semiconductors  automated vehicles  sensors and virtual and augmented reality   
 The tech industry in Europe may not be as big in terms of revenue     as the U S  is  but it has a critical role to play in basically what is  without doubt  a digital revolution that is global in nature   he said ",2017-03-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investors-bet-on-a-quiet-tech-revolution-in-europe-469993,469993

5388,226903,ASML,StockBeat  Chipmakers  Banks Lead Modest Recovery Ahead of Weekend,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Europe s stock markets were on course for a happy ending to a volatile week Friday  as positive leads from Wall Street and Asia combined with suggestions of fiscal support measures from China combined to put a floor under equities 
By  5 AM ET  the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 1 1  at 368 94  while the German Dax and French CAC 40 were up 1 0    They re still all on course for a weekly loss  however 
The FTSE 100 was up a more modest 0 6   reflecting a bounce in sterling on rising hopes that parliament will be able to stop a No Deal Brexit through a vote of no confidence in the government of Boris Johnson  a measure that could theoretically be followed by the creation of a  government of national unity  
Chipmaker stocks led the way  in the wake of better than expected quarterly results released late Thursday by NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   which supported hopes that the slump in demand for high performance chips could be ending  Germany s Infineon Technologies  DE IFXGn  rose 2 2   while STMicroelectronics   A STM  rose 0 7  and Dutch based ASML  AS ASML  rose 1 5  
Banks were also prominent among the gainers after a torrid week  Spain s largest banks all rose by between 1  and 1 5  and Germany s Commerzbank  DE CBKG  and   Deutsche Bank    DE DBKGn  rose 3 3  and 1 5   after both hitting new all time lows this week on fears of endlessly low interest rates 
Markets derived some support from overnight comments from China s state planning commission about a possible plan to support household incomes next year  which lifted Asian equities earlier 
The growing prospects for fiscal stimulus across the globe mean that there s  still substantial potential for equities    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  strategist Ulrich Stephan said in a note to clients 
He pointed to comments by European Central Bank governing council member Olli Rehn on Thursday stressing the need for the ECB to exceed market expectations when it delivers its long awaited package of monetary easing measures in September 
Stephan also pointed to the increasing pressure within Germany for the government to abandon its principle of balanced budgets 
There has been growing talk of government investment packages to upgrade Germany s environmental performance or its infrastructure  accompanied by various ideas on how and when to abolish a reunification era surcharge on income tax  However  none looks close to fruition and the government is constrained by a constitutional amendment limiting the structural budget deficit to only 0 35  of gross domestic product ",2019-08-16,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-chipmakers-banks-lead-modest-recovery-ahead-of-weekend-1956874,1956874

5401,226916,ASML,Demergers and destruction  activists press Europe conglomerates,news,"By Toby Sterling AMSTERDAM  Reuters    The days of the European conglomerate may be numbered  as activist shareholders are pressing diversified groups to spin off secondary businesses and focus on doing one thing well  Many investors and analysts   and some managers   say that in a world where good returns are hard to come by  breaking up businesses that don t belong together can be profitable   In theory  spinning off business divisions allows the parent company and the spin off alike to focus better on their respective strategies  while investors tend to value both more highly due to greater transparency    I think demergers and the destruction of conglomerates is the next major trend in the M A market   said Christer Gardell  co founder of Cevian  a Swedish based activist investment fund   The trend has already started  it s going to run for the next 10 years   said Gardell  who is pushing Swiss Swedish engineering giant ABB  S ABBN  to spin off its power grid equipment division from its robotics and other operations  While some conglomerates such as ABB are trying to hold their businesses together  others are embracing the trend either under pressure from investors or even willingly  A wave of spin offs through initial public offerings  IPOs  among energy and industrial groups is already underway  Philips  AS PHG  of the Netherlands   Fiat  Chrysler  MI FCHA  of Italy and Germany s biggest energy groups E ON  DE EONGn  and RWE  DE RWEG  have all floated major divisions this year  German engineer  Siemens   DE SIEGn  has announced similar plans  Companies with many business lines are  mostly too complicated  too bureaucratic  too slow  and they usually suffer from poor capital allocation and poor performance   Gardell told Reuters   Obviously for investors to invest in these complicated structures  they require a discount  and usually it s a significant discount   Remove these obstacles  and the need for a discount will fade  Cevian argues  It says ABB shares  which are below 21 Swiss francs  would be worth 35 francs if its separate business arms traded in line with listed peers  ABB disagrees that it power grids business should be spun off   As part of the strategic review process  we examined all options for the division  The outcome of the review was clear that the most value would be created through the continued transformation of Power Grids under ABB s ownership   spokesman Saswato Das said  OUTPERFORMANCE Not every spin off works out for shareholders  However  a JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  study in 2015 of spin offs in the United States  where the trend began earlier than in Europe  appears to support Gardell s arguments in general  It found that U S  shares typically rose a relatively modest 2 4 percent against the S P 500 average when a spin off was announced  But over the next two years  the combined value of the parent company and its spin off rose 15 20 percent   with the relative values of both usually rising  Marc Zenner  one of the study s authors  said this U S  data would show activist investors that there is also potential across the Atlantic to create value through spin offs   In Europe one reason why you could see more in the future is that there are more conglomerate companies there   he said  Conglomerates have lasted longer in Europe due to a mix of factors that can insulate managers from unhappy shareholders  These include  poison pill  rules to discourage hostile takeovers and higher levels of family ownership  Some countries also have laws stipulating that managers must consider the interests of employees and other groups along with those of shareholders  Some firms are willing to accept limited change  One such is German industrial group ThyssenKrupp  DE TKAG   which is in talks to merge its struggling European steel business with that of India s  Tata Steel   NS TISC   However  ThyssenKrupp has so far resisted calls to isolate its most profitable business  making elevators  It also sells car parts  and engineers military ships and chemical plants  The company announced worse than expected profits for 2016last week and a gloomy outlook for 2017  which analysts said strengthens the case for a breakup  MANAGEMENT FOCUS OR INVESTOR TRANSPARENCY   Advocates argue that spin offs do better because smaller companies have a stronger focus and their chiefs have a greater incentive to succeed than division heads  But for investors  the biggest benefit seems to be increased transparency   When  spin offs  do work  it is more often the market valuing the standalone business more accurately than a stronger clarity of focus by management   said Drew Dickson  managing director of Albert Bridge Capital  Dickson doesn t look for breakup candidates as a strategy  But he said revaluation paid off for one of his firm s investments  Fiat Chrysler  after the group floated its  Ferrari  sportscar division in October 2015   The market knew that Ferrari was valuable  but only could answer the question  of how valuable  once it was standalone   he said  Under the deal  Fiat Chrysler shareholders were handed an 80 percent stake in Ferrari  MI RACE   N RACE  in January  While the parent company s shares are down 13 percent year to date  the value of their Ferrari stock is such that investors who held onto both have made a gain of roughly 60 percent  However  the jury is still out on strategies adopted by the German power companies  which are under pressure from government subsidized wind and solar electricity  E ON spun off its fossil fuel operations into Uniper  DE UN01   while RWE carved out its green energy operations as Innogy  DE IGY  in an IPO  while still holding a controlling stake  Both parent companies have lost around 60 percent of their value over the past five years  Uniper and E ON  if still regarded as one unit  would be up 1 2 percent since they started trading separately in September  RWE is down 12 5 percent since Innogy listed in October  ECLIPSE Philips CEO Frans van Houten is an example of a manager who has embraced the spin off trend  In May  the group floated Philips Lighting  AS LIGHT   its original business dating back to 1891  allowing the parent to focus on healthcare equipment  Both divisions were  great opportunities with a lot of room to grow  but  both required investment  the commonality was minimal other than the Philips brand   Van Houten told Reuters  Proceeds from the IPO will be reinvested in the high margin health operations while the spin off  the world s largest lighting company  hopes to have greater access to capital markets to fund M A  During his career Van Houten has seen Philips eclipsed in value by not one but two former divisions it has spun off  semiconductor equipment maker ASML  AS ASML   and computer chip maker NXP  O NXPI   He left Philips to oversee NXP s restructuring after it was sold to private equity investors in 2006  returning to Philips in 2011  NXP  which had a new IPO in 2010  is now in the process of being acquired by Qualcomm  O QCOM  for  38 billion    Definitely my learning there helped me in my thinking   VanHouten said   After lackluster performance for most of Van Houten s tenure  Philips shares are up 17 percent year to date

The German Economy Ministry  which withdrew its approval for the deal in October and is now doing its own review of the transaction  said the German process was independent of the U S  scrutiny   additional reporting by Anneli Palmen in Duesseldorf  Eric Auchard in Frankfurt  Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Michael Martina in Beijing ",2016-12-02,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/aixtron-will-have-to-cut-costs,-jobs-if-u.s.-blocks-china-deal-445284",445284

5432,226947,ASML,Encouraging trade talks boost European shares,news,"By Shreyashi Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar
 Reuters    European shares moved higher on Thursday  with technology shares leading the charge after encouraging comments from China on trade with the United States soothed sentiment that was rattled by growth worries and political turmoil 
The Chinese commerce ministry said Beijing is in close communication with Washington and is preparing to make progress at trade talks in October 
Although investors are keeping a close watch and doubt a deal could be struck between the two sides in the near future  they are hopeful of any signs of progress in the negotiations 
 There will be a deal toward the second quarter of the upcoming year   said ING economist Timme Spakman  while adding that the U S  needs to take a step back and give China some breathing space to make room for a deal 
Trade sensitive tech stocks  SX8P  jumped 1 1   helping the pan European STOXX 600 index  STOXX  rise 0 5  
Euro zone s blue chip index  STOXX50E  climbed 0 5   boosted by shares of semiconductor maker ASML Holdings  AS ASML   while export reliant Germany  GDAXI  gained 0 4  
The comments on U S  China trade also helped spark a reversal in early losses after Bloomberg reported the World Trade Organization will authorize the U S  to impose tariffs on nearly  8 billion of European goods due to illegal state aid provided to aircraft maker Airbus SE  PA AIR  
European equity markets closed at two week lows on Wednesday on fears about an impeachment inquiry into U S  President Donald Trump and no clear view on progress in U S  China trade negotiations 
Investor confidence has also been shaken by weak readings on economic data and recent profit warnings from big European companies  which have fueled renewed fears of a corporate blood bath for the upcoming earnings season 
The latest warning came from Imperial Brands Plc  L IMB   which tumbled 10 2   after it said its expects full year profit to be flat compared to last year in the face of a regulatory backlash against vaping in the United States 
Shares of peer  British American Tobacco  Plc  L BATS  also fell 2 2  
The personal   household goods index  SXQP  rose 0 1   logging the smallest gain among major European sub sectors 
 Pearson   L PSON  slid 16 7   to the bottom of the STOXX 600  after the British education company warned its full year profit would come in at the bottom of its forecast range 
However  Belgian supermarket chain  Colruyt   BR COLR  jumped 5 2  after the company said it expected full year net income to rise slightly

For Deutsche Bank  it will be the first time since 1998 that it will no longer be a member of the STOXX 50  STOXX50  
Shares of both were firmly in the red on Tuesday  with Credit Suisse down more than 5 percent and Deutsche off 3 5 percent 
The decision by STOXX Ltd  which manages Europe s top benchmark stock indexes  came following a near halving in value of Credit Suisse and Deutsche shares this year  Deutsche shares are now more than 88 percent below their 2007 peaks 
Banks in Europe are grappling with deteriorating profits  slumping investment income on the back of collapsing yields and higher regulatory costs 
Commerzbank s  DE CBKG  warning on profits and negative interest rates sent its shares to a record low on Tuesday 
While the results of the latest health check on regional banks by the European Banking Authority were greeted by investors with a sense of relief  the fact that the tests did not take into account interest rates staying negative for a long time has met with criticism 
 If rates stay this low  interest income will not be that much of a contributor to the capital base and from that angle  it s difficult to see the banks being in a strong position   Gerhard Schwarz  head of equity strategy at Baader Bank in Munich  said 
Exclusion from a benchmark generally means that exchange traded funds and other passive investors that track the index will be forced to sell the shares 
The European banking index  SX7P  fell 2 8 percent  the worst sectoral performer  taking this year s total losses to more than 30 percent 

The two banks will be replaced by technology firm ASML Holding  AS ASML  and construction company  Vinci   PA SGEF  in the STOXX Europe 50 index  STOXX50   STOXX Ltd  which operates Deutsche Boerse Group s  DE DB1Gn  index business  said late on Monday that the changes will become effective from Aug  8 ",2016-08-02,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/credit-suisse,-deutsche-index-exclusion-another-blow-to-european-banks-417914",417914

5450,226965,ASML,European tech investors spot safe havens from Brexit worries,news,"By Eric Auchard FRANKFURT  Reuters    Technology investors seeking refuge after Brexit are picking companies delivering instant access to services for Web and mobile customers or firms mainly doing business globally which can benefit from the pound s fall  They are shying away from hardware makers or e commerce suppliers with sizeable UK sales  which count for less after currency swings driven by Britain s vote to leave the EU  Shareholders are also wary of software and services firms getting caught short by budget freezes by customers scrambling to reassess their businesses and resulting slowing economic growth  Second quarter results begin this week and run into August  The STOXX European technology index fell 10 percent after the June 23 vote  but has since regained 6 6 percent  It is down 10 5 percent so far this year  weighed by slowing global smartphone growth and concerns about the world economy   Brexit is playing into a deeper trend where established tech firms supplying traditional hardware  software or services are losing ground to cloud based businesses  as corporate spending and consumer appetites shift to the web and mobile phones    There will be a lot of companies that are poorly positioned for the cloud that are going to call out Brexit as a timely excuse for their own problems   said Ben Rogoff  a fund manager with Polar Capital in London   Let s be clear here  This uncertainty is taking place against a backdrop of growth that has been disappointing anyway  These firms will blame Brexit for their own misexecution   A survey of chief information officers in the United States and Europe by  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  in June   before the Brexit vote   showed buyers already paring back 2016 spending plans for hardware and technical services  Cloud  big data and security software remain top spending priorities  it found  After the vote  global market research firm Gartner slashed its tech spending outlook for Britain by 3 percent this year and by 5 percent in 2017   SAFE HAVENS Two UK based safe havens are ARM Holdings  L ARM   which licenses chip technology used in most smartphones worldwide  and Sophos  L SOPH   driven by demand for its computer security software and services  most financial analysts say  U S  names like Salesforce com  N CRM  and Red Hat  N RHT   with long term subscriptions for Internet delivered software and little direct exposure to Britain  are safe bets  said Silicon Valley based analyst Trip Chowdhry  Amazon com  O AMZN  and Apple  O AAPL   while active in Britain  enjoy strong brands and have sticky subscription business models likely to insulate them from any UK slowdown  he said  Globally focused ASML  AS ASML  of the Netherlands benefits from spending on its advanced chip making tools by Intel  O INTC  and Taiwan s TSMC  TW 2330   together with the positive effects of selling products in dollars  but booking them in euros  Morgan Stanley says  Similarly  Europe s biggest software maker  SAP  DE SAPG   remains insulated by long sales cycles and an entrenched  multinational customer base  with little direct exposure to Britain  although the Brexit shock in the final week of June could prove to have delayed some new software licensing deals  Baader analyst Knut Woller expects SAP later this month to reaffirm its full year 2016 financial targets   If SAP can meet the consensus for flat license growth in the second quarter  that would be seen as a relief  and send the stock higher  he said  LEFT VULNERABLE But UK online advertising and ecommerce sales by other big U S  Internet names are set to take an eventual hit from slowing economic growth and translating pounds into U S  dollars for reporting purposes   Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  analyst Ross Sandler said  These include eBay  O EBAY   with 16 percent of revenue from Britain  travel site Priceline  O PCLN  with an estimated 15 percent  Google  O GOOGL  with 9 5 percent and Facebook  O FB  with an estimated 7 to 10 percent tied to Britain  Sandler said  Eastern European software services firms EPAM  N EPAM  and Luxoft  N LXFT   which count heavily on contracts from financial service and media clients in Britain and Western Europe  are some of the tech shares hardest hit in the region by worries about how Brexit may undermine economic growth  Both stocks are down 15 20 percent in the past month  Financial software providers Temenos of Switzerland and UK based Fidessa may struggle to close contracts in the second half of 2016 as banks reconsider their UK positions  UBS said    While we do not think the UK s  leave  vote is analogous to the Lehman collapse  we do think it is likely to impede decision making in Europe as banks consider the possible implications   UBS software analyst Michael Briest said  Dutch car navigation supplier TomTom s stock has plunged 20 percent in the past month  British consumers account for 13 percent of sales  with three quarters of overall revenue coming from Europe   Barclays   LON BARC  said   We foresee challenging times ahead for TomTom based on its exposure to the UK consumer market and the negative impact foreign exchange should have on TomTom s gross margins   said Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents by 11 1   However  adjusted earnings declined 24 5  on a year over year basis For full year 2017  the company s adjusted earnings per share fell 16 1  to  1 41 compared with the year ago tally  Notably  the company s adjusted earnings came within the guided range of  1 38  1 46 per share On a GAAP basis  the company reported earnings per share of 48 cents  compared with the year ago net loss of 45 cents Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues in the quarter were  1 049 1 million  up 18 3  year over year on a reported basis  Additionally  revenues were up 16 6   when adjusted for the impact of currency impact For full year 2017  the company s sales totaled  3 5 billion  an increase of 4 2  both on a reported as well as adjusted for both the impact of currency and market exits basis  compared with 2016 Pitney Bowes Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   As for the segments  on a reported basis  Small and Medium Business   SMB   Solutions revenues dipped 5  year over year to   441 4 million  The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business  down 6    Decline in recurring revenue streams  partially mitigated by solid performance of the new SendPro C Series product proved to be a drag on the North American Mailing business  In addition  lower equipment sales had an adverse impact on the International Mailing Business Enterprise Business Solutions   EBS   revenues increased 9 9  year over year to  255 9 million  Decent performance form Presort Services  up 8   and the Enterprise business  up 10   drove top line growth of this segment  Higher equipment sales driven by higher print and sorter equipment placements bolstered performance of the production mail business Digital Commerce Solutionsreported a whopping 86  year over year growth in sales to  351 6 million  on the back of strong Global e commerce  up 169    Impressive performance in both cross border retail and marketplace volumes along with domestic shipping acted as tailwinds for the Global e commerce business Notably  revenues in the Global e commerce business included revenues from Newgistics  However  soft performance from the Software Solutions business down 3  due tolower license and service revenues partially offset top line growth of this segment Liquidity and Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Dec 31  2017  free cash flow was  145 5 million compared with  164 2 million as of Dec 31  2016 As of Dec 31  2017  the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  1 009 million compared with  764 5 million at the end of Dec 31

lie in the range of  1 40  1 55  Revenues  on a reported basis  are expected to grow in the range of 9 13  year over year On a positive note  Pitney Bowes believes that new products and digital capabilities of SMB  expansion of the Presort Services network and robust e commerce volume growth will act as major catalysts  stoking top line growth for full year 2018  Moreover  the company s focus on operational excellence will help it trim costs and expenses  consequently supplementing growth Our TakePitney Bowes  concerted efforts to transform its business have started to yield results as is evident from growth across most business lines  The transformation initiatives and introduction of new products have boosted performance  Moreover  the company continues to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform to boost profitability which bodes well  going forward Further  the Global Ecommerce business continues to be one of the strongest catalysts of the company  In less than five years  Global Ecommerce has grown from  20 million business to a worth of over  400 million  This apart  Pitney Bowes expects service performance to improve in the second half of the year driven by revenue growth and cost reduction measures However  continued softness in the mailing business is likely to affect Pitney Bowes  growth momentum  going forward  This apart  as the company

5460,226975,ASML,More Pain Before An Enduring Gain ,opinion,"The world s stock markets are open for trading  Traders are looking for cues to an overall direction after a swift week long correction hit The history of corrections shows  There is usually more price action pain before any enduring gain We have seen the  It s Still a Bull Market  optimists  buy the dip   That may mean traders have to grind prices down to wring out that excess optimism before stock markets move higher  in an enduring manner  Traders in corrections usually need to see capitulation  We haven t seen that   at all For this Global Week Ahead  let s look into Reuters  five biggest world market themes  1  A Key to Rates  the U S  Consumer Price Inflation Reading on DeckWhether world markets settle down now   or suffer a fresh volatility shockwave   may be determined by this week s consumer and producer price inflation readings in the United States They are expected to show U S  consumer prices rising at the  2 1  year on year rate they grew at in December  But any stronger and it would feed bets on faster Fed rate hikes  potentially triggering another dump in stocks and bonds  Don t forget  this whole blowout whipped up after Feb 2nd U S  jobs data showed the strongest year on year wage growth since 2009 If U S  inflation does accelerate  markets could see Treasury yields get above the 3 0  level that several investment banks had set as their year end target U S  inflation is not the only game in town  though  British January data  due Tuesday  will be in focus after the Bank of England s recent hawkish comments  Finally  we get German numbers  Wednesday   These should show price growth still subdued  though wage deals and a new coalition government will likely lift future inflation  2  The Return of Market VolatilityMarket volatility is back  With a bang  After months anchored at historically low levels  U S  stock market volatility exploded last week  The rise in the VIX index on Tuesday was the biggest in its history Trillions of dollars were wiped off of global equity market cap and  according to Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Wall Street s near  10  drawdown was steeper and faster than the historical average of all corrections and bear markets going back to the Second World War Have we now moved to a  high vol  regime from a  low vol  regime  and will equity volatility serious infect other markets  Investors will be seeking clues Above 30  the VIX is on track for its highest weekly close in over six years  Investors will want to see that come down to 20 or lower  while so far at least  contagion to FX  rates and credit markets has been limited  That may change if the VIX stays where it is  3  Can European Earnings Reports Get the Bulls Excited Another heavy week coming up on the European earnings front and with the recent volume jitters wiping 0 8 trillion euros from the region s stocks  company updates are going to be key if there is any chance of the bulls coming back So  will the results stem a downward trend in forecasts  Recent weeks have seen analysts  predictions for fourth quarter STOXX 600 earnings downgraded to 11   according to Thomson Reuters I B E S  from 18 percent a few weeks ago What s more  the earnings  beats  in Europe are currently 48 2    compare that to 78  for the S P 500 index  In Europe   beat  levels in an average quarter run at 50  Companies due to report this week include  Heineken  Keurig  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   Enel  MI ENEI   Airbus  Nestle  Allianz  DE ALVG   Renault  PA RENA  and Eni One saving grace is that recent selloff has cheapened share valuations  So  in theory at least  that takes some pressure off those that fall short of expectations  In the end  though  it might just be the moves of the might S P 500 and Dow across the pond that have the most influence on proceedings  4  China s New Year StartsIt s a tradition Chinese authorities are keeping alive even at a time when they are cracking down heavily to try and wean the economy off debt  keeping the money markets amply supplied and stable during the week long Chinese new year holidays Even though the People s Bank of China has refrained from injecting cash through money market operations for nearly two weeks  repo rates are soft and interbank funding has been smooth It is expected to stay that way next week even as consumers and companies withdraw huge amounts of cash to spend and distribute over Chinese New Year   and banks fund their books for the Feb 15   21 holiday week That is partly because of some longer tenor repos the central bank did at the beginning of the year and a generous cut made to some banks  cash reserve ratios which has given them more room to play with Longer term Chinese government bond yields are down too since January  and haven t kept pace with the rise in yields elsewhere in the Western world  Analysts suspect that is deliberate from Beijing  to keep Chinese markets insulated from a global bout of monetary tightening Red packets are traditionally given at Chinese New Year to symbolize good luck and ward off evil spirits  This could be the PBOC s gift  5  Submerging Markets Now Emerging market shares may have shared the pain  but bonds and currencies have outperformed for the most past during the global February freak out  leaving investors wondering how long this traditional volatile asset class can keep it up EM dollar debt spreads   the premiums investors demand to hold these bonds rather than U S  Treasuries   have been rising but not earthshaking  and they are still lower on average than at any point in 2015  2016 and 2017 That is probably due to the sleepy dollar as much as anything  but if it gets shaken awake or global markets take another serious lurch  the resistance could be broken One of the long running EM issues   Jacob Zuma s departure from South Africa s Presidency could also come to a head  while another hotspot  Turkey  will publish

Investors expect a retention of high volumes of European goods exports to the United States after the statement of Fed Chairman that the US economy will continue its stable development 
An additional positive factor for European exporters is the emerging weakening of the euro against the US dollar under the influence of the Fed rate hike  On Tuesday  good earnings reports and news from a number of companies contributed to the increase in European stock indices  Thyssenkrupp  DE TKAG    9    Mediaset SpA ADR  OTC MDIUY     3 5    Schibsted ASA ADR  OTC SBSNY     12 6    Getinge Industrier AB  OTC GNGBY     10

Conversely  during yesterday s US session  corporate optimism helped bulls resume Friday s run  propelling prices to their highest in six months 

The S P 500 surged 2 15 percent  with all sectors closing in the green and even  laggard  Utilities   1 03 percent  gaining over a full percentage point  Technology   3 01 percent  was the clear leader  followed by Communication Services   2 64 percent   The SPX s aggregate gains from last week s selloff stands at 3 percent  which pares the drop since the record close of a little over a month ago to 4 3 percent  Technically  the price jumped back over the 200 DMA and is below the 100 DMA

So far  stocks have been falling on fear and speculation over ongoing geopolitical issues but gaining on fundamentals  As long as macroeconomic data continues to show an expanding economy and companies keep demonstrating growth  prompting demand to outpace supply as can be seen on the technical charts  stocks should continue to advance

WTI pares risk off decline
Trade proxy market structure continues to break down

Key Events
European shares on the STOXX 600 and futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 enjoyed a favorable reversal this morning  as signs of a possible breakthrough on the month long partial U S  government shutdown the longest in the country s history offset trade related headwinds 
U S  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scheduled a vote for Thursday on a Republican backed proposal to reopen the government  Should it not pass  lawmakers will then vote on a competing proposal  tabled by the Democrats with investors hoping to see a swift end to the ongoing political stalemate 
In the early global open  equities had been dragged lower by reports that the U S  rejected Chinese proposals for preparatory talks ahead of official negotiations next week  Despite the fact that the White House s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow denied those reports  investors already disheartened by the alleged lack of progress on technology copyright laws  which is perhaps the thorniest issue within the trade war had remained unconvinced 

In Europe  earnings setbacks from ASML Holding  AS ASML   the region s largest semiconductor gear marker  had also pushed prices lower  The company forecast sales below analyst estimates  most likely exacerbating fears stemming from one of last quarter s key market headwinds  soft guidance  Technically  the price fell after the stock hit the 50 DMA and downtrend line since June 23  The three major MAs 50  100 and 200 are in bearish formation  highlighting a dynamic whereby the more recent the prices are  the weaker they seem  However  the RSI  a leading indicator  is providing a positive divergence  as it tests the momentum highs since August  while the price is 23 percent lower  Also  volumes in the positive sessions have been significantly higher than in the negative sessions since the pre Christmas bottom 
Adding to negative headlines  the U S  Federal Reserve is said to be investigating how Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  handled billions of dollars in suspicious transactions from Denmark s Danske Bank  CO DANSKE   raising the specter of a money laundering scandal 
In the earlier Asian session  regional indices posted a mixed performance after the latest  downbeat trade negotiations reports 
China s Shanghai Composite gave up earlier gains  but  remarkably  still managed to close 0 05 percent in the green  Stimulus measures from the government seemed to have a greater impact on traders  mood than vague  ever lasting discussions around U S  China talks 
In FX trading  the yen slipped after the Bank of Japan reduced inflation outlook 
Global Financial Affairs
In Tuesday s U S  session  equities dropped the most sharply in nearly three weeks on mounting concerns that the U S  China trade dispute will not be settled as easily as recently hoped  Multinational companies  which rely on the Chinese market for sustained growth  and technology firms  which rely on mutual copyrights protection rules  led the declines 

Chipmakers were hit the hardest  with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index losing an aggregate 2 85 percent  with every member in the red  Technically  the chart of the index resembles closely that of ASML  reaching its downtrend line and its RSI retesting its highest level since September  The technical picture  however  is stronger  as the index pierced through its 50 DMA and managed to stay above it  Also  its RSI posted a higher trough  providing a negative divergence to the price s lower trough 

The S P 500 suffered a 1 42 percent setback  Technically  the index s worst drop in weeks took place at the intersection of the downtrend line since the September record peak and the consolidation bottom  at the 2 700 levels  which has been our critical test since the post Christmas comeback 
Energy stocks underperformed   2 18 percent   tracking oil prices lower  Close behind were Industrials shares   2 07 percent   the classic anti trade proxy  Materials companies also lagged   1 38 percent  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed over 300 points but still fared better than the other U S  majors  giving up 1 22 percent  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and DowDuPont Inc  NYSE DWDP  led the Dow s slide 
The Russell 2000 slid 1 85 percent  once more confirming a breakdown of the usual market structure  as small caps which don t rely on exports for continued growth should have outperformed amid heightened pessimism around a forthcoming trade deal 
Still  the NASDAQ Composite  whose listed firms stand at the core of the trade dispute  tumbled 1 91 percent 

WTI crude pared some of yesterday s losses  which saw prices retreating from a near two month high  Note that the bull bear struggle takes place right on the neckline of a potential H S bottom 
Investors once again find themselves juggling between opposing forces as well as inconsistent news reports  On the tailwind front  hopes of a near resolution of the US government shutdown added to Chinese policymakers  efforts to aid the country s stumbling economy and to generally upbeat earnings reports from major U S  banks  compounded by strong guidance which represents a key development crucial after last quarter s broad cut in sales outlook  IBM  NYSE IBM  added to the trend  reporting results that topped estimates and boosted the stock after market close 
Meanwhile  on the headwinds front  the Brexit saga and all its related risks continue to loom in the background  while billionaire investor Ray Dalio chastised monetary policy makers at the World Economic Forum in Davos for an  inappropriate desire  to tighten faster than the capital markets could handle

U S  stocks edge higher after swings amid thin trading

Key Events
European stocks and futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 rebounded from a weak start this morning  following a batch of poor corporate updates that had further tested investor nerves amid ongoing global growth and trade war jitters 
The STOXX Europe 600 climbed into positive territory after a volatile opening trading hour  mostly weighed down by Metro Bank s  LON MTRO  profit miss  The UK lender s stock plunged 38 percent to an all time low yesterday after the group revealed a spike in exposure to risky mortgages and posted soft guidance  sparking fears of a shareholder cash call 
Initially  the index was also pushed lower by chipmakers such as ASML Holding  AS ASML   which had dropped on reduced guidance 
Carmakers also performed poorly at the open  at the mercy of uncertain U S  Sino trade talks  A weak German auto sector is one of the primary drivers of the current European slowdown 
Today s rebound might mean that traders are hopeful on the technicals  after the 8 percent comeback from the pre Christmas rout  which pushed shares to a two year low  But are valuations still cheap enough to offset the flurry of economic  geopolitical and sentiment based headwinds 

The price of the pan European benchmark found resistance precisely beneath a downtrend line since November 8  after rebounding from achieving a H S continuation s implied target  The onus is on the bulls to demonstrate their willingness to overcome the bears line in the sand  downtrend line   However  should they manage to do so  they are likely to convert some bears  catapulting prices toward the 400 mark  where the 100 DMA awaits 
In the earlier Asian session  equities crawled higher on thin volumes  in line with the U S  market pattern  as investors sit on the fence amid persistent political risk and signs of a slowdown  South Korea s KOSPI gained 0 81 percent  outperforming its regional peers thanks to the biggest foreign capital inflows since September  which helped chipmakers  stocks buck the U S  and European downtrend 
Foreign investors chose to focus on depressed share price versus valuations  showing a bullish interest in the chipmaker sector even after fourth quarter profits from SK Hynix  KS 000660   the world s second biggest memory chipmaker  disappointed  Demand came in purely on the technicals  after analysts believed prices had bottomed  Also  a weak Korean won added to the attractiveness of local stock prices 
Global Financial Affairs
In the U S  session  share managed to close higher after swinging between gains and losses through the whole session  as investors were trying to gauge the likelihood of an economic slowdown 

The S P 500 gained 0 22 percent  Technically  bulls and bears struggle under the 2 700 levels  a technical red zone  Eight of the index s 11 sectors closed in green territory  However  traders should take note that defensive sectors were responsible for those gains  with Consumer Staples adding 1 19 percent and Utilities climbing 1 01 percent 
While Industrials   0 15 percent  escaped its anti trade resolution proxy status  the same can t be said for Materials   0 68 percent   which remained under pressure from trade related risk after the International Monetary Fund cut its global economic outlook citing the impact of the U S China trade war  And Energy   1 02 percent  led the day s laggards  tracking a second day decline for oil 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 171 14 points  or 0 7 percent  with listed companies beating earnings expectations  IBM  NYSE IBM  leaped 8 46 percent after posting adjusted fourth quarter results above analyst expectations  This confirmed what is emerging as this quarter s trend  with names like General Motors  NYSE GM  and major U S  banks revising guidance upward  Last quarter  companies  lower outlook represented one of the strongest market headwinds  Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  provides a case in point  despite posting modestly stronger than expected second quarter earnings  its stock climbed 4 87 percent as the firm raised its full year sales guidance 
The NASDAQ Composite   0 08 percent  averted a second day loss but failed to gain much traction  as tech stocks feel the heat of unresolved U S  Sino trade dispute over copyright protection 
The Russell 2000 was the only major U S  index closing lower  0 27 percent  
Investors are once again caught in between solid earnings and rising corporate outlooks which benefit from a slower path to interest rates tightening in the U S   compounded by aggressive economic stimulus in China and mounting political and geopolitical headwinds  Overall  doubts over foreign trade and politics continue to permeate global markets  The chair of the White House s Council of Economic Advisers  Kevin Hassett  said yesterday that if the partial government shutdown extends through March  there s a chance economic expansion will be null this quarter  though  humongous  growth would follow once federal agencies reopen 
And U S  President Donald Trump s top economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow said on Tuesday that negotiations between the U S  and China next week will be  determinative   leaving traders on the edge about the possibility that a final deal will be sealed  Meanwhile  it s not clear whether any measures to reopen the government will pass the Senate s vote on Thursday  adding to political uncertainty 
Since the Brexit vote  and with the rise of populism around the world  investors repeatedly demonstrated that they are willing to ignore geopolitical risk  as long as economic and corporate data come in strong 
The million dollar question is  therefore  how weak is global and particularly Chinese growth  The follow up question should be  however strong the U S  economy is  how long will it be able to continue to grow in a vacuum  especially this late in the business cycle  and during the longest bull market on record  As we ve been saying since the strong post Christmas rally  we d place our bets on the market falling going forward  with the 2 700 levels maybe the 2 800 levels representing the downturn s stress test  From a risk reward ratio standpoint  U S  stocks are standing in an ideal entry point for a short position 

In other news  the dollar wiped out yesterday s losses  finding support above the 100 DMA  but still below the tight range since October 
WTI initially seemed to have found demand  consolidating for the third day  amid mounting civil unrest in Venezuela  The U S  has threatened to impose sanctions on crude exports from the OPEC oil producer as opposition to President Nicol s Maduro gains yet more traction  However  U S  crude started edging lower by the late European morning session

5563,227078,ASML,Semiconductor Earnings Scorecard  INTC  TXN  XLNX  LRCX  ASML,opinion,"There are signs that the semiconductor cycle has peaked driven by softening in smartphone and PC demand  The next wave of growth for semiconductors will come from things like cloud computing  artificial intelligence  smart cities  IoT  5G and auto  Some of the current demand is already aligned with expansion in these markets  but we re just beginning to scratch the surface of that potential 
Whether the demand from these markets can offset the cyclical slowdown is an open question and the answer will unfold through this year and the next  In the meantime  the current slate of earnings shows that there are few safe bets with Xilinx being an outlier   
Intel   NASDAQ INTC    Zacks Rank  3  Hold 
Revenue of  18 657 billion was short of the estimated  19 01 billion  EPS of 1 28 was ahead of the estimated  1 22  By segment  CCG up 9 7   52 6  revenue share   DCG up 8 7   32 5    IOTG down 7 2   4 4    NSG up 24 5   5 9    PSG up 7 7   3 3    other up 27 6   1 2   
The revenue miss  weaker than expected DCG revenue  cautious tone and disappointing guidance were concerns  The lower than expected revenue was attributed to weaker orders coming out of China because of a slowing economy  But management also said that macro issues including the trade war with China  the government shutdown and Brexit made them incrementally cautious for the rest of the year although a relative improvement should be expected in the back half when new products including the first 10nm chips are scheduled to ship 
CCG wasn t in the spotlight but the business which accounts for more than half of Intel s revenue  benefited from stronger ASPs that more than offset the impact of softer volumes 
Result  The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are down 4 cents  9 4   and 4 cents  3 8    respectively 

 
Texas Instruments   NASDAQ TXN    Zacks Rank  4  Sell 
Texas Instruments topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line while slightly missing on the top line  Management attributed the miss to slowing demand for semiconductors overall  not unexpected given waning demand for smartphones and PCs and ongoing trade tensions with China  
The earnings beat was mainly because the high margin analog business remained strong  helped by 5G deployments at telecom customers  Industrial and auto were also good  Plus the company continues to transition from 200mm to 300mm  which helped it lower cost  An offsetting factor was lower factory utilization to maintain optimal use of cash in the softening demand environment 
One of the more popular measures management takes is returning 100  of FCF to shareholders  In 2018  FCF jumped 30  to  6 1 billion and management returned  7 7 billion in share repurchases and dividend 
Guidance disappointed  sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate down 10 cents  8 1   and 9 cents  7 1   for the March and June quarters  respectively 

 
Xilinx   NASDAQ XLNX    Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy 
Xilinx beat the Zacks Consensus on both top and bottom lines helped by double digit growth across business segments  In Data Center  The FPGA as a Service  FaaS  model is gaining momentum with AWS  Huawei and Alibaba  NYSE BABA   New design wins for its FPGA products included Samsung  KS 005930   In Communications  5G related spending helped revenue across Korea  China and North America 
SoC revenue is benefiting from the Zync platform that offers ARM technology  software programmability   Xilinx FPGA  hardware programmability  and I O programmability  Strength in Advanced Products came from 28nm and 20nm categories  What s more  it also guided better than expected  Result  The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are up 12 cents  14 6   and 8 cents  9 6   respectively 
The reasons for particular optimism around Xilinx that will continue in quarters ahead are first  with Intel snapping up Altera  the only other major FPGA player  all rivals feel affinity to Xilinx  second  the company has a solid strategy based on some compelling products that will drive continued expansion in its revenue and profits  even in a difficult market such as this 
The recently announced 7nm Versal  for instance  is the first product in its adaptive compute acceleration platform  ACAP   which is a highly integrated multi core heterogeneous compute platform enabling hardware level flexibility suitable for machine learning  big data applications  cloud computing and more 
On the discrete level  its recently launched Alveo enables acceleration in industry standard servers  Throw in the Zync platform and wrap it up with the FaaS model  and it s clear that this company is going places 

 
Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX    Zacks Rank  3  Hold

5564,227079,ASML,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Intel  Texas Instruments  Xilinx  Lam Research And ASML,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  February 4  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Intel   NASDAQ INTC    Texas Instruments   NASDAQ TXN    Xilinx   NASDAQ XLNX    Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   and ASML Holding  AS ASML  N V    NASDAQ ASML   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Semiconductor Earnings Scorecard  INTC  TXN  XLNX   MoreThere are signs that the semiconductor cycle has peaked driven by softening in smartphone and PC demand  The next wave of growth for semiconductors will come from things like cloud computing  artificial intelligence  smart cities  IoT  5G and auto  Some of the current demand is already aligned with expansion in these markets  but we re just beginning to scratch the surface of that potential Whether the demand from these markets can offset the cyclical slowdown is an open question and the answer will unfold through this year and the next  In the meantime  the current slate of earnings shows that there are few safe bets with Xilinx being an outlier   Intel  Zacks Rank  3  Hold Revenue of  18 657 billion was short of the estimated  19 01 billion  EPS of 1 28 was ahead of the estimated  1 22  By segment  CCG up 9 7   52 6  revenue share   DCG up 8 7   32 5    IOTG down 7 2   4 4    NSG up 24 5   5 9    PSG up 7 7   3 3    other up 27 6   1 2   The revenue miss  weaker than expected DCG revenue  cautious tone and disappointing guidance were concerns  The lower than expected revenue was attributed to weaker orders coming out of China because of a slowing economy  But management also said that macro issues including the trade war with China  the government shutdown and Brexit made them incrementally cautious for the rest of the year although a relative improvement should be expected in the back half when new products including the first 10nm chips are scheduled to ship CCG wasn t in the spotlight but the business which accounts for more than half of Intel s revenue  benefited from stronger ASPs that more than offset the impact of softer volumes Result  The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are down 4 cents  9 4   and 4 cents  3 8    respectively Texas Instruments  Zacks Rank  4  Sell Texas Instruments topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line while slightly missing on the top line  Management attributed the miss to slowing demand for semiconductors overall  not unexpected given waning demand for smartphones and PCs and ongoing trade tensions with China  The earnings beat was mainly because the high margin analog business remained strong  helped by 5G deployments at telecom customers  Industrial and auto were also good  Plus the company continues to transition from 200mm to 300mm  which helped it lower cost  An offsetting factor was lower factory utilization to maintain optimal use of cash in the softening demand environment One of the more popular measures management takes is returning 100  of FCF to shareholders  In 2018  FCF jumped 30  to  6 1 billion and management returned  7 7 billion in share repurchases and dividend Guidance disappointed  sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate down 10 cents  8 1   and 9 cents  7 1   for the March and June quarters  respectively Xilinx  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy Xilinx beat the Zacks Consensus on both top and bottom lines helped by double digit growth across business segments  In Data Center  The FPGA as a Service  FaaS  model is gaining momentum with AWS  Huawei and Alibaba  NYSE BABA   New design wins for its FPGA products included Samsung  KS 005930   In Communications  5G related spending helped revenue across Korea  China and North America SoC revenue is benefiting from the Zync platform that offers ARM technology  software programmability   Xilinx FPGA  hardware programmability  and I O programmability  Strength in Advanced Products came from 28nm and 20nm categories  What s more  it also guided better than expected  Result  The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are up 12 cents  14 6   and 8 cents  9 6   respectively The reasons for particular optimism around Xilinx that will continue in quarters ahead are first  with Intel snapping up Altera  the only other major FPGA player  all rivals feel affinity to Xilinx  second  the company has a solid strategy based on some compelling products that will drive continued expansion in its revenue and profits  even in a difficult market such as this The recently announced 7nm Versal  for instance  is the first product in its adaptive compute acceleration platform  ACAP   which is a highly integrated multi core heterogeneous compute platform enabling hardware level flexibility suitable for machine learning  big data applications  cloud computing and more On the discrete level  its recently launched Alveo enables acceleration in industry standard servers  Throw in the Zync platform and wrap it up with the FaaS model  and it s clear that this company is going places Lam Research  Zacks Rank  3  Hold Lam s reported revenue and earnings of  2 52 billion  in line with the

5565,227080,ASML,StockBeat  Europe Can t Get Over the Brexit Hump,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Semiconductor stocks held Europe s stock markets back Wednesday on a day when most indexes struggled to make headway after yet another parliamentary defeat for the U K  government kept Brexit uncertainty alive and kicking 
A weak third quarter report and outlook from bellwether Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  after the closing bell on Tuesday pushed German chipmaker Infineon Technologies  DE IFXGn  down 2 3   while STMicroelectronics   PA STM  fell 2 1  and Dutch based ASML  AS ASML  fell 1 1   Other sectors were largely in a holding pattern 
The decision of U K  lawmakers to vote down a government motion trying to ram Prime Minister Boris Johnson s withdrawal bill through parliament means that there will be no time to formalize exit terms with the EU before the Oct  31 deadline 
The EU is currently considering a request for an extension to the deadline and has the choice of either accepting  for which it needs unanimity among its other 27 members  or of rejecting  While the latter would lead to a disorderly Brexit on Oct  31  it seems unlikely given the EU s recent public statements 
What is unclear is whether the EU would grant just enough time for the bill to be scrutinized  or for the U K  to hold a general election if that was the preferred option of the U K  An election could either return a majority government under Johnson  or another  hung  parliament with no overall control 
Either way  the pound s decline overnight on the back of the developments made the FTSE 100 the best performing index of the morning  gaining 0 4  by 5 15 AM ET  0915 GMT   The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0 2  at 394 00  unable to break through a resistance level where it has stalled on no fewer than five occasions since May 2018 
Germany s DAX index was flat  while the French CAC 40 was down 0 4  after a bigger than expected drop in business confidence  as reported by Insee  Support came from carmaker   Peugeot    PA PEUP   which rose 2 1  after its third quarter results avoided a repeat of Renault s horror show last week 
In London  meanwhile    Fresnillo    LON FRES  fell to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after reporting a drop in third quarter output and warning of another dip in the fourth quarter due to lower ore grades     Antofagasta    LON ANTO  gained after reassuring that it only faced a modest hit to output at its mines in Chile from the civil unrest there in recent days ",2019-10-23,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-europe-cant-get-over-the-brexit-hump-2001958,2001958

Investing com    Europe s stock markets were broadly higher after early trade on Friday after a strong manufacturing survey from China supported hopes that the worst of that country s slowdown is over 
The moves largely corrected losses from earlier in the week and still weren t enough to get markets like the U K  s FTSE 100 or Spain s IBEX 35 over the gain line for the week  and few were willing to place large new bets ahead of the U S  labor market report later in the day 
The report will be the first major hard data of the fourth quarter  following on from a mixed bunch of purchasing manager surveys from research firm IHSMarkit this week  Much of Friday s gains in Europe were due to the big improvement in the IHS Caixin manufacturing PMI in China  which showed its biggest improvement in two years  Reports from European markets were not as strong  with Turkey  the Netherlands  Sweden and Norway all falling  and only Switzerland and the U K  surprising significantly to the upside 
Among sectors  chipmakers made solid gains on the back of Samsung s forecast that the memory chip sector will revive strongly next year after a buffeting this year from the U S  China trade dispute 
STMicroelectronics NV  PA STM  was up 1 6   while ASML  AS ASML  and Infineon Technologies  DE IFXGn  were both up 1 3   AMS  SIX AMS   more concerned with the outcome of its struggle for control of Osram Licht   DE OSRn   was unchanged 
Elsewhere    Danske Bank    CSE DANSKE  was the standout underperformer after it lowered its full year guidance under the impact of low interest rates and costs from its Russian money laundering scandal 
  Peugeot    PA PEUP  and components maker   Faurecia    PA EPED  both recovered  meanwhile  after Thursday s steep declines in response to the terms of its agreed merger with   Fiat   Chrysler  MI FCHA   Peugeot was up 1 9  while Faurecia was up 1 4 
By 5 30 AM ET  0930 GMT   the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0 4  at 398 50  set for yet another run at the 400 level if the employment report can give it fuel  The German DAX was also up 0 4   while Copenhagen led the way with a 1 3  gain ",2019-11-01,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-stoxx-600-prepares-for-another-run-at-400-2009743,2009743

5586,227101,ASML,European shares jump 1  after report U S   China close to trade deal,news,"By Sruthi Shankar and Lisa Pauline Mattackal
 Reuters    European shares bounced back on Wednesday from a four day slump as a report that Beijing and Washington were moving closer to a trade deal offset fears about a possible delay in resolving their prolonged dispute 
After opening marginally higher  the STOXX 600  STOXX  climbed 1  after Bloomberg reported that the two sides were closer to agreeing on the amount of tariffs that would be rolled back in a  phase one  trade deal 
The report lifted the benchmark from a one month low hit on Tuesday after U S  President Donald Trump said the trade deal might have to wait until after the presidential election in November 2020  with a U S  bill protecting Muslim minority in China s Xinjiang adding to the uncertainty 
 That Bloomberg comment seems to suggest that the two nations can have a political disagreement about what is going on in certain areas on one hand  but that won t necessarily affect how they move forward in terms of the trade negotiations   said Connor Campbell  a financial analyst at Spreadex in London 
 It suggests that a deal can be done by Dec  15  which is really the key date here  before the imposition of new tariffs  
Adding to the upbeat mood  IHS Markit s final reading on November business activity in the euro zone came in slightly better than expected

5587,227102,ASML,StockBeat  Bayer  NMC Rouse Themselves Above the Holiday Torpor,news,"Investing com    Europe s stock markets were happy to drift into the holiday season on Monday  largely shrugging off news over the weekend that China would cut tariffs on hundreds of kinds of imported goods in what analysts saw as a preliminary to signing a preliminary trade deal with the U S  in the New Year 
By 5 10 AM ET  0910 GMT   the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was unchanged at 418 46  while the U K  FTSE 100 was up 0 2  and the German DAX was down 0 2   Most other bourses were also held in tight ranges 
News that the Chinese tariff cuts included semiconductors did little even to support the prices of European chipmakers  with both Infineon  DE IFXGn  and STMicroelectronics  PA STM  dipping slightly and ASML  AS ASML  eking out a gain of only 0 3  
Among the rare exceptions to the torpor were German chemicals giant Bayer  DE BAYGN   which rose as much as 3 5  after the U S  government said a landmark setting court fine against it for damages caused by its Roundup weedkiller should be reversed 
The Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department said in a  friend of the court  brief on Friday that a federal appeals court should reverse a lower court verdict that ordered Bayer  DE BAYGN  to pay  25 million to a man who blamed his cancer on the weedkiller made by   Monsanto    NYSE MON   which the German company bought in 2017

5592,227107,ASML,Europe firms may draw fire by joining buyback boom,news,"By Lionel Laurent LONDON  Reuters    European companies are likely to join a boom in share buybacks as central bank cash floods the economy  risking criticism that they are recycling capital rather than investing to promote growth  European firms are already cheering financial markets by increasingly following their U S  counterparts in returning cash to investors  propping up their share prices while the euro zone economy remains sluggish  But with the European Central Bank starting a 1 trillion euro stimulus program on Monday  political pressure will probably grow on companies to use ultra cheap funding for creating jobs rather than simply buying back their own shares  In the United States  years of Federal Reserve stimulus aimed at reviving the real economy led to the wave of share buybacks while firms neglected capital expenditure  capex   Few people expect European firms to match the staggering sums in the United States  where over  2 trillion of stock was bought back between 2009 and 2014  according to Reuters data  Nevertheless  about  8 billion worth of buybacks have already been announced by a dozen European companies this year  including ABInbev  BR ABI  and ASML  AS ASML   That appetite is likely to keep growing  European firms have over  1 5 trillion in cash on their balance sheets and few obvious places to reinvest it to earn a return  Borrowing costs are already at record lows relative to their earnings power  and with the ECB set to depress rates further with its quantitative easing  QE  program  buybacks are an easy answer  If the United States is any guide  big buybacks will attract criticism  A report by Barclays from September found that  even though capex remained the top form of U S  cash flow spending  the rate of growth of buybacks had far outstripped capex and this meant less cash was being reinvested for growth   The debate over corporate spending will increase  especially in Europe  where there is more of an attempt to balance both government and the private sector   said Martin Schulz  portfolio manager at Cleveland  Ohio based PVC Capital Advisors   With QE  the average voter thinks they are going to get all this free money     There s the expectation that corporations are going to reinvest cash  The political pressure will grow   French companies got a taste of this last year  when President Francois Hollande told Le Monde newspaper that bosses should use tax credits to reinvest and hire instead of paying out dividends to shareholders  CAPEX DECLINE Capex has by no means evaporated  for example French retailer  Carrefour   PA CARR  said on Thursday it would lift capital spending in 2015 to cement a revival in its European hypermarkets  But as a proportion of net sales  capex has declined globally since the 1990s  according to a 2013 OECD paper  In the United States  dividend payouts and share buybacks rose more than 40 percent between 2010 and 2013  eclipsing capex and effectively turning firms into  giant capital recyclers   according to a Citi research paper in 2014  By contrast  a survey by the U S  Industrial Research Institute found that more than two thirds of laboratory and R D leaders expected little to no change in their budgets in 2015  While one might have expected more spending on mergers and takeovers   Barclays   LONDON BARC   figures suggest most of the rebound in U S  deal making after the financial crisis was paid for in stock  with the cash component declining  But European firms won t necessarily become giant capital recyclers  borrowing funds just to buy back shares  in large numbers  Apart from the biggest corporations  most rely on bank borrowing to raise debt and European lenders are less likely to have the capacity to fund buybacks that do nothing to boost future profits than the bond market  where many U S  firms get cash   The way QE is going to be transmitted over here is very different     The corporate debt market is significantly smaller   said Tim Crockford  portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management  Executives  pay is also less tied up in stock options than in the United States  investors say  making another factor that might discourage a buyback frenzy in Europe  However  European buyback volumes remain well below their pre crisis peak   totaling  38 3 billion in 2014 versus  157 8 billion in 2007   giving scope for growth  Lucrative reinvestment opportunities are also likely to take more time to find and win board approval while the economy remains weak  
 In Europe  we are not yet in a phase where we will see the use of balance sheet  spending  on capex   said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen  head of multi asset investing at ING Investment Management   The exception may be Germany  which is in a different phase of recovery  In the rest of Europe  a move into capex will be at least a couple of years away  ",2015-03-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/europe-firms-may-draw-fire-by-joining-buyback-boom-331070,331070

5627,227142,ASML,Warnings from chipmakers point to wider economic slowdown ,news,"By Eric Auchard FRANKFURT  Reuters    Demand for electronics devices is weakening  according to circuit makers at the base of the industry s food chain  suggesting a long predicted slowdown in global economic growth may be coming to pass 
September  the peak month for shipping tiny chips used to build everything from appliances to cars to phones and office equipment if they are to reach consumers and businesses by year end  has not seen its typical pickup after the summer holidays 
In recent weeks  a series of U S  semiconductor makers with global operations have begun to paint a worrying picture of a broad based slow down in markets including autos and network equipment in regions ranging from Asia to Europe 
The weakness is centered in China  which functions as the electronics workshop for many finished products destined to ship worldwide  It may also be a sign of how pessimistic Europe s retailers are feeling ahead of the key Christmas trading season  with the euro zone in danger of sliding back into recession 
On Thursday came the remarkably blunt warning from diversified chipmaker Microchip  O MCHP  of a broad based industry downturn  or correction  suggesting worse may be in store as the latest corporate earnings season gets underway 
 We believe that another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future   Microchip Chief Executive Steve Sanghi said of the sales fall off in its latest quarter 
Semiconductor analysts struggle to find chipmakers which might be insulated from signs of a wider economic downturn 
 Any place to hide   asked BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava in a note to clients   For the time  it appears not  
INVENTORY WORRIES
Shares in major European chipmakers suffered sharp declines on Friday  led by Germany s Infineon Technologies  DE IFXGn   which was off 5 8 percent  STMicroelectronics  PA STM  lost 5 4 percent and ASML Holding  AS ASML  gave up 3 5 percent 
Meanwhile  financial analysts who track inventory levels up and down the electronics industry supply chain have grown concerned by signs of a year over year build up in inventories among sales distributors  contract and component manufacturers 
While some stockpiling is inevitable in the current busy manufacturing season  the worry among investors is that this may be disguising even weaker demand for finished products 
Warnings have also come from niche semiconductor companies including EZchip Semiconductor  which cited weak orders from telecom equipment maker customers  and O2 Micro  which said several of its notebook PC customers were suffering weak demand 
Microchip is considered a proxy for broader demand across the global semiconductor industry because it is a highly diversified supplier of electronic components to some 80 000 customers  which in turn use its digital and analogue devices in finished products 
The company is also an early indicator because it recognizes revenue when its distributors book sales to customers rather than simply when Microchip itself ships its products  meaning there is less lag in seeing fundamental shifts in market demand 
China suffered a sales decline during the last three months where normally it would enjoy strong sequential growth compared with the June quarter  Microchip said in a statement 
Microchip responded by cutting back production levels in its wafer fabrication and test and assembly facilities  it said 
The company expects to return to sequential revenue growth in two quarters  assuming that the current imbalance in supply and demand follow normal industry recovery patterns  it said 
Ahead of Microchip s warning late on Thursday  the semiconductor industry was enjoying an upbeat year  overall  The 30 stock Philadelphia Semiconductor Index had gained 13 8 percent in the year to date

5633,227148,ASML,Top Performing Country ETFs Of April ,opinion,"Even though April proved to be a stellar year for the U S  market  global growth worries are more or less intact  And why not 
In the fourth quarter of 2018  the Euro zone s economic growth was 0 2   the lowest since the second quarter of 2014  The Japanese economy shrank 0 6  sequentially in the third quarter of 2018  though it recovered 0 5  in the following quarter  The Canadian economy logged the growth since the second quarter of 2016 
Germany s automotive industry came under pressure because of new emission control standards  In France  the delay of Macron s reform agenda hurt growth  In Italy  there were concerns over fiscal deficit  per QNB 
On the positive side  there were oil price strength  signs of progress in U S  China trade talks   stimulus in China s economy  and Fed s  ECB s and Bank of Japan s  dovish outlook  As a result  though global GDP growth is slowing  a serious crisis looks unlikely    Investors should also note that the growth rate for the Euro zone has also improved in the first quarter of 2019

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON  Oct 2  Reuters    European shares hit a four week
low on Friday  extending the previous day s sharp losses  with
investors anxious before key U S  jobs figures after data this
week raised doubt about the strength of economic recovery 
 By 1033 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1 2 percent at
970 14 points  after losing 1 6 percent on Thursday to a
three week closing low 
 The index  which has just posted its best quarterly gain in
nearly 10 years  was set for a third day of losses 
  There is a lot of negative in the background  which
suggests you don t want to be complacent about this being a
short term correction   said Geoff Wilkinson  head of investment
research at Mint  in London 
  Clearly people are buying bonds  we have got through the
key 3 3 percent yield level in U S  10 year  Treasury   and
people are buying yen  
 Banks  which have rallied 160 percent since March  were
among the top losers on concerns over the growth picture 
 KBC  UBS  Royal Bank of Scotland  BNP Paribas  Deutsche Bank
  Credit Suisse and Commerzbank lost 0 6 4 5 percent 
  The key thing      is whether we are going to get a turn in
financials  If they have another lurch lower  2 or 3 percent  it
will move beyond a gradual pullback to a more significant
correction of 10 percent plus   Wilkinson said 
 British insurer Legal   General shed 5 5 percent  partly
reversing a four day rally on the back of bid speculation 
 Commodity shares  which have also performed strongly in the
rally  were out of favour  Royal Dutch Shell  BG Group and Total
 dropped 0 4 0 8 percent 
 Among miners  BHP Billiton  Rio Tinto  Lonmin  Xstrata 
Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys were down 0 9 percent to 4
percent 
 All eyes will be on the U S  non farm payrolls data for
September  due at 1230 GMT  for indications of the pace of the
recovery in the world s largest economy 
 Economists in a Reuters survey forecast 180 000 jobs were
lost in the month compared with a loss of 216 000 jobs in
August  while the unemployment rate was seen at 9 8 percent 
compared to a 9 7 percent rate the prior month 
 The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies as
investors squared positions ahead of the jobs data and a meeting
of Group of Seven finance chiefs over the weekend 
 International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique
Strauss Kahn said it was not yet time to withdraw government
economic stimulus because of rising unemployment and a
still damagaed financial sector 
 The pan European index  which slumped 45 percent last year 
has rallied 50 percent since hitting a floor in early March  and
is up 16 6 percent so far this year 
 
 LOW RISK APPETITE
 The VDAX NEW volatility index was up 5 1 percent after
hitting a four week closing high on Thursday  The higher the
index  the lower is investors  appetite for risky assets 
 Across Europe  Britain s FTSE 100 was down 0 8 percent 
Germany s DAX fell 0 7 percent and France s CAC 40 shed 1 3
percent 
 U S  stock index futures pointed to a softer start for Wall
Street 
  We have been waiting for a correction for quite a while  
said Heino Ruland  strategist at Ruland Research  in Frankfrut 
  The third quarter performed pretty strongly  With the
beginning of the fourth quarter  we have to realise that the
economy is by far not in the shape which the performance of the
equity market would suggest  
 Technology shares also came under pressure  tracking
weakness from U S  semiconductors after poor results by
technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture 
 TomTom  Alcatel Lucent  ASML Holding  Cap Gemini and
STMicroelectronics lost 2 8 7 6 percent 
 Carlsberg sagged 5 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded
the brewer to  sell   but SABMiller added 1 5 percent  helped by
Cazenove s positive comments 
 Munich Re gained 1 2 percent after receiving a boost from

5660,227175,ASML,Chinese ambassador warns Dutch government against restricting ASML supplies,news,"AMSTERDAM  Reuters    Trade relations between China and the Netherlands would be damaged if Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML  AS ASML  is not allowed to ship its newest machines to China  Beijing s ambassador to the Netherlands was quoted as saying on Wednesday 
Reuters reported last week that the Netherlands had withheld the license ASML needs to export its newest machines to China following pressure from the U S  government  
ASML  one of the Netherlands  largest companies  is a near monopolist in lithography  an essential step in the manufacture of computer chips  China has invested billions to develop its burgeoning semiconductor industry  but needs ASML equipment if its chipmakers are to compete with the best in Taiwan  South Korea and the United States 
 We are concerned that the Netherlands is politicizing our trade relationship under American pressure   Chinese ambassador Xu Hong was quoted as saying in the Het Financieele Dagblad newspaper 
 If this movement continues it will of course negatively affect bilateral relations  
After a lengthy trade war  the United States and China are expected to announce a limited trade deal on Wednesday that will not resolve disputes over technology transfers 
A spokeswoman for the Chinese embassy confirmed Xu had been interviewed by the newspaper  and said the embassy would publish a complete transcript later on Wednesday 
In the interview  Xu noted that China was an important export market for the Netherlands 
In 2018  the Netherlands also imported 39 2 billion euros   43 7 billion  worth of Chinese goods  two thirds of which was exported on to other countries 
ASML  which is due to report full year earnings next week  has said it can t ship its newest machines without a license  as they are considered  dual use  goods with potential military applications  It says an export request is under consideration 
Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on Friday the government treated dual use export requests on a case by case basis and he would not comment on individual cases 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Irene Gerritsen said on Wednesday the government did not have any new response in light of Xu s remarks 
 When deciding whether to issue an export license  the Dutch government weighs both the economic and security interests   she said in an emailed statement ",2020-01-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinese-ambassador-warns-dutch-government-against-restricting-asml-supplies-2060114,2060114

Dollar drops after jumping on positive retail sales  housing data
Bitcoin extends slide below  10 000 critical level

Key Events
Futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 ticked mildly higher and bucked a falling Asian trend this morning  against a backdrop of renewed U S  China tensions and protracted uncertainty over the Fed s path to lower interest rates 
Europe s STOXX 600 pared a lower open that threatened to end a three day winning streak  At the open  a selloff in financials offset a tech rally  The banking sector dropped with Swedish banks after Svenska Handelsbanken  ST SHBa  disappointed on earnings  and Swedbank  ST SWEDa  cut shareholder pay out policy  Technology stocks  conversely  led a charge higher on the back of ASML  AS ASML  s earnings beat 
In the earlier Asian session  regional equities edged lower after a pick up in U S  President Donald Trump s tariffs rhetoric resulted in a lackluster U S  session performance  South Korea s KOSPI   0 91   underperformed  while Australia s S P ASX 200   0 49   bucked the regional trend 
Global Financial Affairs
In yesterday s U S  session  equities retreated from all time highs as strong earnings beat from some key market players such as JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  and J J  NYSE JNJ  were overshadowed by comments  from President Donald Trump  that higher tariffs on China could be reimposed should the Asian country fail to substantially increase its purchases of U S  farm goods  On its part  China added hard liner Commerce Minister Zhong Shan to its negotiating team  sparking worries of new diplomatic tensions 
The S P 500   0 34   ended a five day advance  Trade sensitive sectors Energy and Technology lagged   1 10  and  0 95  respectively   the former also tracking weakening oil prices 
Renewed trade worries hit demand for oil also based on the consideration that OPEC producers recently synchronized their production cut decision to progress in trade talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping  as ongoing trade spat jitters had strengthened the outlook for a slowdown in global growth and fuel demand 
Tech companies  growth is also particularly dependent on smooth trade relations  with the U S  China dispute seen  at a core level  as a struggle for global tech dominance  Industrials   0 65   outperformed 

Technically  the SPX completed an evening star  at the very top of a broadening pattern since Jan  2018  connecting the highs of January and September 2018  while connecting the lows of February and December 2018  A broadening pattern tends to develop at market tops  and the fact that this evening star a three session bearish pattern develops right on the very top of a long term bearish pattern is very telling 

The dollar pared some gains after jumping on strong U S  retail sales and housing data yesterday  Nevertheless  investors bets on rate cuts remain high as they re pricing in a 100  probability of a 25 basis points cut and a 27  chance of a 50 basis points cut  However  some are resuming to question the Fed s resolve on easing policy as positive economic data accumulates from the recent job report beat to Friday s inflation uptick to yesterday s upbeat figures  Technically  the greenback met resistance of its falling channel top 

Bitcoin trimmed losses but remained below the  10 000 critical level  after Secretary of State Steven Mnuchin joined Trump and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in warning against the dangers of the crypto market  labeling it a  national security issue   Technically  the  10 000 psychological level breach is likely to attract more selling  At the same time  the price cut below the 50 DMA which has been acting as its natural uptrend line since February and  worst of all  it completed a double top 

Crude oil extended gains after rebounding off the 200 DMA after inventories fell by 1 4 million barrels  nearly half of the expected 2 7 million barrels  according to API  The softer tone adopted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Iran helped cool heightened tensions in the Gulf on Tuesday  prompting an earlier slide in WTI prices

 LONDON  July 15  Reuters    European shares closed higher on

Sachs and Intel  with banking stocks the biggest gainers 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was

weeks 
 The benchmark index  which slumped 45 percent in 2008 due to
the credit crisis  rose 1 2 percent in the previous session and
has gained 33 percent since hitting a record low in early March 
  There seems to have been a consistent out turn of
better than expected results with Goldman and Intel today in the
U S  There is a growing conviction that recovery is coming and
we are leaving the worst behind   said Mike Lenhoff  strategist
at Brewin Dolphin 
 Banking stocks added the most points to the index as results

 TECHNOLOGY STOCKS BOOSTED BY INTEL
 Technology stocks gained after U S  peer Intel s quarterly

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON  Oct 2  Reuters    European shares hit a four week
low on Friday  extending the previous day s sharp losses  as
investors were nervy before the U S  jobs figures after data
this week cast doubt about the strength of the recovery 
 By 0757 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1 percent at
971 93 points  after falling 1 6 percent on Thursday to a
three week closing low 
 The index  posting its best quarterly gains in nearly 10
years in the last quarter  was on track for a third day of
losses 
  We have been waiting for a correction for quite a while  
said Heino Ruland  strategist at Ruland Research  in Frankfrut 
  The third quarter performed pretty strongly  With the
beginning of the fourth quarter  we have to realise that the
economy is by far not in the shape which the performance of the
equity market would suggest  
 Banks  which have rallied 160 percent since March  were
among the top losers on concerns over the growth picture 
 KBC  UBS  Barclays  Societe Generale  BNP Paribas  Deutsche
Bank  Credit Suisse and Commerzbank lost 1 1 to 6 8 percent 
 But HSBC put on 0 6 percent  as traders said the bank was
the most defensive in the sector 
 Heavyweight commodity shares  which have also performed
strongly in the rally  were out of favour  BP  Royal Dutch Shell
  BG Group and Total dropped 0 4 to 1 1 percent 
 Among miners  BHP Billiton  Rio Tinto  Anglo American 
Xstrata  Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys were down 0 3 to 2 1
percent 
 All eyes will be on the U S  non farm payrolls data  due at
1230 GMT  for further evidence of the pace of the recovery in
the world s largest economy 
 Economists in a Reuters survey forecast 180 000 jobs were
lost in the month compared with a loss of 216 000 jobs in
August  while the unemployment rate is seen at 9 8 percent 
compared a 9 7 percent rate the prior month 
 The dollar held steady against most major currencies with
investors sitting tight ahead of the jobs data 
 The pan European index  which slumped 45 percent last year 
has rallied nearly 51 percent since hitting a floor in early
March  and is up 16 8 percent so far this year 
 
 LOW RISK APPETITE
 The VDAX NEW volatility index was up 6 percent after hitting
a four week closing high on Thursday  The higher the index  the
lower is investors  appetite for risky assets 
 Across Europe  Britain s FTSE 100 lost 0 7 percent 
Germany s DAX fell 0 8 percent and France s CAC 40 shed 1 3
percent 
 Overnight  the Dow Jones industrial average and the S P 500
 suffered their worst one day fall in three months  while
Japan s Nikkei average fell 2 5 percent 
  Consumer expectations are now extremely stretched relative
to the dismal reality  This also occurred during the early 1990s
credit crunch   Societe Generale s Albert Edwards said in a
note 
  Back then expectations also ran up far ahead of reality 
Interestingly  after the recession had ended in March 1991 
excessively optimistic expectations slumped three more times
until muddling reality caught up with excessive hope  Markets
still have too much hope  
 European automakers were also weak after September U S  auto
sales tumbled by 23 percent as showrooms emptied after the
government funded boom from the  cash for clunkers  programme 
 Daimler  Renault  Peugeot  BMA and Volvo were off 0 4 to 2 8
percent  but Volkswagen advanced 0 8 percent 
 Alcatel Lucent  ASML Holding  Cap Gemini and
STMicroelectronics lost 2 4 to 5 2 percent  leading the tech

5678,227193,ASML,Semiconductor WFE Stock Outlook  Avoiding Is A Good Idea,opinion,"Wafer fabrication is a process during which a silicon wafer  usually 200mm or 300mm in size  is treated with successive layers of conductive and semiconductive material using stencil like structures called reticles  After each deposition of material on the surface  the excess material is etched away and the wafer exposed to a light source to implant the design  This is the front end process  The back end process is involved in cutting up the individual die  packaging for protection and use  attaching of electrical leads and sorting 
So wafer fab equipment demand is dependent on the level of the demand for semiconductors themselves on the one hand and the level of installed capacity on the other 
Researchers are divided on the wafer fab equipment spending environment 
Gartner is forecasting declines in both 2019 and 2020  attributed to weak business conditions and inventory glut at customers 
SEMI expects the 19  decline in 2019 to be more than made up by a 20  rebound next year  mainly because of gyrations in the memory segment  which will decline 45  this year and grow 45  in the next  If the forecast holds true  2020 sales will still trail 2018 levels 
The last few years have seen the proliferation of smartphones and other consumer electronics gadgets  as well as cloud infrastructure buildouts  With smartphone demand moderating and IoT demand accelerating  both these segments are likely to be the most important drivers of semiconductor demand along with artificial intelligence  HPC and automotive  Communications infrastructure  5G  will jump on the bandwagon soon 
The three main themes for the industry are Memory typically makes up the largest part of WFE spending  so oversupply and softer pricing account for the current weakness in this industry  Foundry spending has already started to pick up  the strong growth in major foundry equipment supplier KLA Tencor s  KLAC  earnings estimates is evidence China is playing a larger role  as a consumer  because of the government s initiative to make the country a major producer of semiconductors  But there s a certain opacity to Chinese functioning that brings uncertainty to the market  Add to that the real concern that China will produce so much that prices will fall further  The trade war also isn t helping things Technology transitions  an important consideration for equipment purchases  will continue to respond to the move toward larger wafer sizes  fab upgrades to 300mm  as well as continued demand for 200mm   shrinking nodes  10nm and 7nm   memory chip advancements  3D NAND processes are maturing  driving down cost   denser packaging  MEMS  and so forth  Materials research  device complexities  the need for greater manufacturing integration and new applications are also important Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Continuing Challenges
The Zacks  Industry is a stock group within the broader Zacks  Sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  198  which places it in the bottom 22  of more than 250 Zacks industries 
Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1  So the group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued challenges going forward 
The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of deterioration in the earnings outlook of constituent companies in aggregate  The industry s aggregate earnings estimate revisions in the past year of a 25 0  decline for 2019 indicates negative growth potential 
Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture 
Industry Lags on Shareholder Returns
The Zacks Semiconductor Wafer Fab Equipment Industry has outperformed both the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector as well as the S P 500 index over the past year 
So we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 37 6  over the past year  while the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer and Technology Sector gained 2 3  and 1 6   respectively 
While the industry is small  players like Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   Lam Research and ASML Holding  AS ASML  NV are very important players  
One Year Price Performance

 
Industry s Current Valuation
On the basis of the forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is a commonly used method of valuing semiconductor equipment companies  we see that the industry is currently trading at 21 0X compared to the S P 500 s 17 2X  It is also slightly above the sector s forward 12 month P E of 20 5X 
Over the past year  the industry has traded as high as 21 0X  as low as 12 4X and at the median of 16 7X  as the chart below shows 
Forward 12 Month Price to Earnings  P E  Ratio

Bottom Line
As evident  the market is expected to get a bit worse before it gets better  as in all cyclical industries that go through periods of relative weakness  But there are secular drivers of semiconductor demand that are positive for the wafer fab equipment makers after 2020 
Here s a list of stocks that display the above characteristics

Summary
One important consideration related to investing is the need to separate process and outcome  Making an investment decision based on one s proven process yet losing money can be a painful experience  yet par for the course  Separating decisions from outcomes is necessary to understanding process  A recent article in the Wall Street Journal  quoting successful poker player  discusses such behavior 
 To deal with uncertainty  she says  traders and poker players must develop resilience and learn not to be guided too much by  results based behavior   Put another way  they must learn that it is possible to do everything right and have a bad outcome  and it is possible to do everything wrong maybe by throwing a dart at a list of stocks and win big

Our previous Stock Exchange reviewed the relevance of sentiment for a trading time frame  We reviewed some of the sentiment indicators and offered our own viewpoint  A new market high speaks for itself  Thanks to readers who joined in with comments about their own methods 
This Week 
Most investors find the pain of losing significantly worse than the pleasure of winning  what behavioral economists call loss aversion  Therefore  investors are conditioned to seek out an investment process that wins most of the time to avoid the unpleasant feeling of losing  Or they add additional rules to their process to avoid the most recent painful trade  Seeking out ways to avoid the pain of loss is antithetical to a robust investment process   a highly successful systematic investment manager   

 In order for a system to be successful  it has to be what I call robust  Robust means that I can test that system in a market I designed it around  Say I m using it in the treasury bonds  and then if I switch that market and I try that system in the Euro  it still works  And if I change its parameters  it still works  And if I switch it over to corn   something totally different than treasury bonds   it still works  And if I look at some data that was out of sample from what I designed it around  it still works  Then I have something that might be interesting and have a chance of living in the future  Because the nature of data is it changes a little all the time  And so the key to success in systems trading is to have what I call a loose fitting suit  I can t have a suit that s so tight and perfectly proportioned to me that if I gain two pounds  it won t fit the data anymore  
Investors will always look for the  holy grail  strategy that will win all the time allowing for them to avoid the inevitable pain of loss  However  history demonstrates that utilizing a robust strategy and becoming more comfortable with the inevitable losing periods is the key to successful investing over time  What do you think  We welcome comments and discussion from other traders 
Expert Picks from The Models

Holmes  I bought shares of the Medicines Company    on November 14th 




TT  How do you feel about the trade 
Holmes  I purchased for technical reasons  Specifically  I am a short term dip buyer  and I like to buy attractive pullbacks  as you can see in the chart above 




TT  I see the pullback you re talking about  and it looks attractive so long as you believe the stock can bounce from here 
Holmes  As a technical trader  with a holding period typically around 6 weeks  I don t care too much about long term fundamentals  I sold this position for a 2  gain the next day 11 15 
TT  That was a very quick and attractive gain  thanks for sharing Holmes 





Road Runner  Interesting discussion guys  I recently purchased shares of ASML Holding NV    on 11 11  Any comments or questions 
TT  Why d you buy it 




RR  I like to buy attractive momentum stocks in the lower end of a rising channel  as you can see in the following chart 
TT  It seems like a rounded consolidation within a rising channel and trading at a multiyear high price  Attractive stock indeed 
RR  That s correct  There are a few more data points that go into each trade  but essentially  yes you got it 
TT  Okay  I think this trade has potential  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Athena any trades to share this week 

Athena  I bought shares of Fortive Corp    on November 15th 




TT  Looks like it s breaking out of the recent downtrend 




Athena  I look for stocks having strong positive trends and then select only those with the very strongest trends   king of the hill    constantly replacing the ones with weaker trends  It should not surprise anyone that I bought Fortive  A quick look at the chart should make the strength of the trend obvious  And I generally continue to hold my positions until either the strength of the trend abates or a stock with an even higher trend strength comes along  I don t have a set  holding period  for a position  I will exit only when either a stronger stock comes along or if market conditions dictate a strong potential for loss   capital preservation remains the key driver in all situations 
TT  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Emerald Bay 
Emerald Bay  I bought shares of Arconic    on November 13th 




TT  It looks like these shares have been rising steadily in a tight channel for months before you purchased 
EB  I seek exposure to the highest momentum names in our large cap equity universe  adjusted for volatility  Specifically  I like to base my position sizes on volatility with more capital invested in the less volatile stocks 
TT  You ve been doing quite well since purchasing this position and I suspect you ll hold it until the trend changes  Thank you for sharing 




Jeff  This time a good chart is supported by good earnings  As long as you are not a dividend investor  this is fine

The UK holds that the international law is taking too long  so although that was its first preference  it has to make an interim law that will go into operation in April  The U S  stands to suffer because companies like Alphabet  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Amazon will be affected while other big non American companies won t  So Mnuchin said that these kinds of measures would bring retaliatory action from the U S   such as a tax on British cars Additionally  the post Brexit UK has trade agreements with the EU as its first priority and something officials feel will happen this year  so any deal with the U S  will only come after that ASML Chief Takes U S  China Tiff in Its StrideASML chief executive Peter Wennink told Bloomberg radio that the ongoing trade negotiations between the U S  and Europe wouldn t affect the company adversely The reason the company is caught in the midst of the dog fight is that it has a near monopoly in EUV technology  which is essential for chip manufacture  Since China wants to grow a semiconductor industry to reduce reliance on costly imports and make it a front runner in technological prowess  it desperately needs the lithography equipment that ASML makes  The U S  on the other hand  is trying to thwart China s progress as it irons out differences on trade deficit and other things while keeping itself in the lead The ASML equipment in question requires a special government license for export because it falls in the  dual use  category  meaning it has military applications  So U S  government officials were able to get in the middle  With the license not renewed  ASML couldn t deliver the  150 million machine to China s Semiconductor Manufacturing International  the first Chinese company to have raised such an order  the machines are currently sold in the U S   South Korea and Taiwan  Wennink s thinking is that since the required number of chips the global tech industry consumes have to be made by somebody  it doesn t matter who makes them as far as the company s financials are concerned  So it doesn t matter that Chinese ambassador Xu Hong is protesting  Moreover  since the Netherlands reportedly imports 39 2 billion euros   43 7 billion  of Chinese goods  some of it for resale   its likely  relations  will hold up TripAdvisor Job CutsTripAdvisor is reportedly reducing its headcount by about 200 from the 3 800 it employed at September end  The company appears to be seeing challenges in its business as the going is rough with Google s competing business and TripAdvisor forced to spend more on ads above the search engine results page  The company is not suing Google yet  but since the situation is expected to change any time soon  it is reallocating expenses to maintain profitability Tech Leads Business Lobbying in 2019The five biggest tech companies by market value together spent  62 2 million on lobbying in 2019  3  less than in 2018  Facebook topped the list  followed by Amazon and Apple although Alphabet s spending surprisingly declined as it overhauled its lobbying structure  The second largest business group was the U S  Chamber of Commerce  which spent  58 2 million and doubled the amount spent by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  which takes care of most for the lobbying for pharma companies The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tech-daily-aapl-bug-amzn-jedi-motion-music-subs-uk-digital-tax-more-200501109,200501109
