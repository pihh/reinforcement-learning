134980,356495,TDC,Teradata  TDC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Teradata  TDC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This data management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 5  
Revenues are expected to be  482 78 million  down 11 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Teradata 
For Teradata  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Teradata will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Teradata would post earnings of  0 19 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 22  delivering a surprise of  15 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Teradata doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/teradata-tdc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200445095,200445095
134981,356496,TDC,Teradata  TDC  Meets Q2 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Teradata  TDC  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 29 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 26 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this data management company would post earnings of  0 19 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 22  delivering a surprise of 15 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Teradata  which belongs to the Zacks Computer  Storage Devices industry  posted revenues of  478 million for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 99   This compares to year ago revenues of  544 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Teradata shares have lost about 4 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for Teradata 
While Teradata has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Teradata was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 43 on  495 44 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 48 on  1 98 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Computer  Storage Devices is currently in the bottom 34  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/teradata-tdc-meets-q2-earnings-estimates-200449559,200449559

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Teradata 
For Teradata  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0

So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Teradata will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number

135027,356542,TDC,SMCI Vs  TDC  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Computer  Storage Devices sector might want to consider either Super Micro Computer  SMCI  or Teradata  TDC   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Super Micro Computer has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Teradata has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that SMCI s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
SMCI currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 64  while TDC has a forward P E of 31 09  We also note that SMCI has a PEG ratio of 1 05  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  TDC currently has a PEG ratio of 10 36 
Another notable valuation metric for SMCI is its P B ratio of 1 55  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  TDC has a P B of 8 29 
These metrics  and several others  help SMCI earn a Value grade of A  while TDC has been given a Value grade of C 
SMCI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TDC  so it seems like value investors will conclude that SMCI is the superior option right now ",2018-06-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/smci-vs-tdc-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200326063,200326063

Total revenue of  526 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  510 5 million  However  it plunged 4 7  on a year over year basis  This was mainly due to the company s ongoing business transformation activity  under which its large customers have begun shifting to subscription based offerings

The company reported non GAAP operating income of  50 million  down from  121 million reported in the prior year quarter  Non GAAP operating margin declined to 9 5  from 21 9  reported in the year ago quarter mainly due to lower revenues  shrinking gross margin and higher operating expenses to support the company s strategic initiatives 
Balance Sheet   Share Repurchase
Teradata exited the quarter with  1 025 billion in cash and cash equivalents  compared with  1 085 billion at the end of the previous quarter  Teradata had long term debt  excluding current portion  of  493 million at the end of the third quarter compared with  508 million at the end of second quarter 2017

   To Conclude
Teradata revenues are being adversely impacted by the company s ongoing business transformation  Also  restructuring related costs  a sluggish spending environment in the domestic market and increasing competition will continue to weigh on its financials 
However  we expect growth to come from new strategic partnerships as Teradata has long standing business relationships with large organizations such as Accenture   NYSE ACN    Capgemini  Deloitte  Cognizant   NASDAQ CTSH    IBM   NYSE IBM    Wipro Limited  among others in the same niche market  We believe that new customer wins and strengthening relationships with large vendors will primarily drive revenues and profits 
The company is expected to benefit from transition to the subscription based revenue model in the long run

135068,356583,TDC,Is Teradata Corporation  TDC  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Teradata Corporation   NYSE TDC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Teradata has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 66  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 18  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Teradata s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Computer  Storage Devices industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 58  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Teradata has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 28 4  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Teradata has a P S ratio of about 1 70  This is far lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  TDC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Teradata currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Teradata a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Teradata might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives TDC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimate revisions have been pretty mixed  Although the current and next year estimates have not seen any revision in the past sixty days   the current year consensus estimate has risen by 2  in the past two months  where as the full year estimate has inched lower by 2 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Teradata Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTeradata is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Computer Storage Devices industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into

135094,356609,TDC,Big Data Says Ride The Reversal Higher In Teradata,opinion,"Teradata  NYSE TDC   was in a rut  The stock had fallen from a high over  45 in May 2015 to a low under  22 in February  When the broad market bounced so did Teradata  but it could never move back over the area that was support at 27 60  That was until they reported earnings last week and canned their CEO  The stock jumped 13  that day  back to the resistance area  What is next 
The chart below shows that jump took the price over the 200 day SMA for the first time since the fall started a year ago  And it has consolidated since  Just a 23 6  retracement of the leg lower  Pretty weak bounce so far  But that consolidation is bullish upon closer inspection  The digestion of the move higher on falling volume suggest sellers dropping by the wayside and that buyers may overwhelm them shortly 

The momentum indicators support a break to the upside as well  The RSI moved into the bullish zone and is holding there while the MACD is rising  The Bollinger Bands  area also opening to the upside  A Measured Move out of the flag would target 32  And with 13  of the float short it has fuel to rise

135095,356610,TDC,Teradata  TDC  Q2 Earnings  What To Expect This Time ,opinion,"Teradata Corp    NYSE TDC   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 2  Last quarter  the company posted a 19 35  positive earnings surprise 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Teradata is a leading provider of data warehousing and enterprise analytics  The company is well positioned to benefit from robust growth in the data warehousing market based on a strong product portfolio  customer wins  strategic partnerships and accretive acquisitions  Teradata s international expansion  improved traction from sales force expansion  new products and alliances  market share gains and a growing database analytics market should be another set of positives for the company 
The company plans to exit its Marketing Application business to build up its capabilities in the growing Data and Analytics business  which will likely impact its profits in the near term  Simultaneously  the company is also working to optimize its cost structure and streamline its operations  which are expected to benefit the company s financials in this year itself 
This apart  increasing competition from peers like Oracle   NYSE ORCL   and IBM Corp    NYSE IBM   remain concerns 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Teradata is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Teradata currently has an Earnings ESP of  5 88  ESP as the Most Accurate estimate of 51 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents 
Zacks Rank  Teradata currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum TERADATA CORP Price and EPS Surprise

135115,356630,TDC,Teradata  TDC  To Report Q1 Earnings  Will It Miss Again ,opinion,"Teradata Corp    NYSE TDC   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  Last quarter  the company posted a 3 08  negative earnings surprise  The company has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 13 87  over the past four quarters 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Since the past few quarters  Teradata s business has been impacted by unfavorable customer purchase patterns  The recent realignment of its sales force in the U S  may further make things difficult for the company   In the first quarter  the company is also expected to exit from most of its Marketing Applications business  resulting in an after tax loss of 7 million 
In addition  a sluggish spending environment in the domestic market and increasing competition from peers like EMC Corp  NYSE EMC    Oracle   NYSE ORCL   and IBM Corporation   NYSE IBM   also remain concerns 
Nonetheless  the company can benefit from the robust growth in data warehousing market given its decent product portfolio  customer wins  strategic partnerships and accretive acquisitions  Another positive for the company is its cloud version for Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services which can be an important contributor for the top line  In addition  the company s sales can also get some respite owing to a stabilizing currency market 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Teradata is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Teradata currently has a 0 00  ESP because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 31 cents 
Zacks Rank  Teradata currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a 0 00  ESP  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum

135144,356659,TDC,Since Markets Go Up And Down  Here s What To Buy Now And Later,opinion,"We all know the market has to correct  sometime   In the springtime blush of an outlier market in 2013  some people may have forgotten this simple truth  but markets do go down as well as up  That s why I always provide a 144 year historical chart of the S P in every issue of our investment publication  It allows us to see the forest as well as the trees  It keeps us from either panicking when everyone thinks the sky is falling or over extending when the market shoots ahead on thin volume and speculative enthusiasm 
Regular readers are unsurprised by this current correction  We ve been expecting a correction for some time and tried to position for it  not by day trading or jumping in and out trying to time the market  but simply by buying a fair amount of long short mutual funds  quality high dividend paying stocks and those with a lower Beta than the market itself 
So the question on everyone s lips now becomes  is this the end of the bull market we ve enjoyed since the spring of 2009  No one knows  but our best guess is  Probably  if only for a few months of much needed correction  anyway   Think of a balloon that is difficult to blow up at first  then becomes easier to inflate the more hot air we blow into it  If we just keep blowing  it will burst  But if we occasionally let a little air escape  and then re inflate it  the walls have stretched and can better handle the increased volume of air  Well  the market of 2013 definitely had lots of hot air blown into it so a normal correction should be welcomed  not feared 
If we are correct  expect a market pullback severe enough to turn johnny come lately bulls into scared rabbits    12   15      after which time the mid term elections may give a boost to investors  hopes that the long day s journey into night that has been the US economy will turn better with new adult leadership  sending the market higher  This is often the case after the mid term elections presage positive changes and the politicians do whatever they can to make certain the economy is firing on all cylinders 
The bottom line is that we are reallocating with a view to buying the best companies at the best price  So we have placed ever tighter trailing stops on most of our long positions  if they begin to execute you can be certain we ll advise our readers and provide actionable avenues to protect ourselves in the event a broad decline is beginning 
We are buying more long short mutual funds and ETPs PowerShares S P 500 Downside Hedge  PHDG  and Barclays S P 500 Dynamic VEQTOR ETN  VQT   We are also buying convertible bonds and  income funds  that are allowed to trade bonds like RiverPark Strategic Income  RSIVX   not merely hold them  We still want capital gains  we just don t want pure long equity positions to get there 
What will we buy if this proves to become a real decline  America 
Never Give Up on America
You read it here first  America is going to be the rebounding center of global manufacturing  The confluence of two of our Big Themes  an energy independent North America and the onshoring of jobs once lost to Asia and other emerging market regions  virtually guarantees that American industrial might will prevail 
When the higher productivity of higher wage US  Canadian and Mexican workers is factored into the equation and we add the incredible energy advantage North American  and especially US  manufacturers are gaining  the results are baked in  To this last issue  let s take a look at an erstwhile fine competitor to US manufacturing  a reunited and re energized Germany  Yet just recently  German economy and energy minister Sigmar Gabriel said Germany risks  dramatic deindustrialization  if it doesn t reduce energy costs  After Angela Merkel declared Germany would decommission its low cost per BTU nuclear infrastructure  and continued that nation s long term bowing and scraping to pressure from the Green party  energy costs soared in Germany 
All those windmills that now cover the landscape cost way more than their proponents said they would and produce considerably less power  The story for solar energy is even worse  Tropical nations  with long days of abundant sunshine  can certainly benefit from solar power  Many temperate areas are the same  think Arizona to Florida in America s Southwest and Southeast  But  really now  in places where the mid winter sun only shines  on the rare day it does  for 6 to 8 hours a day  who was the leader dumb enough to extract extra taxes from the citizens in order to install massive solar farms 
Take a look at a map  You ll note that Berlin  Germany is actually farther north than Saskatoon  Saskatchewan  The difference is that Saskatchewan has gas and oil nearby  Really nearby 
In Germany  the various subsidies and renewable energy taxes are now costing German consumers and industry some  32 billion a year  And it isn t just Germany  In December  the Center for European Policy Studies noted that European steelmakers are paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for natural gas as we do in the U S  Energy for power and transportation of finished goods are two of the largest costs for any manufacturer  If U S  manufacturers pay half as much for electricity  and one fourth as much for natural gas  how long do you think it will take for that to translate into a compelling pricing advantage for U S  manufacturers 
In addition  our source of gas is stable  we derive it primarily from the USA and Canada  One of these days  we may even replace some Venezuelan  Nigerian and Saudi oil  versus nat gas  with oil from Canada  as well  if our president makes the common sense decision to approve Keystone XL  which was proposed in June of 2008 and has been held hostage ever since by well meaning folks    even though the safety  economic  and environmental issues are not on their side 
For us  the decision is simple  the oil is either coming to the U S  or TransCanada  the owner of the larger Keystone Pipeline System  will build a different pipeline and send it by sea to China  Either way the environmental footprint is the same  but China gets a secure source of energy while we spend billions to keep the sea lanes open to Nigeria  Sounds like cutting off our nose to spite our face  doesn t it 
Even if some Canadian oil finds its way to the U S   the other binary decision is  it will either come by pipeline or it will come by rail  There are currently over 200 000 miles of oil pipelines all across the USA  and the safety record of pipeline transmission is vastly superior to that of rail 
As for environmental complaints that Canadian oil sands are a dirty fuel   they are cleaner than coal  which they will replace  and as clean  environmentally  as California crude or  for that matter  the environmental lobby s favorite  ethanol processing 
Indeed  thanks to the shale revolution  the U S  is actually reducing emissions faster  at less expense  than the EU  Between 2005 and 2012  U S  carbon dioxide emissions fell by 10 9   according to the  Statistical Review of World Energy 2013   During the same period the EU s emissions fell by 9 9   according to the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency 
Meanwhile  elsewhere in the world  global coal consumption has risen by about 55  over the past decade as populations grew  manufacturing was shifted to them  and demand for electricity soared  While important projects like Keystone XL are being held up and U S  consumers and manufacturers are paying electricity rates that could  and very well might  come down even faster  the U S  is the world leader in cutting carbon dioxide emissions   and our willingness to find cheap sources of energy close to home has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs  no thanks to the politicians 
Recently  energy economist Wallace Tyner estimated that by 2035 the shale revolution will have added  473 billion per year to the U S  economy  American consumers will benefit and I predict that American manufacturing  as a result of all three of our Big Themes  adding the Internet of Everything to North American Energy Independence and Onshoring of Jobs  will enjoy a resurgence that will dwarf our current economic malaise 
So    will there be a market decline  Sooner or later  absolutely  If not this month  then next  If not this quarter  then next  But for our part  that just means the chance to scoop up great American manufacturers and energy producers at prices 10  or more below their current prices  By adding income funds  convertible bonds and long short mutual funds and ETFs to the mix  we aim to have funds available to buy low 
Here s our take on the specifics 
THE TYPICAL BULL MARKET LASTS 4 4 YEARS  This one has already gone on 5 years  
THE HISTORIC MEAN CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED S P 500 PE RATIO IS 16 5   It s currently above 25
 
I d add to these  valuation concerns that corporate revenues are dreadful and earnings are only slightly better  and that QE  the basis for much of the cash sloshing around to buy equities  is declining month by month   I then subtract an  x  factor for the market s ability to go to extremes for longer than anyone expects  and finally note that our Growth   Value portfolio is still on an even keel but the trailing stops in our Aggressive Portfolio have mostly been triggered    Oracle  NYSE ORCL   Teradata  NYSE TDC   Titan International  NYSE TWI   Rydex S P Equal Weight Fund  RSP  and FirstTrust Technology AlphaDEX  FXL  all were triggered  only Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   Penn West Petroleum  PWE   and the PowerShares S P 500 Downside Hedge ETF  PHDG  are still outstanding  and close to their stop points     All these are signs to me that the market is churning like it does at market tops 
 
It s time to play defense   We re going to increase our exposure to income offerings and decrease our exposure to purely long equities  particularly those with great stories  lousy earnings  and no dividends   Specifically  as of the close on Monday  April 21 
IN THE GROWTH   VALUE PORTFOLIO  we will

Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter
