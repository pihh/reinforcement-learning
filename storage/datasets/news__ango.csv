Segment Details
The company currently generates revenues from four major groups  viz  Cardiac and Vascular Group  CVG   Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  MITG   Restorative Therapies Group  RTG  and Diabetes Group 
CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure  CRHF   Coronary   Structural Heart  CSH  and Aortic   Peripheral Vascular divisions  APV   MITG includes the Surgical Innovations  SI  and the Respiratory  Gastrointestinal   Renal  RGR  divisions  RTG comprises the Spine  Brain Therapies  Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments  while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management  IIM   Non Intensive Diabetes Therapies  NDT   and Diabetes Service   Solutions  DSS  divisions 
CVG revenues improved 1 6  at constant exchange rate or CER  down 0 5  as reported  to  2 79 billion  driven by mid single digit growth in CSH and APV offset by low single digit drop in CRHF  all at CER 
CRHF sales totaled  1 39 billion  down 2 3  year over year at CER  down 4 1  as reported   The mid single digits growth in Arrhythmia Managementwas offset by mid teens declines in Heart Failure  including mid forties declines in sales of left ventricular assist devices 
CSH revenues were up 5 9  at CER  up 3  as reported  to  913 million driven by mid teens constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong global uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform  The company reported flat year over year coronary sales in the reported quarter as the mid teens growth in guide catheters and low double digit growth in coronary balloons were offset by mid single digit declines in drug eluting stents 
APV revenues registered 6 1  growth at CER  up 4 2  as reported  to  476 million  driven by mid teens growth in Venous  mid teens growth of in drug coated balloon  DCB  and high single digit growth in thoracic stent graft systems  all at comparable CER basis

Gross margin in the reported quarter contracted 24 basis points  bps  to 69 9  on a 3 2  rise in cost of revenues to  2 27 billion  Adjusted operating margin improved 73 bps year over year to 27 4  despite a 0 4  rise in research and development expenses  to  561 million  and a 2 9  uptick in selling  general and administrative expenses  to  2 59 billion   Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled  57 million as compared with  128 million a year ago 
Guidance Revised
The company has updated its fiscal 2019 revenue guidance 
For the full year  organic revenue growth expectations have been narrowed to the range of 5 25 5 5  from the previous range of 5 0 5 5   Currency fluctuation is now expected to negatively impact the top line by  425  475 million  previous guidance range was  420  520 million   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  30 53 billion 
Fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS view is raised at the range of  5 14  5 16 from the earlier announced range of  5 10  5 15  Currency fluctuation is expected to havea modestly positive impact on the full year adjusted EPS  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 12 falls below the guided range 
Our Take
Medtronic exited third quarter fiscal 2019 on a mixed note  While it reported a better than expected earnings performance  revenues missed the mark  The company has demonstrated improved performances at CER banking on growth in most of the business segments and all geographies  This highlighted sustainability across groups and regions  in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets  Apart from product innovation  the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses 
However  we are concerned about the company s sluggish CRHF performance  This apart  costs continue to escalate putting pressure on margins

   Revenues from CVS Health s Retail LTC were up by 5 4  year over year to  22 03 billion  According to the company  the result was based on increased prescription volume and branded drug price inflation  partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions  Front store revenues increased in the reported quarter primarily banking on improvement in health product sales 
Total prescription volume grew 8 6  driven by the continued adoption of patient care programs and collaborations with PBMs as well as preferred status in a number of Medicare Part D networks during 2018 
LTC business in the quarter however  was facing industry wide challenges like lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities  significant deterioration in the financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customers which resulted in a number of customer bankruptcies in 2018  These have adversely affected the company s ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the company acquired Omnicare 
Following the closing of CVS Health s acquisition of Aetna  the company has integrated Aetna s Health Care segment to its business and renamed it as Health Care Benefits segment  In the reported quarter  the company registered revenues of  5 55 billion within this segment 
Gross profit improved 67 1  to  13 9 billion  Accordingly  gross margin expanded 833 bps to 25 5   Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 597 bps to 13 3  
Outlook
CVS Health has provided its 2019 guidance 
Adjusted EPS is expected in the band of  6 68 to  6 88  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  7 38 per share  outside the company s guided range  This apart  its 2019 adjusted operating profit guidance remains in the range  14 8 billion to  15 2 billion 
Further  the company expects cash flow from operations in the band of  9 8 billion to  10 3 billion 
Our Take
CVS Health ended the year 2018 on promising note with fourth quarter earnings and revenues both ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  The year over year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment  benefiting from the upside in the specialty services  The company s recently introduced Health Care Benefits segment following the Aetna acquisition holds immense promise 
Also  strong year over year Retail LTC comparisons were encouraging  However  the LTC business is facing industry wide challenges  The EPS projection for the full year 2019 currently looks lackluster

22324,243839,ANGO,Can AngioDynamics  ANGO  Pull A Surprise In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"AngioDynamics Inc    NASDAQ ANGO   is set to report second quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 4  before market opens  Last quarter  the company reported adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents On an average  AngioDynamics delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9 79  in the trailing four quarters  However  a lackluster price performance over the last year and high debt levels continue to hinder the company  AngioDynamics  shares have returned a mere 0 7  compared with the  s rally of 24  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Strong Product Portfolio  AngioDynamics  wide array of products like AngioVac  BioFlo and NanoKnife enhances market opportunities  Notably  the PV business  peripheral vascular sales  has also built a strong momentum  AngioDynamics has been experiencing growth in other product families like Food Management  Thrombus Management  BioFlo products and NanoKnife disposables in the Oncology section 
Solero MTA System to Drive Growth  The company rides on the market s solid response to Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation  MTA  system  especially within the Microwave Ablation space  The platform is intended to be used for the ablation of soft tissue during open procedures  Per management  Solero was the primary driver for the whopping 11  year over year increase in the oncology surgery sales last quarter 
Robust Fundamental Growth Story  Over the last 4 years  the company s sales witnessed a CAGR of 0 3   whereas  earnings per share saw a CAGR of 11 3   The company expects to benefit from the ongoing market transition toward less invasive interventional procedures in the upcoming years 
Unfavorable Estimate Revision Trend  The estimate revision trend for the current quarter has been unfavorable for AngioDynamics  In the current quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues fell 1 4  year over year to  87 80 million  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings declined 12 3  to 17 cents per share on a year over year basis AngioDynamics  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   
Earnings WhispersHowever  our quantitative model does not conclusively show earnings beat for AngioDynamics in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  AngioDynamics currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 17 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  AngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision momentum

AngioDynamics  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Segment Details
Peripheral Vascular  PV  business  Sales at this segment totaled  51 4 million in the reported quarter  down 4 3  from the year ago quarter 
Growth in the Fluid and Thrombus Management product lines was offset by declines in the Venous Insufficiency and Angiographic Catheter businesses  as well as the persistent winding down of the company s supply agreement with Boston Scientific Corp    NYSE BSX   
Notably  AngioDynamics is a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space  catheter directed thrombolysis   The company boasts highly unique catheters like Uni Fuse  SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio 
Vascular Access  VA  business  Sales at this segment were  22 6 million  down 4 2  from  23 6 million on a year over year basis  The segment witnessed solid sales in BioFlo related products  However  it was offset by declines in the remaining product lines within the segment 
Oncology Surgery business  AngioDynamics witnessed sales of  12 8 million in the second quarter  an increase of 8 4  from  11 8 million on a year over year basis  The upside was primarily driven by additional sales of the recently launched Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation System 
Margin Details
As a percentage of revenues  adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points  bps  to 49 3  in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  from 50 6  in the year ago quarter  The decline in gross margin was primarily because of an inventory write off related to VOLTA  the company s radio frequency ablation product  that was previously sold in Japan 
Adjusted EBITDAS in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was  13 3 million compared with  15 2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 
Financial Condition
AngioDynamics had a strong cash flow balance in the second quarter  Per management  the company generated  10 2 million in operating cash flow and  9 4 million in free cash flow 
Additionally  AngioDynamics ended the quarter with  51 5 million in cash and cash equivalents and debt of  95 million 
FY18 View Lacks Luster
AngioDynamics reduced its guidance for fiscal 2018  For fiscal 2018  the company expects net sales in the range of  345  350 million compared with the previous range of  352  359 million 
Free cash flow is expected in the range of  30  35 million 
However  the company has reaffirmed previously announced adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 64 68 cents  excluding any impact from the recently legislated 2017 Tax Reform Act 
Our Take
AngioDynamics reported a dismal second quarter of fiscal 2018  wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The company also reiterated guidance for fiscal 2018  AngioDynamicis rides on the market s solid response to Solero  especially within the Microwave Ablation space  Per management  AngioDynamics  consistent focus on financial discipline and building a high quality capital structure will boost investments toward innovative product portfolio and pursue strategic acquisitions 
On the flipside  a drop in the core Angiographic Catheter business has affected the Peripheral Vascular Business segment  The company also has a high outstanding debt level  Higher debts impose certain operating and financial restrictions which might limit the execution of the company s core business strategies

22420,243935,ANGO,AngioDynamics  ANGO  Misses On Earnings   Revenues In Q1,opinion,AngioDynamics Inc    NASDAQ ANGO   reported adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2018  Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and decreased 29 4  year over year  Meanwhile  net sales fell almost 3 4  on a year over year basis to  85 4 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  86 million It is important to note that foreign exchange did not have any impact in the reported quarter  However  continued softness in the Vascular Access and Venous business affected revenues in the first quarter Internationally  AngioDynamics registered revenues of  16 5 million  up from  15 9 million in the year ago quarter  International growth was strengthened by solid sales from the Oncology and Surgery business  However  the company registered  68 9 million revenues in the United States  down from  72 2 million on a year over year basis  The lackluster performance was led by softness in the venous business  which was more or less muted by growth in the oncology portfolio AngioDynamics  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Segment DetailsPeripheral Vascular  PV  business  Sales at this segment totaled  49 9 million in the reported quarter  lower than  52 million in the year ago quarter The quarter saw slow growth in the venous and core businesses  which was offset by stellar performance in fluid management and thrombus management product lines Despite the disappointing performance in the PV segment  management expects the thrombus management platform to lend the company a competitive edge and open up significant long term opportunities We note that AngioDynamics is a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space  catheter directed thrombolysis   The company boasts highly unique catheters like Uni Fuse  SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio Vascular Access  VA  business  Sales at this segment were  23 2 million  down from  25 million on a year over year basis  However  this was offset by solid growth at BioFlo Midlines and Dialysis The BioFlo line of products at the segment is expected to be a key catalyst Oncology Surgery business  AngioDynamics witnessed sales of 12 3 million in the first quarter  up from  11 1 million on a year over year basis  The segment performed impressively on the recent launch of Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation System Meanwhile  AngioDynamics announced market withdrawal of its flagship Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System in the last quarter Margin DetailsAdjusted gross margin decreased 280 basis points  bps  to 48 3  in the quarter  The decline in gross margin was primarily because of voluntary market withdrawal of the Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System in the recent past  Solero s direct impact on gross margins was approximately 90 bps Adjusted EBITDAS in the first quarter of fiscal 2018  excluding the items shown in the attached reconciliation table  was  10 6 million compared with  14 2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Financial ConditionAngioDynamics had a strong cash flow balance in the first quarter  Per management  the company generated  3 million in operating cash flow and  2 5 million in free cash flow Additionally  AngioDynamics ended the quarter with  48 2 million as cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt of  96 3 million GuidanceAngioDynamics reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2018 For fiscal 2018  the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of 64 cents to 68 cents The company projects fiscal 2018 revenues in the range of  352 million to  359 million Furthermore  free cash flow is expected to be more than  35 million Our TakeAngioDynamics reported a dismal first quarter of fiscal 2018 wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company also reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2018  AngioDynamicis rides on the market s solid response to Solero  especially within the Microwave Ablation space  Growth in the core Angiographic Catheter business is also likely to fortify the company s footprint in the global space On the flipside  AngioDynamics recalled the Acculis Microwave Tissue Ablation System under the Oncology and Surgery segment last quarter  The company also had a high outstanding debt level at the end of the first quarter  Higher debts impose certain operating and financial restrictions which might limit the execution of the company s core business strategies Zacks Rank   Key PicksAngioDynamics has a

22442,243957,ANGO,Your Personal Healthcare Investment Plan,opinion,"Healthcare has been a hot topic of late with presidential candidates Clinton and Trump doubling down on promises as the run up to the election on Nov 8  And it makes sense because according to a Pew Research survey from earlier this year  74  of voters said that healthcare was an important consideration determining their vote  behind only economy  terrorism and foreign policy  which were the top considerations      
As far as healthcare focused stocks are concerned  Clinton has it in for insurance and pharma companies  blaming them for rising drug costs  She also doesn t like pharma companies splurging on ads when they could have put the money into R D instead  Trump would like to relax regulations for insurance companies in a way that would promote competition 
Whatever their theories  these segments of the healthcare sector are likely to be volatile in the near term  So this might just be the right time to take a look at the medical instruments segment  which has a lot going for it 
For one thing  medical instrument makers are increasingly collaborating with technology companies to expand beyond traditional genres  This has opened up opportunities in robotics  wearables  implantable devices  electronic health records  EHR  and more  So with the government focused on reforms  it s not too far fetched to imagine that corporate focus  and wellness spending  on Fitbit  type wearables that are part of preventive healthcare will increase 
Digital health startups are also seeing record funding  CB Insights data puts 2015 investment in the segment at  5 74 billion  led by organizations like Qualcomm s  Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Ventures  Alphabet s  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Ventures  Merck   NYSE MRK    General Electric  NYSE GE   as well as VC firms Norwest Venture Partners and Lux Capital 
Given the emerging markets  the segment is likely to get more difficult to understand  so it helps to know the basic categories 
How Medical Instruments Are Categorized
The Census Bureau classifies the industry into seven parts and provides some numbers indicating the size of each part  As with a lot of census data  it s not too timely but rather a fair estimate of longer term trends 
The latest data  from 2012  mentions surgical and medical instruments  anesthesia apparatus  orthopedic instruments  optical diagnostic apparatus  blood transfusion devices  syringes  hypodermic needles and catheters  as the biggest category comprising 29  of total value of shipments 
Surgical appliances and supplies  includes artificial joints and limbs  stents  orthopedic appliances  surgical dressings  disposable surgical drapes  hydrotherapy appliances  surgical kits  rubber medical and surgical gloves  and wheelchairs  is second with 22  
Then comes electro medical equipment  which is basically powered devices like pacemakers 
patient monitoring systems  MRI machines  diagnostic imaging equipment  including informatics equipment  and ultrasonic scanning devices with 17  
In vitro diagnostic substances  chemical  biological or radioactive substances used for diagnostic tests performed in test tubes  Petri dishes  machines and other diagnostic test type devices  follows with 14  
Radiation apparatus  comprising x ray machines and other diagnostic imaging  and computed tomography  CT  equipment accounts for 8  
Around 6  comes from ophthalmic equipment and the balance from dental equipment 
In 2015  the above categories together generated  43 billion in revenue according to the 2016 International Trade Administration report 
The Zacks System
An investment plan is personal  It isn t just about stocks that will do really well in the near future as with the Zacks Rank 1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  stocks  It s also about other things like your risk appetite and investment style because no investment advice is 100  foolproof 
There s always the chance that the market will go slightly different than what was envisaged  That s why we need a plan that has been proved to work in the past and it s also where the Zacks Rank and Zacks Style Scores come in handy 
The Zacks Rank is a quantitative measure that for more than a quarter century from 1988 through 2015  has nearly tripled the S P 500 with an average gain of 26  per year  What s more  these returns were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause  LLP  an independent accounting firm 
The Style Score on the other hand  is best paired with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  You can see    It essentially captures your investment style  So if you re a value investor  you re looking for undervalued stocks that will appreciate in the future  If you re a growth investor  you re willing to pay a higher multiple today for returns that may not be on the immediate horizon  Momentum investors are surf boarders  they want to ride the wave and make some quick gains

quarterly results  The da Vinci system maker posted adjusted earnings of  5 39 per share in the third quarter of 2016  crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  1 04  courtesy of stellar revenue growth  Also  the figure improved 19 8  on a year over year basis Revenues increased 15 8  year over year to  682 9 million  driven by higher procedural volume and growth across all business segments  Revenues were higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  648 million as well  Recurring revenues totaled  478 million  representing almost 70  of the revenues in the quarter Quarter HighlightsIntuitive Surgical s performance in the quarter was solid with rising customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements The company announced a strategic tie up with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceuticals to develop  manufacture and sell robotic assisted catheter based medical devices for cost effective treatment and diagnosis of lung cancer The third quarter was also notable in terms of clinical publications evaluating the da Vinci surgery platform  The company got several publications from the Indiana University  Acibadem University in Istanbul and more Procedure DetailsWorldwide da Vinci procedure volumes grew approximately 14  year over year  thanks to stellar performances in U S  general surgery and massive adoption of the system outside the U S  Notably  the company shipped 134 da Vinci surgical systems  up from 117 in the third quarter of 2015 In the U S   increasing adoption of general surgery procedures  stupendous growth in urology procedures worldwide and modest growth in the urology and gynecology drove procedural volumes in the quarter  Additionally  growth in the segments of ventral and inguinal hernia repair  colon resection and lung resection was also encouraging Meanwhile  procedure growth in Europe was affected by reduced capital placements  while the same in Germany was reasonably strong Also  China  South Korea and Japan witnessed strong procedure growth  In China  half of the year to date procedure growth has been registered from categories outside urology  In fact  in South Korea  approximately 60  of the year to date procedures came from categories other than urology Revenue DetailsInstruments and Accessories revenues grew 16 8  to  348 million in the quarter driven by a higher number of procedures and increased sales in stapling and vessel sealing products  Revenues realized per procedure were approximately  1 870 compared with  1 840 in the year ago quarter INTUITIVE SURG Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    System sales increased 17 8  to  205 million driven by higher revenues from operating lease activities  Intuitive Surgical placed 134 systems in the quarter  up from 117 in the year ago quarter  Management at Intuitive Surgical noted that 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the third quarter  compared with 13 systems in the year ago quarter  At the end of the third quarter  there were 74 systems in the field under operating leases Intuitive Surgical generated approximately  4 million of revenues associated with operating leases in the reported quarter  compared with  2 million in the year ago quarter  and  4 million in the second quarter of 2016 Coming to Service  the company registered revenues of  130 million  up 11 1  on a year over year basis on growth in the installed base of da Vinci systems Outside the U S   the company placed 49 systems compared with 37 in the year ago quarter and 51 in the first quarter  The company noted that 18 were installed in Europe  2 in China  11 in Japan and 18 in other international markets Margin DetailsAdjusted gross margin expanded 390 basis points  bps  to 71 6  in the reported quarter  However  taking the medical device tax refund  the company reported an adjusted gross margin of about 73 1  buoyed by lower product costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies Adjusted operating margin expanded 490 bps to 38 2  owing to lower research and development  R D  expenses  which as a percentage of revenues  decreased 50 bps on a year over year basis  Selling  General and Administrative  SG A  expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased 170 bps Balance SheetIntuitive Surgical had cash  cash equivalents and investments of  4 2 billion as on Jun 30  2016  The company aims to use this cash for capital allocation programs GuidanceIntuitive Surgical forecasts 2016 procedural volumes in the range of 14  to 15   The company anticipates system placements outside the U S  to be unsatisfactory as some of the markets are in early stages of adoption The company expects a lower number of lease buyouts in the fourth quarter compared to the previous two quarters Meanwhile  Intuitive Surgical projects full year 2016 adjusted gross profit margin at approximately 71 5  of net revenue  up from the previously guided range of 70  to 71  of net revenue  Notably  margin for the fourth quarter is lower than the just reported quarter  primarily due to product mix Further  the company anticipates a 13  to 14  year over year increase in operating expenses in 2016  owing to continuous investments in robotic assisted surgery  The company expects non cash stock compensation expenses in the band of  170 million to  180 million for 2016 compared with  168 million in 2015 Per management  for the coming quarters  Intuitive Surgical is going to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery  colorectal surgery and hernia repair  The company is also expected to gain prominence in the markets of Europe and Asia by enhancing its organizational capabilities Our TakeWe believe that the growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical s da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery  oncology  urology and gynecology procedures is a key growth catalyst  Moreover  increasing procedural volumes outside the U S  present significant growth opportunity to the company Further  the joint venture with Shanghai based Fosun pharma is considered a prudent move  However  we believe that the positive trends are mostly quarter specific and the company has to make efforts to sustain the momentum Zacks Rank   Key PicksCurrently  Intuitive Surgical carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Better ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are ABIOMED Inc    NASDAQ ABMD    AngioDynamics Inc

22559,244074,ANGO,5 Healthcare Stocks To Buy Despite A Clinton Victory,opinion,"As the race for the presidency enters its last lap  Hillary Clinton has emerged as the clear favorite  Going by the Real Clear Politics poll average  Clinton is leading Donald Trump by more than six points as of now  Market watchers and analysts alike are now examining the implications of a Clinton presidency for various sectors of the economy 
Given her stand on healthcare and the biotech industry in particular  it comes as no surprise that investors have become increasingly wary of such stocks  However  the sector s inherent appeal remains intact despite the troubled waters it has traversed recently  Picking healthcare stocks despite a Clinton win could be a profitable play after all 
Would Healthcare Companies Be Badly Hit 
Most of the pharma industry s apprehensions related to a Clinton presidency are related to her stated position on drug overpricing  However  the fear that a Clinton presidency would lead to industry wide price controls on drugs may be widely exaggerated  according to analysts at Credit Suisse   TO CS   
Clinton and Donald Trump are both in favor of giving Medicare the freedom to negotiate with drugmakers directly on prices of prescription drugs  But such a scenario is highly unlikely given the resistance that President Obama has faced in his multiple attempts at giving Medicare bargaining power  Meanwhile  the pharma industry supports a different approach to fix pricing  This model envisages prices being set according to a drug s performance 
For instance  a drug could be initially provided at lower cost and prescription plans would later pay higher amounts if the medication succeeds in achieving preset goals  Several companies such as Eli Lily   NYSE LLY    Merck   NYSE MRK   and Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   have already struck such deals where performance determines pricing 
Sector Prospects Remain Bright
Given the challenges on the drug pricing front  investors are now betting on other stock categories which could be better bets  Medical technology  life science tools and service providers have replaced biotech stocks as industry favorites 
Companies such as Thermo Fisher   NYSE TMO   and Illumina   NASDAQ ILMN   are riding the genomic analysis wave and have begun offering products with applications ranging from cattle breeding to oncology  Meanwhile  Medtronic   NYSE MDT   and Edwards Lifesciences   NYSE EW   are poised to gain from there cardiovascular therapy products which is emerging as one of the most innovative therapeutic areas 
At the same time  healthcare stocks remain great defensive options during a period of economic uncertainty and looming geopolitical risks  A spate of mergers and options  primarily in the biotech space  is likely to spark off further investor interest  The fact that Pfizer   NYSE PFE   paid  14 billion to buy Medivation   NASDAQ MDVN   shows that the eagerness of larger companies to acquire smaller industry players  This trend is likely to continue in the near future    
Our Choices
Despite the near certainty that Clinton will win the presidential election next month  it s not all doom and gloom for healthcare stocks  In fact a section of market watchers are even predicting a biotech  relief rally  
But given the uncertainty which hangs over this particular set of stocks  it may a good idea to pick up other options from within the healthcare industry  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  
AngioDynamics Inc    NASDAQ ANGO   designs  manufactures and sells a wide range of medical  surgical and diagnostic devices 
AngioDynamics has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM Score of A  The company has expected earnings growth of 12 9  for the current year  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 3 2  over the last 30 days

22633,244148,ANGO,Preventing Acute Kidney Injury Creates Investment Opportunity,opinion,The administration of radiocontrast media can lead to an usually reversible form of acute kidney injury  formerly called acute renal failure  that begins soon after the contrast is administered  In most cases  there are no permanent sequelae  but there is some evidence that its development is associated with adverse outcomes  Contrast induced nephropathy   CIN   is defined as the impairment of renal function and is measured as either a 25  increase in serum creatinine from baseline or 0 5 mg dL  44  mol L  increase in absolute value  within 48 72 hours of intravenous contrast administration  For renal insufficiency   RI   to be attributable to contrast administration  it should be acute  usually within 2 3 days  although it has been suggested that RI up to 7 days post contrast administration be considered CIN  it should also not be attributable to any other identifiable cause of renal failure  The CIN market is a more than  500 million market which can be conquered by niche players such as AngoDynamics  ANGO   PLC Systems  PLCSF OB  and Australian listed Osprey Medical  Bristol Meyers Squibb  BMY  has a lack of clear supporting clinical data for its preventive product so they will not profit from this market going forward  Current Treatment Methods for CIN The only clinically accepted and routinely utilized preventive measure for patients at risk for CIN is pre  and post  procedure overnight hydration  which is inconvenient  expensive and time consuming for hospital staff  There is currently no FDA approved device or drug for CIN prevention  but it is expected that this will change soon  Due to the attractiveness of the potential market  there are a number of other companies developing or investigating potential new CIN preventive drugs  devices and therapies  Preventive measures being used in clinical practice today include  Mucomyst  N acetylcysteine  Mucomyst   Mucomyst is both a renal vasodilator and antioxidant  It is produced by Bristol Meyers Squibb   It is prescribed by a doctor prior to the start of an interventional procedure and is taken by the patient in prearranged doses that may start the day before the procedure  This therapy is employed by many physicians due to an extremely low risk profile and cost  A team of Brazilian researchers  data on the largest trial of Mucomyst to date  the ACT Trial  They reported that after studying Mucomyst in 2 308 patients  the rate of CIN was identical between the group of patients who received the drug and those who did not  The results of the ACT trial have reduced the use of Mucomyst as a preventative therapy at many centers  Sodium bicarbonate Sodium bicarbonate is a pre mixed pharmaceutical solution that is given intravenously on the same day as the procedure  prior to the start  A small number of published studies that have evaluated utilizing sodium bicarbonate as a preventive measure   of these studies and larger studies of the therapy have failed to demonstrate a clear benefit to sodium bicarbonate  The lack of solid clinical evidence for this therapy has led to the a tapering off of the use of sodium bicarbonate at many hospitals  Device Based Treatments CINCOR System Osprey Medical Systems  formerly known as V Kardia  Inc   is a United States based medical device company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange  The company develops catheter based technologies to minimize contrast induced neuropathy   CIN   in patients with chronic kidney disease  It offers CINCOR contrast removal system  a catheter and vacuum system  which is designed to remove dye  contrast  from the heart before it can enter the kidneys and cause damage known as contrast induced nephropathy   CIN    The CINCOR system can be activated multiple times throughout the heart procedure  At the conclusion of the procedure  the small amount of dye laden blood is discarded  has announced that it has received CE Mark for its CINCOR system and the Osprey announced in  enrolment of their first patient in the CINCOR IDE Clinical Study at the Leipzig Heart Centre in Germany  The multi country trial will be conducted in 30 hospitals enrolling 600 patients with complete enrolment and FDA submission expected in 2014  Osprey s public statements list the CINCOR price as between  1500  2000  Market challenges for this approach may include concerns regarding complications of placing a catheter in the coronary sinus  lack of clear supporting clinical data  and the significant cost of the system  Additionally  published reports to date only indicate that CINCOR removes on average 32  of the contrast injected  which still allows a significant volume of potentially dangerous contrast to pass to the patient s kidney  CINCOR only works for coronary interventions  so the technology cannot be used in patients undergoing peripheral catheterizations  transcatheter aortic valve implantation  TAVI   or contrast enhanced CT  Benephit Catheter In January 2009  AngioDynamics Inc  acquired certain assets of FlowMedica  Inc   including its Benephit  CV Infusion System  which is a catheter designed to deliver drugs and or fluid directly to the renal arteries during an interventional procedure  This system is FDA 510 k  cleared and CE marked for the infusion of physician specified agents in the peripheral vasculature  The Benephit XT infusion system was designed as a universal system to facilitate local drug delivery in multiple settings  as a stand alone intervention or in conjunction with another medical  interventional or surgical procedure  The system consists of a bifurcated infusion catheter and dedicated 5F introducer sheath that allows for placement from femoral or brachial access sites  The system was designed to provide stability in the vasculature to allow usage in multiple clinical settings as well as in cases where patients may require transport between locations with the Benephit system placed   In addition to the XT system  AngioDynamics manufactures the CV  Solo and Mini versions for use in specific clinical situations  The Benephit CV system is used primarily in coronary cases if simultaneous infusion is desired during the procedure  The Benephit Solo catheter has one open lumen for those patients with only one open renal artery or one kidney  The Benephit Mini catheter is for use in patients with small aortas  such as those patients with small stature  In a subset of 285 patients in the BE RITe registry  the incidence of CIN was 71  lower than predicted  8 1  actual CIN versus 28  predicted  using Mehran risk scoring method  In the BE RITe registry  catheter related complications were rare with only 1 case 0 2   of renal artery dissection that was immediately stented without compromising renal function or causing long term sequelae At the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla  CA  Dr  Paul Teirstein s study of 33 patients showed a significant increase in renal function withTargeted Renal Therapy   TRT   compared to IV which was sustained for 2 hours post procedure  RenalGuard RenalGuard  is designed to reduce the potentially toxic effects that contrast media can have on the kidneys when it is administered to high risk patients during certain medical imaging procedures  It is believed that allowing contrast media to dwell in the kidneys of certain higher risk patients can lead to contrast induced nephropathy   CIN    a potentially deadly form of acute kidney injury  By inducing and maintaining a high urine flow rate before  during and after these medical imaging procedures  the incidence rates of CIN in at risk patients can be reduced  RenalGuard facilitates this increased urine clearance automatically  enabling the body to more rapidly void the contrast media  thereby reducing its overall resident time and toxic effects in the kidney  RenalGuard  is manufactured by PLC Systems and is currently an investigational device in the U S  It is a safe  innovative technology capable of achieving significant market adoption due to its evidence based therapy and straightforward integration into hospital environments where contrast agents are routinely used  The effectiveness of RenalGuard has been  in two randomized  open label controlled clinical trials  Both of these studies reported that inducing very high urine outputs with precise matching of intravascular volume significantly reduced the incidence of CIN in at risk patients  The RenalGuard System  is comprised of a Console and a RenalGuard Single Use Set for infusion and urine collection  The Single Use Set contains a urine collection set which connects to a patient s Foley catheter and an infusion set which connects to a standard IV catheter  The Console measures the volume of urine in the collection set and infuses an equal volume of hydration fluid to match the patient s urine output  The Console relies on proprietary  patented software and electronic weight measurements to control the rate at which fluid is infused and to monitor urine volume  The Console is mounted on a custom IV pole and is equipped with an internal battery that allows operation while the patient is being transported within a hospital  In addition to urine volume replacement  a user can set RenalGuard System to achieve a net fluid gain over and above matched hydration or to achieve a net fluid loss  RenalGuard System allows infusion of a bolus of fluid at the user s request  In addition  the system is capable of adjusting matched hydration to take into account other fluid sources  RenalGuard System is CE marked for the intended use of temporary  up to 14 days  replacement of urine output by infusion of a matched volume of sterile replacement solution to maintain a patient s intravascular fluid volume  and has demonstrated accurate matched replacement and an appropriate safety profile with normal saline in limited human use More on how the RenalGuard works you can see on the company s   Final Note CIN is one of the leading causes of hospital acquired acute renal failure  It is associated with a significantly higher risk of in hospital and 1 year mortality  even in patients who do not need dialysis  Nonrenal complications include procedural cardiac complications  vascular complications  and systemic complications  There is a complicated relationship between CIN  comorbidity  and mortality  Most patients who develop CIN do not die from renal failure  Death  if it does occur  is more commonly from either a preexisting nonrenal complication or a procedural complication  Many physicians who refer patients for contrast procedures and some who perform the procedure themselves are not fully informed about the risk of CIN  A survey found that less than half of referring physicians were aware of potential risk factors  including diabetes mellitus  Patients with risk factors for CIN should be educated about the necessity of follow up care with their physicians with a postprocedure SCr estimation  especially if the initial procedure was done on an outpatient basis  Specifically  prevention strategies involving calcium channel blockers  endothelin receptor antagonists  theophylline  prostaglandins  diuretics  anti oxidants  or other reno protective drugs have been shown to have no benefit or to have little consistent effect  I believe the Benefit Catether of AngioDynamics and the RenalGuard Therapy of PLC Systems are until now the only two successful treatments hospitals are

RenalGuard works you can see on the company s  Financials PLC Systems In the  I noticed that in the first quarter the company incurred a net loss from operations before taxes of approximately  7 808 000 and used cash in operations of approximately  2 158 000  As of March 31  2013  cash and cash equivalents were  1 863 000  Management expects that quarterly losses and negative cash flows will continue during 2013  Based upon the current financial condition of the company and the expectation of continued quarterly losses during 2013  management is currently investigating ways to raise additional capital that can be completed in the next several months  The company believes that its existing resources  based on its currently projected financial results  are sufficient to fund operations through the third quarter of 2013  Based upon current and anticipated revenue projections from foreign sales of our RenalGuard product  and the anticipated costs of its U S  clinical trial  PLC Systems expect that they will need to raise additional capital during the remainder of 2013  The company was able to raise an additional  4 040 000 in capital on February 22  2013  through the completion of financing with Palladium Capital Advisors LLC   With the sale of their TMR business in February 2011  the company s future prospects are solely dependent upon the successful commercialization of RenalGuard  To date PLC Systems has recorded only a limited amount of sales of RenalGuard  principally to a single customer in one country  Italy  The ability to effectively market RenalGuard outside the U S  is largely dependent on the reception of the results of the MYTHOS and REMEDIAL II investigator sponsored clinical trials  The RenalGuard System has only had limited testing in a clinical setting in the United States so the company may need to modify it substantially in the future for it to be commercially acceptable in the broader market  Despite all these

22637,244152,ANGO,5 GARP Stocks Poised To Deliver Good Returns,opinion,"Stocks that are available at a discount and are poised to record strong growth have always been on investors  radar for both growth as well as value investing  Growth at a reasonable price or GARP investing is a strategy that seeks to achieve this aim 
Investors following this strategy pick undervalued stocks with strong earnings growth history and prospects  While this appears similar to the blend strategy  there is a thin line of difference  While the blend strategy chooses value and growth stocks  the GARP strategy seeks to identify stocks that provide the best of both value and growth investing 
GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value Metrics
Growth Metrics
Strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  they choose stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal in the GARP strategy 
Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for stronger and higher ROE compared with the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flows get precedence in GARP investing 
Value Metrics 
GARP investing gives precedence to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though followers of this investing style choose stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  they avoid picking companies with extremely high P E ratios 
Moreover  price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered in GARP investing 
Using GARP principles  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer good returns in the near term 
Screening Parameters
Along with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy    to make the strategy more profitable 
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  
  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  
Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only eight 
Here are five stocks from the eight that made it through the screen 
Tenneco Inc    NYSE TEN   is one of the world s largest designers  manufacturers and marketers of emission control and ride control products and systems  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 10 5  
WNS  Holdings  Ltd    NYSE WNS   is a recognized leader in business process outsourcing  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 4 5  
AngioDynamics Inc    NASDAQ ANGO   is a leading provider of innovative medical devices used by interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons and other physicians  It has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 8 5  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see
