Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood afternoon and welcome to Hologic s First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call  My name is Justin and I m your operator for today s call   Operator Instructions I would now like to introduce Mike Watts  Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call Michael J  Watts    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsThank you  Justin  Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic s first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call  With me today are Steve MacMillan  the company s Chairman  President and Chief Executive Officer  and Karleen Oberton  our Chief Financial Officer  Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks  then we ll have a question and answer session  Our first quarter press release is available now on the investors section of our website  We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them  Finally  a replay of this call will be archived through February 21 Before we begin  I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward looking  These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied  Such factors include those that are referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that s included in our earnings release  and in our filings with the SEC Also during this call  we will be discussing certain non GAAP financial measures  A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release  One of these non GAAP measures is organic revenue  which we are defining as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses  as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine business  We hope that our discussion of organic revenue in this call  will simplify a complex quarter and help you focus on the parts of our business that matter most  Finally  any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year over year basis  and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency  unless otherwise noted Now I d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan  Hologic s CEO Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Mike and good afternoon  everyone  We re pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020  But before we get into those details  let me start by saying that it s an exciting time for the company  and for our shareholders  Now that the divestiture of Cynosure is behind us  we re able to double down on what we do best    helping women and their families live healthier lives through early detection and treatment of disease Along those lines  at the recent JP Morgan conference it was exciting to reintroduce ourselves to investors as a unique asset in women s health  Now with a simpler story  minus the overhang of medical aesthetics  shareholders can focus on the significant  positive changes that have occurred in each of our businesses over the last couple of years When you do  we think you will find a company with a broad portfolio of market leading products for women s health  A company that over the last six years has grown the top line at a mid single digit rate and leveraged that into low double digit growth on the bottom line  A company where each business has strengthened significantly since the first half of 2018  positioning us to drive faster organic revenue growth and better margins in 2020 And a company that is focused on redeploying its strong cash flow more aggressively  into growth accretive  tuck in acquisitions as well as returning cash to our shareholders via stock buybacks  I m proud to say that for the first time since I joined Hologic  all our domestic divisions  as well as our international regions  are performing well at the same time  And behind the scenes  that s because our corporate and divisional leadership teams have never been stronger than they are today  With that introduction  let me turn to our first quarter results  which represent our seventh consecutive quarter of solid  consistent performance  Total revenue finished slightly above the high end of our guidance at  850 5 million  This was only 2 8  growth  but it s important to break down the components  as Mike said He defined organic revenue  which excludes the divested Blood Screening and Medical Aesthetics businesses  as well as some earlier than expected revenue from SuperSonic Imagine this quarter  So organically  we significantly outperformed expectations  growing 4 6  against our toughest comparable of the year  And this 4 6  compares favorably to our last quarterly guidance  which called for growth of 1 2  to 3   In terms of the bottom line  we were pleased to hit the high end of our guidance range with EPS of  0 61 in the first quarter  even while absorbing a much worse than expected loss from Cynosure So we are off to a good start in fiscal 2020  with all our divisions and regions showing solid performance  We are particularly excited about our Surgical division  which led the way with 10 2  growth in the quarter  and our Diagnostics business  which outperformed with 6 5  growth excluding Blood  In terms of geography  domestic sales of  632 7 million increased 1 8  in the first quarter  but 3 2  on an organic basis Outside the United States  sales of  217 8 million increased 6   But excluding acquisitions and divestitures again  revenue increased 9 2  organically  reflecting the strong foundations we have built for sustainable international growth  Core US sales have grown at a low double digit rate in each of the last three years  and we re well positioned to maintain that pace in the balance of 2020 Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results  In our biggest division  Breast Health  our core 3D mammography business remains rock solid  and we are building on it with an increasingly diversified product portfolio that spans the continuum of breast healthcare  As we said at JP Morgan  we have overhauled our sales talent  structure and process to help key account managers sell a growing product portfolio more strategically  And this has led to more diverse  consistent revenue growth In the first quarter  underlying trends in Breast Health remained solid  though consistent with our guidance  growth was slower due to a very difficult prior year comparable  when worldwide sales grew by more than 13   Against this  global Breast Health sales totaled  331 1 million this quarter  an increase of 2 4   Excluding  6 1 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine  which was not included in our last guidance  global growth was 0 5  In terms of geography  domestic Breast Health revenue finished in line with our expectations with growth of 1 5   OUS sales increased 5 5  in total  but decreased 1 4  without SSI against a very challenging 16 1  comparable in the prior year period  We do expect OUS growth rates to rebound strongly in the balance of the year as the business grows and the comps ease  In terms of the Breast sub segments  imaging sales grew 2 4   benefiting from the SSI revenue I mentioned earlier  while interventional sales increased 2 6  In imaging  sales of our Genius 3D mammography systems remain steady  driven by our new 3Dimensions and 3D performance gantries  As we said in San Francisco  we have sold more than 1 000 gantries a year in the United States for each of the last five years  a remarkably durable performance that has defied expectations of a rapid drop off in sales  Not only have we been converting our own 2D units to 3D  we have been gaining a much higher share of competitive conversions than anticipated  This market leadership position provides a solid foundation for divisional growth  and a platform onto which we can add new products and strengthen our strategic advantages In interventional  our first quarter results benefited from strong growth in biopsy disposables  as our account managers focus on selling our entire portfolio  However  this was largely offset by a headwind from lower Brevera capital sales  which peaked in the first quarter of 2019 before we began limiting supply  We expect the Brevera headwind to be less onerous in the second and third quarters  then flip to a tailwind in the fourth quarter when we begin selling capital again Our new Breast Surgery franchise  which consists of the acquired Faxitron and Focal brands plus some legacy Hologic products  also continues to perform very well  with growth in the low teens in the quarter  We re pleased to see our strategic rationale for these division led  tuck in acquisitions playing out  as we accelerate growth by coupling clinically differentiated products with Hologic s commercial infrastructure  And we are equally excited about our acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine  or SSI  during the first quarter As a reminder  SSI is a French innovator in cart based ultrasound technology  which is used across the continuum of breast healthcare  Integration is off to a good start  and we continue to believe that the business will be accretive to our revenue growth rate  albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near term  We are especially excited about the opportunity in the United States  where SSI had a very limited sales presence  but will now be able to benefit from our commercial infrastructure and relationships with key customers Now let s turn to Diagnostics  where we have upgraded our talent and aligned our commercial structure to help lab customers of all sizes grow their business  In the first quarter  total revenue of  311 5 million increased 5 5   Excluding sales from the divested blood screening business  Diagnostics revenue grew 6 5   an even stronger performance  The growth driver here remains Molecular  where we re placing more Panthers  with more assay menu  in more countries  This has led to strong increases in consumable sales and consistent revenue growth In the first quarter  for example  worldwide molecular sales of  178 5 million grew a robust 9  against a challenging prior year comparable  International molecular continues to be a standout in both the speed and consistency of growth  OUS molecular sales increased 22 2   well into the double digits for the 14th time in 15 quarters  Growth was led by our core women s health tests  our viral load assays with a growing contribution from HIV in Africa and Panther Fusion And in the US  although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories  molecular sales still grew 6   This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive volumes and better patient care in established markets  Domestic growth was again broad based as customers consolidated testing on our large installed base of Panther instruments As we showed at JP Morgan  we have shipped more than 200 Panthers globally in each of the last five years  fueling a very consistent  profitable razor blade business model  In the first quarter  our legacy women s health assays for chlamydia  gonorrhea  HPV and trichomonas drove the growth  with our new vaginosis tests  Panther Fusion and our viral load assays contributing as well Moving on  we were also pleased that cytology and perinatal sales of  121 million grew by 3 1  in the quarter  admittedly versus a soft prior year comp  Perinatal sales were flat  so the growth came from our ThinPrep cytology franchise  Domestic sales were down slightly  consistent with recent trends  but OUS sales grew solidly  in part reflecting the early phase of Germany s decision to adopt co testing  screening for HPV and Pap  as the standard of care to minimize cervical cancer risk To wrap up Diagnostics  revenue related to our divested blood screening business was slightly higher than expected at  12 million  but declined by 15 5   As a reminder  this revenue reflects low margin products and services under transition agreements with Grifols  and is excluded from our organic results Now let s turn to GYN Surgical  our most profitable division on a percentage basis  where best in class products  new leadership  new commercial models and new product launches have been consistently accelerating growth for two plus years  In the first quarter specifically  sales of  119 1 million increased 10 2   our fastest growth in a 11 quarters  Surgical growth was driven by three main factors  First  core MyoSure continues to perform well  with mid teens growth in the quarter  as we expand the market for fibroid removal while gaining share Second  although the domestic endometrial ablation market continues to contract  NovaSure is stabilizing thanks to renewed focus by our commercial teams  NovaSure was down low single digits in the quarter  an improvement compared to recent periods  We are pleased with the number of competitive wins we are seeing for NovaSure  and ended the first quarter with more NovaSure customers in the United States than we started with Third  new products are growing rapidly  although they still represent less than 10  of divisional revenue  Our Fluent fluid management system is our best selling new Surgical product thus far  with more innovations emerging from our development efforts  And fourth  although international represents less than 20  of Surgical sales  it is growing rapidly  19 6  in the first quarter  And we ve only scratched the surface of this opportunity To round out the revenue discussion  Skeletal sales of  23 5 million grew a 11 4   our best performance since the fourth quarter of 2017  based on strong growth of our DXA systems  We re pleased to see the top college and professional sports teams are adopting DXA technology for body composition testing  and that our products will once again be used to assess football players participating in the NFL draft combine Before we turn the call over to Karleen  let me just close our medical aesthetics chapter by saying that we are pleased to have completed the divestiture at the end of December  Cynosure sales in the first quarter were clearly much weaker than expected across the board  and as I mentioned earlier  the business was a significant drag on profitability as well  In terms of our business development strategy moving ahead  we look forward to pursuing more of the smaller  division led deals that have been working well for us  Net  we feel really good about the businesses we re currently in  and don t see a need to add a fourth leg to our strategy  given the many opportunities for tuck ins that leverage our existing commercial channels So in conclusion  it s an exciting time for the company and our shareholders  We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of strong execution  with 4 6  organic growth against our toughest comparable of the year  Our Surgical and Molecular Diagnostics businesses stood out this quarter  aided by strong international growth  but Breast Health is also performing well  with a multitude of opportunities still ahead  The efforts we have made over the last few years to strengthen capabilities and accelerate growth are paying off across the company  and we are supplementing these efforts with smart capital deployment that is focused on tuck in acquisitions and share buybacks Now let me turn the call over to Karleen Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Steve and good afternoon  everyone  In my remarks today  I m going to walk through the rest of our income statement  touch on a few other key financial metrics  then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2020  as well as for the second quarter  Unless otherwise noted  my remarks will focus on non GAAP results  and percentage changes will be on a year over year basis  in constant currency As Steve described  we are pleased with our first quarter results  as organic revenue growth of 4 6  drove sales of  850 5 million  which slightly exceeded our guidance range  In addition  EPS of  0 61 finished at the top end of our guidance despite significant under performance from the divested Medical Aesthetics business  We also executed on a  205 million accelerated share repurchase program following the Cynosure announcement  and bought back an additional  81 million worth of shares on the open market  And our Board has authorized an additional  500 million repurchase program beginning in the third quarter For all these reasons  fiscal 2020 is off to a great start  and we are raising our guidance for organic revenue growth and EPS accordingly  I ll discuss that more in a minute  But before I do  let me start by reviewing our P L for the first quarter  Gross margins of 61 6  decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year period  This was primarily due to disappointing sales in the divested Cynosure business  product and geographic sales mix  and the stronger US dollar Total operating expenses of  289 3 million increased 5 3  in the first quarter  or 4 1  if you exclude SSI s expenses  This increase was driven mainly by higher G A costs associated with our deferred compensation plan  in which the associated liability is marked to market  resulting in higher expense  It s important to note  however  that we hedge this exposure  so most of this expense is offset by a benefit below the line  in other income  In addition  research and development expenses increased  as we continue to balance growth investments with our goal to drive operating leverage Based on these increases in operating expenses  operating margin of 27 5  decreased 170 basis points  However  given the deferred compensation dynamic that I just discussed and the benefit in other income  it s probably more appropriate to focus on net margins of 19 3   which increased 40 basis points despite the Cynosure headwind  Overall  our profitability remains very healthy  All this led to non GAAP net income of  164 1 million  and non GAAP earnings per share of  0 61  at the top end of our guidance range despite absorbing the Cynosure loss  Cynosure ended up costing us more than  0 02 in the quarter  net of the fixed overhead costs that the division absorbed Before we cover our revised 2020 guidance  I ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics  Our leverage ratio stood at 2 5 times at the end of the first quarter  as we used cash to acquire SuperSonic Imagine and buy back shares  We remain comfortable with a leverage ratio between 2 5 times and 3 times  recognizing that this could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity  Moving on  ROIC was 12 3  on a trailing 12 month basis  an increase of 10 basis points over the prior year  Finally  adjusted EBITDA of  261 9 million increased slightly compared to the prior year Now I d like to shift gears and discuss our non GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter  We are updating our full year guidance based on our good first quarter results  and to account for the divestiture of Cynosure  At a high level  we are raising our organic constant currency revenue guidance as well as our EPS forecast Let s start with revenue  As a reminder  we previously guided to reported sales of  3 45 billion to  3 5 billion  which represented constant currency growth of between 3  and 4 5   This original guidance contemplated an equivalent organic growth rate of 3  to 4 5   since that forecasts from the acquired SSI business and the divested blood screening business basically offset each other Based on a strong first quarter results in our core businesses  the divestiture of Cynosure  and an updated foreign currency headwind of  10 million  we are increasing our organic revenue growth guidance to a range of 4  to 5   If we meet or exceed the middle of this range  organic revenue growth would accelerate compared to 2019  as Steve said in his introduction Now let me transition to reported growth guidance for the full year  We now expect revenue of  30 million to  35 million from SSI  and  35 million to  40 million from Blood Screening  This helps us build up to a total  reported revenue range of  3 238 billion to  3 268 billion  This range equates to a constant currency decline of 3 5  to 2 6   or a reported decline of 3 8  to 2 9   These declines are driven by the absence of Cynosure revenue in the balance of the year Based on the improved revenue performance in our core businesses  we expect to invest additional resources in future growth  But at the same time  our buyback activity enables us to offset these additional investments while still driving leveraged bottom line growth  So despite absorbing the  0 02 Cynosure loss in the first quarter  we are increasing our full year EPS guidance to a range of  2 63 to  2 67 a share  which represents growth of between 8 2  and 9 9   This full updated    full year updated guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of  268 million to  269 million for the full year  which reflects progress on our buyback program  and an effective tax rate of approximately 21 75   the same as our original guidance Now let s turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020  We expect organic revenue growth of 3 4  to 4 8   This organic growth combined with the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  leads to a total revenue range of  770 million to  780 million for the quarter  This equates to constant currency decline of 5 4  to 4 2   and a reported decline of between 5 9  and 4 7   Again  these declines are due to the absence of Cynosure revenue compared to the prior year period  On the bottom line  we expect EPS of  0 61 to  0 63 in the second quarter  This implies growth rates of between 5 2  and 8 6   continuing to outpace revenue  Let me point out that this EPS range incorporates improved gross margins of 62  to 63  in the second quarter  mainly reflecting benefits from the Cynosure divestiture I d also like to point out that while other expenses  net  were  24 8 million in the first quarter  we expect these expenses to increase by more than  5 million sequentially in the second quarter  as we don t forecast the benefits we saw in the first quarter to recur  As you update your forecasts  let me remind you that we re raising our guidance materially this quarter  so we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges  It s still early in the year and we ve tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides Before we open the call for questions  let me conclude by saying we are pleased with how we started 2020  We feel great about our core businesses and are raising our organic growth rate guidance accordingly  We are encouraged by continued strong commercial execution  the progress in our international franchises  the productivity of our R D pipeline  and the deals we have completed  And we are excited about the opportunity to strategically redeploy capital going forward through division led business development and share buybacks  Overall  we believe we have multiple levers to deliver healthy organic growth    revenue growth and EPS growth in 2020 With that  I will ask the operator to open the call for questions  Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow up  then return to the queue  Operator  we are ready for the first question Questions and Answers OperatorWell  thank you   Operator Instructions  And we ll go ahead and take the first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi Patrick Donnelly    Citi    AnalystGreat  Thanks guys  Maybe just on the Cynosure in the wake of the divestiture  Obviously  this is a big focus or distraction  whatever you want to call it for the investor base  But how much in the divestiture allow for an increased focus internally  Given things are segmented out  did it not consume too much mind share or do you feel like there is not going to be a renewed focus on the core business  particularly in areas like internationally  your business seem to be run a little closer to each other  Did Cyno get kind of disproportionate amount of attention there  Do you feel like there is going to be an increased benefit even outside of the removal on the overall growth number Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Patrick  You re the last part of your question is extra insightful  that in the US  there was really the core businesses were not as distracted  but clearly  Karleen  me and Mike and the whole senior management team was internationally to your point  I think what we re really excited about is the international folks being able to really double down on the three core businesses because like anything they will probably spending a disproportionate amount of time and energy  dealing with customer issues  service issues  whatever it might be on the Cynosure business And I will tell you  if you talk to our Head of Asia Pac  our Head of the European area and then you get into the country leaders and everything else  they    I think are very excited about the opportunities ahead  I hope you didn t    making very nice progress the last few years internationally  but this is probably the best news they get out  And I would puts us more excited about the opportunities ahead Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerAnd Patrick  this is Karleen  The only thing I would also add is that Cynosure such a back end loaded revenue in the quarter  Really  this divesture also gives us increased confidence in our forecasting ability and ability to reinvest when we see upside  So I think it s a benefit there as well OperatorAnd our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen Chris Lin    Cowen and Company    AnalystHey  This is Chris on for Doug today  Thanks for taking my question  Maybe just to follow up on the Cynosure question a bit Michael J  Watts    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsHey  Chris  Before you get started  just for    this is Mike  Just for the operator  it s fine to let folks ask a second follow up question  just to be clear  so just wanted to make that point that you re welcome to ask a follow up  Go ahead  Sorry  about that  Go ahead Chris Lin    Cowen and Company    AnalystSo could you just help us bridge that organic revenue growth guidance as it relates to Cynosure in the core business  I guess  said differently  to what extent was organic revenue growth guidance increased due to the removal of Cynosure from results Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThere was a bit of both  I think at the truthfully  at the start of the year  Cynosure  we thought was going to grow roughly in line with the rest of the businesses  Now  clearly  that did not happen in the first quarter because of the divestiture in the announcement  So it was a pretty ugly quarter  But I think if you really look at it  at the end of the day  the revised guidance upward is also more conviction and confidence in our core businesses  So it s really more about the additional confidence we have in our core businesses  We didn t really see Cyno being a drag  now probably would have been  but it s clearly we feel better and better about each of the three other businesses Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And I think to the point that Steve made earlier  internationally is a significant piece of the Board to take them in Chris Lin    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  And then for a follow up question  has a severe flu season benefited your Panther Fusion  respiratory assays and could you just ballpark  how big that business is now Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We wish it was  but we re still so small in the flu business  If anything  we always    we re probably still at that stage where it could possibly hurt us a touch as people may give up other visits to the doctors  But I think overall a wash  but we don t see it being a big benefit to us yet  just we were not as big yet in that space Michael J  Watts    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsYeah  Chris  This is Mike  Just to give a little more color on that  I think we ve said last year our Fusion respiratory assay revenue was around  10 million a little bit less  So that will give you a sense  I mean certainly  we were up in the quarter  as you would expect and we would expect to be up in the year  but as Steve said  not a huge  huge deal OperatorAnd our next question come from Tycho Peterson with J P  Morgan Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Just looking at guidance  the mid point of the higher end obviously implies an acceleration ex Cyno  Can you just talk about by segment  where you re seeing the acceleration for 2020  Is it mostly on the GYN Surg side  And if so  how sustainable is that  you head to over 10  there this quarter  So just curious about where you see the acceleration this year Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Clearly  we are really pleased with the Surgical performance and the continued improved performances we ve seen over the several quarters now  But yeah  I would say  acceleration is clearly from Surgical and probably Diagnostics as well Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystAnd then you re bumping up the SSI guide from 25  30  to 30  35  Can you just talk a little bit about how you re bundling that with the rest of the offering anything to note on the integration front and how you see that  that ramp going Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYes  So I would just say  is that the increase really has to do the timing of obtaining the controlling interest  So when we originally guided in Q4  we assumed we would not have a controlling interest and therefore no revenue in the first quarter  So the uptake is really the timing of that controlling interest  and I think it s early days  but the integration off to a start and I think as we said before SSI had minimal presence in the US only I think five reps    sales reps in the US and so our teams are decided to drop that product into their    are sophisticated commercial infrastructure here in the US OperatorAnd our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystThanks  Good afternoon  Wanted to go back to the molecular growth in the quarter and maybe just focus on what s going on in the US  I think you mentioned in the script that the core women s health was still growing well  but I m just curious because we ve seen just the past couple of quarters I think last quarter US molecular grew 9   Just what was the    maybe just why did that slow down a little bit in the quarter  Was there anything from a comp perspective or what s going on the women s health side Michael J  Watts    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsYeah  Jack  It s Mike  I think we were pretty happy with the molecular number in the quarter both US  as well as OUS  As we ve talked about in that business  it s not really any one thing that drives growth  certainly  the core women s health assays specifically chlamydia  gonorrhea  HPV and Trich  are the biggest test  So they have to grow for the business to kind of show the performance that you ve seen  but they were up very solidly in the quarter in mature markets  viral load was a nice contributor as well  I think we highlighted some growth in Africa  in particular from viral load  And I would say  some of the new products  particularly the vaginosis panel  BV CV test  are starting to contribute as well  So pleased with where that division is Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystAll right  And maybe just turning to Cytology side Michael J  Watts    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsSorry  Jack  I guess the other thing  I mean remember that had a really bad comp last year too  It was a very challenging prior year comp  So that might be  some of what you re seeing Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystOkay  Got it  And then I think on the flip side  Cytology  I thought the international growth looks pretty good  I know working out some what small numbers and I picked up  I guess the comment around Germany  just    do you feel like there s    how durable  do you think the double digit on the international side as they were lever to keep Cytology nudging forward Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWould not expect it to be a double digit growth  Like  all these things international sometimes at the smaller bases and timing  you get a little capital sale  you get some things like  Having said that  I think we do see it being at least a slightly growing asset outside the US to offset the declines in the US  and that s why I think  globally  we feel like Cytology is roughly a flattish business and the international gets a little more growth  it may tweak that slightly better  But I don t think it s necessarily double digit grower OperatorAnd our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler Rachel    Piper Sandler    AnalystHi  This is Rachel  Phonetic  on for Bill  Good afternoon  everyone  So the international Diagnostics business continues to grow at a robust double digit piece  How much of this is driven by new products versus share gains  And how long can this sort of pace continue Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  we talked about    I think the majority of the growth is from share gains  little less from the    the new product contribution is the viral loads internationally  which is contributing nicely  but we expect continued double digit growth probably maybe not the rate that we ve seen as we come against some of these tougher comps  but feel really good about that business Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We have been placing more Panthers internationally over the recent quarters than we have in the US  So I think our ability to continue to sustain that we feel really good about Rachel    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  And then given the combination of new products across almost all of your divisions and that may completed so far  how much capacity do your teams have for additional transactions Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerI m sorry  we couldn t hear that  Could you repeat that question Rachel    Piper Sandler    AnalystYeah  So given the combination of new products across all divisions and M A completed so far  how much capacity do you think your teams have for additional transactions Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I think the transactions that we ve done to date have been in the Breast Health division  So certainly within Diagnostics and Surgical there is    more than adequate capacity to take on transactions  I think Breast Health has still has a very active M A pipeline  They do have a lot of integration activities  but certainly we feel that  if the right deal came along we have the ability to make the capacity to do a transaction OperatorAnd moving on to Dan Brennan with UBS Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Danny there OperatorAnd again  your line is open  Please go ahead with your question  Once again  Dan Brennan  your line is open  Please go ahead Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerIf we lost Dan  let s move on OperatorAbsolutely  our next question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair Brian Weinstein    William Blair    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking the question  Just going back to OUS here for a minute  Obviously  it s been a great driver and it looks like there s a lot to go here  but can you give us any kind of an update on where you actually do stand in terms of market share for some of the key products  You ve typically said that they were around half of what they were for key products here in the States  Where is that now and what are your longer term kind of thoughts about where market shares can wind up over there  Can they get to US level still  do you think Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerBrian  I think it s so hard quite frankly to really have a great handle on our market shares by segment because there s not great data on a lot of these  I think anecdotally from what we just feel  yeah  there is still enormous opportunities ahead  And when you look at our relative revenue under a quarter of most of our businesses are outside the US  where clearly huge opportunities to  again  continue to be playing out  not just in the coming quarters  but really  we think we ve got a decades worth of runway here in terms of solid growth before the    even catch up to the US  We have probably ultimately the US shares Brian Weinstein    William Blair    AnalystOkay  And then on some of the investments that you re talking about and having a little bit more flexibility to make some of those investments  What are the key strategic investment areas that you guys are focusing on this year and if there was some upside to develop where are the incremental investments likely to be made  Thanks Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo there s always the extra R D projects that will come up even during the course of the year that we ll look at  I think we now have better and better leadership internationally  And so that ability to be thinking about adding some more sales reps behind certain franchises in certain countries  I think those kind of opportunities are the kind that we can redeploy efforts  as we go through and then occasional marketing activities as well  But it s really looked at by franchise  by geography combination  sales  marketing  R D OperatorAnd our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGood afternoon  Just two questions on earnings and margins for Karleen  Coming to  0 03 in the buyback   0 02 to  0 04 from remove Cyno dilution  that s around  0 05 to  0 07 and you are raising the guide by  0 02  So that incremental  0 03 to  0 05 of additional reinvestment  where is that going on  And a quick follow up on margins Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYes  So Dave  let me walk you through how we thought  but we raised the guidance on the bottom line  So  yes  we absorbed an additional  0 02 loss  We talked about the ASR was about  0 02  again  there is    that includes the impact of the stranded costs in the    from Cynosure because they will bring a piece of our overhead  And then the incremental ASR    the incremental open share repurchase is less than a  0 01 for the full year  So I gets you close to the  0 025 at the midpoint David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  But you still expect the Cynosure divestiture to be  0 02 to  0 04 accretive for the year Michael J  Watts    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsYeah  I don t    Hey David  it s Mike  I don t know that we said  0 02 to  0 04 accretive for the year  I think when we announced the divestiture basically  the business was breakeven or at least was expected to be breakeven for the year  clearly  that is worse than that in the first quarter  We said that the combination of the divestiture and the ASR would be about  0 02 accretive maybe that s where we were clear  but    so we were kind of look at those things as roughly  0 02 accretive and then  of course we absorb as Karleen said some extra dilution that s baked into the raise in Q1 here OperatorAnd moving on to Dan Brennan with UBS  Again  your line is open  Go ahead please with your question  Again  please go ahead Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI think  he is having a hard time  why don t we move on OperatorAbsolutely  our next question will come from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies Raj Denhoy    Jefferies    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  Wondered if maybe I could hit on a couple of things  Maybe you mentioned the gantry placement number has been pretty consistent about 1 000 for several years running now  realize that the acceleration business is only about six or seven years old  but it sounds like  do we start to see a replacement cycle in 3D  Could that number start to pick up  as you move out a couple of years from now Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean think eventually you need to think about 3D was originally approved in 2011  but you had that significant uptake in the 2014 2015 timeframe with the seven year life    seven to nine year life  Here at some point there is a replacement cycle there  but I think we ve intentionally smooth out that cycle with the upgrades that we re doing to the field now  because if you think about our greatest gantry 3D    three dimensions  those features and functionalities of backwards compatible to the installed base  so really trying to minimize that pent up demand in our replacement cycle  So we feel good and really are pleased with the steady approach of placements overall the coming years Raj Denhoy    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  That s fair  Maybe just to follow up on the last question on David s question about the guidance    the earnings guidance in particular  you know all of the raisings around the ASR and the Cynosure divestiture  And so Karleen  I m just curious about your views on sort of other margin expansion initiatives  which you guys can undertake over the next year plus in order to take your margins  You can hire where they are now Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So certainly  there s always a focus to increase leverage in an operating margin  And I think always we have ongoing programs within the supply chain organization to work on that  And then  there is still efforts within the middle of the P L that we can take  It s an active    it s an ongoing activity throughout the organization to look for leverage points Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI would remind you  Raj  as you well know  our margins are already pretty good  So a big part of our focus at this point is really been on accelerating that organic growth rate via the investments in R D  sales  marketing  And we think overall it s going to be a pretty good combination  but more on accelerating the sales growth then on huge additional focus is on margins  But again  obviously  we re always working and expect to improve the margins as well OperatorAnd our next question come from Ivy Ma with Bank of America Ivy Ma    Bank of America    AnalystHi  Thank you for taking the question  Karleen  appreciate the color on the guide so far  Not to beat the margin question to that  I just wanted to see  how should we think about the margin improvement in this fiscal year and beyond  given the removal of Cynosure in terms of both gross margin and operating margin would be great  And then I ve a follow up on the gross margin this quarter as well  Thanks Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So if you look even at just what we ve guided to for Q2  62  to 63  compared to where we ended Q1  You can see that in the mid point of the 100 basis improvement in the margin profile  So I think that s 50 basis points to 100 basis points its how we re thinking impact is for Cynosure  as we move forward  And I think operating margins  certainly will be more than that on the gross margin  given that Cynosure was such a heavy opex business Ivy Ma    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  That s helpful  And then a follow up  So on the gross margin decline this quarter  could you help us unpack how much in 60 bps  if relates to Cynosure  the mix and then the  Indecipherable  see please  Thank you Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYes  Maybe I ll describe it another ways  the majority of that decline was really Cynosure  So if you looked at the base business  gross margins were essentially flat year over year and if we look at quarterly trending of gross margins in  19  Q1 was our best gross margin quarter  So majority is really Cynosure related Operator Operator Instructions  Our next question come from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James Jayson Bedford    Raymond James    AnalystGood afternoon  Thanks  So I wanted to just to revisit the segment growth  I came off the fourth quarter call thinking Diagnostics  Breast Health  Surgical would all grow in that 4  to 5  range for the year  I realize that comps come into play here  but Surgical was obviously well above this level  Breast Health was below this level  So maybe you can just level set us on segment expectations for the year  if they ve changed at all Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think overall probably each of our business is going to grow solidly in the mid singles for the year  Breast Health that will include a little bit of help from SSI  as we said at the start  And then Surgical was probably a little bit at the higher end of that piece and Diagnostics pretty much right in the middle  So I think all of that gets to that 4  to 5  organic that we re talking about Jayson Bedford    Raymond James    AnalystThe Breast Health mid single include SSI Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think as we always said  especially going against the first two quarters where we had these monster comps from a year ago  That s why our initial guidance  if you recall from last quarter  only called for 1 2  to 3  organic growth OperatorAnd we will go back to Dan Brennan with UBS Nathan Treybeck    UBS    AnalystHi  guys  This is Nathan Treybeck calling for Dan Brennan  Can you hear me Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Here we go  All right Michael J  Watts    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsA lot of pressure on this question now Nathan Treybeck    UBS    AnalystYeah  Definitely  Third time is the charm  I guess  In terms of going back to molecular  Can you frame the size of the OUS opportunity in terms of I guess  an addressable dollar figure Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe ve got a great number on that  because you can t just some of the data sources and other stuff  but I think it gets back to    we have a lot of runway ahead  If you consider the size of our molecular business outside the US relative to inside  Yeah  Can we easily double and triple it over the longer term  where we are today  Outside the US  yes Nathan Treybeck    UBS    AnalystOkay  And just staying on molecular  can you discuss the split between share gains from other molecular players versus let s say  converting less from non molecular approaches Stephen P  MacMillan    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerIt s so hard to know that  When you start to deal country by country and everything else  I think we just    we feel good about the trajectory and obviously it s sources above OperatorAnd our next question will come from Ivy Ma with Bank of America Ivy Ma    Bank of America    AnalystHey  Thanks for putting me back on  Just wanted to talk about Surgical for a minute  Can you talk about how sustainable is that segment s growth and what s your expectations are for the rest of the fiscal year  especially that the comp gets tougher later in the year  Thank you Karleen Oberton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think what we said in Surgical  I think Steve just talked about the segments that we expect Surgical at the high end of that mid single digit given the Q1 performance  again  we have contribution from new products coming throughout the continuation of the year  But to your point  we are coming up against higher comps  so that s why we don t    not projecting that 10  for the full year Ivy Ma    Bank of America    AnalystAll right  Thank you OperatorAnd thank you  That is all the time we have for questions today  This now concludes Hologic s

159292,380808,HOLX,3 Plastic   Reconstructive Surgery Stocks Looking Good ,opinion,"There was a time when plastic and reconstructive surgeries were performed only on serious burn cases or accidental injuries  Now cosmetic surgery is de rigueur in many social circles  Over the last few years  the masses have been picking up this trend from eminent Hollywood celebrities 
From millennials to baby boomers  plenty are interested in such procedures for aesthetic reasons  Data from the 2016 Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics report published by The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery  ASAPS  substantiates this fact  stating that for the first time since 2016  Americans have spent more than  15 billion on surgical and nonsurgical procedures marking a  1 5 billion rise in annual spending 
This data might encourage venturesome investors to consider industries which have been gaining considerable ground of late 
Factors Driving Plastic   Reconstructive Surgery Market
The trend to look presentable on social media platforms is on the rise  Per an article by Jim Frame published by INDEPENDENT   Cosmetic procedures are now the surgery of  want  not need   
Moreover  a rapidly aging population has been contributing to the fast growing plastic and reconstructive surgery market  Per data provided by ASAPS in a Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics report  the combined surgical and nonsurgical procedures for men and women above the age of 65 have risen by 89  between 2012 and 2016 
The wide gamut of surgical and nonsurgical procedures makes the plastic and reconstructive surgery market a lucrative space  Ranging from skin grafting  modifying an existing feature for cosmetic reasons  to getting a congenital defect corrected  all these procedures fall under the umbrella of this niche space 
Notably  surgical and nonsurgical solutions for men are also rapidly gaining momentum  Per data provided by ASAPS in Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics report  male breast reduction procedures alone  for the treatment of Gynecomastia  had risen by 181   as measured in 2016  since ASAPS initiated surveying for cosmetic surgical data 20 years back 
The report also stated that breast augmentation and lifting surgeries dominated the chart of five most popular surgeries for women in 2016  Many analysts believe that increasing awareness and rising expenditure in healthcare with technological advancements are likely to drive demand for these surgeries  This is further substantiated by data provided by Global Market Insights  which projects that the global breast implants market is set to reach a worth of roughly  1 482 1 million  at a CAGR of 4 1  in the 2016 2024 period 
If that is not enough  a report by Technavio published in Business Wire  says that the global plastic surgery products market is expected to value around  15 billion  seeing a CAGR of 9  between 2016 and 2020

    Quarter in Details Pharmacy Services revenues increased 8 5  to  31 2 billion in the reported quarter on growth in the specialty pharmacy business  higher pharmacy network claim volume as well as

 backed by net new business growth  Moreover  the Mail Choice processed claim count was 63 7 million  up 4 5  on a 30 day equivalent basis as the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and increase in specialty pharmacy claims were partially offset by a decline in traditional mail volume Revenues from CVS Health s Retail LTC declined 3 8  year over year to  19 3 billion  primarily due to a 4 7  decrease in same store sales  continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate Front end same store sales were down 4 9  year over year  Front end same store sales were negatively impacted by 100 basis points  bps  due to the absence of leap day this year compared with the prior year  The shift of the Easter holiday to the second quarter 2017 from the first quarter 2016 had a 75 bps negative impact  Front store sales were also negatively impacted by soft customer traffic  efforts to rationalize promotional strategies  which were partially offset by an increase in basket size Pharmacy same store sales also declined 4 7  in the reported quarter  Sales were affected approximately 480 bps due to recent generic drug introductions  Moreover  Pharmacy same store prescription volumes dropped 1 4  on a 30 day equivalent basis  This apart  marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 460 bps negative

TakeCVS Health posted mixed first quarter results with adjusted EPS beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declining year over year  Slower revenue performance on poor Retail LTC numbers as well as margin debacle resulted in such a dull earnings performance by the company in the quarter Nonetheless  year over year growth in the top line was due to strong Pharmacy Services segment that benefited

Our TakeOne more time  Abbott Labs successfully exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales front  We are optimistic about the company s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance  However  these strong performances were to some extent offset by sluggish Nutrition business However  the company stands to benefit from the recently completed acquisition of St  Jude Medical  which has already started offering it an industry leading pipeline across cardiovascular  neuromodulation  diabetes and vision care In 2017  the company plans to execute its existing operating model which focuses on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas  This will lead to the creation of unique channel opportunities in differentiated relationships with physicians  retailers and pharmacies that are looking to offer a complete line of solutions to treat prominent local health conditions  Also  Abbott Labs has plans to beef up its development capabilities with an expanded EPD innovation center in India Moreover  the sale of Abbott Medical Optics to Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  will help the company in reshaping its portfolio in order to focus on gaining leadership

159438,380954,HOLX,ResMed s Study Results For Central Sleep Apnea Hold Promise,opinion,"Medical device company ResMed Inc    NYSE RMD   recently sponsored a study which shows potential treatment of obstructive sleep apnea  OSA  in patients with untreated central sleep apnea  CSA   According to the study  CSA patients are more responsive toward adaptive servo ventilation  ASV  therapy when they switch from continuous positive airway pressure  CPAP  therapy 
Notably  OSA is a kind of sleep disorder in which the throat muscles relax  block the airways and stop the flow of breath during sleep  CSA is another sleep disorder in which the brain fails to transmit the  breathe  signal to the muscles that control breathing during sleep   
The analysis compared compliance rates of 198 890 patients using anonymous  aggregated telemonitoring data from a U S  positive airway pressure  PAP  therapy database  All patients in the analysis received CPAP via ResMed s AirSense 10 or ASV via ResMed s AirCurve 10 devices  In particular  three groups of patients    CPAP only    ASV only  and Switch  that started on CPAP and switched to ASV   were evaluated 

The 90 day compliance rates for the CPAP only and ASV only groups were 73 8  and 73 2   respectively  In the Switch group  patients beginning on CPAP had the lowest initial compliance rate of 62 7  which improved to 76 6  after switching to ASV  Further  ASV reduced obstructive and central events 
The study quite clearly demonstrated the efficacy of ASV over CPAP  The market for CSA is gradually expanding and gaining importance over time  Currently  CSA has been linked to a wide range of diseases  Especially  this breathing disorder during sleep has been seen to develop among OSA patients who are on CPAP and have a history of ischemic stroke or have taken opioids for chronic pain 
Taking the growing significance of the global CSA market into consideration  we believe the latest development at ResMed is a strategic fit  According to a report by Markets and Markets  the sleep apnea devices market is expected to reach a worth of  6 70 billion by 2021 from  4 59 billion in 2016  growing at a CAGR of 7 8   Thus  the company has considerable scope for expansion in this niche market 
Recent Developments
ResMed AirMini   which was recently cleared by the FDA   is expected to be launched at the end of fiscal 2017  The device is a tiny portable travel PAP with ResMed s best in class comfort features  AirMini is intended to be a secondary device for travel and complements the AirSense 10 platform 
The company has also launched the AirFit range of masks  such as AirFit N20 nasal mask andAirFit F20 full face mask recently  In the area of sleep help and wellness  the company is also making progress with the new joint venture called Sleep Score Labs
