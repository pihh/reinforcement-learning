completed in 2020  This is only the most recent such agreement for a space witnessing a spate of deals In fact  defense stocks have emerged as power packed performers this year  An end to budget

same period  The sector has outperformed the broader index on a dividends reinvested basis over the last five  10 and 15 years The reasons for this pattern are not so mysterious  Commercial air travel is a terrific long term bet since its growth remains robust and largely unhindered  And defense spending is likely to remain substantial regardless of who controls the Congress or White House  The sector has received a strong boost ever since the end of sequestration in 2015  a factor which had weighed on sales growth of the sector for quite some time In fact  President Trump has announced a substantial defense budget proposal of  750 billion for 2020  The Republican controlled Senate is likely to approve of this proposal  And while the Democrat heavy Senate will certainly press for a

30624,252139,ATRO,Upland Software  Astronics And Michael Kors Holdings Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 7  2018    highlights Upland Software   NASDAQ UPLD   as the Bull of the Day  Astronics   NASDAQ ATRO   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Michael Kors Holdings   NYSE KORS   Here is a synopsis of all three stocks  Upland Software is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has the type of style scores that I love to see  As the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research  I like to see a weak value score and a strong growth score   That tells that I am in the right spot  and UPLD has just that  an F for Value and a B for Growth DescriptionUpland Software Inc  is a provider of cloud based Enterprise Work Management software that helps organizations to plan  manage and execute projects and work  It provides services to teams in Information Technology  IT   marketing  finance  professional services and process excellences  The Company s services include Professional Services  Education and Training and Global Support  Upland Software  Inc  is headquartered in Austin  Texas Earnings HistoryUPLD has a solid history of beating the number  I see four straight beats with an average positive earnings surprise of 23    most of that came from the Mach and Dec quarters where they posted back to back 42  surprises Estimate RevisionsEstimate are ticking higher  with this year moving up from  1 50 to  1 55 and next year seeing a stronger move from  1 59 to  1 77 over the last 60 days ValuationThe valuation here is pretty good with 20x forward earnings and 54  year over year topline growth  I see a big price to book of 7 7x but you will get that from software names  A price to sales of 5 6x is also big  but keep in mind there is big growth here  Astronics is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and this comes just after the company posted a beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Let s take a look at why the stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and review the most recent quarter DescriptionAstronics Corporation is a manufacturer of specialized lighting and electronics for the cockpit  cabin and exteriors of military  commercial transport and private business jet aircraft  A major lighting and electronics supplier to the aircraft industry  its strategy is to expand from a components and subsystems supplier to an aircraft lighting systems integrator  increasing the value and content it provides to various aircraft platforms  Luminescent Systems Inc  is Astronics  primary operating subsidiary which produces its aerospace and defense products Recent QuarterATRO reported EPS of  0 52 when  0 47 was expected   That translates into a 10  positive earnings surprise   The beat of 5 cents was good  but smaller than the 15 cent beat the company posted last quarter The two most recent quarters were solid beats  the two quarter before that were both misses   So the recent earnings history is more hit and miss Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Rank looks at earnings history  but much more weight is placed on the revisions to earnings estimates Following the recent beat  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter went up    and that made me wonder how this is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  It turns out the full year number  which is more heavily weighted than the quarterly numbers  fell from  1 60 to  1 46 Next year also saw a decrease  with  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 sliding from  2 01 to  1 77 Additional content Michael Kors Dips Ahead of Earnings  What to ExpectShares of Michael Kors Holdings fell 1 4  during regular hours Tuesday  the last day of trading before the luxury fashion company is releases its Q2 fiscal 2019 report tomorrow morning  Broad indexes posted gains on the day  so investors clearly displayed caution ahead of the event risk in KORS but this nonetheless remains a key stock to watch Michael Kors is a global accessories  footwear  and apparel company  It offers two primary collections  the Michael Kors luxury collection and the MICHAEL by Michael Kors line  an affordably luxury brand  Michael Kors also acquired Jimmy Choo  a luxury shoes and handbags maker  last year The biggest news surrounding Michael Kors as of late was delivered in late September  when the company announced that it reached an agreement to buy luxury fashion house Versace for about  2 12 billion  Michael Kors Holdings will be renamed Capri Holdings upon completion of that deal The Jimmy Choo and Versace deals underscore Kors  ambition to cement its status as a global leader in luxury  but until the latter of those two moves closes  investors will be eagerly anticipating a new financial update and news on the progress of its  Runway 2020  innovation and modernization plan So what is in the cards for KORS tomorrow morning  Let s take a closer look Earnings OutlookAs mentioned  Michael Kors will release its Q2 fiscal 2019 results before the opening bell Wednesday  Here s what analysts are expecting  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimates Earnings Michael Kors is projected to report adjusted earnings of  1 09 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 18  Estimate Revisions  Kors has witnessed two negative earnings estimate revisions and just one positive adjustment within the last 60 days  The company guided light in its previous report  so earlier adjustments occurred outside this window  The Zacks Consensus for earnings is seven cents lower than it was 90 days ago as a result of this weak guidance Revenue  Consensus estimates have Kors  Q2 revenue pegged at  1 26 billion  This would mark year over year growth of nearly 10  ValuationKORS is trading at about 11 4x forward 12 month earnings heading into the report  This is a steep discount to the  Textile   Apparel  group s average of 17 3x  It is also near the stock s 52 week low for the metric This implies that investors are skeptical about Kors  growth opportunities  which  if true  is curious considering its M A moves  Acquisitions will dilute earnings in the short term but should inspire growth in the future  Some investors might conclude that this supports a value case for KORS right now Bottom LineMichael Kors seems reasonably valued and presents interesting long term growth prospects ahead of its report  However  the company s latest near term earnings trends have not been favorable  It guided lower for the to be reported quarter  and analysts followed suit Kors has not missed earnings estimates in any quarter we have on record  so that is not a particular concern tomorrow  But with a major acquisition in the works and all eyes on the Runway 2020 plan  it is likely that the post earnings reaction will have more to do with guidance and management commentary which can be unpredictable Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent

30626,252141,ATRO,Astronics  Ichor  JP Morgan  Bank Of America And Goldman Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 1  2019    Astronics Corp   NASDAQ ATRO   as the Bull of the Day  Ichor Holdings   NASDAQ ICHR   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on JP Morgan Chase   NYSE JPM    Bank of America   NYSE BAC   and Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Astronics Corp is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that has a B for Value and a C for Growth   The Zacks Industry Rank is among the top coming in at 21 of 256 placing it in the top 8    That alone has to spark your interest in this stock   That solid Zacks Rank coupled with a strong Industry The company makes lighting and electronics that are used in cockpits   They sell in both the military and commercial markets as well as to private business jet aircraft   I did check to see their exposure to the Boeing  NYSE BA  737MAX line  and they are not in the cockpit on that plane  but they do service the exterior lighting on that plane Earnings HistoryI see a good earnings history here  with the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 of the last four quarters   The most recent beat was a positive earnings surprise of 5 7    Prior to that  the beats were 10 6  and 44    So the level of beat is coming down  but still on the right side of the equation Estimate RevisionsThe current quarter and next quarter have not seen any estimate revisions that would cause the Zacks Rank to change   There is some movement in the full year 2019 number as that has moved from  1 67 60 days ago to  1 71 at the current level   This implies that the second half of the year has seen some recent increases in estimates The 2020 number has held still at  1 94  but that implies some healthy earnings growth which is just what investors need to see ValuationI really like the valuation here for ATRO   I see a forward PE of 18 5x and sales growth of the exact same level versus last year   The price to book of 2 6x is still keeping the value investors interested as they like that number below 3x   The price to sales of 1 28x shows there is some premium on their product  but really it shows plenty of room to grow  Net margins have improved in each of the last three quarters  moving from 2 5  to 3 7  and were 5 8  after the most recent quarter   If ATRO can keep that number moving higher along with topline growth of 18  or more  then this stock will likely be reaching new highs in the not too distant future   Ichor Holdings has slipped to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  after it missed earnings back in early February   The stock is right around the same price  but estimates have fallen in a meaningful way   Since that hasn t really impacted the stock  it has moved the valuation metrics ICHR s last report had EPS at  0 32 but the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for  0 35   That three cent miss translates into a 8 5  negative earnings surprise   This was the only miss of the last 4 quarters  so its not like there has been a very poor earnings history Estimate RevisionsThe key to the Zacks Rank is the revision to earnings estimates   As the estimates fall  so does the Zacks Rank  and that is just what we have in the case of ICHR 60 days ago  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this quarter was  0 42  but that was slashed to the current level of  0 26 The estimate for the next quarter fell from  0 57 to  0 33 over the same time period Full year 2019 estimates slipped from  2 45 to  1 80   The Zacks Rank tends to weight the full year number more than the current quarterly numbers   This is the main reason the Rank fell to the lowest level 2020 estimates have also dropped  moving from  2 83 to  2 68 ValuationNormally I would be excited to see a stock at 12x forward earnings multiple for a tech stock like this would excite me   Problem is  growth is contracting at 22  from last year   The price to book multiple of 2 5x is good for value investors  while a 0 6x price to sales multiple isn t that great for growth investors   Margins have been moving in the wrong direction  and until they turn around  this is a good stock to avoid Fed Analysis  How Financial Stocks Are AffectedInterest Rates Hit FinancialsInterest rates have taken a tumble since there high last October  with the 10 yr Treasury bond yield down almost a full percentage point  The 10 yr is trading at its lowest yield since 2017 and could have more room to fall  It is becoming an unfavorable credit environment for lenders  and financial stocks are taking a hit because of it Interest income makes up a considerable portion of our favorite bank stocks  income  JP Morgan Chase s revenue is 50  driven by interest  Bank of America relies on interest income for over 50  of revenue  Goldman Sachs  whose focus is investment banking  still relies on interest for about 40  of its income  Since the Fed started their dovish campaign at the end of 2018  bank stocks have taken a hit  You can see this in the 1 year performance chart below  These banks have far underperformed the broader equity market  all having negative 52 week returns Federal Reserve OverviewThe Federal Reserve has two ways of controlling interest rates in the US  one is through their balance sheet  and the other is the Fed Fund rate  monetary policy   The Fed uses their almost  4 trillion balance sheet to influence interest rates by buying and selling fixed income instruments  quantitative easing and tightening  When the credit market fell apart in 2008  the Fed was forced to buy up the toxic assets in order to keep the credit markets afloat  Mortgage backed securities aka collateralized debt obligation  CDOs   which started to see defaults in 2008  were quickly losing value and requiring higher and higher yields  These defaults caused a domino effect in the markets  The initial reaction was for people to get out of the riskier equity market and into safer fixed income assets  flight to quality  which caused an initial spike in bond prices and drop in yields  This didn t last long  Investors quickly started requiring higher yields for fixed income assets because of the perceived systemic concern in the credit markets caused by the CDOs  The Fed had no choice but to start buying up a substantial number CDOs to keep credit markets from restricting too much cash flow  By buying these assets the Fed effectively lowered interest rates  This method of monetary policy is called quantitative easing The Federal Reserve stopped growing their balance sheet at the end of 2014 hitting an all time high of  4 5 trillion  up from the  800 billion before the credit crisis   At the end of 2017  the Fed started rolling fixed income assets off their balance sheet  driving interest rates up  This is a method of monetary policy called quantitative tightening  Below is a chart showing the size of the Feds balance sheet since the financial crisis  from the Federal Reserve s site  The Fed Funds rate is the overnight rate the Federal Reserve charges banks to meet their cash reserve requirements  The Fed Funds rate is the benchmark interest rate for all fixed income assets in the US and is the principal way in which the Fed controls interest rates The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of keeping unemployment low and controlling inflation  Recently though the Fed has been taking cues from the stock market Feds Most Recent MoveThe equity market took a tumble at the end of 2018  and the Fed responded with dovish policy  They recently announced that they wouldn t hike rates for the foreseeable future and that they would be stopping their balance sheet roll off  stop quantitative tightening   These announcements both knocked yields down and caused a surge in prices in both the equity and bond markets Unfortunately  bank stocks and their substantial interest income  are heavily impacted by the Federal Reserve s monetary policy  Currently the market isn t just pricing in no more rate hikes but a potential rate cut  The Fed Watch Tool  created by the CME  illustrates that the markets have priced in a 2 3 chance that there will be a rate cut in 2019 All this dovish news makes me very hesitant to get into any banks stocks right now  Although  if these rate cuts are already priced into the financial sector and they don t come to fruition we could see some larger gains from our bank stocks this year  JPM  BAC  GS   Zacks Rank  3  Hold Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing
