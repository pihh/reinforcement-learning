3309,224824,CCRN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Cross Country Healthcare  Everi  SPS And Viad,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  August 6  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Cross Country Healthcare  Inc    NASDAQ CCRN    Everi Holdings Inc    NYSE EVRI    SPS Commerce  Inc    NASDAQ SPSC   and Viad Corp   NYSE VVI   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Robust Jobs Data Paint a Pretty Picture for These StocksJobs growth in July was more or less on par with estimates  with unemployment rate near a 50 year low  Hiring increased at a steady pace despite trade concerns  and fears of a major slowdown for the U S  economy  Let us  thus  look at stocks that can make the most of the underlying strength in the labor market Strong Labor MarketThe United States added a heartening 164 000 jobs in July  almost in line with analysts  expectations  per the Labor Department  Such solid job additions calmed nerves about the health of the economy  which has now entered its 11th year of expansion  It s worth pointing out that U S  jobs growth had been healthy in the first half of 2019 Meanwhile  the jobless rate remained near a 50 year low of 3 7  last month  The real unemployment rate  including those who are underemployed and discouraged  also known as the U6 rate  slipped to 7  from 7 2  a year ago At the same time  another broader gauge of unemployment that shows people who can t find a full time job dropped just below 4 million for the first time since 2006  By the way  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said recently that  people who live and work in low  and middle income communities tell us that in who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives  Staffing Stocks ShineSuch a strong month of hiring has resulted in the labor force participation rate to increase to 63  in July  more than the expected 62 9   This surely bodes well for staffing companies Gad Levanon  Chief Economist  North America  at The Conference Board had said that  with the U S  economy slowing a little  but still projected to remain above its 2 percent long term trend  we expect job growth to remain strong enough to continue tightening the labor market and draw more people off the sidelines  Professional and Business Services Lead the Way in HiringBy and large  the jobs report showed that most of the industries added jobs and workers  pay continued to remain consistent over the past few months  Healthcare companies boosted payrolls by 30 000 and social assistance providers took on 20 000 workers  Manufacturing companies increased staffing by 16 000  but  it were retailers who missed out on jobs growth  Retail trade added 49 000 fewer people in July compared to the same period last year Nonetheless  it was the business services field that singlehandedly led the way in hiring by boosting employment by 31 000  Such a hiring spree indicated that those who are into professional and business services are in an expansion mode and their businesses are churning out huge profits Top 4 WinnersFrom recruiters to professional and business service houses  all stand to gain from a steady jobs report  Thus  investing in such stocks seems the right thing to do now  We have picked four stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1

3310,224825,CCRN,5 Top Ranked Stocks Primed For An Earnings Beat ,opinion,"All the uncertainty that hovers prior to the earnings release of a company stems from speculation over its beat potential  More than the comparison with previous results  it is a positive earnings surprise which drives the market post release  And since in any earnings season  both positive and negative surprises hit us  investors must always be looking keenly for stocks likely to post positive surprises or an earnings beat 
Why Is Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals are in serious question 
There is also the factor of seasonal fluctuation  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such a case  growth rates are ambiguous while judging the company s true health 
On the other hand  Wall Street analysts study companies  financials and initiatives to forecast earnings  They in fact club their insights and the company s guidance to derive an earnings estimate  So  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception  And if the company manages to surpass earnings by a wide margin  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 
Now  since it is hard to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  A notable track record generally acts as a tailwind  It revs up chances of beating estimates in the next release too as investors expect the company to use the same old trick to come ahead of expectations  or is smart enough to pull off a beat in the next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks that delivered a positive surprise in the last quarter are likely to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stock has adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to six 
Here are five out of the six stocks 
Crocs Inc    NASDAQ CROX    This Zacks Rank  1company is a world leader in innovative casual footwear for men  women and children  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 14    You can see

3315,224830,CCRN,5 Top Stocks To Buy On Blockbuster Jobs Data,opinion,The U S  economy created more than expected jobs in November  This along with a 50 year low unemployment rate showed that in spite of a slowdown  robust job growth will drive the economy in the near future We have shortlisted five stocks that can make the most of the positive labor market data U S  Economy Adds Stellar Jobs in NovemberOn Dec 6  the Labor Department released a report on job additions in American for November  The economy added 266 000 jobs last month  beating the consensus estimate of 188 000  The report also highlights a revision in job additions for October to 156 000 from 128 000 and 193 000 in September instead of the previous 180 000 The reports definitely indicate that the pace of job creations haven t slowed  instead have shown signs of reacceleration The U S  service sector that accounts for about 85  of the total jobs in America has seen significant job additions in the past few months  And private services remained a major contributor to job creation with 206 000 people newly employed  Among them  health care and hotels and restaurants added 60 000 and 45 000 jobs  respectively  Professional services added 38 000 staff last month Meanwhile  the government hired 3000 employees across different sectors The unemployment rate fell to 3 5  and matches its lowest level seen in 1969  However  the 50 year low value failed to beat the consensus estimate of 3 6   In fact  the BLS reported that U6 unemployment rate  which is a broader measure of real unemployment  came in at 7 2  in November  higher than the previous month s 6 9   matching the lowest level on record  The unemployment rate s decline was largely due to the decline in the labor force participation rate that came in at 63 2  Factors Behind Job AdditionsThe U S  economy may have shown signs of a slowdown recently  with the slump in the manufacturing sector due to the protracted U S  China trade war  But American consumers have been resilient enough and their high purchasing power has kept the economy afloat What supports the strong American consumer  Wage growth  which remained solid in November  left consumers with enough money to spend  The average hourly wage rose 0 2  or by 7 cents to  28 29 per hour  However  the 12 month rate of hourly wage gains dropped to 3 1  from 3 2  in the previous month Additionally  November saw a revival in the manufacturing sector  as the autoworkers  strike at General Motors Company  NYSE GM  ended  and the company added roughly 50 000 jobs  With that  the manufacturing space added a total of 54 000 new jobs in November Buy These 5 Stocks NowThis low unemployment rate points at a robust labor market even after the economy has shown signs of a slowdown  Moreover  stronger than expected job addition calls for investment in the staffing space  as it is a key driver in new employment  Further  health care  hotels and restaurants  and business service sectors saw solid job creation in November and cannot be ignored Hence  keeping all the positives in mind  we have shortlisted five stocks that for investment purpose  Each of these flaunts a Zacks

3334,224849,CCRN,5 Bargain Breakout Stocks For Extraordinary Returns,opinion,As popular as it is divisive  a breakout strategy is one of the most frequently used techniques among active investors  The idea is fairly simple    to identify stocks trading within a narrow band and buy them when they move above this channel or sell when they move below  If a stock moves above the channel  it promises substantial gains for investors But critics warn against the risk of timing such a move incorrectly or identifying the wrong breakout level  However  when executed correctly  this strategy can yield lucrative gains  which explains its enduring popularity Determining Breakout LevelsThe first step to selecting the right breakout stock is to calculate its support and resistance level  A support level is the lower bound for stock movements while a resistance level refers to the maximum price which it trades within over a considerable period In other words  the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level  which means most traders are willing to sell it  At the resistance level  most traders are willing to go long on the stock  which means that they would like to add them to their portfolios  The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or those that have just broken above the resistance level Is this a Genuine Breakout The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a genuine breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends  The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive    Current Price  52 Week High greater than or equal to 0 9  Stocks which are trading 90  close to their 52 week highs    Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy stocks can get through  You can see     Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2  Stocks which move by a greater degree than the broader market but within a reasonable limit    Current price less than or equal to  20  Stocks which are reasonably priced  These criteria narrow down the universe of over 7 889 stocks to only six Here are the top five stocks that meet these criteria Net 1 Ueps Technologies Inc    NASDAQ UEPS   provides its universal electronic payment system as an alternative payment system across various sectors across the world  Its average EPS surprise over the last four quarters is 14 1 Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd

3335,224850,CCRN,Does Cross Country Healthcare  CCRN  Make For A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cross Country Healthcare  Inc    NASDAQ CCRN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cross Country Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 83  This level compares considerably favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 19 72 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Cross Country Healthcare s current PE near its lows  Hence  we could infer that the stock is undervalued in this respect  especially in light of its historical trend  Thus  the present level seems to be a suitable entry point for the stock from a PE perspective Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Business Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 66  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cross Country Healthcare has a P S ratio of about 0 52  This is much lower than the Business Services sector average  which comes in at 4 06x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  CCRN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cross Country Healthcare currently has a Value Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cross Country Healthcare a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cross Country Healthcare is just 1 08  a level that is far lower than the sector average of 1 79  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  CCRN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cross Country Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives CCRN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success  All things considered  Cross Country Healthcare seems to have pretty striking prospects Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period This has had meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 10 5  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 8 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cross Country Healthcare  Inc  Price and Consensus   Cross Country Healthcare has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates that while analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  the stock s growth story might be good over the long term  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCross Country Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front However  it forms a part of the staffing industry which currently carries a sluggish industry rank  among the Bottom 28  out of more than 250 industries   Combining this with a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get excited about the company overall In fact  over the past two years  the staffing industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking SecretSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars But here s something even more remarkable  You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar  And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes

3342,224857,CCRN,U S  Jobs Growth Roars Back  Winners   Losers,opinion,U S  job growth has been healthy in the first half of 2019  with job additions rebounding in June from a weak May  The strength in the labor force implies that there is no pressing requirement for the Fed to trim interest rates in the near term to support economic expansion  Nevertheless  here s a rundown on the strong job growth s big winners and losers  Hiring Rebounds in JuneDespite worries about employment growth  the United States added a heartening 224 000 jobs last month  way higher than analysts  expectations of 170 000 jobs  per the Labor Department  Such stellar job additions calmed nerves about the health of the economy  which has now entered its 11th year of expansion  It s worth pointing out that May s job additions of 72 000 raised doubts about the current state of the economy Nonetheless  hiring last month was widespread  defying disputes between the United States and its trading partners as well as slowdown in global economic growth that affected American exports and dented businesses and consumer confidence Professional and business services added 51 000 new jobs  while health care saw another 35 000 job addition  Transportation and warehousing added 24 000 jobs  Meanwhile  construction added 21 000 and manufacturing saw another 17 000 jobs added  way higher than its 2019 monthly average of 8 000 Unemployment rate  by the way  edged up to 3 7  from 3 6  but is still near a 50 year low  The U 6 rate ticked up to 7 2   However  the rate of underemployment rate is below where it was a few years back Staffing Stocks to Make the Most of a Strong Jobs ReportThe latest job additions bode well for staffing companies  Additionally  the Conference Board s Employment Trends Index rose to a reading of 111 63 in May from April s 110 21 level  Gad Levanon  Chief Economist  North America  at the Conference Board added that  the Conference Board s Employment Trends Index increased in May  more than reversing the declines in March and April  Given the buoyancy in the staffing space  investors can bet on Cross Country Healthcare  Inc    NASDAQ CCRN   and Kelly Services  Inc    NASDAQ KELYA    Cross Country Healthcare  in particular  provides healthcare staffing  recruiting  and workforce solutions in the United States  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The stock s expected earnings growth rate for next year is a whopping 260   way higher than the  industry s projected rally of 15 4   You can see  Likewise  Kelly Services  which provides workforce solutions to various industries  possesses a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The stock s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7 9   higher than the Staffing Firms industry s estimated rise of 2 8  Chances of Multiple Rate Cuts Reduce  Financials GainThanks to better than expected job additions  possibility of multiple rate cuts by the end of this year have reduced  Before the jobs release  market was expecting a 25  probability of a Fed rate cut by 50 basis points  bps   per CME Group  NASDAQ CME  data  But  chances of a 50 bp cut dropped to 5 9   What s more  the phenomenal jobs report shows that hourly pay has gone up by 6 cents to  27 90 an hour  In the last 12 months  wage gains held steady at 3 1  These developments stand in good stead for financials as well  After all  higher pay means that the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses is going to go up soon  Higher inflation  in turn  may force the Fed not to trim rates but instead it might even hike rates  A less dovish Fed will also help banks and insurance houses ramp up profits   With financials set to gain  investing in  Howard Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ HBMD    Meridian Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ EBSB   and

current year is 322 2   way higher than the  industry s projected rally of 11 5  Gold Prices Under PressureGold prices took a beating after the solid jobs report pushed the U S  dollar index to its highest level in over two weeks  Needless to say  a rising dollar decreases the value of other countries  currencies  This in turn hurts demand for commodities such as gold Mark O Byrne  research director at GoldCore  added that  traders have used the better than expected jobs number to push gold prices lower as expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July have diminished somewhat  Per FactSet data  August gold gave up  20 80  or 1 5   to settle at  1 400 10 an ounce following the jobs report  In fact  gold prices suffered a loss of 1  last week  which had followed two

Likewise  Kelly Services  which provides workforce solutions to various industries  possesses a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The stock s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7 9   higher than the Staffing Firms industry s estimated rise of 2 8  Chances of Multiple Rate Cuts Reduce  Financials GainThanks to better than expected job additions  possibility of multiple rate cuts by the end of this year have reduced  Before the jobs release  market was expecting a 25  probability of a Fed rate cut by 50 basis points  bps   per CME Group  NASDAQ CME  data  But  chances of a 50 bp cut dropped to 5 9   What s more  the phenomenal jobs report shows that hourly pay has gone up by 6 cents to  27 90 an hour  In the last 12 months  wage gains held steady at 3 1  These developments stand in good stead for financials as well  After all  higher pay means that the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses is going to go up soon  Higher inflation  in turn  may force the Fed not to trim rates but instead it might even hike rates  A less dovish Fed will also help banks and insurance houses ramp up profits   With financials set to gain  investing in Howard Bancorp  Inc   Meridian

current year is 322 2   way higher than the  industry s projected rally of 11 5  Gold Prices Under PressureGold prices took a beating after the solid jobs report pushed the U S  dollar index to its highest level in over two weeks  Needless to say  a rising dollar decreases the value of other countries  currencies  This in turn hurts demand for commodities such as gold Mark O Byrne  research director at GoldCore  added that  traders have used the better than expected jobs number to push gold prices lower as expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July have diminished somewhat  Per FactSet data  August gold gave up  20 80  or 1 5   to settle at  1 400 10 an ounce following the jobs report  In fact  gold prices suffered a loss of 1  last week  which had followed two successive weeks of gains Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana       Ignited by new

3357,224872,CCRN,4 Stocks To Watch  BLDR  CCRN  ITEK  OMER,opinion,"Tuesday was an interesting day for the stock market  The Chinese markets were down when our markets opened  so naturally it put a damper on things   at least in the morning  A lot of our stocks were down  but we still have some that we follow that managed to stay ahead of the game  despite the down day 
Builders FirstSource Inc  NASDAQ BLDR  had an interesting day on Tuesday  up 56 cents to 14 93  3 9   on 1 4 million shares  This stock exploded in April on a merger with one of their competitors  moved sideways and consolidated  recently popped  moved up to new highs  and then pulled back and formed a nice little bull coil  It popped out on Tuesday  a swing trade was put on it and I think it s going to head through the highs at 15   then up towards 17   and then 20 potentially 
Cross Country Healthcare Inc  NASDAQ CCRN   which is being followed by some of our traders who have given me a heads up on this stock  not only formed a month to month bull coil and broke out and tested the 50  it exploded off that level and then set up a little flag  This explosive move on good volume  pushed this stock through key  double top at resistance and now it has a 2 day pullback  The 2 day surge may be heading this stock for a run up towards the 17 17  level  It could be a swing trade  Maybe go as high as 20  eventually  on a secondary target  It was up 63 cents to 14 83  or 4 44  on Tuesday and is looking very good 
Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corp  NASDAQ ITEK  popped 67 cents to 14 81  or nearly 16   on a million shares on Tuesday  This is a stock that we traded when it was in the 18 90 range  and then it came down and coiled  broke out and now it has been moving for the last five days  It does not have a lot of energy or volume  but the key is that it doesn t get too far ahead of itself  It has 4 waves up and looks like wave 5 could be up around 18  maybe 19  
Omeros Corporation  NASDAQ OMER  was a monster on Tuesday  exploding 10 48 to 25 03  or 72   on 32 5 million shares on positive drug news  It exploded through moving averages  trendline and several layers of resistance and made new  multi year high and a new all time high  This kind of thrust isn t often seen without some kind of follow through  Look for it to consolidate and edge higher up towards the low to mid 30 s  Eventually  this is a 40 dollar stock  I believe

Can Fite BioPharma Ltd   NYSE CANF   which was put on a swing Wednesday  exploded to 5 59 before pulling back to 5 24  up 1 20  or 30   on 16 5 million shares  That was huge volume for that stock  It was a very nice move for a four dollar stock in a quick period of time  It closed at the upper end of the range about 35 cents off the high  and looks like it has a shot at moving up to the 7  range and then the 9  range 
Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ CNAT  was a nice day trade for this stock on Wednesday  up 78 cents to 5 74  or 15 7   on 6 6 million shares  When the company announced positive drug results  this stock exploded to over 8 00  and is trading to over 7 00 at 7 80 in after hours  Resistance is up near 8 40  45 range  If it gets above that maybe it will get a gap to about the 9 25  40 zone  and then eventually 10 11 00 
Heron Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ HRTX   one of our recent swing trades  exploded on positive drug news  up 7 25 to 40 81  or 21 6   on nine million shares on Wednesday  It went from Tuesday s close of 33 56 to Wednesday s open at 38 95  reaching a high of 42 25 before pulling back and closing at 40 81  There s a little resistance up here  A move through 42 05 could get this one moving into the mid 40s  which is the target on this one 
Vitae Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ VTAE  did well on Wednesday  up 93 cents to 16 48  or 6   on 531 000 shares traded  After the recent explosive move and coil  it had a powerful breakout a few days ago and backed off  but came on again and popped on Wednesday  The high two days ago was 17 28  and Wednesday s high at 17 12  are in line with where the resistance may be  We re looking for a level that  if broken  will create an explosive move  Keep an eye on this one

3359,224874,CCRN,5 Stocks To Buy As Election Heads For Close Finish,opinion,Hillary Clinton s campaign for the White House received a major boost when the FBI said on Sunday that it was standing by its earlier position on her personal emails  The central investigating agency said that it continued to recommend that no criminal charges should be pressed against the Democratic nominee Though this development may bring interim relief for stocks  investors are likely to remain largely unmoved  Donald Trump has been gaining steadily in recent polls and these advances may not be completely due to the impact of the FBI s recent investigation on Clinton s personal emails Trump may yet have a slim chance of entering the White House  Though it is difficult to predict whether this will indeed happen  the best way to prepare for such an outcome would be to add low beta stocks to your portfolio  Beta measures the tendency of a stock s returns to respond to market swings  And this type of stocks would be the best bets to protect yourself from potential losses Clinton Maintains Edge  Trump Still in RaceThe final lot of national polls released on Sunday handed the advantage to Clinton s campaign  The latest NBC News Wall Street Journal gave a point lead to Clinton over Trump  This is a sharp comedown from the 11 point lead held by her last month  The Washington Post ABC tracking poll has given Clinton a five point lead  Meanwhile  the Politico Morning Consult poll also puts the Democratic nominee in front  but gives her only a three point lead The Real Clear Politics Average of national polls shows Clinton leading Trump by 2 2   a much slimmer margin  Also  in crucial swing states  Trump and Clinton are running nearly neck to neck  In the all important state of Florida  both candidates stand tied at 45   per the CBS News Battleground Tracker poll  In Ohio  Trump has the edge with a slim one point lead Trump could also woo Iowa over to his side  He is also betting on breaching the traditional Democratic strongholds of Wisconsin  Pennsylvania and Michigan  Most pollsters think that Clinton is still tipped to win  At the same time  she doesn t have the luxury of losing even one of these swing states  Problems with President TrumpThe market s warmth for Clinton and the trepidation with which it views Trump has been borne out over the course of the recent trading sessions  Most of this is to do with Trump s economic plans  collectively known as  America First   This plan has three primary motifs  cutting taxes  reconfiguring trade agreements  and amending banking and immigration regulations While there are issues with his tax plans  his trade agenda is primarily protectionist in nature  His ideas on immigration and other issues have forced Mexico to come up with a contingency plan in case he is eventually elected And what of the market itself  A recent economic study indicates an immediate sell off if Trump wings while a Clinton victory could spark off a modest relief rally  There is also the unforeseen outcome of the lack of a clear winner when results are ultimately announced  Trump has gone as far as to say that he may not accept the results of the election  The palpable unease among investors in understandable Our ChoicesAt this point  political analysts are betting on a Clinton victory and it is likely they will be vindicated  This doesn t mean that investors should not prepare for the unsavory prospect of a Trump presidency  Even though you could think that is a somewhat pessimistic view  it may be a good idea to shore up your portfolios against any possible downside This is why it would be better to pick safer bets at this point  In such a situation  picking value stocks with low beta would be a good option  At the same time  it would be a good idea to pick winning stocks  in case the market moves north  even after a few hiccups This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to

3361,224876,CCRN,4 Stocks To Buy On Strongest Wage Growth Since Recession,opinion,"Despite a decline in non farm payrolls  solid growth in wages last month indicated that the U S  labor market is on a strong footing  Moreover  upward revisions in jobs additions number for the previous two months and a decline in unemployment rate once again confirmed that the economy is improving  This again increases the chances of a December rate hike  Thus selecting stocks from sectors that are poised to gain the most from this encouraging scenario may be a good choice for investors 
7 Year High Wage Growth Pace
According to the recently released jobs data by the U S Department of Labor  average hourly earnings increased 10 cents or 0 4  to  25 92 last month  which was preceded by an increase of 8 cents witnessed in September  The rate of growth also came higher than the consensus estimate of 0 3  increase  Also  it surged 2 8  year on year  which was the biggest rate of increase since Jul  2009 
Moreover  average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents to  21 72 in October  Among the broader industries  information  5 2    leisure   hospitality  4 6    utilities  4 2   and nondurable goods  4 1   emerged as the best performers in terms of year on year wage growth  Strong rise in wage growth also signaled that the labor market conditions are tightening 
Upward Revisions in Jobs Number  Unemployment Rate Declines 
Apart from this impressive wage growth rate  jobs additions for August and September were also revised significantly upward  The labor department increased the numbers by 9 000 and 35 000 for August and September to 176 000 and 191 000  respectively  However the report showed that the economy generated 161 000 jobs last month  lower than the consensus estimate of 173 000 and September reading  The average jobs addition over the past three months came in at 176 000 despite October s decline 
Meanwhile  unemployment rate declined 0 1 percentage point last month to 4 9  on the back of a slight decrease in labor participation rate to 62 8   Also  the total number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs dropped 218 000 to 3 7 million in October  Professional and business services  health care and financial activities emerged as the major segments to add larger proportions of jobs last month  These sectors generated 43 000  31 000 and 14 000 jobs in October  respectively 
Sectors to Gain
Among all other sectors  consumer discretionary is poised to be the foremost gainer of the solid wage growth as consumers are expected to spend around one third of their total expenditures on purchasing goods related to this sector  Moreover  the upcoming holiday season along with the strong growth in average hourly earnings is expected to boost the sector further 
Another industry that is also well positioned to benefit from the improving labor market scenario is staffing  Staffing is a sub segment of the business services sector  which has been one of the leading contributors to jobs over a significant time frame  Companies from this space play an important role in providing employment services across a wide range of industries  It is speculated that continuing rise in wages will encourage more people to participate in jobs search  which in turn might boost companies from the staffing domain in the days ahead 
4 Stocks to Buy
Given this encouraging backdrop  potential stocks form the above mentioned sectors may prove to be profitable additions to one s portfolio  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score

3377,224892,CCRN,Investing In Russia  A Cross Country Comparison ,opinion,As an investor  I have some emergent market bonds  and thus  I am highly interested in the performance of the countries in this category  As a Russian  I always prefer to know more about its potential relative to other countries  Below are several simple graphs showing the growth of GDP per capita in absolute and relative terms  Per head values say more about actual potential not related to population fluctuations  I compare Russia to four different country groups  China and India  countries from the former USSR  East European countries  former socialist countries   a few Asian countries  There are three time points of interest  1991  the start of transition period   2001  the start of sustainable growth as a capitalist country   and 2008  the peak before the current crises   Therefore  I have normalized the GDP per capita time series to their respective values in 1991  2001  and 2008  The normalized curves illustrate the evolution of the corresponding economies in relative terms  Figures 1 through 4 display the obtained result for four country groups  Russia is always shown by a black line   All data are borrowed from the   TED  compiled by the Conference Board  as of October 5  2012   The GDP per capita figures are in 2011 US  converted to 2011 price levels with updated 2005 EKS PPPs  There are several conclusions from the graphs  1  Since 1991  India and China have been doing better than Russia in relative terms but still lag behind the Russian level of GDP per capita  Since 2001  India and Russia are close with China opening a larger gap  Since 2008  the Russian economy has been falling apart  Hopefully  the negative deviation is an indication of a higher rate associated with a recovery growth in the near future  In any case  I am lucky to have the Indian and Chinese bonds in my portfolio together with the Russian ones  2  Among Former Soviet countries  Russia is not a good performer as well  It is in the middle of the growth curves since 1991  2001  and 2008  The level is almost the highest  however  Hence  Russia is a good representative on average  It is not the best performer  but is less sensitive to the current crisis than many of the FSU countries  Therefore  there is no reason to diversify investments over the FSU countries   one will get the result close to the Russian one  When investing in the best performers one may meet a higher risk of slow down  The poor performers with a higher recovery potential are also characterized by a higher risk  3  Russia is in the middle of the GDP per capita distribution among East European countries  It has been growing slowly since 1991  but outperformed almost all countries since 2001  As mentioned above  Russia was very sensitive to the 2008 crisis and the GDP per capita fell by 9   It is one of the worst performances among East European countries  The rate of recovery since 2009 is the highest  however  If continued to intersect the paths of Poland and Albania  this recovery growth may bring a fortune for an investor  4  Among Asian countries  Russia is a good performer since 2001  but the poorest one since 2008   Russia  The level of GDP per capita  upper panel  and the evolution of GDP per capita normalized to 1991  2001 and 2008 The case of India  China and RussiaIndia  China and Russia  The level of GDP per capita  upper panel  and the evolution of GDP per capita normalized to 1991  2001 and 2008 The case of the countries from the former USSR former USSR  The level of GDP per capita  upper panel  and the evolution of GDP per capita normalized to 1991  2001 and 2008  The case of the East European countries East European countries  The level of GDP per capita  upper panel  and the evolution of GDP per capita normalized to 1991  2001 and 2008 ,2012-10-08,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investing-in-russia:-a-cross-country-comparison-139046,139046
3381,224896,CCRN,Week in Review Part II  Street Bytes,opinion,Stocks rose on the first trading day of the new year  Tuesday  and immediately some floor reporters started foaming at the mouth  touting their January stock market lore   I stopped discussing that on my Wall Street History link  by the way   But the market treaded water the rest of the week and we finished with the gains of Tuesday  essentially  Any positives were met with resistance from Europe But now its earnings season and the next three weeks will be interesting  Some companies will blame Europe  Others will blame Asia for any shortfalls  But will any give an  all clear  signal  I seriously doubt it U S  Treasury Yields6 mo  0 05  2 yr  0 26  10 yr  1 96  30 yr  3 02 The yield on the 10 year Treasury got back above 2 00  briefly before Europe concerns ushered in a renewed flight to quality and the greenback Meanwhile  in a bid to be more transparent  the Federal Reserve said it will begin to publish its interest rate forecasts for years into the future  All 17 members of the rate setting Federal Open Market Committee will give their own forecasts  as well as when they expect interest rates to rise for the first time The point seeming to be that if the market sees the preponderance of FOMC officials forecasting low short term rates for longer than the market expects  that may help drive down longer term rates and thus boost the economy I don t see this being that effective  but getting individual forecasts from the members could be interesting China s manufacturing data for December provided a little shot in the arm for the markets on Tuesday as the government announced the reading was 50 3  rather than the sub 50 HSBC had forecast a week earlier  But Premier Wen Jiabao talked of a  relatively difficult  first quarter and as home prices declined a fourth straight month in December  you still have the important issue for 2012 of the bursting of the property bubble  With a growing price war  as developers frantically try to raise cash  many won t survive  though the government is prepared for this  They will only feel compelled to step in if a large bank has problems and there is the risk of a systemic crisis As for the young homeowner who bought at the top  this is another growing issue  On unfinished properties  many are trying to cancel their contracts with limited success Separately  President Hu Jintao vowed that China will make the right structural adjustments  though he warned that imbalances in the country s development and its lack of sustainability will remain big problems  At the same time  the government is determined to expand domestic consumption South Korea s manufacturing PMI for December was 46 4  the fifth consecutive month below 50 But India s PMI for last month was a stronger than expected 54 2 Research firm Gartner expects worldwide tech spending to grow just 3 7  this year  down from an earlier forecast of a 4 6  gain  Supply constraints brought on by the floods in Thailand are still a major issue U S  auto sales for December were solid  with Chrysler continuing its comeback  up 37  over year ago levels  Ford Motor was up 10  and General Motors saw a 4 6  increase  For all of 2011  Chrysler registered a 26  gain  Ford 11  and GM 13   Light vehicle sales for all of 2011 totaled 12 8 million  December s annualized pace is 13 56 million Both Honda and Toyota  however  saw sales for 2011 down 7  each  though Toyota eked out a 1  gain in December  while Honda s dropped a whopping 19  for the month Separately  Hyundai posted a 13  gain for December  affiliate Kia s sales rose 43    and 20  for the year  while Nissan s sales for the month were up 7 7  and 14 7  for all of 2011 I noted a few weeks ago that nothing could stop the global economy  save for an attack on a commercial airliner  like bird flu after the H5N1 virus was found in a bird in Hong Kong  But now we have the confirmed death of a Chinese bus driver from the virus  thus taking the threat to a new level  60  of humans the virus infects die  Thankfully thus far  none of the people officials were able to identify that came in contact with the man had signs of the illness but the next few weeks are critical because tens of millions of Chinese will be traveling in cramped buses and trains over the lunar new year holiday  last week in January  Hong Kong has raised its threat level to  serious   So far the virus hasn t mutated into a strain that could spread around the world and kill millions PetroChina  Asia s largest oil and gas company  now has 100  ownership of one of Alberta s largest oil sands developments  buying up the remaining 40  from Athabasca Oil Sands Corp  If President Obama doesn t act quickly on the Keystone XL pipeline that would bring oil from Canada to U S  refineries on the Gulf Coast  Canada may just say the heck with you  we re going to build a pipeline to the west coast from the oil sands and ship it all to China In a major step  India will finally allow foreign nationals to invest directly in the country s listed companies in an effort to widen the class of investors  attract more funds  and reduce volatility  according to the finance ministry  Previously  foreigners could only invest in India s equity market through mutual funds or institutional channels According to a European economist  Zsolt Darvas  Iceland s policy of letting its banks fail when their economy collapsed worked out far better than the policies adopted in Ireland and Latvia  which suffered similar banking crises The three all allowed the credit boom to fuel property speculation and investment imbalances  says Darvas  Then the banks collapsed when property prices fell and all three had to turn to the IMF for help Meanwhile  house prices in Ireland declined 13  to 18  in 2011  according to two surveys of the market  Daft ie reports the average residential property is now off 52  from its 2007 peak  while it was reported 1 930 Irish companies failed last year  More than half the companies in the construction and real estate sectors are considered to be in danger of insolvency   Irish Independent An independent panel urged California lawmakers to postpone the issuance of  2 7 billion in bonds to kick start the  98 5 billion high speed rail project in the state  The panel questioned whether the federal government would participate in future funding according to current plans  Not doing so leaves California taxpayers on the hook for billions in future costs  Lawmakers don t have to listen to the panel  but it will be difficult to ignore their recommendation Eastman Kodak is nearing a Chapter 11 filing  unless it finds a buyer for its 1 100 patents  The Wall Street Journal editorialized  Meanwhile  the companies now riding high on the technological waves that Kodak didn t catch might consider that they also aren t immune to business blunders or the impact of new technologies  Kodak so far has managed an astonishing 131 year run  Will Apple  Microsoft or Facebook be around in the 22nd century to say the same   Steve Ballmer took over Microsoft 11 years ago  with the stock at  44  Today it s around  28  How does he survive  In an interview with the New York Times  Steve Lohr  Samuel J  Palmisano  who just called it quits at IBM after nearly a decade as CEO  said his guiding framework boiled down to four questions  Why would someone spend their money with you   so what is unique about you   Why would somebody work for you   Why would society allow you to operate in their defined geography   their country   And why would somebody invest their money with you  As opposed to Steve Ballmer  shareholders benefited handsomely during Palmisano s tenure  with the share price roughly doubling over that time Federal investigators are looking into allegations that Wells Fargo and other banks are double billing for mortgage escrow fees to the tune of  150 million or more  with the average homeowner being double charged about  2 000 if they fall behind on a payment or two  this according to Catherine Curan of the New York Post An international arbitration panel ruled that Venezuela must pay Exxon Mobil more than  900 million for nationalizing Exxon s assets in the country back in 2007  including one of the world s largest oil reserves Tolls on New Jersey s highways jumped 50  in the new year According to reinsurance giant Munich Re  the world had its costliest year ever for natural disasters with an estimated  378 billion in damages in terms of direct property losses  An average year sees losses of  75 billion  The Japan earthquake tsunami accounted for  261 billion of the total in 2011  It was also the deadliest with 15 840 deaths  Severe storms and tornadoes accounted for  15 billion in the U S   and Hurricane Irene was another  15 billion Meanwhile  the weather has been quite good this winter across the country  The lack of snowfall is leading to major savings for state and local budgets  Ottumwa  Iowa  for example  has a snow removal budget of  300 000 and hasn t spent a dime  In my area in New Jersey  it s funny how the landscapers  who double as snow removal outfits  made a mini fortune with Hurricane Irene and then the Halloween snow disaster and resulting tree removal  but now are struggling all over again  Not a good time to be a day laborer as well Here in New Hampshire  you can picture the consternation on the faces of those who make their living this time of year  The downhill ski operators are hanging in there with man made snow  but those in the snowmobiling or cross country ski business can t afford too many years like this one  I drove up north the other day and was shocked to not even see snow at the top of the mountains  Then again  restaurant business across the state is good when everyone can get around so easily Super Bowl ad time is officially sold out  all of the 30 second spots going

and Huron Consulting Group Inc    NASDAQ HURN   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Stocks to Buy on Blockbuster Jobs DataThe U S  economy created more than expected jobs in November  This along with a 50 year low unemployment rate showed that in spite of a slowdown  robust job growth will drive the economy in the near future We have shortlisted five stocks that can make the most of the positive labor market data U S  Economy Adds Stellar Jobs in NovemberOn Dec 6  the Labor Department released a report on job additions in American for November  The economy added 266 000 jobs last month  beating the consensus estimate of 188 000  The report also highlights a revision in job additions for October to 156 000 from 128 000 and 193 000 in September instead of the previous 180 000 The reports definitely indicate that the pace of job creations haven t slowed  instead have shown signs of reacceleration The U S  service sector that accounts for about 85  of the total jobs in America has seen significant job additions in the past few months  And private services remained a major contributor to job creation with 206 000 people newly employed  Among them  health care and hotels and restaurants added 60 000 and 45 000 jobs  respectively  Professional services added 38 000 staff last month Meanwhile  the government hired 3000 employees across different sectors The unemployment rate fell to 3 5  and matches its lowest level seen in 1969  However  the 50 year low value failed to beat the consensus estimate of 3 6   In fact  the BLS reported that U6 unemployment rate  which is a broader measure of real unemployment  came in at 7 2  in November  higher than the previous month s 6 9   matching the lowest level on record  The unemployment rate s decline was largely due to the decline in the labor force participation rate that came in at 63 2  Factors Behind Job AdditionsThe U S  economy may have shown signs of a slowdown recently  with the slump in the manufacturing sector due to the protracted U S  China trade war  But American consumers have been resilient enough and their high purchasing power has kept the economy afloat What supports the strong American consumer  Wage growth  which remained solid in November  left consumers with enough money to spend  The average hourly wage rose 0 2  or by 7 cents to  28 29 per hour  However  the 12 month rate of hourly wage gains dropped to 3 1  from 3 2  in the previous month Additionally  November saw a revival in the manufacturing sector  as the autoworkers  strike at General Motors Company  NYSE GM  ended  and the company added roughly 50 000 jobs  With that  the manufacturing space added a total of 54 000 new jobs in November Buy These 5 Stocks NowThis low unemployment rate points at a robust labor market even after the economy has shown signs of a slowdown  Moreover  stronger than expected job addition calls for investment in the staffing space  as it is a key driver in new employment  Further  health care  hotels and restaurants  and business service sectors saw solid job creation in November and cannot be ignored Hence  keeping all the positives in mind  we have shortlisted five stocks that for investment purpose  Each of these flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Cross Country Healthcare  Inc provides healthcare staffing  recruiting and
