156201,377717,NI,Earnings Preview  NiSource  NI  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects NiSource  NYSE NI  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  60  
Revenues are expected to be  939 83 million  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NiSource 
For NiSource  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NiSource will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NiSource would post earnings of  0 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 05  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NiSource doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-nisource-ni-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200476789,200476789

Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  CFD DFT  A performing stock in a performing sector  AMD has rallied an impressive 112  year to date  Since touching a record high of 41 75 in November  prices have moved lower but on thinner volumes to suggest the move is corrective  so we re looking out for new level of support to build before it breaks to fresh highs 
A spinning top doji marks a potential swing low at 38 19  near the 23 6  Fibonacci ratio  If bullish momentum returns above this level  it can be assumed the correction has ended The 35 55   36 00 zone may provide better support upon a deeper retracement  If a higher low forms near or above this zone and bullish momentum returns  bulls could look to target the 2019 and 2016 highs   




United Technologies  NYSE UTX  CFD DFT  Prices are consolidating just below the record high  and the 20 day eMA is providing support  At the beginning of November  we saw a break of key resistance around 144  and the bullish trend from the September low appears to be an impulsive wave  Due to the strength of momentum leading into the current consolidation  we expect prices to eventually break higher   
Bias remains bullish above 144  which means bulls can see dips above this level in case momentum takes it lower initially If momentum takes it higher out of the current consolidation zone  bulls can use an open upside target as we re back at record highs

A series of lower highs below 38 shows bearish momentum is building and Friday s bearish candle suggests prices could be headed lower 
Near term bias remains bearish below 23 14 Bears can wait for a break of 22 00   22 19 to confirm a resumption of the downtrend The lows around 20 make viable downside targets  A break beneath here would take prices to their lowest levels since 2001 





NiSource  NYSE NI  CFD DFT  Momentum since the 2019 high has been predominantly bearish  with losses coming quite hard and fast  Support was recently found at the February low around 26  and prices have retraced higher although Friday s bearish hammer suggests the corrective  That the bearish hammer stalled beneath the 26 38 resistance and 38 2  Fibonacci levels adds further weight to the corrective move nearing its completion 
Bias remains bearish below 27 Bears can either look to  pick at the highs   fade into minor rallies  below 27 and assumes prices will revisit support around 26 Alternatively  wait for a break below 26 38 support before assuming a return to the 26 area Price Action Update

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

This energy holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 06 billion  up 5 6  from the year ago quarter

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NiSource 
For NiSource  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NiSource will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NiSource would post earnings of  0 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 82  delivering a surprise of  6 49  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
PGE has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while NiSource has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that POR has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
POR currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 55  while NI has a forward P E of 19 50  We also note that POR has a PEG ratio of 5 64  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  NI currently has a PEG ratio of 8 
Another notable valuation metric for POR is its P B ratio of 1 62  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  NI has a P B of 2 05

156303,377819,NI,Top Stock Reports For Cisco  Nike   United Parcel Service ,opinion,"Monday  March 25  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Cisco  CSCO   NIKE  NKE   and United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked Cisco s shares have gained  19 7  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Computer Networking industry s increase of  17 3   The Zacks analyst thinks Cisco is benefiting from strength witnessed in the company s security  Infrastructure Platforms and applications segments  Order strength and improving traction of the subscription based model are other tailwinds  
A strengthening collaboration portfolio  which now includes Webex Teams and Accompany  bodes well  Further  buyout of Duo Security and Luxtera is expected to aid the company in expanding its IT and data center clientele  Moreover  robust adoption of company s Wave 2 offerings  Meraki solutions  Catalyst 9000 switching platform and HyperFlex data center solutions hold promise  
Nevertheless  weakness in routing is a headwind  Competition from Arista primarily in campus connect network switches market is likely to hurt Cisco as it holds a dominant position in that domain 
 You can   
Shares of Nike  NYSE NKE  have gained  24 8  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry  which gained  19 6  over the same period  driven by a robust surprise trend  stemming from the execution of Consumer Direct Offense  Nike delivered positive earnings results for over three years now  with third quarter fiscal 2019 marking the 27th straight quarter of earnings beat  Sales surpassed estimates for the eighth straight quarter 
The Zacks analyst thinks strong progress on Consumer Direct Offense through innovation and focus on digital transformation are the key drivers  Growth at international and NIKE Direct businesses aided results in the fiscal third quarter  
However  the company provided a soft view for the fiscal fourth quarter  owing to unfavorable currency impact  Higher SG A expenses due to increased investments are likely to remain a drag  Further  higher input costs like cotton  chemicals and labor as well as the shift in supply chain investments from the fiscal third quarter to the fourth quarter should hurt results 
 You can   
United Parcel Service s shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry over the past year  gaining  3 5  vs   10   The Zacks analyst likes UPS  efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks  
Evidently  the company rewarded its shareholders to the tune of  4 2 billion in 2018  Continuing its pro investor approach  in February 2019  UPS increased its quarterly dividend by 5 5  to 96 cents per share  Robust free cash flow generation by UPS supports the possibility of a dividend hike moving ahead  Moreover  UPS  growth is hugely supported by the e commerce development  The company anticipates cross border e commerce volume to grow by 28  over the next three years  
However  the company s high capital expenditure is limiting bottom line growth  Trade war related uncertainty and high debt pose further challenges

156442,377958,NI,Southern Company  SO  To Post Q2 Earnings  Hit Or Miss ,opinion,"Electric utility firm Southern Company   NYSE SO   is set to release its second quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Wednesday  Aug 2 
In the preceding three month period  the Atlanta  GA based service provider reported stronger than expected earnings due to robust performance by its wholesale unit 
However  coming to earnings surprise history  Southern Company has a good record  its beaten estimates in 3 of the last four quarters Southern Company  The  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
A leading utility holding entity in the U S   Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast  With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation  we expect the firm to generate steady earnings 
Also  with operations in a stable and growing industry  Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow  The utility s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself 
We further believe that the AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings  
However  with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time  sales might be affected  This together with a large base  might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates  Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern 
Moreover  the recent positive news regarding Toshiba s financial guarantee to help complete the half finished Vogtle project in Georgia  we remain skeptical regarding Southern Company s  20 billion twin nuclear plants  The Vogtle project is being bankrolled with more than  8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees 
Georgia Power believes that the project has already exceeded the budget by  3 billion and is unlikely to be completed before the end of 2020  This will substantially increase Southern Company s leverage and deteriorate its credit metrics  Additionally  the increasing capital intensity of its operations may result in reduced returns going forward 
Southern Company s much delayed clean coal power plant project Kemper in Mississippi recently suffered yet another setback with a postponement in the projected in service date  The extension of the schedule  together with certain technical glitches  would also hike the overall cost of the plant by  186 million 
As it is  the economics of the Kemper project is a major cause of concern for the company as the plant is not competitive at the current natural gas prices  Overall  the project has been a major overhang on Southern Company s stock owing to its poor execution  cost overruns and multiple delays 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 43   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 71 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower  at 70 cents 
Zacks Rank  However  Southern Company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
As it is  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Share Performance  Southern Company has lost 3 8  of its value during the second quarter versus the 0 03  growth of its 

Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company  here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
NiSource Inc    NYSE NI   has an Earnings ESP of  10 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  The firm is expected to release earnings results on Aug 2  You can see  
The AES Corp    NYSE AES   has an Earnings ESP of  20 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  The utility is anticipated to release earnings on Aug 8 
ALLETE Inc    NYSE ALE   has an Earnings ESP of  5 36  and a Zacks Rank  2  The utility is likely to release earnings on Aug 2

156514,378030,NI,Is A Surprise In Store For PPL Corp  PPL  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"We expect PPL Corporation   NYSE PPL   to surpass expectations when it reports first quarter 2017 results after the market closes on May 4  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15 38  
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that PPL Corporation is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates and PPL Corporation has the right mix 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 63 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents is  1 61   This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  PPL Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

   Zacks Rank  PPL Corp  currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  The combination of PPL Corp  s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season 
Conversely  we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions 
Factors to Consider
PPL Corp  has a diverse business portfolio that helps it to perform in and adapt to different market conditions  The company s UK operation puts it at an advantageous position than its domestic focused peers  Considering that nearly half of its income comes from the U K   any tax reform in the U S  will only impact its domestic business 
To protect itself from the price fluctuations in pound  the company reestablished its hedge levels  PPL Corp  hedged about 92 93  of the pound at an average rate of  1 21 per pound in 2017  This initiative is expected to guard the company from the foreign currency risk 
Warmer winter in its services territories might have an adverse impact on demand in the first quarter 
Other Stocks to Consider
PPL Corporation is not the only  company looking up this earnings season  We see likely earnings beats coming from these companies as well
