118711,340226,INTU,Earnings Preview  Intuit  INTU  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Intuit  INTU  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 21  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 27 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 12 billion  up 10 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuit 
For Intuit  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intuit will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Intuit would post a loss of  0 14 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 09  delivering a surprise of  35 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Intuit doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-intuit-intu-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200485390,200485390

118719,340234,INTU,Intuit  INTU  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Intuit  INTU  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Intuit basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Intuit imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Intuit
For the fiscal year ending July      2020  this maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software is expected to earn  7 58 per share  which is a change of 12 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Intuit  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Intuit to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuit-intu-upgraded-to-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200495194,200495194

118746,340261,INTU,Financial Technology Trends And Growth In 2019,opinion,"CB Insights recently published a Q2 2019 Global Fintech Report  highlighting trends in financial technology investments and deal activity  The report gives constructive insight to investors interested in the sector s financial opportunities and growth 
In 2018  fintech companies raised roughly  58 billion through 1 707 deals  This strong backing sparked interest in the sector as a growing opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs  In H1 2019  global fintech saw 838 deals worth  15 1 billion  While these are still promising figures  fintech did see a global dip in deals during Q2 
Q2 2019 also saw a drop in venture capital backed deals  falling to  367 million  the lowest since 2016 s fourth quarter 
Nonetheless  other trends outlined in CB Insights  report show incredible and continued growth for the sector 
According to the report  the first half of 2019 has been strong for the fintech sector in many respects  largely maintaining 2018 s momentum  Globally  fintech startups raised  8 3 billion in the second quarter while achieving 25 mega deals reaching more than  100 million  Currently  there are now 48 fintech unicorns worth a total of  187 billion  28 of which reside in the United States  Seven of these startups entered the market in Q2 2019   Markets  Bill com  Carta  Lemonade  Checkout com  Value  and Liquid 
Internationally  CB Insights  reported that Latin America proved in Q2 to be one of the fastest growing regions for fintech funding  topping both India and China with 23 deals worth  481 million 
Q2 2019 was also strong for emerging sub sectors within the fintech ecosystem  In the first half of the year  digital banking companies raised over  2 5 billion and now boasts over 230 million mobile users 
Within the digital banking sub sector  challenger banks also continued to raise significant capital  with over  649 million across 17 deals  Challenger banks  such as Credit Karma and Coinbase  make up the biggest cohort of the fastest growing fintech startups  Meanwhile  capital markets tech companies concluded large rounds of funding in the first half of the year  raising nearly  2 billion 
Despite this continued and steady growth  the sector will likely follow the 2018 trend of lackluster IPO activity  In 2018  only three fintech unicorns went public  Due to a record number of mega rounds  2019 IPO activity will likely be just as slow 
Investors should still keep track of these impressive startups nonetheless  as the number of VC backed deals did dip this quarter  However  due to the overall trend of large and successful funding rounds  it is expected for these companies to be much larger at the time of IPO  providing less benefit to individual investors 
Despite the slow pace of IPOs  these fintech startups still provide great investment benefits  As companies like Visa  NYSE V   PayPal Holdings  PYPL  and Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS  continue to acquire these innovative startups  their stock prices and stockholders continue to prosper  For example  PayPal s acquisition of Venmo  the incredibly successful mobile payments app  had a hugely advantageous impact on their stock  In fact  all three of these stocks recently jumped into the IBD 50 roster of growth stock 

Other fintech stocks that investors are suggesting as long term buys are  Intuit  Inc  NASDAQ INTU    Square Inc   NYSE SQ    Envestnet Inc   NYSE ENV   and  Blackline Inc   NASDAQ BL

The S P 500 was down about 35 basis points on October 22  nothing dramatic  The index failed at the 3 014 level all day  before finally moving lower around 2 PM   Support continues to be around 2 986  and I think much changed following today 
I m still felt wondering why momentum stock got crushed again today

Shop was down a lot today  over 6   on no apparent news  The stock fell below  300 and could even fall back to  285 again  The company reports results on October 29

Paypal fell by over 4  today and looks like it could go to around  94

Anything to do with global payments or its software did not have a good day  Energy stocks were the one stand out today  with the XLE  NYSE XLE  rising by over 1 5   There were a bunch of names in the group up over 3   like Pioneer  NYSE PXD   Occidental  NYSE OXY   and National Oilwell  NYSE NOV   Perhaps it was a rotation from some of the better performers  names into some of the underperformers  I do not know 

SNAP  NYSE SNAP 
Finally  I m surprised SNAP fell so sharply after hours  Maybe it s one of these stocks that regroups tomorrow once trading resumes  Guidance looked fine  maybe I m missing something  and I haven t looked closely enough   13 25 was firm after hours  though 
But what was really strange about SNAP was that the stock was getting pushed lower in a big way before the results were even out  I was watching it trade down searching the web for the results  and they weren t to be found  until 4 10  I think someone was trying to get in front of SNAP  and that set the stage for the push lower  which is likely why the stock is lifting after the dust has settled

118750,340265,INTU, Bitcoin is a  Colossal Pump and Dump Scheme   Founding PayPal CEO ,news,"Founding PayPal CEO Bill Harris is of the view that Bitcoin is little more than a pump and dump scheme on a large scale  it continues to survive entirely owing to its speculative nature  which has pulled  ill informed buyers  into a  spiral of greed  
Bitcoin has been around since 2009  but shot to prominence in mid to late 2017  when it registered gains of over 1600  and skyrocketed to a record breaking price of  20 000  It has since receded in terms of price  but the fascination with the digital currency has yet to die down  While regulators are scrambling to try and rein in the volatile cryptocurrency and its peers  the crypto market refuses to die down  and Bitcoin s price continues to fluctuate 
According to Harris  however  Bitcoin is nothing more than a scam  In a recently published   the former  Intuit   NASDAQ INTU  CEO outlines three main reasons why Bitcoin has zero value and is a  colossal pump and dump scheme  the likes of which the world has never seen  
Harris claims that Bitcoin has no value as 
A means of payment   he claims it is accepted nowhere  comes with high transaction fees and delays attached  and is unsuitable as payment owing to its wild price fluctuations 
A store of value   its price volatility  according to Harris  also makes it an unsuitable store of value 
A thing in itself   he states that it has no intrinsic value and is only valuable so long as people believe that others want to buy it  Harris questions   In what rational universe could someone simply issue electronic scrip   or just announce that they intend to   and create  out of the blue  billions of dollars of value  
In addition  he also refers to Bitcoin s potential for usage in criminal activities such as tax evasion  and the fact that it has become a popular target for hacks  He also points out that Bitcoin mining consumes huge amounts of natural resources  and urges the SEC and other regulatory authorities to crackdown on cryptocurrencies 
However  as a  points out  Harris  article contains more than one misconception  Firstly  he seems to have erroneously lumped Bitcoin together with other alternative cryptoassets and initial coin offerings  ICOs   e g   he refers to ICO scams to back up his main claim that Bitcoin is a scam  whereas Bitcoin has nothing to do with ICO scams  
The rebuttal goes on to address each of Harris  three charges against Bitcoin  In regards to the claim that Bitcoin cannot be used as a method of payment  it argues that Bitcoin is used in specific use cases  and criminal activity is also a use case  regardless of the morality immorality factor   Using issues such as transaction fees and delays to discredit Bitcoin also ignores the existence of solutions such as the Lightning Network  In addition  Bitcoin s value lies in the fact that it is a  censorship resistant  method of payment  and is not exactly meant to be used for trivial  everyday purchases 
The rebuttal also points out that dismissing Bitcoin as a store of value on the grounds of price volatility is flawed logic  as these price swings do not impact those who are holding Bitcoin for varied reasons such as  political philosophy  or  price speculation  
Lastly  in regards to Harris  argument that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value  the rebuttal points out that Bitcoin s value lies  among other factors  in its value proposition as  digital gold in an increasing cashless society  ",2018-04-25,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-is-a-colossal-pumpanddump-scheme-founding-paypal-ceo-1412516,1412516

118760,340275,INTU,Analysts Estimate Intuit  INTU  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Intuit  INTU  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  143 8  
Revenues are expected to be  961 37 million  down 2 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuit 
For Intuit  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intuit will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Intuit would post earnings of  5 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 55  delivering a surprise of  2 97  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Intuit doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-intuit-intu-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200455528,200455528

118798,340313,INTU,CACI International  CACI  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of CACI International  CACI   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  215 29 in the previous session  CACI International has gained 48 8  since the start of the year compared to the 21 7  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 23 2  return for the Zacks Computer   Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 1  2019  CACI International reported EPS of  2 69 versus consensus estimate of  2 3 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 49  
For the current fiscal year  CACI International is expected to post earnings of  12 02 per share on  4 98 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  13 51 per share on  5 62 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 13 33  and 12 84   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
CACI International may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
CACI International has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A

Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  CACI International currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates

118800,340315,INTU,5 Stocks That Flaunt An Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio called interest coverage ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest coverage ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of

118833,340348,INTU,Tech Leads S P 500 To Post Best 1H In 22 Years  6 Top Picks ,opinion,Wall Street completed a record breaking first half of 2019  Three major stock indexes     the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite     are up 14   17 4  and 20 7   respectively  The performance of U S  stocks in the first half of 2019 marked one of the best turnarounds in Wall Street s history after a pathetic 2018  when all three indexes ended in the red     The S P 500 Index scored several records during the first half of 2019  The primary driver of the broad market index was none other than the technology sector  Notably  tech stocks are likely to push the S P 500 to cross the 3 000 mark for the first time S P 500 Posts Blockbuster Performance in 1H 2019The S P 500 gained 17 4  in the first half of 2019  marking its best first half performance in any year since 1997  The broad market index witnessed an impressive turnaround this year after finishing last year in negative territory  with its worst ever yearly performance since 2008  Notably  all 11 broad sectors of the index were in positive territory in the first half 2019  with ten recording significant double digit growth During this time period  the S P 500 touched all time highs twice  the latest being on Jun 20  when the index closed at 2 954 18 after an intraday high of 2 958 06  In five out of six months this year  the benchmark index posted positive returns From January to April  the S P 500 Index gained 7 9   3   1 8  and 3 9   respectively  In May the market s benchmark plunged 6 6  due to an abrupt break down of the U S  China trade talks  only to witness an impressive rebound of 6 9  in June  Notably  the S P 500 logged the best June performance since 1955 Technology Leads S P 500 RallyThe biggest catalyst for the S P 500 s rebound in 2019 is the technology sector  which has rallied 25 9  year to date  And from the eve of Christmas last year  when the benchmark index hit rock bottom  the sector has gained nearly 36  In a major boost to the tech sector  the first genuine ray of hope for a potential solution to the U S  China trade spat which stalled in May came from the just concluded G 20 summit in Japan  On Jun 29  President Donald Trump and China s president Xi Jinping agreed to continue negotiations for an amicable solution Moreover  both sides have decided to restrain from imposing further tariffs on each other for the time being  So far  the United States has imposed 25  tariff on  250 billion Chinese goods while China has retaliated with 25  tariff on  160 billion U S  goods  President Trump has threatened to impose 25  tariff on another  300 billion of Chinses goods Additionally  the U S  government has decided to ease some restrictions on Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei  The Trump administration has decided to allow U S  tech companies to sell products that will not harm U S  national security to Huawei Will Technology Sector Push S P 500 to 3 000 A trade deal with China will benefit the technology sector the most  China is the largest market for high tech products of U S  companies  At the same time  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  Moreover  clinching a lasting agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for the homegrown tech behemoths At present  the S P 500 is around 2  away from a landmark 3 000 level  Positive developments on the trade war front and a dovish monetary policy of the Fed can easily push the broad market index to 3 000 for the first time According to FedWatch  most of the respondents are looking for a rate cut by the central bank in July or may by twice by September  Yet again  the technology sector is set to be the primary driver Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in technology stocks within the S P 500 Index for solid gains  We have been able to narrow

118834,340349,INTU,Oracle  ORCL  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Oracle  ORCL   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 15 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  58 09 in the previous session  Oracle has gained 28 5  since the start of the year compared to the 20 3  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 32 5  return for the Zacks Computer   Software industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on June 19  2019  Oracle reported EPS of  1 16 versus consensus estimate of  1 07 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 78  
For the current fiscal year  Oracle is expected to post earnings of  3 91 per share on  40 35 billion in revenues  This represents a 11 08  change in EPS on a 2 08  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 29 per share on  41 6 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 66  and 3 11   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Oracle may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Oracle has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 13 2X versus its peer group s average of 26 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 51  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Oracle currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Oracle fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Oracle shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Oracle Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Oracle have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Nuance Communications  NUAN   Open Text  OTEX   and Intuit  INTU   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 33  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Oracle  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oracle-orcl-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200436459,200436459
118835,340350,INTU,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Keysight Technologies  Akamai Technologies  Harris  AMETEK And Intuit,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   July 2  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Keysight Technologies Inc    NYSE KEYS    Akamai Technologies Inc    NASDAQ AKAM    Harris Corp    BE HRS    AMETEK Inc    NYSE AME   and Intuit Inc    NASDAQ INTU   
Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  
Tech Stocks Lead S P 500 to Best 1H in 22 Years  5 Top Picks
Wall Street completed a record breaking first half of 2019  Three major stock indexes     the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite     are up 14   17 4  and 20 7   respectively  The performance of U S  stocks in the first half of 2019 marked one of the best turnarounds in Wall Street s history after a pathetic 2018  when all three indexes ended in the red     
The S P 500 Index scored several records during the first half of 2019  The primary driver of the broad market index was none other than the technology sector  Notably  tech stocks are likely to push the S P 500 to cross the 3 000 mark for the first time 
S P 500 Posts Blockbuster Performance in 1H 2019
The S P 500 gained 17 4  in the first half of 2019  marking its best first half performance in any year since 1997  The broad market index witnessed an impressive turnaround this year after finishing last year in negative territory  with its worst ever yearly performance since 2008  Notably  all 11 broad sectors of the index were in positive territory in the first half 2019  with ten recording significant double digit growth 
During this time period  the S P 500 touched all time highs twice  the latest being on Jun 20  when the index closed at 2 954 18 after an intraday high of 2 958 06  In five out of six months this year  the benchmark index posted positive returns 
From January to April  the S P 500 Index gained 7 9   3   1 8  and 3 9   respectively  In May the market s benchmark plunged 6 6  due to an abrupt break down of the U S  China trade talks  only to witness an impressive rebound of 6 9  in June  Notably  the S P 500 logged the best June performance since 1955 
Technology Leads S P 500 Rally
The biggest catalyst for the S P 500 s rebound in 2019 is the technology sector  which has rallied 25 9  year to date  And from the eve of Christmas last year  when the benchmark index hit rock bottom  the sector has gained nearly 36  
In a major boost to the tech sector  the first genuine ray of hope for a potential solution to the U S  China trade spat which stalled in May came from the just concluded G 20 summit in Japan  On Jun 29  President Donald Trump and China s president Xi Jinping agreed to continue negotiations for an amicable solution 
Moreover  both sides have decided to restrain from imposing further tariffs on each other for the time being  So far  the United States has imposed 25  tariff on  250 billion Chinese goods while China has retaliated with 25  tariff on  160 billion U S  goods  President Trump has threatened to impose 25  tariff on another  300 billion of Chinses goods 
Additionally  the U S  government has decided to ease some restrictions on Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei  The Trump administration has decided to allow U S  tech companies to sell products that will not harm U S  national security to Huawei 
Will Technology Sector Push S P 500 to 3 000 
A trade deal with China will benefit the technology sector the most  China is the largest market for high tech products of U S  companies  At the same time  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  Moreover  clinching a lasting agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for the homegrown tech behemoths 
At present  the S P 500 is around 2  away from a landmark 3 000 level  Positive developments on the trade war front and a dovish monetary policy of the Fed can easily push the broad market index to 3 000 for the first time 
According to FedWatch  most of the respondents are looking for a rate cut by the central bank in July or may by twice by September  Yet again  the technology sector is set to be the primary driver 
Our Top Picks
At this stage  it will be prudent to invest in technology stocks within the S P 500 Index for solid gains  We have been able to narrow down our search on six stocks  which soared in the first half and still have upside left  All the six stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

118858,340373,INTU,4 FinTech Stocks To Buy On Changing Consumer Preference  ,opinion,"The rise in financial technology  FinTech  is changing the way consumers use financial services  Increased dependency on smartphones  tablets and other connected devices is spurring demand for mobility in the financial services sector  This demand is not only driving the way consumers interact with money but also the way financial companies operate 
Therefore  investors keen on FinTech companies can invest in stocks gaining from high demand 
Changing Payment Preferences Driving FinTech
FinTech s largest contribution to America s booming millennial population is the flexibility it offers for payments  Mobility largely defines this flexibility  which is precisely what drives consumer preference toward digital payment systems 
At present  83 1 million millennials comprise the U S  population  which makes them the largest generation in America s history  a Forbes  cited  Therefore  it s no surprise that millennial payment preferences should play a vital role in the growing usage of digital payment systems 
A Visa  NYSE V   in 2018 cites that not only do millennials use cards more than other segments  but also are likely to increase spending as they grow older  They are also welcoming to new and emerging payment products  This rising preference for debit credit cards among the largest constituents of America s current workforce is a crucial factor driving the payment industry today 
Michael Marx  senior director at Visa  Inc    that consumers are using card based payments and electronic funds transfer instead of paper checks  depending on different merchants  payment acceptance practices 
Businesses have begun to adapt themselves to meet consumer preference for digital payment systems  This is why many retailers and restaurants are now eliminating cash payments  The process not only helps diminish long queues and increase the number of transactions on a per hour basis but also saves companies  money on transportation of cash 
It is this rising trend for digital financial payment and services that has drawn the attention of established financial services giants  These companies are entering into M As with FinTech companies to increase the perimeter of their financial services 

FinTech M As Boost Operational Efficiency 
Mergers and acquisitions raise the scope of business and services for financial services organizations and Fintech companies as well as increase their asset valuations 
Well established financial companies can also boost their operational efficiency through these collaborations  Improved security protocols  biometrics  new technologies such as AI  machine learning and blockchain in financial services  all of which are offered by FinTech companies are vital in enhancing operational efficiency  Data handling and management can also be advanced through FinTech  This makes digital transformation faster 
In fact  the steep rise in M As in the financial services sector this year is indicative of companies  growing acknowledgement of demand for digital financial services  These businesses are fast realizing that consolidation rather than competition with FinTech companies raise the scope of their business and services 
Earlier in January  Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV  Inc    NYSE FIS    the financial services technology company whose services are the base for most common banking transactions  announced a merger worth  22 billion with First Data Corporation   First Data s Clover  which is a point of sale  POS  platform  has more than a million merchant devices used across the globe  Undoubtedly  the deal adds more value to this POS technology that competes with Square   NYSE SQ

118863,340378,INTU,Intuit  INTU  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Intuit  INTU  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Intuit is 19 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 19 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 3  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Intuit has an S TA ratio of 1 21  which means that the company gets  1 21 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 67  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Intuit looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 13 2  this year versus the industry average of 5 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Intuit have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Intuit a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

118893,340408,INTU,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Intuit  INTU ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Intuit  INTU  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Intuit is 19 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 9  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Intuit has an S TA ratio of 1 21  which means that the company gets  1 21 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 67  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Intuit looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 13  this year versus the industry average of 5 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Intuit have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Intuit has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Intuit is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-intuit-intu-200425661,200425661

 By Jon Hopkins
 LONDON  Aug 21  Reuters   Britain s leading share index
added 0 2 percent in early trade on Friday  modestly extending
Thursday s rally after overnight gains on Wall Street  with
heavyweight oils firmer as crude prices held steady 
 By 0756 GMT  the FTSE 100 index was 11 28 points higher at
4 767 86 after closing up 1 43 percent  or 66 91 points on
Thursday  driven mainly by a rally from heavyweight commodity
and financial issues 
 Oil majors provided the main strength for the blue chips
early on Friday as crude held around  73 a barrel  with BP  BG
Group  Royal Dutch Shell  Cairn Energy and Tullow Oil up 0 6 to
1 0 percent 
  I suspect we ll have a fairly quiet day as generally it s
been a quiet week  with volumes across the world very slim at
the moment  and nothing much on the corporate or economic front
to provide interest  said Jim Wood Smith  head of research at
Williams de Broe 
  The market doesn t want to go down at the moment  with
buyers coming in to each dip and quite solid buying support for
the FTSE below 4 700  It s just having a little pause for breath
before we can expect it to go back upwards   Wood Smith added 
 Selected financial issues found support  with fund manager
Schroders up 1 5 percent and insurer Old Mutual gaining 1 6
percent  reflecting firmer equity valuations 
 Banks were in the main higher  with the sector buoyed by
gains in heavyweight HSBC  up 0 5 percent  while Lloyds Banking
Group and Standard Chartered added 1 3 and 0 1 percent 
respectively 
 U S  stocks rose for a third straight session on Thursday

manufacturing data pleased  although Asian stock markets were
mixed on Friday  keeping a wary eye on volatile Chinese shares 
 Miners also added some strength to the blue chips  although
overall the sector was mixed  Vedanta Resources  Fresnillo and
Xstrata gained 1 4 to 2 1 percent  but Lonmin  BHP Billiton and
Rio Tinto lost 0 3 to 0 8 percent 
 The U S  Federal Trade Commission has cleared Rio Tinto s

 Intertek was the top FTSE 100 riser  up 2 5 percent  buoyed
by a double upgrade to  buy  from  underperform  by Banc of
America Merrill Lynch 
 The broker said taking a longer term view of Intertek s
markets suggests substantial re rating potential 
 
 SAGE FALLS
 Sage Group was the top FTSE 100 faller  retracing some of
the gains it made on Thursday with a 2 2 percent drop  after
U S  financial software peer Intuit said overnight that its
fiscal 2010 earnings would be below analysts  estimates 
 WPP Group fell back as well  down 2 1 percent  having seen
strong gains late on Thursday which traders attributed to a
short squeeze ahead of the adverting firm s results  due next
week 
 Among the mid caps  Rightmove jumped 11 percent higher after
the property website said it is confident 2009 operating profit
will exceed current market expectations as it posted
above forecast first half results 
 No major domestic economic data will be released on Friday 
so investors  focus will be on July U S  existing home sales
data in the afternoon  which are seen at 4 99 million in July 
up from 4 89 million in June 
 The market will also scour a speech by Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke before the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas

stimulus programmes  and rising consumer demand that you are
beginning to see from China and India   said Stephen Pope  chief
global market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald

rally with only a 25 percent gain since March  were also in
demand  GlaxoSmithKline  AstraZeneca and Shire rose about 1 3
percent 
 Software firm Sage  however  lost 0 8 percent after U S

estimates and saw tight economic conditions prevailing for at
least another year

118946,340461,INTU,Open Text  OTEX  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Open Text  OTEX   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  40 49 in the previous session  Open Text has gained 23 8  since the start of the year compared to the 19 5  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 24 6  return for the Zacks Computer   Software industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 1  2019  Open Text reported EPS of  0 64 versus consensus estimate of  0 59 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 61  
For the current fiscal year  Open Text is expected to post earnings of  2 76 per share on  2 89 billion in revenues  This represents a 7 81  change in EPS on a 2 48  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 92 per share on  3 03 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 5 98  and 5   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Open Text may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Open Text has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 15 3X versus its peer group s average of 25 8X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Open Text currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Open Text fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Open Text shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Open Text Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Open Text have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Avid Technology  AVID   Intuit  INTU   and NetEase  NTES   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 11  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Open Text  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-05-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/open-text-otex-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200420767,200420767

118948,340463,INTU,Stocks Fall Short Of Weekly Comeback ,opinion,"The market missed its opportunity to salvage the week as the major indices turned lower on Friday and ended their three day winning streak 
	Most of the damage came on Monday in the wake of the U S  and China raising tariffs on each other after talks broke down  Stocks plunged on the news and set the table for what could have been a disastrous five days 
	But then the market rallied for three consecutive sessions  leaving each of the indices in striking distance of recouping Monday s losses and getting on positive ground for this bumpy week 
	And it looked like we just might do it  Stocks reversed course after a weak open and were in the green around midday  
	But as we ve been experiencing of late  the indices limped into the closing bell  In fact  this time they limped all the way into the red and dashed any hopes of fully recovering from the earlier selloff 
	As a result  the NASDAQ was off 1 3  this week  while the other two indices were each off by less than 1  
	Investors shouldn t be too disappointed  though  It could have been a lot worse after the early selloff  especially since the U S  and China aren t even talking to each other right now 
	For example  the NASDAQ fought back from a 3 4  plunge on Monday 
	As for today  the tech heavy index dropped 1 04   or about 82 points  to 7816 28  It was really all or nothing for the NASDAQ this week  It moved at least 1  each day 
	The S P slipped 0 58  to 2859 53 while the Dow dropped 0 38   or about 100 points  to 25 764 
	Unfortunately  it looks like this trade issue is sticking around for the foreseeable future  The U S  is making it more difficult for companies to do business with China s telecom giant Huawei  And now we re waiting for more potential retaliation for the move

119049,340564,INTU,3 Reasons Why Intuit  INTU  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects

While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below

While the historical EPS growth rate for Intuit is 15 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 2  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Intuit has an S TA ratio of 1 21  which means that the company gets  1 21 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 65  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Intuit looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 11 7  this year versus the industry average of 6 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Intuit  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Intuit a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

119083,340598,INTU,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Intuit  INTU  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Intuit  INTU  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Intuit is 15 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 16 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 11 2  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Intuit has an S TA ratio of 1 21  which means that the company gets  1 21 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 63  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Intuit looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 11 3  this year versus the industry average of 6 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Intuit  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Intuit has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

119093,340608,INTU,Intuit  INTU  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Intuit  INTU   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Intuit currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if INTU is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For INTU  shares are up 3 45  over the past week while the Zacks Computer   Software industry is up 0 89  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 98  compares favorably with the industry s 4 49  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Intuit have risen 32 77   and are up 55 49  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 17 98  and 12 05   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to INTU s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  INTU is currently averaging 1 426 479 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with INTU 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost INTU s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 51 to  6 57 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that INTU is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Intuit on your short list ",2019-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuit-intu-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200403909,200403909

119120,340635,INTU,4 Dividend Dogs That Rallied More Than Deserved   Sell Now,opinion,"That dip didn t last long  did it 
The S P 500 is back around 2 800  the Dow is back around 26 000  and stocks   which frankly were never really  cheap  even in the December doldrums   are back to being hilariously overpriced  And that s a problem on two fronts 

It makes finding values   an important aspect in collecting big total returns   exceedingly difficult 
The more richly stocks are priced  the harder they can fall  making dividend landmines more plentiful in the current environment 

How bad is it out there 
Here s a look at the short term  which shows valuations are clearly back to their pre dip  normal  

Data Source  Multpl com  
If that s not worrisome enough  here s a look at the Shiller P E ratio  which takes into account inflation adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years  Stocks have only been this expensive or more twice in history   and that preceded two massive bear markets 

Source  Multpl com
And if you think it s just some trick of earnings  it s not   stocks are overpriced on a price to sales basis  too  trading at more than double revenues 

Source  Multpl com
You want to buy stocks when they re cheap because that adds to their capital appreciation potential and tends to correspond with a larger than average yield   a  double bonus   if you will 
The opposite is true if you buy stocks when they re costly  Not only do you have more downside potential  but typically you re buying in at a much smaller yield than typical 
We can see this relationship in Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI    not a prolific yielder  but a serial dividend raiser that has delivered serious upside in recent years  That is  until late last year when the markets dropped  and investors could no longer justify the fat premium on ATVI shares  
Game Over
I want you to watch out for the following four stocks  but for two separate reasons  In a couple of cases  these are troubled stocks that are just asking for a reason to get knocked into the abyss  But two of these stocks are actually growth and income plays that have simply become too expensive of late   and could use a broad market gut punch to drag them back down to more buyable levels 
Intuit  NASDAQ INTU 
Dividend Yield  0 75 
Tax software isn t the most scintillating business in the world as far as narratives go  But Intuit  INTU    the company behind TurboTax and QuickBooks   has turned do it yourself accounting into simply sizzling returns over the past decade 
Intuit  INTU  Is Nearing a 10 Year 10 Bagger 
There s no smoke  n  mirrors here  These are legitimate gains produced by solid  steady business growth over the years  Consider this 

The company now boasts 3 9 million QuickBooks Online subscribers   with nearly 1 million of those coming internationally   in its fiscal second quarter ended Jan  31  up 38  year over year  The company s QuickBooks Capital business loans division also boasts roughly  277 million in cumulative loans since it launched a little more than a year ago 
And Intuit still sees pretty robust growth going forward  including 8  10  revenue growth for fiscal 2019  and adjusted profit growth of 11  12  
Indeed  I ve been bullish on this stock previously  saying   This is another prolific dividend grower that has more than doubled its quarterly dole in five years  And its DIVCON rating of 5 implies that INTU is well armed enough to continue the upward march   Intuit s shares are up more than 27  since that call 
But the stock needs a breather  INTU now trades at more than 50 times trailing earnings and nearly 40 times analysts  projections for current year profits   both on the extremely high end of its historical valuations  And while Intuit has never been a particularly lofty yielder despite its rapid pace of payout growth  its current yield of 0 7  is awfully lean 
Good company  bad price  Stocks like this almost give us a reason to root for a quick  violent pullback so we can jump into quality companies like this at a more palatable valuation 
Covanta Holding  NYSE CVA   CVA 
Dividend Yield  5 9 
Covanta  CVA  technically is a  waste management  company  and that would typically check the  stable  reliable revenues  box in your mind  After all  good economy or bad  everyone needs to get rid of their trash 
But that s not Covanta s full story 
The company also generates electricity from waste  across several countries  including the U S   U K  and Japan  making it an alternative energy play   an attractive option in an investing environment that increasingly values ESG 
The problem is  while the company has grown its geographical reach and its top line  it s long had profitability and free cash flow issues  As a result  management is stuck between a rock and a hard place   it keeps pledging its commitment to the payout  but it hasn t been able to budge it from 25 cents quarterly since mid 2014 
Case in point  Right now  the highest estimate for 2019 profits is a mere 30 cents per share  versus a full  1 pledged to investors  Things technically look better on a cash flow basis  but not peachy   even if the company meets the midpoint of its own 2019 FCF guidance  it ll come up short of what it must pay out in distributions 
That s bad enough  Paying 57 times the most optimistic estimate for 2019 earnings  or more than 200 times the consensus analyst estimate  for it  Yikes 
Nike  NYSE NKE   NYSE NKE 
Dividend Yield  1 0 
In late 2015  investors saw something they hadn t seen in many years 
Nike  NKE  was tripping over its own shoelaces 
For a period of nearly two years  Nike lost nearly a quarter of its value  including a 2016 in which its 18  loss made it the worst stock of the Dow  Rival Adidas  DE ADSGN  made inroads against both the American sports apparel giant and relative upstart Under Armour  NYSE UAA   which also jabbed at Nike by becoming more aggressive in seeking out athlete endorsements  sometimes leading to bidding wars 
But Nike has found its stride yet again  ramping up considerably through most of 2018 before pulling back with the rest of the market in Q4  then putting together a 15  year to date rally to put it at fresh all time highs 
Nike s brand has become resurgent  often topping the list of favored athletic apparel brands among men and women alike in the 18 to 34 demographic  The company s support of Colin Kaepernick and placement of the controversial football player in its ads  while sparking immediate concern  proved to be a boon to sales  Revenues blew through expectations in fiscal Q2  during which that ad was released  Meanwhile  Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel considers the retailer a  top pick  and thinks it can crack the  100 mark in the next 12 months thanks to its strong operating performance and potential to keep boosting margins 
Again  this all just comes down to price  Much of Nike s gains are coming on margin expansion  and its all time high prices have lifted NKE to multiyear high valuations  Meanwhile  the yield has shrunk to a mere 1  
Nike  NKE  Is as Overpriced as Its Basketball Shoes
This company is an American powerhouse  and one heckuva dividend growth play too  with the payout rocketing almost 90  over the past half decade  It s just too  too expensive right now 
Wait for gravity do its thing first 
Vereit  NYSE VER 
Dividend Yield  6 9 
VEREIT  VER  is one of the largest single tenant commercial real estate investment trusts  REITs  in the country  boasting roughly 4 000 properties across 49 states  Canada and Puerto Rico  These properties are leased out by 661 tenants spanning retail  42    restaurants  21    offices  19   and industrial space  18    That kind of diversity should in theory help a great deal   when one area is down  other types of properties can keep the portfolio propped up 
That s the theory  anyway 
But first  a refresher  VEREIT is actually the old American Realty Capital  whose stock was obliterated thanks to an accounting scandal  The fallout was so bad that the REIT went with a full scorched earth strategy  ditching its CFO and even rebranding with a new name 
The good news  VEREIT has played by the rules since adopting the new moniker in 2015  The bad news  Operational and stock performance alike haven t set the world on fire 
VER shares are only a few basis points better than breakeven for the past three years  and while it s up about 23  on a total return basis  thank you  dividends    that s still less than half what the S P 500 would ve given you over that same time period 
Most recently  VEREIT delivered a net loss of about  92 million for 2018  let its debt tick up slightly higher to  6 1 billion  and saw its adjusted funds from operations shrink from 74 cents per share to 71 9 cents  Moreover  the company still has a 5  plus exposure to struggling  sub investment grade Red Lobster  which doesn t give me the warm fuzzies 
So while the company s shares aren t grossly overvalued at 11 times adjusted funds from operations  FFO  a key profitability metric for REITs   they are awfully expensive for a company that has offered mostly downside for years and hasn t touched its dividend since its 2015  reinvention  ",2019-03-08,Brett Owens,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-dividend-dogs-that-rallied-more-than-deserved--sell-now-200395718,200395718
119125,340640,INTU,Upland Software  UPLD  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Upland Software  UPLD   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 23 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  42 29 in the previous session  Upland Software has gained 49 1  since the start of the year compared to the 15 6  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 24 4  return for the Zacks Internet   Software industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on March 7  2019  Upland Software reported EPS of  0 58 versus consensus estimate of  0 48 
For the current fiscal year  Upland Software is expected to post earnings of  2 05 per share on  181 48 million in revenues  This represents a 20 59  change in EPS on a 21 08  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 99 per share on  200 66 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of  3 05  and 10 57   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Upland Software may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Upland Software has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 19 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 37 6X versus its peer group s average of 27 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 0 99  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Upland Software currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Upland Software meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Upland Software shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Upland Software Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Upland Software have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including MeetMe  MEET   F5 Networks  NASDAQ FFIV   and Intuit  INTU   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Upland Software  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-03-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/upland-software-upld-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200397260,200397260
119142,340657,INTU,Intuit  INTU  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Intuit  INTU  reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 21  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of TurboTax  QuickBooks and other accounting software is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  145 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 48 billion  up 26 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 2  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuit 
For Intuit  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 32  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intuit will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Intuit would post earnings of  0 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 29  delivering a surprise of  163 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Intuit doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuit-intu-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200388202,200388202

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuit 
For Intuit  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intuit will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Intuit would post earnings of  0 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 32  delivering a surprise of  39 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Intuit doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuit-intu-q1-earnings-preview-whats-in-the-cards-200358315,200358315

119194,340709,INTU,5 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio To Buy Now,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is INTU due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Intuit Q2 ResultsIntuit reported third quarter fiscal 2018 results  The company reported non GAAP income  excluding stock based compensation  amortization and other one time items  from continuing operations of  4 82 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 67  The figure also increased 24  on a year over year basis Quarter in DetailThis tax preparation related software maker reported revenues of  2 925 billion  up 15  from the year ago quarter figure  The revenue figure was better than the guided range of  2 785  2 835 billion and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 842 billion Services and Other revenues were up nearly 16 7  to  2 42 billion while product revenues increased 8 1  to  505 million Segment wise  Small Business and Self Employed Group witnessed 16  year over year growth  primarily driven by 45  subscriber growth rate for Quickbooks Online  which brought the count to 3 2 million at the end of the just reported quarter  Online ecosystem revenues surged 41   Self Employed subscribers increased to around 680 000 from 490 000 in the previous quarter and 360 000 in the year ago quarter Geographically  U S  based subscribers grew 40  to 2 5 million and international subscribers increased 66  on a year over year basis to 630 000 Notably  revenues from Consumer Group were up 15  year over year  Revenues from Strategic Partners Group were up 4  on a year to date basis Management is particularly positive about a successful tax season backed by the performance of the DIY category and higher average revenue per return  The company also managed to gain some additional share in the DIY market  Additionally  the shift in the product mix toward the higher end of the company s product line was also a positive TurboTax Live offering witnessed success in its first season and is likely to be accretive to the company s Consumer business going ahead  The recently launched Turbo offering that provides a snapshot of a user s financial health also witnessed healthy adoption  which is yet another positive for the expansion of the company s business beyond tax The company posted non GAAP operating income of  1 714 billion compared with  1 519 billion in the year ago quarter  Operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 58 6  during the quarter Intuit posted non GAAP net income from continuing operations of approximately  1 260 billion compared with third quarter fiscal 2017 net income of  1 015 billion Balance Sheet and Cash FlowIntuit exited fiscal third quarter 2018 with cash and investments of  1 936 billion compared with  726 million in the prior quarter  Long term debt was  400 million at quarter end compared with  413 million reported in the previous quarter Cash provided by operational activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was  2 149 billion  During the quarter  the company repurchased  19 million worth of shares  with  1 2 billion still remaining under the share repurchase authorization The company received an authorization to pay a dividend of 39 cents per share on Jul 18  2018 OutlookFor the fiscal fourth quarter  the company anticipates revenues in a range of  940  960 million Intuit expects fiscal fourth quarter non GAAP operating income in the range of  75  85 million  The company anticipates non GAAP earnings in the band of 22 24 cents per share The company raised its guidance for fiscal 2018  Intuit now expects revenues of  5 915  5 935 billion  representing an increase of 14 15  year over year  The previous guidance was  5 640  5 740 billion  representing an increase of 9 11  year over year Non GAAP earnings per share are now projected between  5 51 and  5 53  up 25   The previous expectation was  5 30 and  5 40 per share  up 20 22  The non GAAP tax rate used for calculating the guidance is 26 3  
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimate  There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower Intuit Inc  Price and Consensus    VGM Scores
At this time  INTU has a strong Growth Score of A and a grade with the same score on the momentum front  However  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Zacks  style scores indicate that the company s stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  Notably  INTU has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuit-intu-up-105-since-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200326789,200326789
119203,340718,INTU,Intuit  INTU  Soared To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Intuit   NASDAQ INTU    Shares have been on the move  with the stock up 8 8  over the past month  INTU hit a new 52 week high of  213 76 in the previous session  Intuit has gained 35 3  since the start of the year compared to the 9 3  move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 17 4  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 22  2018  Intuit reported EPS of  4 82 vs the Zacks Consensus of  4 67 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 91  
For the current fiscal year  Intuit is expected to post earnings of  5 53 per share on  5 93 billion in revenues  This represents a 25 4  change in EPS on a 14 51  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 52 per share on  6 51 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 17 96  and 9 88   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Intuit may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for INTU  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Intuit has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 38 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 44 9X versus its peer group s average of 25 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 38  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Intuit currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Intuit passes the test  Thus  it seems as though INTU shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Intuit Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Intuit have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Verint Systems   NASDAQ VRNT    SAP SE   NYSE SAP    and Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices

How Does Intuit Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Intuit have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Sapiens International Corporation N V    NASDAQ SPNS    Salesforce com   NYSE CRM    and CACI International   NYSE CACI    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices

119241,340756,INTU,After Hours Action    Hit The Ignore Button ,opinion,"Do you ever watch the action after hours with without money on the line  Do you get stressed out  anxious or worried that stock being taken down following an earnings report is going to hit your p l badly the next day  It happens to many of us  but that shock of a move is often on lower volume or turnover  which means there is a lack of conviction to sell 
The market is often a game of trickery and many shenanigans are witnessed  yet if you stay the course and go with what is truly happening you may not get fooled  After hours action is usually thin trade  which means fewer participants creating an il liquid market 
In these moments  especially after an earnings report prices are pushed around without much effort  the result of little pricing depth  That lack of depth is often a smokescreen and punishes those who take action trading in off hours  Often times the next trading day s  finds much better price discovery on a stock that might have shown much less activity after the markets closed the prior day 
My advice would be not to look  trust or believe the price action in the after hours or pre market  The intention is to fake out the crowd  Two weeks ago Intuit  NASDAQ INTU  reported decent earnings but the stock was pummeled after the close  down some 5  or so  The hot money removed  we now see the stock not only recovered those losses but has tacked on another 6  to close at an all time high above 202  Those who panicked and left the name and did not wait patiently would end up buying the stock much higher 
One instance last week was showing a modest price rise pre market in Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  on May 31  Volume was suspect  yet some news may have triggered some bidders in the stock 
I waited for the market to open before executing a trade  which in this case occurred about 3 minutes after the open  we bought the 1080 strike July monthly call for 34 dollars at that moment   By Friday  our call had doubled to 68 bucks  an astounding gain in one day  we took that down and rolled up to a higher strike  now we have a free trade working and cannot lose money regardless of what the stock does going forward  
While the pre market may have been a set up for this stock to move higher  it was the waiting we did for regular hours to start that gave us the push to get involved in the name ",2018-06-04,Bob Lang,https://www.investing.com/analysis/after-hours-action--hit-the-ignore-button-200321683,200321683

119334,340849,INTU,4 Ways To Include Blockchain In Your Portfolio Withou Buying Bitcoin,opinion,"Bitcoin has delivered super impressive price returns that would make even the best traders and investors green with envy  In the year to date period  anybody with a basic understanding of what Bitcoin is  and who is bold enough to purchase the cryptocurrency  would have scored about 600  price gains 
In contrast  the top traders and investors on Wall Street are still busy themselves with how to outperform the measly low end double digit gains that Wall Street has delivered in the year to date period as seen in the chart below 

If you have bought Bitcoin on January 2nd 2017 and you didn t sell until today  your investment would have gained about 1 100  as seen in the NYSE Bitcoin index  In contrast  if you had put your money in traditional Wall Street investments  you would have 17 95  gains from the S P 500  26 43  from NASDAQ  and 22 80  gains from the Dow Jones Industrials 
However  despite the obvious gains in Bitcoin  many Wall Street financial advisers will preach against making Bitcoin investments because of the huge volatility that the cryptocurrency experiences  Honestly  Bitcoin does suffer huge price volatility 
In November  the cryptocurrency made a new all time high of  7 721 98 and then it crashed all the way down to  5616 69 in about 3 days  The cryptocurrency went on to cross the  10 000 barrier and it is trading in a range above  11 000 per BTC as seen in the chart below 

It is rational to be somewhat scared about the inherent volatility of Bitcoin  Nonetheless  the volatility in Bitcoin is an opportunity for bold investors to profit on the rising popularity of blockchain technology 
If you re interested in making profits off blockchain solutions without necessarily buying Bitcoin  below are four companies that should get the attention of your due diligence 
BTCS Inc   OTC BTCS 

BTCS Inc  previously known as Bitcoin Shop Inc works on creating e commerce platforms where people can use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to purchase goods and services 
BTCS Inc is currently beta testing an e commerce marketplace that accepts a wide range of cryptocurrencies as part of efforts to drive the mass market adoption of cryptocurrencies for transactions  BTCS recently secured  1 million in funding  out of which  250 000 was provided as Bitcoin 
360 Blockchain Inc   SNX CODE 

360 Blockchain Inc  formerly 360 Capital Financial Services Group provides Wall Street investors with a structured approach to blockchain investments  The firm is now pivoting to provide financial services to both private and public companies planning to enter the Blockchain industry 
360 Blockchain will help blockchain firms with merchant banking  IPO consulting  business advisory  and finance advisory among other things  U S  investors can access 360 Blockchain on the OTC markets where it trades up around  0 2196 per share 
CanYa
CanYa  is another blockchain worthy of your attention  CanYa is trying to disrupt the gig economy with a blockchain solution that decentralizes projects with smart contracts  In May  the results of a market research by Intuit  NASDAQ INTU  revealed that  The gig economy   is now estimated to be about 34  of the workforce and expected to be 43  by the year 2020   In another report  researchers at McKinsey observed that there are  in the U S  alone 
CanYa also goes a step further to hedge cryptocurrency transactions on its platform against potential fluctuations in the price of the underlying cryptocurrency used in the dead 
One of the reasons most people are buying cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin for speculation instead of using it as a means of exchange as money is the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrencies 
With CanYa s cryptocurrency hedging escrow contract  CanYa helps freelancers and clients use cryptocurrency easily by providing a consistent value for contracts  CanYa s CAN token serves as a tool to automatically create a hedged smart contract to lock in the value of the agreed upon price 
CanYa will also further help stakeholders in a global gig economy explore opportunities beyond their borders by helping them to bypass the volatility of their currencies and avoid currency exchange commissions 
CanYa is not a publicly traded company but it will soon open up its doors to investors in a public coin sale that will be conducted over four stages 
First BITCoin Capital Corp   OTC BITCF 

First  Bitcoin Capital provides another opportunity to enter the blockchain industry  especially for people who want a venture capital type of exposure to the blockchain industry  First Bitcoin Capital busies itself with the acquisition of Bitcoin startups  and it provides funding to startups creating blockchain hardware and software 
The firm also has a number of blockchain products in the pipeline  The firm is specifically working on products such as CoinQX  Bitessentials  BitClassTravel  Bitcoin cc   Bitcoin ATM among others

119370,340885,INTU,Top Stock Reports For Johnson   Johnson  Schlumberger   PayPal ,opinion,"Tuesday  October 24  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ   Schlumberger  SLB  and PayPal  PYPL   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated Johnson   Johnson s shares have gained  27 1  in the year to date period  compared with the  23 5  gain of the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  J J beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the third quarter and raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook  
As indicated last quarter  J J s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter backed by higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment and positive contribution from the Actelion deal  Though quite a few key products in J J s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition  the Zacks analyst thinks new products in all segments  label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions   mainly Actelion   can support top line growth 
Meanwhile  share buybacks and the restructuring initiative should provide bottom line support  However  headwinds like generics  pricing pressure  sluggish growth in the Consumer segment and soft global market conditions remain 
 You can  
Shares of Schlumberger have lost 24 7  year to date  following the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry s 30 3  decline  However  this compares unfavorably with rival Halliburton s 21 0  decline  The company s third quarter 2017 earnings were in line with expectations  Also  the bottom line improved from the year earlier adjusted profit  
Growing hydraulic fracturing work in the North American land market primarily supported the bottom line  Schlumberger is also expected to generate significant cashflow from the Palliser Block project where the company will assist Torxen Energy in setting up more than 1 600 oil wells  
However  since 2015  Schlumberger s long term debt load has increased considerably  Moreover  the company s cash balance has been declining over the last seven quarters  reflecting significant balance sheet weakness 
 You can  
Strong Buy rated PayPal s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet Software industry in the year to date period   76 9  vs   25 4    The company delivered strong third quarter 2017 results  surpassing expectations on both counts  The results were driven by continued strong performance in global payments  both online and mobile  Currently  the company is riding high on partnerships and mobile centrism  
The Zacks analyst likes PayPal s ongoing strategic partnerships with Visa and MasterCard since they offer great flexibility and choice to consumers  Partnerships with Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Pinterest  Alibaba  NYSE BABA   Intuit  NASDAQ INTU  and other major retailers and financial institutions are also delivering positive results  However  continuous exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks are concerns

Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies
It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively 
And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation

5 Top Stocks with Powerful Relative Price Strength 

	Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average 

	If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong 

	It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning 

	Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy 

	Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains

119454,340969,INTU,Looking For A Top Momentum Stock  3 Reasons Why Intuit  INTU  Is A Great Choice ,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Intuit  Inc    NASDAQ INTU   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for INTU s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for IntuitA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 7 8  compared to an industry average of  0 5   INTU is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for IntuitWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of INTU  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 24 7  to  7 1  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 90 5   Clearly  INTU is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors   Intuit Inc  Price   INTU Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with INTU as of late too Over the past two months  one earnings estimate has gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that one estimate has moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as a month ago INTU was expected to post earnings of  3 43 per share for the full year  though today it looks to have an EPS of  3 54 for the full year  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have INTU as a security with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of  B   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep INTU on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like to peek behind the curtain today and view them Starting now  for the next month  I invite you to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum   from stocks under  10 to ETF to option movers   from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ,2017-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-a-top-momentum-stock-3-reasons-why-intuit-(intu)-is-a-great-choice-200196588,200196588

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Looking for Firms with Solid Earnings Growth  5 Top Buys 

	Whether it is a fledgling company or a renowned corporation  unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for the top brass of any organization  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t last over the long haul  Consider a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you have earnings 

	This metric is also considered the most significant variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a vital role in determining share price movement 

Earnings Estimates Determine Share Prices

	We have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations 

	Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm 

	Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we added the following parameters 

Zacks Rank equal to 2   Only Zacks   Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off   You can see

  Change EPS F 0  F  1  greater than or equal to 5   Companies that witnessed year over year earnings growth rate of 5  or more in the last reported fiscal

  Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero   Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week  

  Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero   Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks

119511,341026,INTU,Adobe s Rosy Outlook Appears Fully Priced Into Shares,opinion,"Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE  is expected to report earnings on Thursday after the market closes  The company s shares last traded at  106 15 as of Tuesday  approximately 96  of its 52 week high and 104  of its 200 day moving average 
Finbox io fair value data implies that the stock is currently 10  overvalued 
Historical Performance
Adobe s growth over the last five years looks unattractive when compared to its publicly traded peer group  Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM   Intuit Inc  NASDAQ INTU   Citrix Systems Inc  NASDAQ CTXS  and Nuance Communications Inc  NASDAQ NUAN   The company s 5 year revenue CAGR  5    EBITDA CAGR of   1   and net income CAGR   4   are all below its respective peers 
Efficiency Ratios
Furthermore  Adobe s LTM return on equity  of 14   return on assets  of 8  and return on invested capital  of 9  are also below the group averages of 32   9  and 13   respectively 
Price to Earnings And EBITDA Multiples
Despite the company s below average financial performance  ADBE shares trade at premium multiples on price to earnings and Enterprise Value to EBITDA 
The company s high multiples can be attributed to the future growth the market is expecting over the next several years as Adobe continues to migrate to the cloud  However  the regularly changing nature of the software industry makes this growth risky but investors seem to have fully priced in the optimistic outlook 
Finbox io s fair value estimate is derived from future free cash flows as projected by Wall Street analysts  Applying these projections in various DCF models and comparable company analyses concludes a fair value of approximately  96 00

119512,341027,INTU,Best Tech Companies To Invest In,opinion,"There is no doubt that technology companies are some of the fastest growing on the S P  However  they also tend to be the most expensive on a PE basis  There is also concern about how the policies of President Trump will impact on the sector  However  one would ask if it was possible to select companies that may not be the most glamorous yet have the most prospects for growth  In this article we will delve into some tech companies that have been overlooked but have the most scope for growth in 2017  as well as returns on your portfolio  
Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP 
This  founded in Israel in the 1990s tends to be quite shareholder friendly and is trading on a relatively low P E ratio of 25  This company also operates in one of the most relevant Technology sub sectors  namely information security  Given the amount of cyber threats that presented themselves last year  firms that offer clients protection from hackers are in more demand currently  Checkpoint more specifically focuses on network and data security using a number of tools including firewalls etc 
Their first quarter results no doubt caught investors off guard as the stock rallied by over 7  on the announcement  This is mainly because of the 21  increase in EPS  This was caused by effective cost cutting initiatives which translated into better bottom line figures  Another positive announcement by the CEO was the drive to increase subscriptions and hence incurring and stable revenues 
SAP  NYSE SAP 
When it comes to an essential part of a company s operations  Enterprise Resource Planning  ERP  is essential to that  One of the most established names in ERP software is SAP  ERP is fundamental to companies as it manages HR  payroll  Supply chains etc  Given that so many companies use SAP  it is no surprise that they will continue to use it for the foreseeable future  SAP software benefits from the  lock in  effect  Essentially  once a company has integrated the software into their systems  they are extremely reluctant to change 
This mainly comes down to the costs of changing from retraining staff to replacing other compatible software  However  SAP is not just relying on its powerful existing customer base but is also trying to expand into new technologies such as Cloud Computing  They recently completed purchases of companies including Concur and Ariba which operate in this industry  One can be certain of heavy cash flow generation from the core operations which were up nearly 12  in Q3 of 2016 on the previous year  This will no doubt provide a lot of firepower for the company to invest in other areas such as R D and acquisitions 
Tech Financials
Tech Financials is another company out of Israel that recently listed on the London Stock Exchange  They provide technology and platform solutions to  and brokers  They are already used by a number of top brokers in the industry  Although the share price has had quite a tough time  this appears to have been arrested and it had quite a rally last year 
The company is now fully profitable and at an attractive discount  If one were to compare this to a competitor such as Plus500  the price seems like a bargain at a 5x EV EBITDA ratio  Although there was a slowdown in trading revenue in Europe due to increased regulation  a new partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald will mean that the company has more growth opportunities in the U S 
Intuit Inc  NASDAQ INTU 
For a small business person or self employed individuals  taxes and accounting can be some of the most time consuming and involved processes  This is where Intuit enters the picture  They have two companies which are at the forefront of these markets  namely QuickBooks and TurboTax  What is most interesting about these companies is the size of the operating margins that they are able to generate  QuickBooks had revenue of  2 3bn in the previous financial year with operating income of  874m  However  the TurboTax franchise was able to generate operating income of  1 3bn on  2bn of Revenue 
There is also more growth on the horizon for both of these companies because of two very important developments  The first is a  American Express to integrate the QuickBooks system into that of AMEX s  This means that it will be easier for users of QuickBooks to get loans directly online  Another important development for TurboTax is the growth of self employed individuals in the U S  This is mainly as a result of the new providers in the  sharing economy   These include drivers for companies such as Lyft and Uber and landlords who provide accommodation through AirBnB 
Shopify  NYSE SHOP 
Shopify is an Ecommerce platform coming out of Canada that is already quite well known among online entrepreneurs  What it essentially provides is the opportunity for individuals to set up online stores that are hosted by Shopify  These users can then customize their online store with a number of different plugins and themes  The Shopify platform is also well optimised for use on mobile devices such as phones and tablets  They charge a subscription income for the hosting and payment processing and they currently have over 350k subscribers on the platform 
What is even more of a vote of confidence in Shopify was the announcement by Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  that they would be partnering with Shopify by rolling out Amazon payments on the platform  Moreover  Shopify seems like it still has a lot of growth ahead of it given the number of entrepreneurs who are yet to expand and run their own online stores  46 Million by Shopify s estimates   Although the company is currently making losses on the bottom line the top line growth is the key number to watch  As a relatively new tech company  capturing the market with customer growth is essential to securing dominance in the future ",2017-02-08,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-tech-companies-to-invest-in-200175037,200175037

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  116 million  The year over over increase was driven by the addition of new clients and product development initiatives coupled with better than expected performance from Paycom s single database architecture Moreover  revenues were impacted positively by a 32 6  increase in recurring revenues and 30 4  incresae in implementation and other revenues on a year over year basis The company s adjusted gross margin  including stock based compensation  declined 107 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 85 6   primarily due to higher cost of sale Paycom Software s adjusted operating margin  including stock based compensation  increased from 31 8  reported in the year ago quarter to 32 3   primarily due to lower operating expenses

both the top and the bottom line increased on a year over year basis Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud based

119540,341055,INTU,Market Is Undervaluing Cisco By Over 30 ,opinion,"While earnings season is coming to a close  there s still some notable companies expected to report earnings this week including Home Depot  NYSE HD   Wal Mart Stores  NYSE WMT   Intuit  NASDAQ INTU   and Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  
Using finbox io s  data  which provides a quick sanity check on a company s fundamental value  I screened companies expected to report earnings this week to find stocks that may be trading off their intrinsic value prior to earnings  The results showed that Cisco was one of the most undervalued of these companies 
Cisco s fair value estimate 

The fair value estimate above implies that Cisco is currently 15  undervalued  However  notice how the discounted cash flow  DCF  models show even more upside which is the real story here 
Using multiple valuation methodologies can help triangulate a stock s fair value but some may be more relevant for a given company  Understanding leverage trends will help determine which valuation approach should be more heavily relied upon  Take Cisco for example 

Over the last ten years  Cisco s debt to equity ratio has steadily increased from 20  to 45   Because of this leverage fluctuation  a DCF analysis is the most reliable valuation approach  The main reason for this is because projecting debt payments becomes too difficult  Additional detail on this can be found  

View full DCF analysis  
The DCF analysis above concludes that Cisco has over 30  upside when using consensus Wall Street projections for the 5 year forecast period  The valuation model then applies a 2 5  perpetuity growth rate after the 5 year forecast to calculate a terminal value 
Further analysis of this growth rate offers additional insight on how the market seems to be severely discounting Cisco 

The perpetuity growth rate used in such analysis is typically between the historical inflation rate of 2 3  and the historical GDP growth rate of 4 5   However  inputting a negative  2 5   growth rate results in a fair value of approximately  30 per share  not too far off Cisco s current trading price  This implies that the market is actually expecting Cisco s cash flows to decline forever  A negative growth rate seems unreasonable especially when comparing the company s positive 5 6  EBITDA CAGR over the last 5 years 
While Cisco does face stiff competition from smaller players like Arista Networks  NYSE ANET   it is still the world s largest supplier of high performance computer networking systems  It is unlikely the company becomes irrelevant over the next several years which is why value investors may want to take a closer look at CSCO prior to reporting earnings Wednesday  Shares could easily trade close to  40 over the next 6 12 months ",2016-11-15,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-is-undervaluing-cisco-by-over-30-200164779,200164779

Key Takeaways

The Estimize consensus is calling for flat earnings on  738 57 million in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
Intuit has seen steady growth in recent quarters from greater adoption of its cloud computing software
Intuit is putting a greater focus on its QuickBooks brand to carry growth in the long term

Intuit is prepared to cap off its fiscal 2016 when it reports fourth quarter earnings tomorrow afternoon  With tax season now behind us  expect a significant drop off from the prior quarter  The company generates a majority of its sales during the quarter which includes tax season and the turn of most fiscal calendars  That doesn t mean this quarter will be a complete flop  In fact  expectations are shaping up quite nicely for Intuit s report tomorrow 
Analysts at Estimize are calling for flat earnings  94  higher than the same period last year  That estimate has been revised down 4  since Intuit last reported in may  Revenue for the period is estimated to increase 6  to  738 57 million  Shares are up nearly 17  year to date but historically remain flat after an earnings report

Intuit s recent string of success has been driven by increasing demand and subscriptions for its suite of cloud computing software  Intuit has successfully transitioned away from its licensed based service towards cloud focused services  Currently  reports two core segments  small business and consumer and professional tax 
QuickBooks success continues to steer the small business segment  Last quarter total small business sales increase 12  supported by a 60  jump in Quickbooks online subscribers  Revenue from tax prep  on the other hand  grew 7  in the third quarter  The company also guided fourth quarter revenue in the range of  720 to  740 million on breakeven earnings 
Increasing adoption of cloud based services and products are expected to carry growth moving forward  Moreover a greater focus on the QuickBooks brand will likely pressure near term margins but lead to substantial long term benefits  This includes the recent launch of QuickBooks financing  similar to Square  NYSE SQ  Capital  which connects lenders and borrowers in a seamless fashion 
The biggest concerns now and in the future come from rising competition in specifically from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Soft  NYSE PAYC  and Automatic Data Processing Inc  NASDAQ ADP   From a tax perspective  H R Block  NYSE HRB  is right there with Intuit in terms of tax preparation services

119612,341127,INTU,Paycom Software  PAYC  Q2 Earnings  Will It Surprise ,opinion,"Paycom Software  Inc    NYSE PAYC   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 2  2016  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 55   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Paycom Software reported better than expected first quarter 2016 results  with its top and bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company also provided an encouraging second quarter and full year 2016 revenue guidance  Also  year over year comparisons on both counts were favorable 
Revenue growth was steady  positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and greater traction in cloud based offerings  Better than expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions during the reported quarter were the other positives 
We believe that the higher adoption of Paycom Software s Affordable Care Act   ACA   dashboard application that tracks employee count  employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind for the company  Also  the cross selling of newer products to the existing client base is expected to boost revenues 
Nevertheless  competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corp    NASDAQ PCTY    Intuit Inc  NASDAQ INTU   and Paychex  NASDAQ PAYX   Inc  remains a headwind PAYCOM SOFTWARE Price and EPS Surprise
    
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paycom Software is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the upcoming release  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Paycom Software is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 13 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  Paycom Software has a Zacks Rank  3  Though Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies  which are worth considering  as our model shows that they have the right combination of the two key elements

Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 246 billion as well  On a year over year basis too  revenues were up 7 9  mainly on the back of the company s ongoing transformation into a global cloud company and higher demand resulting from the U S  tax season Services and Other revenues climbed nearly 9  to  1 845 billion while product revenues were up 3 8  to  459 million Segment wise  Small Business Group

gross margin contracted 10 basis points  bps  to 90 8  The company reported a 2 6  year over year increase in adjusted operating expenses  However  as a percentage of revenues  adjusted operating

also issued an encouraging guidance for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year Moreover  we are positive about Intuit s growing SMB exposure and believe that its strategic acquisitions will boost the segment  Increased adoption of its cloud based services and products is another positive Intuit has also restructured its business to focus on the QuickBooks services  It expects to continue investing in this portfolio  which is likely to hurt its near term profitability Moreover  rising competition from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Software Inc    NYSE PAYC   and Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   is a concern  especially considering the seasonality of Intuit s tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty Currently  Intuit has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Another

119707,341222,INTU,Intuit Small Business Index  A First Look,opinion,"Here we introduce the   SBI  which measures employment in firms with fewer than 20 employees with data going back to 2007  The real time data comes directly from Intuit  NASDAQ INTU  software  not from surveys  and is the only source of monthly data on small business revenues  expenses  and payroll data  It allows for a much earlier read on the health of small businesses 
Here is an excerpt from Intuit s overview of the index 

The goal of the Intuit Small Business Employment index is to provide a forecast of the current level of employment for firms with fewer than 20 employees that BLS will report when it next releases the BED data  To construct this forecast  we use a combination of data from Intuit s small business payroll service customers  data from BLS on payroll employment  from the establishment survey  and self employment  from the household survey   The forecast model measures the relationship between past BLS levels of employment for small firms to total payroll employment  private payroll employment  construction payroll employment  self employment  plus an index of employment built from data from Intuit Online Payroll customers 

These small businesses  less than 20 employees  make up 87 percent of the total U S  private employer base  which is almost 21 million people  The SBI represents 5 percent of this nationwide category 
Intuit has created an index based on the  with 100 equaling January 2007  We have used that series for our charts with recessions highlighted  The current index comes in at 97 6 

As you ll notice  the SBI began trending downward in March of 2007  before the downturn in 2008  while the national employment numbers did not start declining until after the recession start  These both have a trough  but the SBI downturn begins much sooner 
For comparison  let s look at the ADP Small Business Report  which measures private sector business employment using client payroll data and is a subset of the ADP National Employment Report  The primary difference between the SBI and ADP are the categorizations of small businesses  ADP includes in their index small businesses such as singular franchise stores that are part of a larger business  whereas the SBI uses only independent business with less than 20 employees  The ADP index tends to be more optimistic than SBI due to this fact 
Here is the ADP Small Business Report along with  and its 12 month MA  The  collects data on small businesses and calculates an Optimism Index to gauge small business sentiment with data going back to 1986 using surveys  We have indexed both the ADP and NFIB to January 2007   100 for comparison to the Intuit Small Business Index  Note that the latest ADP and NFIB data are released after the SBI data is out  We will be updating this article again after these data are released 

The NFIB is much more volatile an indicator than the other small business indexes  most likely because it is a sentiment index   an opinion indicator   and is measured slightly differently than the other two ",2015-09-02,Doug Short,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuit-small-business-index:-a-first-look-263734,263734

119737,341252,INTU,CyberSecurity Fears  Stocks In Focus,opinion,"According to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   2 7 million taxpayers were victims of identity theft in 2014  These fresh revelations have brought cybersecurity into the spotlight once again  John Koskinen  the IRS Commissioner has said the agency is increasing its efforts to improve the tax filing system by next year 
Massive Security Breach
Koskinen made these revelations while speaking before the Senate Finance Committee  The agency has decided to collaborate with companies dealing with tax software as well as state governments to thwart the efforts of hackers who attempt to make away with people s tax returns 
The IRS commissioner was replying to questions about how hackers managed to gain access to 104 000 tax forms using the IRS website  This data leak was due to a service known as  Get Transcript   This provides access to tax forms of past years  information essential when applying for financial aid to a college or a mortgage 
This was used by unknown hackers to gain access to personal data  Pretending to be genuine taxpayers  they attempted to download 200 000 forms during the Feb May period  Ultimately  they managed to steal around half that number 
Hackers Target Refunds  Personal Data
Approximately 13 000 of these forms were used to made false tax refunds  But Koskinen believes worse may be in store  He says that the real objective of these criminals was to steal personal data  This is because the Get Transcript service can only be accessed by utilizing personal data stolen previously 
This includes addresses  birthdays and Social Security numbers  Access to the service also requires users to answer stringent questions to verify identity  This means that the fraudsters already had access to such sensitive personal information  Such data can be utilized to secure credit lines  open bank accounts and steal even more tax refunds going forward 
As of now  the Get Transcript service has been disabled as a temporary measure  With 23 million downloads over the last few months  Get Transcript is a popular service  The IRS is trying to make the app more secure  while trying to make it as user friendly as possible at the same time 
Budget Cuts and System Upgrades
Treasury Inspector General J  Russell George said the IRS failed to implement a number of suggested security upgrades to fend off such security breaches  Both Koskinen and George  however  agreed that these fraudsters were part of a global crime syndicate  The latest attack has resulted in a loss of  39 million for the IRS 
Koskinen said that reductions in budgets have acted as a major obstacle for improving cybersecurity  Funds on this front have been reduced from  187 million in 2011 to  149 million for the current fiscal year  Congress has reduced the IRS budget by  1 billion compared to 2010 levels to  10 9 billion for the current year 
Partnering with States  Industry
The IRS commissioner said he held a meeting with tax officials at the state levels and chiefs of established tax software and related companies three months ago  These probably included the likes of H R Block  NYSE HRB  and Intuit  NASDAQ INTU   These stakeholders have agreed to enter into a partnership focusing on the next tax filings period  Officials and companies will share data and boost security in an effort to thwart similar threats 
According to IRS estimates   5 8 billion was lost through falsified returns in 2013  At the same time  nearly four times of that amount was saved by thwarting similar attempts  Koskinen said refund fraud jumped during 2010 and 2012  Since then  things have gone from bad to worse  According to the IRS  the agency has prevented fraud attempts worth  63 billion during 2011 14 
Stocks in Focus
Apart from Intuit and H R Block  companies in the cybersecurity sphere will gain from such episodes  This is due to the focus on the Senate hearing on the IRS breach  Assurances from the agency that security will be stepped up have helped the sector as well 
After the end of Wednesday s trading session  Fireeye Inc  NASDAQ FEYE  said it had entered into a partnership with Visa Inc  NYSE V   This is aimed at offering a threat intelligence service to those merchants tied to Visa as well as related card issuers 
Prominent security technology winners of the day included the likes of VASCO Data Security International  NASDAQ VDSI  and The KEYW Holding Corporation  NASDAQ KEYW   which gained 5 4  and 7 6   respectively  Proofpoint Inc  NASDAQ PFPT   Avg Technologie  NYSE AVG   Qualys Inc  NASDAQ QLYS  and Imperva Inc  NYSE IMPV  moved up 2 9   3 5   3 8  and 3 3   respectively 
In Conclusion
Koskinen has said the incident proves that such fraudsters have stepped up attempts to gain access to personal data  He underlined their proficiency with data analytics and their ability to answer personal questions  This lays special emphasis on the importance of cybersecurity  Related companies are expected to grow in prominence and make further gains in the days ahead ",2015-06-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/irs-breach-raises-cybersecurity-fears:-stocks-in-focus-254060,254060
119738,341253,INTU,Bulls May Be Getting Ready To Push Stocks Higher,opinion,"After a brief pullback to retest support levels  it appears that bulls may be preparing to take the market higher  Although retail investors are still hesitant  risk taking among institutions is apparent  Cheap cash from abundant global liquidity is hungry for higher returns  Margin debt is high  Credit spreads are low  Subprime loans are back in vogue  Small caps and the banking sector in particular look ready to resume a leadership role 
Market overview 
After last week s strong jobs report  coming in 25  above expectations   Treasury yields spiked  the dollar strengthened  and dividend stocks took a hit while growth stocks held up  particularly the NASDAQ  mid caps  and small caps  Market commentators of course have expressed a wide range of views ranging from cautious optimism to outright collapse  For example  Goldman Sachs s chief U S  equity strategist David Kostin just announced a prediction that the S P 500 will finish the year around current levels as the market simply treads water and relies upon dividends for further returns 
Some of the dominant concerns include the fact that total margin debt is at record levels  hitting  507 billion in mid April  and while the major indexes have been hitting record highs  breadth is narrow  NYSE Composite has not challenged its high   GDP growth has shrunk  unit labor costs have surged  and corporate profits have struggled 
Of course  the strong dollar has been blamed as a prime culprit for hindering profits  However  the U S  economy overall has enjoyed a net benefit from the strong dollar  with low oil and gasoline prices  affordable imports and overseas travel  and foreign investors flocking to the safety  yield  and bullish trend of the dollar  Nevertheless  although companies appear to be doing some hiring  they continue to be reluctant to make much in the way of new capital investment in PP E 
As a result  95  of profits at S P 500 stocks last year were used for stock buybacks or dividends  In April   133 billion of new stock buyback programs were announced  the highest level ever for a single month  In fact  buybacks have been the biggest source of accumulation  At the current rate  the overall market is on track to hit over  1 trillion in buybacks 
We keep hearing that it has been three years since the market pulled back at least 10   and although investors are worried that any of a variety of potential triggers could start a massive correction  stocks continue to hold up pretty well    even though the former resistance turned support thresholds of Dow at 18 000 and S P 500 at 2100 failed as support  Learned observers insist that we desperately need a 10  correction soon in order to stave off a 20  debacle later  But few traders are willing to let it happen in this low volatility environment  The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 14 21  and the 15 threshold has held as resistance 
The 10 Year Treasury yield closed Friday at 2 40   This is a 7 month high and represents a breakthrough of resistance from the December high and 200 day moving average  Greece s decision to delay an IMF payment weighed on bullish sentiment  and the IMF urged the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates until 2016  And with the Fed conceding that economic growth is progressing more slowly than expected  that is a distinct possibility 
Worth noting are falling sector correlations  ConvergEx reported that average sector correlations to the S P 500 has fallen to below 80   which gives portfolio managers a better shot at outperforming an index  while also allowing for effective asset allocation 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 209 77  displaying a spinning top  or doji  candlestick pattern that reflects uncertainty about direction  It broke below its 50 day simple moving average on Friday  but I usually like to see a second day of confirmation before pronouncing an official break  and Monday appears to be providing it   But with plenty of solid support nearby  it could be setting up as a good launch point for the next bullish move 
The long standing uptrend line has been providing reliable support for quite a while  and it is now around 209  As I said two weeks ago when SPY made a tepid breakout above resistance at 212  oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic had all either flattened out or were pointing down bearishly  And indeed a pullback has occurred  But now the oscillators have worked off most of their overbought conditions and could reverse soon  Next major support is at the convergence of the uptrend line and 100 day SMA  around 209   and the critical 200 day SMA  near 205   followed by earlier in year support at 204  then round number support at the 200 price level  But I think the uptrend line will hold  even if there is a temporary breach  

As for the Russell 2000 small caps  the index formed a bullish engulfing pattern on Friday and might be ready to lead the overall market higher  In addition  the VIX formed a bearish engulfing pattern on Friday  which is bullish for stocks  On the bearish side  the iShares Transportation Average  ARCA IYT  got a little bounce last week but has a lot of work to break that series of which was displaying a series of lower highs and lower lows since November 
Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF   iShares US Technology  NYSE IYW   iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ   iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH   iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   iShares US Energy  NYSE IYE   iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
 Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Financial again takes first place with a strong Outlook score of 92  Financial displays the lowest  i e   best  forward P E  and good sell side analyst sentiment  forward long term growth rate  and insider sentiment  buying activity   Technology has moved back up to take second place with a score of 91  primarily due to the best Wall Street sentiment  the best return ratios  and solid insider sentiment  Utilities falls to third this week 
2  Telecom stays in the cellar with a feeble Outlook score of 4  Other than a strong forward long term growth rate  the sector scores poorly in most factors in the model  and in fact  stocks within Telecom continue to be hit the hardest by net downward revisions to Wall Street earnings estimates  Energy remains in the bottom two with a score of 10  Even though the sell side community has eased up on the cuts to forward estimates  it still reflects a flat forward long term growth rate and poor return ratios 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Technology displays the top score of 67  Energy shows the lowest Bull score of 47  which is the only one below 50  The top bottom spread is 20 points  reflecting low sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  So this is good 
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  displays the highest  i e   best  score of 52  followed by Financial and Materials  which means that stocks within these sectors have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Technology scores the lowest at 43  The top bottom spread is about 9 points  which reflects elevated sector correlations on particularly weak market days  i e   broad risk off selling   Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Technology displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed closely by Financial  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Technology is the best  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Energy is the worst 
6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings are still mostly neutral  but are actually starting to move in a bullish direction with Financial and Technology looking quite solid and all weather Healthcare holding up well  On the other hand  Utilities and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  remain in the top five  while Industrial and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  are in the bottom five  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   retains its bullish bias and suggests holding Technology  Financial  and Healthcare  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages   Because SPY is right on reliable support levels  despite closing below its 50 day SMA   I am maintaining a bullish bias for the moment 
Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Technology  Financial  and Healthcare sectors include iShares Global Tech  NYSE IXN   PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio  NYSE KBWB   Market Vectors Pharmaceutical  NYSE PPH  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Technology  Financial  and Healthcare sectors include Intuit  NASDAQ INTU   Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   East West Bancorp Inc  NASDAQ EWBC    Voya Financial Inc  NYSE VOYA   Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   and Zoetis Inc  NYSE ZTS   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm 
If you prefer to maintain a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Financial  Technology  and Utilities  in that order  But if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Financial  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Basic Materials  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

119767,341282,INTU,U S  ISM  A Sign Of Things To Come ,opinion,Manufacturing activity contracted in June  according to the Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing index  For the first time since July 2009  the ISM Index slipped under 50  dropping to 49 7 last month  A reading below 50 indicates a manufacturing sector that s in contraction Is this an early warning of a new recession  Perhaps  but we re still a long way from declaring the current growth phase of the business cycle dead  Like any one economic indicator  the ISM Index is far from flawless when it comes to using it as a benchmark for anticipating major turning points in the economy  To be precise  a below 50 reading for this indicator doesn t always correspond with recession  The history of this index is littered with periods when below 50 levels didn t equate with a new downturn in the broad economy Sometimes A Dip s Just A DipThen again  it s also clear that every recession in the post World War II era has been accompanied by sub 50 readings in the ISM index  Sometimes a dip is relevant  sometimes not  It s too soon to say if today s today is an early warning or another false signal  Nonetheless  it s hard to overlook the latest reading for new orders  which tumbled sharply last month relative to May  On the other hand  manufacturing employment is holding steady What we know for sure is that the key economic indicators for May the most recent full set of monthly numbers published so far are trending positive  Fourteen crucial leading and coincident indicators through May tell us that recession risk was quite low Will June tell us differently  Today s ISM report certainly implies that incoming data will be weaker relative to May  But forecasting and reading the numbers in hand are two different tasks  For the moment  growth rolls on  based on a broad set of numbers  We may suffer an attitude adjustment in the weeks ahead  but for now a darker future is still the stuff of speculation Riding Europe s And China s Coattails  Clearly  today s ISM report  is the biggest sign yet that the U S  is catching the slowdown that is well underway in Europe and China   writes Paul Dales  senior U S  economist at Capital Economics  in a note to clients  according to MarketWatch   But it is worth remembering that a reading of below 47 0 is required to be consistent with another recession  This means the index is still consistent with a growing economy  albeit at an annualized rate of a little below 1   If June proves to be a turning point for bigger problems  we may find stronger evidence in the government s employment report scheduled for release this Friday  June 6   At the moment  the consensus forecast still calls modest improvement for June vs  May  Private sector jobs are expected to rise by a net 105 000  up from May s sluggish 82 000 gain  according to Briefing com One reason to think optimistically is today s encouraging news on employment growth last month in small businesses via the Intuit Small Business Employment Index  According to a press release The employment index shows that employment increased by 0 3 percent in June  for an annualized rate of 4 1 percent    the strongest rate of growth that small businesses have seen in the past three months  This equates to approximately 70 000 new jobs created  although Intuit is recalibrating the index and expects these numbers to change Let s see if the broad national report on employment confirms the trend    or not ,2012-07-02,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-ism:-a-sign-of-things-to-come-128348,128348

119769,341284,INTU,Why The Oil Industry Doesn t Want You To Remember The Last 14 Years,opinion,This is the first of a six part series introducing readers of The Christian Science Monitor to concepts useful in understanding the Resource Insights blog  Selected posts from Resource Insights will begin to appear on the Monitor s Energy Voices blog starting this month  What were the prices of oil and gasoline in 1998  Do you remember  Without looking them up  or looking below this line   make your best guess  I ve been taking an informal poll to find out what people remember about oil and gasoline prices in that year  So far  only one person has correctly characterized prices back then  Most guesses have clustered around  2 50 to  3 a gallon for gasoline  in the United States   Only one person could come up with a crude oil price which she guessed was around  55 a barrel  The answers show a vague recollection that oil and gasoline were cheaper than they are today  But just how much cheaper has been lost down the memory hole  Okay  I know the suspense is killing you  Here s how gasoline and oil fared in 1998  The  in the United States in December of that year was 95 cents  sold on the New York Mercantile Exchange on December 31 was  12 05  Just three weeks earlier the price of oil had hit its nadir for the year at  10 72  Oil had started the year above  17 and steadily slid as the Asian financial crisis slowed the world economy and reduced oil demand  Gasoline prices dropped only a little during the year starting from the January average of  1 09 a gallon  Why does the oil industry want you to forget this  Because after a 10 fold increase in the price of crude oil and a fourfold increase in the price of gasoline  the industry is once again trying to sell the same that they were selling back in the late 1990s  But the manyfold increase in oil prices ought to make everyone doubt an industry which has repeatedly told us that huge supplies are just around the corner  and prices are headed for a crash  Perhaps the best example of the oil industry s  Wrong Way Corrigans  is industry mouthpiece Daniel Yergin  head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates  CERA   a prominent energy consulting firm  For a long time Yergin has been a frequent guest on prominent television news programs and a source for many print journalists  He is a darling of the media on energy issues  a media which is too polite to confront him with  in the oil market  He was wrong in his public pronouncements every step of the way from the 1998 low in oil prices right up to the all time highs of 2008  frequently predicting a large buildup of new supply and crashing prices   One wonders why clients of CERA continue to buy the company s research when it has been so wrong for so long  But that s a story for another time   Only at the end of 2008 did oil prices finally crash and then only because the world economy was headed into the worst economic decline since the Great Depression  But as soon as the economy revived even tepidly  prices rose back to  80 a barrel and then above  100 which is about where they are today  The reason for high prices is actually quite obvious  Crude oil  has been stuck between 71 and 76 million barrels per day since 2005  calculated on a monthly basis   Oil volumes have been tracing out a troubling bumpy plateau that many fear will mark the all time peak in world production  These numbers are reported by the U S  Energy Information Administration  the statistical arm of the U S  Department of Energy  and are widely considered to be the most reliable available  They reflect total production of  crude oil including lease condensate   which is the definition of crude oil  from all sources worldwide  Oil production has stalled despite the huge incentive that record high prices are providing for oil exploration and development  And  despite enormous spending by oil companies on exploration and drilling worldwide  we have only just kept production on a plateau for the last seven years  These high prices and enormous capital spending were the reasons given by Daniel Yergin for the expected buildup of production volumes  So what went wrong  The simple answer is that we ve exhausted the easy to get oil and are now left with mostly the hard to get oil  It only makes sense that the early oil pioneers harvested the easy oil first  Why go after the hard stuff at that point  We ve since learned how to extract oil that is much harder to develop This includes deposits far offshore and deep below the seabed as well as those locked in the Canadian Tar Sands  deposits that must undergo expensive and energy intensive processing to convert what is really bitumen  a goopy  thick hydrocarbon  into what we call oil  And  this leads me to a crucial concept which I find myself repeating over and over again in response to all the foolish Daniel Yergins of the world  The critical factor in the oil markets and a global economy dependent on large  continuous supplies of oil is the rate of production  The rate is the key  not the size of the world s reserves  not the size of the tank that matters  Let me offer another analogy to help explain  If you inherit a million dollars with the stipulation that you can only withdraw  500 a month  you may be a millionaire  but you will never live like one  That is increasingly the situation we face with oil  There may be huge resources of tight oil  often mistakenly referred to as shale oil  and of oil like substances such as tar sands  But the expense  the necessary energy and increasingly  the amount of water required to extract and process them is so great that we have been unable to lift the worldwide rate of production significantly above its current plateau for a sustained period during the last seven years  Even with all our vaunted new technology  we have only just barely been able to replace the capacity lost each year to the inexorable decline in the rate of production from existing oil fields  Recently  the head of a company well placed to judge trends in the worldwide rate of oil production said he believes that the all time peak is in  Core Laboratories CEO Dave Demshur told attendees at the Denver Oil   Gas Conference last month that   t he maximum yearly oil production of the planet is taking place now   Core provides well analysis and reservoir management to oil and gas companies in practically every major oil region of the world  Demshur s statement is an unusual admission from an industry insider with access to information that spans the entire industry  The truth is we won t know for sure that we ve passed the peak in world oil production until long after it occurs  It may be a decade after the event before oil production turns down definitively and the peak becomes obvious for all to see Just to clarify  here s what peak oil does NOT mean Peak oil does not mean we are running out of oil  This is a canard used by the oil industry to confuse the public  Nobody who understands world peak oil production ever says that it means we are running out  In fact  we won t run out of oil for a very  very long time  At the peak the rate of production will cease to rise  probably trace a plateau for a time  and finally begin a possibly slow and bumpy decline  That means we ll have less and less oil available each year  As oil becomes more and more expensive  we will use less  and we will ultimately reserve it for critical purposes for which we cannot find good oil substitutes Peak oil does not mean that we won t find any more oil  We are finding oil every day  We re just not finding enough and putting it into production fast enough to grow production in the face of declining flows from existing fields Peak oil does not mean the immediate collapse of modern civilization  However  if we stand still and do little to address oil depletion  peak oil will likely result in immense difficulties The industry and its paid spokespersons try to dazzle the public with talking points that include the notion that we have more oil reserves than we ve ever had  That is questionable  and I ll explore that claim in a later piece  But again  I emphasize that reserves are not the salient point It is and always will be the rate of production that matters more  If oil production stopped for a sufficiently long period  enough to drain all aboveground supplies  modern civilization as we know it would collapse  The amount of reserves would not matter since the rate of production would have dropped to zero  What matters is how much we can produce for continuous input into the world economy  As you might intuit  we ve built a financial system and physical infrastructure premised on continuous and rising levels of oil consumption  That s why peak oil matters so much  and why flat oil production has been a large contributing factor to the unstable world economy in recent years  To further illustrate the importance of rate  consider the following  since the beginning of the oil age has been consumed since 1985  We consumed exponentially larger amounts nearly every year until 2005 when a number of factors conspired to constrain supplies  We frequently hear about  and think  wrongly  that oil must surely be plentiful as a result  So  here s another question to ponder  How long does one billion barrels of oil last the world at current rates of consumption If you guessed something close to 12 days  you have a sense of the enormous challenges humans face in extracting finite resources at ever higher rates  Just multiply those multi billion barrel discoveries by 12 to find out how many days the oil age might be extended by each discovery  You ll find the answer is   not many   Perhaps it will seem puzzling that experts inside the industry  with a few notable exceptions  cannot grasp that the rate of production is the central issue  The best explanation I can offer is to quote author Upton Sinclair   It is difficult to get a man to understand something  when his salary depends upon his not understanding it   And  here is where we get to the motivations behind the sunny optimism of the oil industry  If the public understood that oil supplies might be nearing an irreversible decline  it would demand the deployment of alternative fuels and efficiency measures to soften the blow in order to give us time for a transition to a society based on something other than oil  That would ultimately reduce demand for oil products and eventually end our dependence on oil  Oil companies might get stuck with significant inventories in the ground that they cannot sell  at least not at the prices or in the quantities they would like  The more immediate problem for oil company executives is that their companies may soon find it impossible to replace all their oil reserves  Oil companies strive to replace at least 100 percent of what they produce so that their reserves don t fall  If investors come to believe that a failure to replace reserves will be ongoing year after year  they will mark down oil company share prices significantly    and it s likely to happen with more frequency as more companies struggle to reach 100 percent replacement  Such share price declines would  of course  make a lot of oil executives significantly poorer as the value of their stock and stock options plummet  Essentially  oil companies would be recognized as self liquidating businesses  All of this the oil industry wants you to ignore as it undertakes yet another public relations campaign to convince the world that supplies will only grow from here  Naturally  with prices near  100 a barrel  the public needs reassurance  The campaign is designed to lull both the public and policymakers into a somnolent surrender to a business as usual future that will leave us unprepared for the momentous challenges ahead  Oil is the central commodity of the modern age  As of 2011 it provided one third of the world s energy and the basis for countless petrochemicals necessary to the functioning of modern society  Oil s role in transportation remains critical   of the world s road  rail  air and sea transportation fuel is derived from petroleum  and   Good substitutes for oil in transportation are still hard to come by  No one can know exactly when world oil production will peak  not me  not the world s oil companies  not any government agency  The dangers we face if we are unprepared are potentially quite severe  With worldwide oil production essentially flat for the last seven years  the sensible thing to do would be to get ready now as quickly as we can  Given what s at stake for oil company managements  it should be obvious why they are telling us not to worry  Given the publicly available production data  the persistently high price of oil  and the failure of oil companies to expand worldwide production even after enormous expenditures and effort  it should also be obvious why we shouldn t fall for the industry s beguiling but wildly misleading tale ,2012-09-03,Kurt

119770,341285,INTU,Tar Sands  Oil Shale  And Heavy Oil,opinion,This is the third of a six part series introducing readers of The Christian Science Monitor to concepts useful in understanding the Resource Insights blog  Selected posts from Resource Insights are now appearing regularly on the Monitor s Energy Voices blog  To read the previous installments of this series click on the following     In the old days  that is before 2010  the oil industry used to regale the public with tales of plenty that revolved around what is commonly called  conventional oil   Conventional oil refers to oil in a liquid state occurring naturally and coming from a well on land or water  It s what most people think of when they think of oil  And  this category of oil is relatively easy to extract and refine using longstanding conventional techniques  The industry assured us that there was plenty of conventional oil in the Middle East  Russia and elsewhere to supply us for decades to come  Then in its 2010   the  announced that the peak in the rate of production of conventional oil had already arrived  probably in 2006  There was some good news  however  Production of so called  unconventional oil  would grow considerably over the coming decades and allow total oil production to rise  This unconventional oil includes oil derived from the Canadian tar sands  from heavy oil deposits in Venezuela and elsewhere  and from so called oil shale  It also includes oil products obtained from coal through coal to liquids technology and those obtained from natural gas using gas to liquids technology  Some people include tight oil  often mistakenly referred to as shale oil  as part of the unconventional mix  though once out of the ground it is typically refined in the same way as conventional oil  Signal qualities of unconventional oil are that it is expensive and difficult to extract and refine  This has so far meant that in most cases only high oil prices can justify its extraction  And  this means that it is going to be hard for unconventional oil to make up for the decline in the rate of conventional oil production  And  rate is the key metric  As I am obliged to remind people again and again  it is the rate of oil production which matters much more than the size of the resource  The global economy is entirely dependent on continuous flows of energy and raw materials  Oil is absolutely central because it provides one third of the world s energy and more than 80 percent of its transportation fuel  Very few things of consequence move in the world economy without the assistance of oil  When we think of conventional oil  we can picture gushers which are evidence of highly pressurized underground reservoirs that send oil to the surface without any pumping  Nowadays  blowout preventers have eliminated gushers except in the case of an accident such as the BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill  As oil is produced from a well  the pressure declines and eventually the remaining oil must be pumped to the surface  The general category for this type of oil is light sweet crude   Light  means it flows and flows quite readily   Sweet  means it contains little sulfur  and this makes it compatible with conventional refineries which are designed to process low sulfur oils   Sulfur  you may recall  is routinely removed from motor fuels to help prevent acid rain which occurs when sulfur from vehicle exhaust and other sources mixes with moisture in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid   Now  unconventional oil can be entirely different  Tar sands  for example  are a mixture of sand and bitumen  a thick  gooey hydrocarbon that is often used to make asphalt  The bitumen is separated from the sand using hot water  Essentially  the bitumen moves to the top and is skimmed off  This is obviously water intensive  but it is also energy intensive since the sands must first be mined and transported to a separation facility  Then  enormous separators filled with water heated using natural gas start the separation process  That process is repeated to get up to 90 percent of the bitumen out of the sand  But we don t yet have oil  The bitumen must be put through another energy intensive  upgrading  process that typically strips the hydrogen off natural gas molecules and makes them available to the bitumen under great pressure and heat using the proper catalysts  Finally  the sulfur must be removed  Then  and only then  do you get something that resembles what we call oil  In fact  it is referred to as syncrude  short for synthetic crude  because it is not naturally occurring and must be manufactured  As you might intuit  ramping up tar sands production has been easier said than done     Let s remember that tar sands production was projected to grow from 1 mbpd  million barrels per day  in 2006 to 2 8 mbpd in 2012  but actual production is currently just 1 6 mbpd   he wrote citing a Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers forecast from 2006  Promises of 5 mbpd by 2030 ought to be taken with a grain of salt  And  5 mbpd needs to be put in the context of a world that  is projected in 2030 to consume 108 mbpd of so called  total liquids   which include not only oil  but biofuels and natural gas plant liquids such propane and butane   I have my doubts that we will reach either 5 mbpd from tar sands production or 108 mbpd in worldwide production of liquid fuels given the difficulties of producing unconventional oil  Perhaps the most egregious exaggerations are saved for deposits of so called oil shale  I say  so called  in this case because oil shale is neither shale  nor does it contain oil  The designation was created to attract investors  Oil shale is  in fact  organic marlstone containing kerogen  a waxy hydrocarbon  Like tar sands  it must be extensively processed to yield what we call oil  Writers and analysts abound who will cite astronomical figures for oil contained in America s oil shale deposits which are found in Colorado  Wyoming and Utah  An article in  claims that there are 3 trillion barrels of oil contained in the oil shale of those three states  nearly twice the known reserves of oil worldwide  Of course  it isn t oil  it s kerogen  which the author doesn t appear to understand  The article cites testimony from a representative of the General Accountability Office  the nonpartisan research arm of the U S  Congress  The witness says half that number may be  recoverable   As I am obliged time and again to remind people  recoverable isn t the same as economically recoverable  It is possible to recover rocks from the Moon  But we would never think of transporting rocks from the Moon to the Earth to make roadway aggregates  So  just how much oil from oil shale is currently available for purchase on world markets  The answer is none  There are some pilot projects which produce small quantities for research purposes  but that is all  Here it is important to review the difference between  resources  and  reserves   The writer of the articles above refers to 3 trillion barrels of reserves  But  reserves are what can be produced at today s prices from known fields using existing technology  By that definition the oil reserves of America s oil shale fields are exactly zero  Resources  on the other hand  refer to the amount of something thought to be in the ground based on rather sketchy evidence  By that definition there is still no oil contained in America s oil shale  What s thought to be there are 3 trillion barrels of kerogen imbedded in rock  which  as I said  must go through extensive processing before it can become oil  Since the early 1980s oil companies have tried to commercialize the production of oil from this kerogen rich rock  but have so far been unsuccessful  So complex and difficult is the task of extracting and processing kerogen that the EIA has estimated that even under its high oil price scenario    That s a drop in the bucket compared to the country s projected needs of about 15 million barrels per day  Heavy oil  on the other hand  is actually being extracted in many places around the world  While the resource base for heavy oil is actually much larger than for conventional oil  typically a much lower percentage of any reservoir can be extracted  Historically  the recoveries from conventional oil reservoirs have averaged around 35 percent  The percentage for heavy oil can be as low as 5 percent though many reservoirs yield a considerably higher percentage  The point is that while people can quote large numbers for heavy oil resources  these need to be paired with an awareness that we simply cannot get nearly as great a percentage of those resources out of the ground economically as we have conventional oil  Heavy oil is what you probably imagine it to be  a highly viscous hydrocarbon rich liquid that flows only with difficulty  Though it can in some cases simply be pumped from the ground  often it is heated with steam or by other means to make it flow better  That  of course  increases the cost of extraction over conventional crude  And  heavy oil operations face a double handicap  Not only is heavy oil more expensive and difficult to extract  but it commands a lower market price than conventional crude because it is more difficult to refine  For example  Canadian Heavy Crude Oil futures contracts traded in New York sell at around a  10 to  20 discount to the U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate  a high quality conventional crude   Prices are actually quoted as the difference in price between the Canadian and U S  oil  in this case a negative number   There is yet another impediment to heavy oil production which has nothing to do with physics or economics  By far the largest deposits are located in Venezuela  But the current administration has mismanaged the government owned oil company  Petr leos de Venezuela  SA  PDVSA   which dominates oil development in the country  President Hugo Chavez s government has used revenues from PDVSA to fund social welfare programs to address the needs of the country s many poor  But this has led to a lack of investment in Venezuela s oil infrastructure and a consequent fall in oil production  Thus  for various reasons the all important rate of production for heavy oil may not over time be able to do much to fill the gap left by the continuing decline in the rate of conventional oil production  Transforming coal into liquid fuels suitable for vehicles also falls into the unconventional category  The Germans perfected this process during World War II when they lost access to oil  But for now  only South Africa produces an appreciable amount  Here s what I wrote previously about coal to liquids production  Turning coal into liquid fuels for vehicles is now done mostly in South Africa  a holdover from the days of apartheid when the South African government feared an oil embargo could leave the country without fuel for transportation  Turning coal into gasoline and diesel is extremely dirty and extremely expensive  But South Africa paid for the equipment to do so long ago and now must simply pay for domestic coal to supply its coal to liquids refineries  As for processing natural gas into liquid fuels using gas to liquids technology  it is capital intensive and currently only suitable for turning what is called  stranded gas   natural gas that would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere  primarily into diesel  I should say a few words about tight oil because it is often mistakenly referred to as shale oil  even though that term is more properly interchangeable with oil shale  Tight oil does indeed come from deep shale deposits  and it is released through hydraulic fracturing or fracking  the same process that is causing so much controversy when it is used to release natural gas from deep shale  Tight oil does not really fall into the unconventional category since it produces oil that is suitable for conventional refining  While hydraulic fracturing is not new  the particular form of it used to make tight oil deposits flow has only been in widespread use since 1998  This form has made previously uneconomic deposits of oil in such places as North Dakota profitable to extract  U S  oil production has risen recently as a result  But the  that production of such oil in the United States will top out in 2030 and then decline even as overall U S  oil production hits a secondary peak earlier in about 2020 and then starts to decline   The United States hit its all time oil production peak in 1970   Total  recoverable  resources of tight oil in the United States  remember  they re not necessary economically recoverable  are put at 24 billion barrels  or the equivalent of 288 days of world supply  Based on what we know today  tight oil production will not do much to overcome the loss of other conventional oil production worldwide  Finally  there is the seemingly esoteric question of Energy Return on Investment  EROI   Simply stated  it takes energy to get energy  More than a century of cheap energy has made us forget this critical fact  As we exploit ever more difficult to get energy resources  we are obliged to spend ever increasing amounts of energy to get them  When the EROI of a seeming energy resource reaches one  that is  when it takes one unit of energy to obtain one unit of energy  that resource ceases to be a source of energy  The United States is thought to operate at an EROI for all energy sources of about 40 to 1  It is hard to imagine running the country entirely on fuels such as oil from tar sands which has an EROI between 5 2 and 5 8 to 1  For oil shale there is little to go on since there are no commercial scale operations  But available estimates tell us something about why this resource has never been successfully commercialized    Compare this to between 12 to 1 and 18 to 1 for oil imported into the United States  As we as a species continue to exploit energy resources that are more and more energy intensive to extract  we will find out the true meaning of  net energy   That is the energy left over after we find  extract  refine  and deliver energy to its user  Net energy is what everything in society except the energy industry runs on  Right now in the United States  if the 40 to 1 ratio for EROI is correct  then about 2 5 percent of our energy is spent getting energy  That leaves plenty for all the other things we want to do  But if we come to rely on an array of low EROI fuels  we may soon find that vast portions of our economy must now be occupied with energy gathering  A drop to a 10 to 1 average EROI implies that 10 percent of the economy would be devoted to energy extraction  That s four times the current size of the energy sector in the United States  A drop to 5 to 1 implies that 20 percent of the economy would be involved in energy extraction  This progression is called the  net energy cliff   and it augurs enormous changes in the way we structure our economy and our lives if it comes to pass  Those changes are  in fact  already happening as we realize that unconventional oil won t be cheap  It s unlikely to be plentiful either because unconventional oil will be challenging to produce at the same high rates we ve been producing conventional oil  And  the low EROI of unconventional oil should tell us that we cannot count on it to provide as much energy to society as we are used to from much higher quality fuels  All of the foregoing flies in the face of the  wildly misleading  conventional wisdom about unconventional oil  But if we are to make intelligent policy and personal decisions about energy  we will be better prepared if we work with the available evidence rather than relying on the oil industry s pronouncements of wonders yet to come ,2012-09-17,Kurt

119773,341288,INTU,The Education Of An Investment Risk Manager  Part V,opinion,One thing that came out of our  employee empowerment project  was a need to improve our equity and bond fund offerings  At the same time  a fund manager manager  FMM  came out of the woodwork and suggested to us that we could do multiple manager funds  They had analyzed many managers and had found some that they thought were great The more we thought about it  the more we thought it would be a great idea  Here s why Our own abilities to find superior managers were limited A few members of our team  including me  possessed ability to analyze what FMM would bring us  We thought we could add value We came up with a clever name   The All Pro Funds  We also thought we could add value in changing weightings every now and then  and firing managers that we felt had become uncompetitive because they were now running too much money  had critical staff losses  or were underperforming style specific indexes by a wide margin We could increase our fee a little to pay FMM and us for the additional work entailed And whaddaya know  It worked  The portfolios in aggregate outperformed their indexes even after fees  and fund flows increased dramatically  The representatives had a story to tell  Morale improved everywhere  We were rolling  until A day came where we heard from one of the underlying managers that FMM had recommended their termination because they wouldn t rebate more of their fees back to FMM  I would not say that we went ballistic when we heard this   instead  we went cold on FMM  Act fast  No  act deliberately  The senior officers tasked me and the  2 guy in marketing to deal with the problem We had a rule in our division   we will pay disclosed compensation  or we will pay undisclosed compensation  but we will never pay disclosed and undisclosed compensation  Why  We wanted our clients to know that if compensation was disclosed  that s all there was  If there is no  sticker price  but you are happy with the services provided  and don t need to know what any agent is making that s fin with us  But we will not pass more money quietly to those that have said   This is the sticker price  FMM had violated our sense of ethics to the core  The two of us decided to put out an RFP  asking them to bid to help manage the now  1 billion of assets  We excluded FMM  We chose 10 well known manager consultants  Most responded to the RFP and we invited 5 to come present to us on a given day in spring I need to mention one other thing  When we first started dealing with FMM  we appreciated their qualitative research  which seemed to have some punch  After a year  they discovered returns based style analysis  This allowed them to analyze many more managers just by looking at their returns  and correlating them to a variety of equity and other indexes  They stopped the qualitative research The first time I saw it  I thought it was hooey  even as I think MPT is hooey  When you have a lot of highly correlated indexes  any attempt to intuit the style of a given manager is problematic  the error bands get too wide  It is too difficult to determine what the correct answer is  The optimal answer mostly represents happenstance  and not fact  Tiny tweaks to the data produce big changes in the answer  Not a good system There was one incident where I met with their new quantitative analyst  a woman 10 years younger than me  She ask if we understood how the method worked  I replied with some mathematical jargon regarding the method  leading her to say   Oh  so you  really  understand this  Also  when I analyze a manager  I like looking at what they own  I like looking at their trades  I want to see consistency with what they claim is their strategy  I also like to hear why they do what they do  and what sustainable competitive advantage they think they have  There is value in that style of analysis  There is little value in analyzing returns To our surprise  one well known consultant  call them STAR  that had no for profit clients was one of the five  The leader said it was a one time experiment  so they were evaluating us  as much as we evaluated them On the day when they came to present  the presentations were all over the map  from highly professional to  did not prepare   Some big names could not answer basic questions about what sustainable competitive advantages they brought to the process  or were fuzzy about how they earned their money STAR had the best presentation  services  model  ethics  etc  It was almost  no competition   and they liked us as well  We hired them  much to the chagrin of FMM  who begged us to keep them  It had the following positive results Management fees down by 60 Fund manager fees down by 50 Far better marketing cachetBetter models for investment analysis We reduced client fees  but had better margins  and still greater growth  Our division was transformed thorough the two projects  Before we started our ROE was around 8   and we were growing AUM at a 5 10  rate  By the time all these changes occurred  our ROE was 25   and our growth rate was not far from that  We were now the stars of the firm  even though the firm culturally could not acknowledge that  because the life division was so big I learned several things from this five year escapade Creating a desirable investment product takes work  If you do something different that seems to add value  it will attract clients    We manage the managers for you  so you don t have to  Focus on ethics in those you work with Reduce fees where possible  both your own  and that of suppliers Name recognition helps Be careful what you accept as analysis  Just because there is clever math does not mean it represents how reality works If you don t take chances  you won t achieve anything great  We didn t have to burn our old strategy  and move to multiple manager funds  but we did it  and it made clients a lot happier  The added work

119793,341308,INTU,The Fallacy of Fundamentals And More ,opinion,The Fallacy of FundamentalsAs fundamental investors  it can be frustrating to see companies  stock prices not reflect their true condition  Seeing things like Citigroup trading at half its tangible book value or Oracle unchanged on the year despite posting record profits is frustrating  But for long term investors like us  moments such as these present great entry points  Who will remember the European debt crisis in 10 years  Citigroup won t  All they will remember is the fact that more and more of their profits come from emerging markets  Apple will sell iPads and iPhones and iWhatever no matter what economic conditions it faces  In markets where everything trades together  it is important to find companies that should be trading elsewhere  That is the art of long term investing  Short term investing is an entirely different field  since fundamentals matter far less  and it is a field into which we rarely venture  We invest into stocks for the long term  unless we are in a stock that has produced a decent return in a short amount of time  for sometimes our theses play out faster than we expect The Reality of UnemploymentFor 2 years  politicians and pundits have been speaking loudly  but rarely clearly  on the employment situation in America  Everyone bemoans the fact that our unemployment rate is over 9   While this is no doubt a social tragedy  as well as a personal one for millions  the truth may very well be that this does not have as much of a meaning as it used to  Structural unemployment in the US is around 4 5  even in prosperous economic times  and although we have 4  or so less people employed than we should as a nation  the harsh reality is that this may be a  new normal   Many companies  such as Apple  UPS  Qualcomm  and Starbucks have all posted record profits while employment is stagnant  46  of sales reported by S P 500 companies came from overseas  and that number will only rise going forward  With many companies now dependent on international growth for continued overall profit growth  the US economy  and by extension unemployment  is becoming less and less relevant  People complain that US corporations are not  hiring enough workers  The harsh and unfortunate reality is that they simply do not need more employees  We sincerely hope that employment growth accelerates  something that can happen only when small businesses  the engines of job creation  are confident in their futures  Hopefully the President s speech tonight will help Combining Dividends   Growth for ProfitOur investment strategy has always been simple  Invest in the stocks we feel will generate the most alpha  That approach has led us to companies such as Apple  Netflix  Intuit  and Whole Foods  However  we recognize the importance of income as well  To that end  our portfolio is almost perfectly balanced between dividend paying stocks and non dividend paying stocks  This occurred purely by chance  but we are thrilled it did  for it provides us with both some income as well as protection during weak markets  We choose dividend players that have both opportunity for rapid growth and dividend raises as well  Most people think of companies such as AT T  Coke  or Johnson   Johnson when they think of dividend payers  Not us  We see Qualcomm  Costco  Starbucks  and most recently  Intuit  Companies like these are able to grow far rapidly than traditional  defensive dividend payers  and have plenty of opportunity to raise their payouts going forward  But  we soon realized that we wanted more income than this  We wanted a true monthly income stream from a group of stocks  This led us to the recently launched Global X SuperDividend ETF  an ETF that tracks 100 dividend paying stocks around the world and pays a monthly dividend at a yield of about 5   We think it is a great way to boost our portfolio s yield while generating some upside in a slow and conservative manner ,2011-11-23,Helix Investment Management,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fallacy-of-fundamentals…and-more!-106551,106551
119797,341312,INTU,Small Business Job Growth Slows In February  Intuit Reports,opinion,This week brings updates on three employment reports  and the first one arrived yesterday  The Intuit Small Business Index rose in February  the payrolls firm Intuit advises   Job creation among small businesses continued in February  albeit slowly   the firm says in a press release   This slow growth was accompanied by a small uptick in compensation and a slight decrease in hours worked  Does the Intuit index offer clues about tomorrow s ADP Employment Report or Friday s U S  payrolls update from the Labor Department  If so  this clue isn t particularly encouraging for expecting a substantial acceleration in job growth  Then again  there s nothing in Intuit s report that suggests that the modest growth in payrolls is set to fade either What we do know is that the Intuit benchmark posted another month of employment growth  although the pace continues to slow  February s rise was the fourth straight month of decelerating growth and the slowest percentage increase over the previous month since March 2011  Meanwhile  the annual increase for the Intuit index was unchanged in February  advancing by 3 66  over the year earlier month  We saw another month of tepid improvement for small businesses in February  echoing pretty much all of the other indicators of economic activity   says Susan Woodward  the economist who worked with Intuit to create the Index  in the accompanying press release   As an overall trend  employment is up modestly  but the number of hours worked by hourly employees is about the same as last month  seasonally adjusted   Keep in mind that the Intuit index draws on data from businesses with less than 20 employees that use the firm s payroll services  As a result  the benchmark may not be all that useful for developing intuition about the national employment trend  Speaking of small businesses  there s a perception that this is the source for most of the nation s job growth  As it turns out  the truth is a bit more complicated  A recent NBER  notes   once we control for firm age there is no systematic relationship between firm size and growth   Meantime  tomorrow s update of ADP s employment report for February is expected to show a faster rate of job growth  according to the consensus forecast  220 000 vs  170 000 in January  Friday s private nonfarm payrolls news from the government  however  is predicted to bring the opposite effect  a rise of 220 000 in February  down from the previous month s 257 000 gain  Nonetheless  the  tells us that dismal scientists remain upbeat about the big picture   The economy has begun a self sustaining period in which job growth is fueling more consumer spending  which should lead to further hiring   AP reports  If so  it s reasonable to expect that we ll see some evidence for this optimism in Friday s employment report ,2012-03-06,James Picerno,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/small-business-job-growth-slows-in-february,-intuit-reports-116097",116097
