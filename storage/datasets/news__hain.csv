35100,256615,HAIN,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Fed Statement Will Have Few Signs of Doves
The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting today and tomorrow and will be releasing its statement Thursday 
The market is convinced that the FOMC will keep rates in its range of 2  to 2 25   92  chance according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool   just as it s convinced they will hike in December  84  chance  
There will be no press conference and there s little chance that the Federal Reserve will change the language in its statement  which suggested further rate hikes with the economy rising at a strong rate in September  to a more dovish stance  even given the October market selloff 
Watch for the statement to rather highlight a pickup in wages and a further drop in unemployment  indicative of an FOMC that s willing to boost rates past neutral  Diane Swonk  chief economist at Grant Thornton  said in a note 
 The Fed has done a 180 degree turn in its view on inflation   Swonk said   What was once a concern that the economy was not warm enough has shifted to worries of overheating  Even former Fed Chair Janet Yellen has adjusted to the new environment  arguing that the risks of overheating and seeing a corrosive rise in inflation are now greater than the threat that disinflation once was  



2  Bond Yields on the Radar Again
If  as expected  the market gets its affirmation from the Fed that points to steady rate hikes  investors will be looking at bond yields 
Surging yields were a big scapegoat for the October tumble in equities  especially with high flying companies like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  that are raising a large amount of capital 
The United States 2 year yield climbed today to around 2 96   around levels not seen since 2008 
The United States 10 year yield was down today  but still up near 3 2  
The midterms are in the rearview mirror  but politics aren t  There is already talk of bipartisan cooperation on infrastructure spending  which could buoy stocks but would add more to the deficit  pushing yields even higher 
3  DR Horton Provides a Window to Housing
As a trifecta for economic wonks  earnings from DR Horton  NYSE DHI  before the bell tomorrow will give more insight into the housing market  the one area of the economy that hasn t been consistently humming along 
Analysts expect that the homebuilder earned  1 23 per share in the latest quarter on revenue of a little more than  4 5 billion 
The stock took a hit  as most did  in October  but has gained slightly since the end of that month

35183,256698,HAIN,Canopy Growth s Shake Up Not First For Cannabis Firms  Start Of NewTrend ,opinion,"By far  the biggest news in the cannabis sector last week was the ousting of Canopy Growth s co CEO Bruce Linton  The founder of the world s largest marijuana company was removed last Wednesday by the firm s board of directors  which is controlled by U S  based beverage giant Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  
Some observers have commented that Linton s removal was a direct reaction to Canopy Growth s  NYSE CGC    TSX WEED  latest earnings figures  unveiled last month  which showed a net loss of C 335 6 million  US 255 83 million   and tested Constellation s patience 
The shake up which left Mark Zekulin  the former co CEO  at the helm of Canopy set the price of the company s shares swinging wildly  Canopy shares took an immediate dive when the news of Linton s dismissal was made public  dropping about 3 6   or US 1 44 a share  to hit a low of US 39 095  C 50 40   But by the end of last week  the stock price had made its way back up to US 40 16  C 52 63  
Yesterday  it closed at US 39 47 and C 51 64 

Fuelling the theory that Constellation Brands was behind the move  the maker of Corona beer issued a statement saying it fully supports Canopy s board of directors  decision to appoint Zekulin as the sole CEO 
Top Level Shakeups
Making front page news in national newspapers in Canada  Linton s departure has undoubtedly been the biggest corporate beheading in the cannabis sector  but it s only the latest in what is becoming a long string of top level shake ups in the marijuana industry 
These changing of the guard moves  coming one after the other  make it difficult to simply view them as isolated events  They are arguably part of a trend 
Control of major cannabis companies is transitioning from the players who  in many instances  started the companies to a second generation of leadership  And this new wave of management marks a shift  putting a higher priority on profitability as operations continue to scale  It s a sign of an industry that s maturing 
Several of the leading marijuana companies have gone through a similar process of dumping their top ranking executives in recent months  and in many cases  these individuals were the original founders of the firms 
Aurora
For example  Aurora Cannabis  NYSE ACB    TSX ACB  in February reorganized the occupants of the corner suite when it named Michael Singer as executive chairman above CEO and co founder Terry Booth 
Booth had founded the Edmonton based marijuana grower in 2013  when the Canadian government created the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations  He built the company from the ground up 
Under his stewardship  Aurora went from owning a 100 acre plot of land to a world leading medical marijuana producer with a US 7 52 billion  C 9 85 billion  market cap and operations in 24 countries across five continents 
Aphria
Over at Aphria  NYSE APHA    TSX APHA  the Ontario based medical cannabis grower announced the appointment of Irwin Simon as its new interim CEO at the end of December 2018  The former head of Hain Celestial  NASDAQ HAIN   an organic natural foods producer  Simon replaced Vic Neufeld  who stepped down saying running the company for five years took a toll on his health and personal life 

From the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2018  Aphria shares went from about C 0 50 to C 7 85  US 2 67 to US 5 69   Today  Aphria is a leading cannabis player operating in 10 countries on five continents with a market cap of US 1 69 billion  C 2 22 billion  
CannTrust
Similarly  CannTrust Holdings  NYSE CTST    TSX TRST  last fall appointed banking executive Peter Aceto as its new CEO  replacing the company s founder Eric Paul  Paul was moved to the position of board chairman and named a special adviser 
After Paul stepped down  two other top executives left the company   former president Brad Rogers and head of production Michael Revensdale 
CannTrust made headlines of its own yesterday  when a report issued by Health Canada  which regulates cannabis practices  outlined how the company failed to comply with regulations at its growing operation in Pelham  Ont  The company was found to be growing cannabis in five unlicensed rooms at a greenhouse facility between October 2018 and this March 
This timeframe covers the period when the company had pending applications with Health Canada to use the space for growing operations  Licenses for these rooms were eventually issued in April  But the news was enough to send the company stock plummeting more than 22   to close at US 3 83  C 5 00  ",2019-07-09,Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lintons-ouster-from-canopy-growth-not-first-toplevel-cannabis-company-shakeup-200437892,200437892

35220,256735,HAIN, Food revolution   megabrands turn to small start ups for big ideas,news,"By Martinne Geller LONDON  Reuters    Food and drink megabrands are seeing their sales chewed away by smaller  nimbler  cooler rivals  They can t beat them   so now they re joining them   Nine of the world s biggest industry players  including  Danone   PA DANO    General Mills   N GIS    Campbell Soup   N CPB  and Kellogg  N K   have launched venture capital units over the past 18 months  a Reuters analysis of the sector shows   The aim of the strategy  according to interviews with executives  is to buy into   and learn from   the kind of start up innovation that has become their nemesis  from micro distilled spirits and cold pressed juices to kale chips and vegan burgers  Food and drink multinationals spend far less on R D than their counterparts in many sectors like tech and healthcare  They have been wrongfooted over the past five years by the shifting habits of consumers who are increasingly shunning established brands in favor of small  independent names they regard as healthier  more authentic and original   This is forcing the companies to take a leaf out of Silicon Valley s venture capital playbook   and their success or failure in harnessing promising new trends at a very early stage could help determine how well they adjust to the changing landscape  and whether they ultimately emerge as winners or losers    It s difficult for companies to have the persistence and to replicate the energy and the passion that these early stage entrepreneurs have   said John Haugen  head of General Mills  venture capital arm 301 Inc  adding innovation was extremely tough because of how quickly market trends were changing   We re just a year or a little more than that into these investments   he said of 301  where his team of about 15 sits down twice a month to pass around dozens of samples from start ups   For me it s part of a total long term growth strategy for our company    In the United States   the world s biggest packaged food market   small  challenger  brands could account for 15 percent of a  464 billion sector in a decade s time compared with 5 percent now  according to Bernstein Research   The researchers point to successful upstart brands like Chobani Greek Yogurt  which they say has stolen more than half of General Mills  market share in yogurt  and Kind Snack Bars which have taken a big bite out of Kellogg s snack bars    IT S AMAZING  THIS SWITCH  The nine companies to recently launch venture capital arms also include Hain Celestial  O HAIN    Tyson Foods   N TSN  and  Pernod Ricard   PA PERP   Typically  their funds range in size from about  100 million to  150 million   While it is still early days for them  the experiences of the handful of food and drink firms that have had funds for several years   Nestle  S NESN    Unilever   L ULVR   Coca Cola  N KO   PepsiCo  N PEP  and  Diageo   L DGE    could offer some guide to the future  Coca Cola  for example  has had a mixed record  its investment in Honest Tea was a success  but a fermented soda and a Japanese tea failed to take off in the United States  So far none of the companies  venture units has delivered a blockbuster brand  but they say a link to the cutting edge is worth the effort  Diageo  the world s biggest liquor maker  has invested in 14 start ups through its venture capital arm Distill Ventures  spending about 30 million pounds over the last four years on minority stakes  It points to last year s purchase of a 20 percent stake in Seedlip   a British start up that says it produces the world s first non alcoholic distilled spirit   as a prime example of how the strategy is making it more adventurous    If we d had our strategic areas written down four years ago   what does Diageo want to go after   nowhere would we have written down   We think there s a big opportunity for a non alcoholic spirit    said James Ashall  who heads its innovation unit Diageo Futures   By Distill Ventures provoking our thinking about the space it allows us to stretch into an area that wouldn t have been naturally in our gift    The company also cites learning gained from investments in craft whiskies  as it develops its own brands in that area  which include Roe   Co and Hilhaven Lodge   More broadly  Diageo says the venture arm is changing its culture  The global corporation now makes its marketing managers pitch for their ad budgets  like the entrepreneurs who present at Distill Ventures  laid back office for 20 30 minutes and get an answer on the spot   It makes our decision making faster and more exciting   said Diageo s chief marketing officer  Syl Saller  Seedlip founder Ben Branson and other food and drink start ups are reveling in this surge of investment interest     Big companies are saying  wait a minute  we used to beat these guys down   said Branson  a bearded and tattooed ex marketing executive who grows some Seedlip ingredients   peas and hay   on his farm in eastern England  where he also dabbles in taxidermy and painting    Now I think it s amazing that there is this switch to let s not beat them  let s join them    R D EXTENSION The venture capital divisions are not only for delivering returns or swallowing start ups  executives say  but also to act as an extension of the companies  research departments   This is of particular importance in an industry that PwC says accounted for just 3 percent of the  680 billion spent globally on R D last year  well behind the computing and electronics  healthcare and autos sectors  which together spent 62 percent   This is a form of R D for us  or access to places where the company isn t currently participating   said Simon Burton  who heads Kellogg s new venture capital arm  Eighteen94 Capital  Its first investment  announced in January  was in California based Kuli Kuli  which makes snack bars from the moringa plant  There are more in the pipeline  he said   As the need for innovation has intensified  the strings that were typically attached to venture capital investments across all sectors   notably the right to buy out the business when it gains scale   have started to disappear in food   Campbell Soup  Kellogg  Unilever and General Mills have largely scrapped such provisions when investing in early stage brands because they are often a deterrent for start up entrepreneurs who fear it will cap their fortunes by keeping other bidders away  Campbell s general counsel  Adam Ciongoli  said flexibility was needed to attract the best and brightest    Why would they want to sign up from the get go with the idea that they re not going to be able to maximize their economic leverage and their exit   said Ciongoli  who sits on the investment committee of Acre Venture Partners  which Campbell set up last year to contend with the  revolution going on in food     NEW ROCK STARS  For investors  experimenting with venture capital is worth the relatively small spend  compared with the risk associated with larger M A deals  which the companies are also pursuing    Something really good might come out of it  so I don t have a problem with that   said Alan Custis  head of UK equities at Lazard Asset Management  an investor in Diageo and Unilever  The risk of buying a successful small brand at substantial cost  rather than investing at a very early stage  is that this will rob the target of the very size and independence that made it cool  One oft cited example is Kashi cereal  an organic food pioneer whose sales tumbled after it was swallowed by Kellogg   Olivier Garel used to run M A for Unilever and now runs Unilever Ventures  He said the consumer goods sector was relatively late to the venture capital game  but was now being motivated by the need to keep up with new technologies including social media  e commerce and direct to consumer selling models  Unilever Ventures has invested in more than three dozen start ups and says it is in contact with about 2 500  This month it announced a deal leading a  9 2 million funding round for U S  organic food delivery service Sun Basket   Augustin Paluel Marmont  who sold 40 percent of his French cookie company Michel et Augustin to Danone Manifesto Ventures last year  said it was a good time to be a food start up   
 It is a lot easier today than before to find funds   he said   Entrepreneurs are the new rock stars  ",2017-05-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/'food-revolution':-megabrands-turn-to-small-start-ups-for-big-ideas-487927,487927

35229,256744,HAIN,Hain Celestial s  HAIN  Q2 Earnings Decline Y Y  View Slashed,opinion,The Hain Celestial Group  Inc    NASDAQ HAIN   disappointed investors with second quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein both top and bottom lines declined year over year and continued with the negative surprise trend  Moreover  management slashed its top and bottom line views for fiscal 2019  which was an additional dent on investors  sentiments  Notably  shares of this manufacturer  marketer  distributor and seller of organic and natural products lost 9 2  during the trading session on Feb 7  In fact  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has plunged 43 3  in the past six months  wider than the  s decline of 8 5  Markedly  Hain Celestial now envisions adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be 60 70 cents  reflecting a decline of 40 48  from fiscal 2018  Also  the updated guidance is way below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 10 Q2 in DetailThe company posted adjusted earnings of 14 cents a share that came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents  and also declined sharply from 32 cents recorded in the year ago period  The downside can be attributed to lower net sales  and higher interest and other financing expenses and factors that affected gross margin The Hain Celestial Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Net sales dropped 5  year over year to  584 2 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  612 million  owing to soft performance in the United States  United Kingdom and Rest of World  On a constant currency basis  net sales dropped 4   On adjusting for currency fluctuations  buyouts  divestitures and various other items like SKU rationalization  sales dipped 1  Segment wise  net sales at the United States segment dropped 4  year over year to  259 2 million  mainly due to decrease registered across Pantry and Better For You Baby products  This was partly mitigated by an increase in the Better For You Snacks category  Sales were also negatively impacted by the company s decision to shift focus away from various lower margin SKUs Net sales in the United Kingdom slid 5  to  225 3 million  due to a decline of 4  in Hain Daniels net sales  This was partly offset by sales growth witnessed in Tilda  whereas sales at Ella s Kitchen remained flat year over year Net sales for the Rest of the World segment tumbled 8  to  99 7 million  Net sales for Hain Celestial Canada and Hain Ventures decreased 12  and 17   respectively  while net sales for Hain Celestial Europe were flat year over year Costs   MarginsAdjusted gross margin contracted 240 basis points  bps  to 20 3   owing to increased investments related to trade and promotions along with escalated freight and commodity expenses in the United States SG A expenses decreased 1 2  to  85 4 million  due to cost savings from Project Terra  which were somewhat offset by marketing investments in the company s international operations  However  the same increased about 60 bps to 14 6  as percentage of sales Adjusted operating income tanked close to 40  to  29 9 million  while adjusted operating margin contracted 290 bps to 5 1   Adjusted EBITDA plunged 33 7  to  44 9 million  while adjusted EBITDA margin shrunk roughly 330 bps to 7 7  Other FinancialsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  38 2 million  long term debt  excluding current portion  of nearly  692 1 million and total shareholders  equity of  1 590 9 million  Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations totaled  14 5 million  while capital expenditure incurred during the three months ended Dec 31  2018  were close to  19 million  thereby resulting in negative free cash flow of  40 8 million  Management projects capital expenditure of  80  100 million for fiscal 2019 OutlookWhile management is skeptical about its near term performance  the company is seeing some sequential improvements and working toward reverting to growth in the United States  Further  the company is on track to simplify its business and allocate its resources toward areas with higher growth potential  Management expects to see improvements in the second half of fiscal 2019 when compared with the first half  on the back of its Project Terra savings plan Hain Celestial is well on track with Project Terra  which is aimed at cutting costs and complexity  alongside aiding sales growth  The company generated savings of nearly  21 million from this program in the second quarter  However  management now expects total savings for fiscal 2019 to be at the lower end of its previously guided range of  90  115 million  This is because some savings are taking time to be generated  owing to the existing complexities in the company s U S  business  Consequently  management slashed its guidance for fiscal 2019 Hain Celestial now expects net sales from continuing operations in fiscal 2019 to decline 4 6  to  2 32  2 35 billion  Earlier  management projected the same to increase nearly 2 4  to  2 50  2 56 billion Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is now expected to tumble 22 28  to  185  200 million  Management earlier projected the metric to rise about 7 17  to  275  300 million Hain Celestial now anticipates adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be 60 70 cents  reflecting a decline of 40 48  from fiscal 2018  On the contrary  the company earlier predicted the bottom line to be  1 21  1 38 per share  reflecting a jump of roughly 4 19  from fiscal 2018 Don t

intense antitrust case in decades Shares of AT T sunk in after hours trading shortly after the news  while Time Warner stock added as much as 4 5   The judge s decision will apparently allow AT T to buy Time Warner without any significant conditions Analysts have said that such a decision might limit the government s power to restrict mergers in the future  with many pointing to potential tie ups between CVS and Aetna  NYSE AET   or Disney and 21st Century Fox  as deals that could be affected by this precedent Judge Richard Leon filed the decision  which will ignite AT T s content ambitions and put the company in a better position to battle tech media hybrids like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Government prosecutors attempted to argue that a combination of AT T s distribution network its cellular and wired broadband infrastructure and Time Warner s original content HBO  Warner Bros   and Turner Broadcasting would create an anticompetitive

35317,256832,HAIN,United Natural Foods  Big Upside On Positive Earnings,opinion,"United Natural Foods Inc   NASDAQ UNFI  shares have taken a big hit following news of Amazon com s  NASDAQ AMZN  acquisition of Whole Foods  However  this may be completely overblown leading to significant upside in the stock s current share price  Either way  investors should expect to gain further understanding around the acquisition s potential impacts when management reports earnings on Wednesday after the markets close 
Why Shares Fell
The company s shares last traded at  35 77 as of Friday  September 8  down 25  year to date and 13  since the company last reported mixed earningson June 6  In fact  a significant portion of the recent losses came on June 16th  when the stock dropped 14  immediately following news of Amazon s acquisition of Whole Foods 
While United Natural Foods remains a supplier to Whole Foods  the acquisition left investors concerned as to how the relationship will progress with Amazon now entering the picture  However  the concern may have been overblown as new details continue to emerge in the aftermath of the acquisition 
Whole Foods Acquisition Concerns Overblown 
Loop Capital s Andrew Wolf has been highly involved with updating investors on new developments in the aftermath of the Whole Foods acquisition  First on June 23rd  Wolf spoke with UNFI management and then reiterated his buy rating  He noted that United Natural Foods has a supply contract with Whole Foods through 2025 and added that  It would take Amazon many years to replicate United Natural Foods direct store delivery network if it chose to do so   According to United Natural Foods management  Whole Foods does not have the capacity or buying power to enable them to self distribute 
Then on July 5  Wolf followed up by stating that United Natural Foods could actually be a potential Amazon acquisition target  He noted that in the food space  Amazon is more likely a  buyer rather than a builder   Amazon is not interested in moving into the grocery store business on its own through a trial and error process which could take multiple years  Rather  Amazon is more likely to make further acquisitions to streamline this effort 
The Whole Foods acquisition closed on August 28 and Loop Capital conducted a  before and after  experiment to better understand Amazon s pricing dynamics  When comparing prices to a local grocer in Boston  Wolf found that Whole Foods  prices were 31  higher prior to the acquisition  However  pricing actually became 2  cheaper immediately following the acquisition just days later  However  the experiment found that only high tonnage commodity goods  e g  bananas  were now cheaper 
From the experiment  Wolf actually found that food suppliers stand to benefit from these changes  The Hain Celestial Group  NASDAQ HAIN   which sells its organic products to Whole Foods  reported earnings on August 29 that beat estimates  Hain Celestial went on to say that it saw growth at Whole Foods in the most recent quarter  More importantly  Amazon reaffirmed Hain Celestial s relationship with Whole Foods will remain in place post acquisition 
Can investors expect similar news from United Natural Foods when they report on Wednesday 
What Investors Need To Know Before Earnings
Analysts often look at companies as either thriving  surviving or dying  Analyzing a company s revenue growth can help distinguish between these stages  Revenue growth compares a company s revenue from the most recent year  or quarter  to its revenue from the previous year  or quarter   Growth of over 10  typically signifies the core business is doing very well and the company s products and services are in demand  On the other hand  a decline of 10  or more is an indicator that the company is in real trouble and that its products or services are losing demand and or becoming irrelevant 
The company s total revenue stands at  8 470 million as of fiscal year ending July 2016  This is 87  higher than the  4 530 million achieved in fiscal year July 2011 and represents a five year compounded annual growth rate  CAGR  of 13   Going forward  analysts forecast that United Natural Foods  total revenue will reach  12 163 million by fiscal year 2021 representing a five year CAGR of 7 5

Many analysts have yet to bring down their projections for United Natural Foods post the Whole Foods acquisition  This potentially illustrates that nothing they ve witnessed to date implies that the company is dying  In fact  the company looks highly attractive when compared to its peers 
Analysts covering the stock often compare United Natural Foods to a peer group that includes Supervalu  NYSE SVU   Performance Food Group Co   NYSE PFGC   US Foods  NYSE USFD  and Sysco  NYSE SYY   Notice the company s projected 5 year revenue CAGR of 7 5  is above all of its selected comparable public companies  SVU  6 3    PFGC  4 5    USFD  3 8   and SYY  4 1   
Although United Natural Foods  growth has outperformed its peers  and is expected to continue outperforming   the stock s valuation multiples trade at a discount to this same peer group 
source  finbox io
The company s LTM EBITDA multiple of 7 2x is only above SVU  5 3x  and well below PFGC  13 0x   USFD  11 2x  and SYY  12 1x   Similarly  its P E multiple of 14 2x is again only above SVU  1 3x  and well below PFGC  34 7x   USFD  20 2x  and SYY  26 4x   The lower multiples is most likely explained by investor concern in relation to the Whole Foods acquisition  This could well be overblown 
Nice Upside Potential While Earnings Should Offer Insight

lingering in investors  minds is  whether this leading manufacturer and marketer of personal care  household and specialty products will be able to post a positive earnings surprise again in the to be reported quarter  The company has been delivering positive earnings surprise for three straight quarters now  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Church   Dwight Company  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    What to Expect The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 47 cents  which is in line with the year ago period figure  Further  the earnings estimate has trended upward in the last 30 days  Also  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  937 million  up roughly 7 6  from the year ago quarter Factors at PlayA look at Church   Dwight s past performance reveals that out of the past 13 quarters  the company s bottom line has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 quarters  while the top line has surpassed the same 11 times  The impressive past performance can be attributed to Church   Dwight s solid brand portfolio  along with focus on acquisitions and innovations  Evidently  in the last quarter  sales grew 2 3  on the back of acquisitions  Organic sales climbed 1 8  as higher volumes were largely offset by higher promotional investments  which continues to be a hurdle  While shares of the company have gained 3 8  so far this year  it has underperformed the  s jump of 16 3  Higher Promotional Costs   Pricing Pressure May Dent MarginsSegment wise  the company witnessed strong organic sales growth at Consumer International and Specialty Products units  while growth at the Consumer Domestic unit decelerated from the previous quarter  Moreover  increased promotion and coupon investments in the domestic business dented the company s gross margin  which also weighed upon earnings  Further  the company expects higher marketing spending in support of new product launches and increased promotional spending to squeeze gross margins in the third quarter  Also  Church   Dwight continues to expect modest inflationary environment  These factors  along with pricing pressure  stiff competition and weak demand in many of its markets remain headwinds for the company Contributions From Buyouts to Aid Top Line  Q3 ForecastsNonetheless  management remains confident of its performance  thanks to its stable portfolio of value and premium products  launch of new and innovative products  aggressive productivity programs and tight expense management  All said  in third quarter 2017  the company expects reported and organic sales growth of 3 5   Organic sales at the domestic unit is estimated to rise 3    Further  Church   Dwight envisions adjusted earnings of 46 cents in the quarter  including 2 cents of net dilution from Water Pik acquisition costs As the domestic segment contributes a major chunk to Church   Dwight s total revenues  let s look at the third quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment  The revenue consensus estimate for the Consumer Domestic segment is pegged at  710 million  reflecting year over year growth of 6 8   The consensus mark for Consumer International and Specialty Products segments are pegged at  147 million and  76 million  representing year over year growth of 9 7  and 5 6  respectively   What the Zacks Model Unveils Our

35387,256902,HAIN,Yet Another Resource Glut,opinion,"You ve heard about the massive glut in oil and natural gas  And you re likely aware of the global oversupply in aluminum 
But this week s chart tells a story you probably haven t heard 
It involves the swelling reserves of a commodity many consider  precious   But we re not talking about gold  No  we re referring to that other coveted yellow resource 
Cheese 
Americans have a voracious appetite for cheese  According to USDA data  we eat around 35 pounds of it each year  Per person  And that number has increased 43 5  since 1990 
To accommodate growing demand  cheese production had to rise as well  Today  U S  farms produce nearly 12 billion pounds of cheese each year  That s up 95  from what we were producing 26 years ago 
Again  that s a 43 5  increase in demand  And a 95  increase in production 
If you ve taken even one rudimentary math course  you should be able to spot the issue here 
This massive imbalance has led to a surplus of U S  cheese  which is at a 30 year high  We re resting on more than 1 2 billion pounds of it 
In fact  it s gotten so bad that Uncle Sam has decided to step in 
The USDA just announced plans to buy 11 million pounds of cheese from private inventories and distribute it to food banks  According to the press release 
The purchase  valued at  20 million  will be provided to families in need across the country through USDA nutrition assistance programs  while assisting the stalled marketplace for dairy producers whose revenues have dropped 35  over the past two years 
That sounds nice  but we ll just have to wait and see how this plays out  One thing we know for sure  Government intervention rarely pays off for investors 
So with the situation in the dairy sector looking dire  why not bet on an alternative market 
No  literally  Why not bet on dairy alternatives  Soy cheese  almond milk  coconut butter   
This market may be smaller than Big Dairy  but it s growing fast  Worth  8 8 billion in 2015  it s expected to reach  35 06 billion by 2024 
A near 300  increase 
According to Grand View Research  the U S  market for dairy alternatives is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10  over the next eight years 
Just one word of warning  To invest in the companies behind these products  you ll probably need to do some digging 
As our Editorial Director recently reported  many small organic businesses have been bought up by larger food corporations  Silk  for example  is owned by French company Danone  PA DANO   And The Hain Celestial Group  NASDAQ HAIN  now owns DREAM  a full line of dairy alternatives that includes everything from rice milk to soy gelato 
I know what you re thinking  YUM 
Even if those products disgust you  just remember that you don t have to actually eat the stuff to make money from it ",2016-09-09,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yet-another-resource-glut-200152759,200152759

35419,256934,HAIN,Is Hain Celestial A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Hain Celestial Group  Inc     NASDAQ HAIN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Hain Celestial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 03  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 16  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Hain Celestial s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number remaining stable over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Food   Miscellaneous sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 25  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Hain Celestial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 53  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Hain Celestial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Hain Celestial has a P S ratio of about 1 29  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Hain Celestial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Hain Celestial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Hain Celestial is just 1 73  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 34  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Hain Celestial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives HAIN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  The full year has seen one estimate moving north  compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months  However  the current quarter has seen no estimate revisions over the same time frame This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter estimates remained stable for the last two months  while the full year estimate inched lower by 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Hain Celestial Group  Inc  Price and Consensus
     This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHain Celestial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 24  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2017-06-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-hain-celestial-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200192872,200192872

first three quarters Other DevelopmentsManagement unveiled a host of strategic initiatives aimed at driving the company s growth  Firstly  the company began a strategic review under Project Terra  and expects to generate worldwide cost savings worth  100 million from fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2019  To achieve these savings  the company intends to optimize plants  co packers and procurement  along with rationalizing its product portfolio  and thereby reinvesting the additional savings through brand development and household penetration  To oversee these actions  management named James R  Meiers

    GuidanceThe company s performance remains impressive  marked by sturdy sales and earnings growth  along with its focus on productivity enhancement  which led to profitable global expansion Going

Commentary After my last T2108 Update  I eagerly awaited a long overdue eruption of volatility  I am still waiting  After Friday s jobs report missed  expectations   volatility took a dive off the deep end and left intact the ceiling at the critical 15 35 pivot 

Back to the drawing board for the volatility index  the VIX 
Along with the plunge in volatility  the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   gapped back into the middle of the current trading range  The move left behind two straight days where sellers seemed to be ready to break the index down only to stumble and fall as buyers rallied the index off its lows for the day 

The S P 500 continues to float along in an ever extending trading range 
During that time  T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   took some serious technical hits  T2108 traded as low as 48 3  on Thursday  September 1  and closed that day at 52 3   The bearish divergence widened ever further 
T2108 closed the week at 57 9   The good news for bulls and buyers is that  T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  has remained remarkably calm throughout all this churn  T2107 has drifted within a tight two percentage point range since it recovered from early August s brief tumble  My short term trading bias is still cautiously bearish given the earlier described divergence and the tendency for September to deliver the biggest drawdowns of the year 

T2108 s downtrend exposes an on going deterioration of short term technicals for the general stock market 

T2107 s steady hand indicates the longer term health of the stock market remains remarkably intact 
Central bank and OPEC action looks set to dominate the scene for September  This week kicks things off with the Reserve Bank of Australia on September 6th and the European Central Bank  ECB  on September 8th  As these events roll out  currencies may become the forcing function for stocks  In the meantime  here are some stock charts to consider this week 
I wrote comprehensively about Mylan NV  NASDAQ MYL  and  last week  I predicted further selling ahead and collateral damage for the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB   Two for two so far although IBB is holding up to the Clinton Bash Part Two a lot better than I expected  Perhaps the market has already priced in its Clinton fears from last year  I hope to soon cover two epinephrine related companies Impax Laboratories  NASDAQ IPXL  and Adamis Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ADMP  

The selling accelerated on Mylan  MYL  

The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  is barely clinging to converged support at its 50 and 200DMAs  One more slip could trigger a cascade of selling pressure 
On Friday  August 26   featured U S  Concrete  NASDAQ USCR  as a stock pick from a fund manager  I put the company on my potential buy list but have hesitated given the sudden appearance of high volume selling  I have yet to find explanatory news  but I have duly noted that the stock is technically a short  given how well the 200DMA has held up as resistance  The high volume selling seems to confirm USCR as a short  I need to see much more constructive action before pulling the trigger for a buy at some point in the future 

Since an early August gap down  sellers and resistance have dominated the action on U S  Concrete  USCR   It looks like a don t buy sell short here 
Start at the 15 57 mark 

Tableau Software  NYSE DATA  has erased about half of its big gain from August 23rd  This looks like a classic  calm after the storm    Although I am bearish on the stock market  I am keeping an eye on this setup  If it fails  I might short DATA in anticipation of a complete gap fill and or retest of 50DMA support   See here for description of previous setup on DATA  
Buyers have yet to follow through on the big gap up for Tableau Software  DATA   but the selling is drifting and non committal  A return of buyers could lead to a swift resumption of momentum or a continued absence of buyers could motivate more determined selling 
  I concluded that the Teucrium Corn ETF  NYSE CORN  would continue to sell off  After a brief pop  CORN did indeed set new all time lows  Buyers returned over the past two days  and CORN is looking interesting again 
I will stay patient and wait to see whether the ETN can even manage to a close above 50DMA resistance before I consider any kind of purchase  Readers recall that I typically exempt commodities from my general stock market trading call since they can be uncorrelated to stock market returns 
Sellers have placed intense pressure on Teucrium Corn ETF  CORN   Can buyers sustain the latest bounce 
The earlier contrary excitement over retailers has cooled off and even reversed in many cases  Macy s  NYSE M  led the way by cratering through its 200DMA  The stock is now trying an important bounce from 50DMA support  The SPDR S P Retail ETF  NYSE XRT  is also trying to find support at its 50DMA  If I were not bearish  I would look to buy XRT here 
Instead  I am watching for a breakdown to sell  JC Penney  NYSE JCP  is also testing important 50DMA support  The stock was a big  undervalued pick by the fund manager  August 26th 

 I m telling you  this is one of the biggest turnaround stories I have come across in my 30 years  

The bad news is good news trade looks just about over for Macy s  M   Can buyers defend support at the 50DMA 

The SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  is also trying to hold support at its 50DMA  However a double top for 2016 may already be a lock 

Imagine that   JC Penney Company  JCP  is also testing critical 50DMA support

Palo Alto Networks  PANW  is struggling to regain its former luster as an unstoppable stock  Resistance at its 200DMA may be the ultimate dividing line between breakout and resignation 
One final trading note  I sold my call options in the iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  as part of  for last week  The precious metals did not move nearly as much as I had hoped  open or down   The profits from the SLV call options cover most of the cost of my call options on ProShares UltraShort Silver  NYSE ZSL   If SLV manages to breakout above 50DMA resistance  I will likely jump right back into call options and get much more aggressive 

The iShares Silver Trust  SLV  springs back to life and makes a challenge for 50DMA resistance

35503,257018,HAIN,Will Target s Dividend Hike Help ,opinion,"Target Corporation  NYSE TGT   the operator of general merchandise and food discount stores  revealed its plan to utilize its free cash to boost shareholders  return by announcing a dividend hike 
Minneapolis  MN based Target raised its annual dividend by 20 9  to  2 08  or 52 cents quarterly  from  1 72 per share  or 43 cents quarterly   The company announced that the increased dividend will be paid on Sep 10 to stockholders of record as on Aug 20  This marks the 188th successive dividend payment for the company ever since it went public in Oct 1967 
However  the news did not provide much impetus to the stock  as Target s share price inched up 0 4  or 22 cents to close at  57 08 yesterday  The dividend yield based on the new payout and the last closing market price is 3 6  
Target  an S P 500 company  last hiked its annual dividend to  1 72 from  1 44 per share in Jun 2013  reflecting an increase of 19 4  
Dividend hikes not only enhance shareholders  return but raise the market value of the stock  Through this strategy  companies bolster investor confidence in the stock  thereby persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it  Looking ahead  the company remains confident of its growth potential  suggesting enhanced value for shareholders 
Although Target s dividend hike is a regular feature  it may be considered to be part of a strategy to provide cushion to the stock that was hurt by a massive data breach  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company faced its worst security infringement ever last holiday season  when information related to credit and debit card data of approximately 70 million customers was hacked 
Apart from the security infringement  the company s tepid foray into the Canadian market  weak e commerce sales and subsequent dismal quarterly performances have set Target back  Moreover  the breach has shaken consumer confidence  resulting in lesser footfall and a public relations nightmare for the company

Cigna  NYSE CI 
Cigna  rose out of a base between 88 and 94 up to another base centered around 102 before starting a move higher in January  The current move is now consolidating under resistance  As it does  the RSI has worked off an overbought condition while remaining bullish and the MACD is level after a pullback 
The Hain Celestial Group Inc  NASDAQ HAIN 
Hain Celestial  has trended higher  with a few pullbacks along the way  since August  Now it is consolidating under resistance with the Bollinger Bands  tightening  This is often a precursor to a move in price  The RSI has turned back higher and is bullish while the MACD is level after a pullback  Watch for a break out higher 
Old Dominion Freight Line Inc  NASDAQ ODFL 
Old Dominion Freight Line  rose from an April 2014 low with only a pullback along with the market in October  But the last 4 months has seen falling trend resistance  like the neckline of an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern  The higher low last week suggests it may be ready to break higher  And the bullish and rising RSI supports this  The MACD which is level after a pullback  turning higher would confirm support too 
PerkinElmer  NYSE PKI 
PerkinElmer  has been a bit of a messy chart but the action sine January has some short term clarity  Rising to resistance and then pulling back a couple of times to higher support each time  It pushed through that resistance Friday on strong relative volume  The RSI is rising and in the bullish zone while the MACD is about to cross up  These support a new leg higher

Weyerhaeuser  had been in a rising channel or wedge since April 2014 until falling out lower to bring in March like a lion  Now consolidating over support  it has moved back into the Bollinger Bands  The RSI is bearish and holding along the oversold line with the MACD falling  Look for a break lower 
Up Next  Bonus Idea
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower along with Crude Oil next week  The US Dollar Index may consolidate in the uptrend but has a clear bias higher while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite is trying to break consolidation to resume the uptrend while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside still 
Volatility looks to remain subdued but above the low range of the early 2014 keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  but with the wind easing at their backs  Their charts all are consolidating in the short run with the bias to the upside for the IWM while to the downside for the SPY and QQQ  The long term uptrend remains intact for each though  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

35547,257062,HAIN,Reaching For The Stars With Hain Celestial,opinion,"Hain Celestial  NASDAQ HAIN  is a natural   specialty  and snack food company  Its stock price may be ready to reach for the stars  After making a high in August 2015  the stock started lower with the market  But unlike many stocks  it did not stop and rebound into the end of the year  It just kept falling through the middle of January 
It finally found some support and consolidated over 33  54  lower  That was more like crashing to Earth  But since February 11 it has started to round higher  It made a higher high on the 17th and then a higher low the 24th  Now it is making another higher high  The momentum indicators are rising  with the RSI moving into the bullish zone and the MACD above zero 

The stock moved over its 50 day SMA for the first time since August last week and is now closing in on the 100 day SMA  Notice as well that the Bollinger Bands  are opening to the upside  Using 36 50 as a stop loss  this stock might be a great way to reach for the stars if it can get over 40  A minor 38 2  retracement would yield a 18 7  return and if it gets really strong  that 61 8  retracement would yield over 40  ",2016-03-07,Gregory W.

35555,257070,HAIN,Coke Takes Another Sip Of Keurig,opinion,"Shares of specialty coffee retailer Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Inc   NASDAQ GMCR  soared almost 8  higher after media reports stated that beverage giant The Coca Cola Company  NYSE KO  is planning to increase its stake in the company to 16  
This is an extension of the deal closed on Feb 27  2014  under which Coca Cola took over 10  stake of the coffee maker for  1 25 billion at  74 98 per share 
The Deal
In early February  Keurig Green Mountain announced a 10 year partnership deal with Coca Cola as part of its strategy to step into the world of cold beverage and soda with its new   The Keurig Cold Machine  that makes sodas  sports drinks and other beverages at home using specially designed pods 
Under the deal  the former will exclusively make Coca Cola branded pods to be used on the Keurig Cold at home beverage system  The two companies will also work on the development and launch of this latest version of Keurig single cup brewer 
Win Win Deal for Both
For Keurig Green Mountain  this is a great opportunity to leverage Coca Cola s branding and global presence  The expansion into cold beverages is an obvious growth prospect for the coffee maker which is also the leader among makers of single cup coffee brewing systems used in offices and homes  Since coffee preferences vary from country to country  the global appeal of soda and carbonated beverage drinks will help Keurig Green Mountain target a larger customer base than Keurig brewers 
For Coca Cola  the deal paves its way to enter the growing  single serve at home  channel  The deal opens up an exciting new packaging format for Coca Cola brands 
Other Stocks to Consider
Both Coca Cola Keurig Green Mountain carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Another stock in the consumer staples sector worth considering include Pinnacle Foods Inc   Pinnacle Foods Inc  NYSE PF   and The Hain Celestial Group Inc   NASDAQ HAIN  both sportinga a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2014-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/coke-takes-another-sip-of-keurig-212832,212832

35562,257077,HAIN,IPO Look   Annie s  Inc   Organic Food Goes Public,opinion,Based in Berkeley  CA  Annie s  Inc   BNNY  scheduled a  75 million IPO with a market capitalization of  252 million at a price range mid point of  15 for Wednesday  March 28  2012  Managers  Credit Suisse  J P  Morgan BNNY is one of nine IPOs scheduled for the week of March 26  For a summary BNNY is offering five million shares or 30  of the company in total  Four million shares  80  of the total shares  are coming from private equity shareholders  IPO proceeds to BNNY are allocated to pay debt and to pay a  1 3 million management termination fee to the private equity sponsor  Solera SUMMARYBNNY is a natural and organic food company with a widely recognized brand  with 24  of net sales going to Target  TGT  and Costco  COST   According to BNNY the company has the  1 natural and organic market position in four product lines  macaroni and cheese  snack crackers  fruit snacks and graham crackers Large mainstream conventional packaged foods competitors include Kraft Foods  KFT   General Mills  GIS   Campbell Soup Company  CPB   PepsiCo  PEP   Nestle S A  and Kellogg  K   Natural and organic packaged foods competitors include The Hain Celestial Group  HAIN   Newman s Own  Inc   Nature s Path Foods  Inc   Clif Bar   Company and Amy s Kitchen BNNY s gross margin of 39  is higher HAIN s  28   or KFT s  35    And BNNY s trailing 12 months P E ratio of 20 is the same as KFT s and is 66  of HAIN sCONCLUSIONBased on the above ratios and gross margin comparisons it seems that BNNY is a buy on the IPO  at the price range mid point of  15 BUSINESSBNNY is growing natural and organic food company with a widely recognized brand  offering consumers great tasting products in large packaged food categories BNNY sells premium products made from high quality ingredients at affordable prices  Products appeal to health conscious consumers who seek to avoid artificial flavors  synthetic colors and preservatives that are used in many conventional packaged foods BNNY s has the  1 natural and organic market position in four product lines  macaroni and cheese  snack crackers  fruit snacks and graham crackers BNNY offers over 125 products and is present in over 25 000 retail locations in the United States and Canada  Over the past three years  the company has significantly increased both the number of retail locations where products can be found and the number of products in individual stores BNNY expects that increasing penetration of the mainstream grocery and mass merchandiser channels  combined with greater brand awareness  new product introductions  line extensions and favorable consumer trends  will continue to fuel sales growth in all channels We rely on sales to a limited number of distributors and retailers for the substantial majority of our sales  and the loss of one or more significant distributors or retailers may harm our business DISTRIBUTIONA substantial majority of sales are generated from a limited number of distributors and retailers  For fiscal 2011  sales to the principal distributor and largest customer  UNFI  represented 28  of net sales  and sales to the top two retailers  Target and Costco  represented an aggregate of 24  of net sales Financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant distributors or retailers  For example  in fiscal 2010 sales to Costco were  3 2 million lower than in fiscal 2009  which contributed to lower sales growth BNNY does not have commitments or minimum volumes that ensure future sales of products SEASONALBNNY s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that may have a disproportionate effect on results of operations  Historically  BNNY has realized a higher portion of net sales  net income and operating cash flows in the second and fourth fiscal quarters  September   March calendar quarters  due to customers  merchandising and promotional activities around the back to school and spring seasons SALES COMPARISONSNine Months Ended December 31  2011 Compared to Nine Months Ended December 31  2010 ProductsThe revenue increase of  17 million reflects a  9 6 million   7 5 million and  0 1 million increase in net sales of snacks  meals and dressings  condiments and other  respectively  The increase in snacks was attributed primarily to growth in fruit snacks  granola bars and snack mixes  which generated an estimated increase in net sales of  4 2 million   2 2 million and  1 8 million  respectively The increase in meals was driven by strong growth in the macaroni and cheese product line  Distribution gains also contributed to net sales growth  primarily in the mainstream grocery and mass merchandiser channels ChannelsNet sales increased an estimated  9 1 million   6 0 million and  2 2 million for the nine months ended December 31  2011 in the mass merchandiser  mainstream grocery and natural channels  respectively  The net sales increase was primarily driven by volume combined with slightly higher average selling prices to offset rising commodity costs Over the past three years  the percentage of sales made direct to retailers has increased  primarily driven by increased volume with mass merchandisers such as Target and Costco PromotionsBNNY offers a variety of sales and promotion incentives to customers and to consumers  such as price discounts  consumer coupons  volume rebates  cooperative marketing programs  slotting fees and in store displays  BNNY s net sales are periodically influenced by the introduction and discontinuance of sales and promotion incentives For example  BNNY had a strong fourth quarter in fiscal 2011  with a net sales increase of 25  over the comparable period in the prior year  aided in part by some significant promotional incentives  Given the substantial fourth quarter BNNY had last year  the company expects its increase in net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 will not keep pace with the net sales growth in the prior three quarters SUPPLY DISRUPTIONSIn fiscal 2011  organic wheat and sunflower oil were in shorter supply than BNNY expected  BNNY purchases some ingredients offshore  and the availability of such ingredients may be affected by events in other countries  including Colombia  Paraguay  Thailand and Brazil In addition  BNNY competes with other food producers in the procurement of organic ingredients  which are often less plentiful in the open market than conventional ingredients  This competition may increase in the future if consumer demand for organic products increases COMPETITIONLarge mainstream conventional packaged foods competitors include Kraft Foods Inc   General Mills  Inc   Campbell Soup Company  PepsiCo  Inc   Nestle S A  and Kellogg Company  Natural and organic packaged foods competitors include The Hain Celestial Group  Inc   Newman s Own  Inc   Nature s Path Foods  Inc   Clif Bar   Company and Amy s Kitchen In addition to these competitors  in each of their categories they compete with many regional and small  local niche brands  Given limited retailer shelf space and merchandising events  competitors actively support their respective brands with marketing  advertising and promotional spending  In addition  most retailers market similar items under their own private label  which compete for the same shelf space EQUITY SPONSORSolera Capital pre IPO owns 90 5   post IPO expects to own 63 5   LLC is a private equity firm based in New York City  Solera has

featured in the blog include  Colgate Palmolive Co    NYSE CL    Kellogg Co    NYSE K    The Hain Celestial Group Inc    NASDAQ HAIN   and Post Holdings Inc    NYSE POST   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Buy 4 Top Consumer Staples Stocks Ahead of EarningsWall Street has maintained its momentum of 2019 since the beginning of this year  despite facing intermittent fluctuations due to geopolitical conflict with Iran and the outbreak of coronavirus in China  Meanwhile  fourth quarter 2019 results have so far not been as disappointing as expected initially  However  overall earnings are still expected to dip Better Than Expected Fourth Quarter Earnings Results So FarAs of Jan 27  just 87 S P 500 members reported fourth quarter earnings results  Total earnings of these companies are down 0 1  from the same period last year on 3 4  higher revenues  Of the total  70 1  surpassed EPS estimates while 72 4  outpaced revenue estimates As of Jan 27  fourth quarter 2019 earnings for the S P 500 Index were projected to be down 2 6  year over year on 3 7  higher revenues  This suggests an improvement from earnings decline of 3 2  from the same period last year on 3 5  higher revenues  projected at the beginning of the reporting cycle    Read More   Fourth Quarter at a GlanceThe final three months of last year were quite promising for Wall Street as the U S  China trade war finally seemed to ease and strong economic data boosted investors  sentiments The U S  economy is on a stable footing  Strong consumer spending  which constitutes 70  of the GDP  a strong labor market  a historically low level of unemployment  steady growth in wage rate and a housing market revival bolstered investors  sentiments and are likely to reflect on earnings results The consumer staples sector includes companies that provide necessities and products for daily use  This makes the sector defensive in nature  So  this has always been a go to place for investors  who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations Adding stocks from the consumer staples basket lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market condition  Moreover  the sector remains lucrative for income seeking investors given its strong dividend yield Notably   the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP   one of the total 11 sectors of the S P 500 Index  has gained 28 1   close to the broad market index s rally of 28 9   However  during fourth quarter 2019  when the market was almost free of volatility  XLP gained 3 3  compared with the benchmark index s surge of 8 5
