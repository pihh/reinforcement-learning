Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood afternoon and welcome to WEC Energy Group s Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Year End 2019 Results   Operator Instructions   Before the conference call begins I remind you that all statements in the presentation  other than historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time Such statements are based on management s expectations at the time they are made  In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements  factors described in WEC Energy Group s latest Form 10 K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated During the discussions referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted  After the presentation  the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers  In conjunction with this call  a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup com  A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call And now  it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa  Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanGood afternoon everyone  thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2019  First  I d like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today  We have Kevin Fletcher  President and CEO  Scott Lauber  Chief Financial Officer  Bill Guc  our Controller  Peggy Kelsey  Executive Vice President and General Counsel  Tony Reese  Treasurer and Beth Straka  Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in just a moment  But as you saw from our news release this morning  we reported full year 2019 earnings of  3 58 a share  And I m pleased to report that we delivered a record year on virtually every meaningful measure of performance  from customer satisfaction  to the swift recovery from severe July storms that caused extensive damage to our system As we review our financial results our balance sheet continues to strengthen  In fact  our ratio of holding Company debt to total debt now stands at 28   that beats our 30  goal  In 2019  we also eliminated a regulatory asset for transmission costs and we continue to leverage the benefits of tax reform for both customers and shareholders In addition  we worked effectively to settle our Wisconsin rate reviews  which represent approximately 70  of our regulated assets  We also took our environmental efforts a step further  We set a new goal in 2019 to reduce the rate of methane emissions from our natural gas distribution system by 30  per mile by the year 2030 Our ongoing work to modernize Chicago s natural gas delivery network is key to achieving this goal  And  we continue to analyze our climate related risks and opportunities  In fact  a recent Moody s report focused on the risk exposure of regulated utilities to heat stress  water stress  and extreme rainfall  I m pleased to note that WEC Energy ranked among the lowest risk Companies in our sector During 2019  we also reached a number of significant milestones in our Infrastructure segment  The Coyote Ridge Wind Farm is now in service in South Dakota and will contribute a full year of earnings in 2020  As you may recall  Coyote Ridge consists of 39 turbines with a capacity of roughly 97 megawatts We invested approximately  145 million for our 80  share of the wind farm and we re entitled to 99  of the tax benefits  As you know  a significant portion of our earnings from this facility come in the form of production tax credits  Project has a 12 year offtake agreement with Google Energy LLC for all of the energy produced  We also announced back in September  that we will acquire an 80  ownership interest in the Thunderhead Wind Energy Centre for  338 million Invenergy is developing this project in Nebraska and we expect it to be in service at the end of 2020  The site will consist of 108 GE wind turbines with a combined capacity of 300 megawatts  The project has a long term offtake agreement with AT T for 100  of the energy produced  We expect Thunderhead will qualify for production tax credits and 100  bonus depreciation Then earlier this week folks  we announced plans for another new development  We ve agreed to acquire an 80  ownership interest in the Blooming Grove Wind Farm for  345 million  Invenergy is developing this project in Illinois with commercial operation expected to begin by the end of this year  The site will host 94 wind turbines with a total capacity of 250 megawatts  Blooming Grove has a 12 year offtake agreement with affiliates of two multinational companies that are investment grade We expect that Blooming Grove will be eligible for 100  bonus depreciation as well as production tax credits  Overall  we re very encouraged about these investments in renewable energy  which will serve strong businesses for years to come  We expect the return on these investments to be higher than our regulated returns  Of course  we re being very selective as we vet future projects  We re only interested in projects that achieve our financial return metrics and do not change our risk profile Now let s take a brief look at the regional economy that s supporting our Company s longer term growth  Wisconsin s unemployment remains near record lows for the state and we continue to see strong economic development projects in the pipeline  Foxconn is moving forward with its plan to create a high tech campus in Racine County  south of Milwaukee  Work on a Generation 6 fabrication plant for liquid crystal display screens is progressing The fab  which spans about 1 million square feet is now enclosed and work is beginning on the internal structures  Foundations are also in place for a high capacity data center  In addition  Foxconn has announced plans for a smart manufacturing facility  Construction crews began lifting the exterior walls into place for the smart manufacturing plant earlier this week Based on public data  we estimate that Foxconn s investment in Wisconsin over the past two years has risen to approximately  500 million  Turning a bit further south in the Kenosha area  Uline has announced plans to invest  130 million in two new facilities and bring approximately 350 new jobs to the area Uline  as you may know  is a leading distributor of shipping  industrial and packaging supplies with headquarters here in Wisconsin  In addition  Milwaukee Tool has announced another expansion  Milwaukee Tool will invest  100 million in a large multipurpose campus north west of the city in Menomonee Falls The Company also committed to adding 870 jobs in Wisconsin on the year 2025  These are exciting times  We look forward to more economic development and opportunity across the region And now  I ll turn the call over to Kevin for more insight on our operations and our regulatory calendar  Kevin  all yours Kevin Fletcher    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Gale  First I d like to share some good news  Our largest subsidiary  We Energies was named the most reliable electric utility in the Midwest for the ninth year running  Wisconsin Public Service also was recognized for the first time for outstanding reliability performance  Now  I ll briefly review where we stand in our four state jurisdictions  As you ll recall  in March of last year  we filed a proposal with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to set customer rates where  Phonetic  introduced and Wisconsin Public Service and in August  we entered into settlement agreements with the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin  the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and Clean Wisconsin On December  the 19th  the Commission issued its written order affirming those settlement agreements and setting rates for the next two years  New rates went into effect on January  the 1st  During 2019  we also continue to make progress in developing solar generation for our regulated businesses in Wisconsin  You may recall that in Wisconsin  we re planning a total of 300 megawatts of utility scale solar capacity  The first facilities of this size in the state We ve broken ground on two solar project for Wisconsin Public Service  Two Creeks and Badger Hollow 1  Our share will total 200 megawatts with an expected investment of approximately  260 million  Both projects are scheduled to begin producing energy by the end of this year  And this past August  at We Energies we filed with the Wisconsin Commission for approval to acquire 100 megawatts of capacity at the Badger Hollow II Solar Park  The projected investment would be  130 million  We expect to receive the Commission s decision this spring We also see efficient natural gas storage  another important part of our regulated business strategy  In particular  Wisconsin needs more natural gas peaking capacity at the highest demand times on the coldest days  We re continuing to evaluate site plans for two liquefied natural gas facilities to help meet our customers  needs during the winter peak We expect to invest approximately  370 million in these projects  If approved by the Wisconsin Commission  construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2021  Turning to Illinois  we continue making progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization program  This program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern  safe and reliable  We re approximately 28  complete with our replacement of outdated  corroded natural gas piping  some of which was installed more than a century ago  We continue to project an investment of  280 million to  300 million per year on average in this program Now  we ll turn to Michigan  In 2019  we completed our new natural gas fired power plants in Michigan s Upper Peninsula on time and on budget  These plants are now providing a cost effective long term power supply for our customers in the Upper Peninsula  With these new units operating  we were able to retire our older  less efficient coal fired plant at Prescott  This resulted in significant operations and maintenance savings and reduced CO2 emissions Taking a broader look across our business  we continue to focus on operating efficiency and financial discipline  As a whole  we exceeded our 2019 goal to reduce our day to day operation and maintenance calls  Our goal was a reduction of 4  and we actually achieved a 7  reduction  We have set a goal to further reduce our O M by an incremental 2  to 3  in 2020 as well And with that  I will turn it back to Gale Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanKevin  thank you very much  As you ll recall  ladies and gentlemen our 2020 guidance is in a range of  3 71 a share to  3 75 a share  This translates to an earnings growth of between 6  and 7 1  of our 2019 base of  3 50 a share  Recall that  3 50 a share was the midpoint of our original guidance for 2019 And finally  a word about our dividend policy  In its January meeting  our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend of  0 6325 a share for the first quarter of 2020  that s an increase of 7 2   The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of  2 53 a share  This marks the 17th  Indecipherable  17th consecutive year that our Company will reward shareholders with higher dividends We continue to target a payout ratio of 65  to 70  of earnings  We re right in the middle of that range now  So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share And now with details on our 2019 results and our outlook for 2020 is our CFO  Scott Lauber  Scott Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Gale  Our 2019 earnings of  3 58 per share increased  0 24 per share compared to 2018  a 7 2  increase  In 2019  we benefited from additional capital investment  production tax credits and continued emphasis on cost control While all of our utilities met their financial goals  our Wisconsin utilities earned their fully allowed ROE  And customers will see the benefit going forward through the sharing mechanism  We posted the earnings packet to our website this morning and it includes a comparison of fourth quarter and full year results  My focus will be on the full year beginning with operating income by segment and then other income  interest expense and income taxes Referring to Page 10 of the earnings packet  our consolidated operating income for 2019 was  1 530 billion as compared to operating income of  1 470 billion in 2018  an increase of  63 million  Recall that as part of our previous rate settlement in Wisconsin  we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory assets The plan continued through year end and as we expected  the transmission escrow asset balance at We Energies was eliminated  My update will focus on changes in operating income by segment excluding the impact of tax repairs and our adoption of the new lease accounting rules Starting with the Wisconsin segment  operating income increased  42 million net of these adjustments  Lower operation and maintenance expense resulted in approximately  105 million increase in operating income driven by efficiencies and effective cost control across the enterprise  This positive impact on operating income was largely offset by a few items First  lower sales volumes due to primarily cooler summer weather conditions accounted for approximately  26 million decrease in operating income  Second  depreciation and amortization increased  35 million as we continue to execute on our capital plan  And finally  operating income was reduced by  22 million tax item that flowed through operating income  This was fully offset by a reduction in tax expense  In Illinois  operating income increased by  36 million  primarily as a result of our continued investment in the safety and reliability of the Peoples Gas System Operating income at our Other state segment decreased  3 5 million  Turning now to our Energy  Infrastructure segment  Operating income at this segment was up  800 000  driven by additional investment in our Power the Future Plants  As expected  the Bishop Hill Upstream and Coyote Ridge Wind Farms did not have a material impact on operating income Recall a significant portion of earnings from these wind farms come in the form of production tax credits  which are recognized as an offset to income tax expense  These production tax credits contributed approximately  0 08 per share to our earnings for the year compared to  0 01 in 2018  The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased by  12 million This variance reflects a  5 3 million gain that we recorded in 2018 related to the sale of a legacy business  as well    as well as an impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 on assets that we inherited from the Integrys acquisition  Combining these variances and excluding the impact of tax repairs and the new lease rules  consolidated operating income increased  62 8 million Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled  128 million  a decrease of  9 1 million as compared to 2018  Our earnings from ATC decreased by  19 million as a result of the recent FERC order addressing the MISO complaints  Going forward  we are recording ATC earnings assuming a 10 38  return on equity This includes a 50 basis point added for our participation in MISO  Other income net increased by  32 million driven by investment gains associated with our benefit plans  Note that these investment gains partially offset the benefit expense included in our operating segments  The remaining increase relates to the non service cost component of our pension and benefit plans Our net interest expense increased by  53 million  mostly due to higher long term debt balances to fund the capital investment  This excludes the impact of the new lease guidance  Our consolidated income tax expense net of tax repairs decreased by  42 million  The major drivers were production tax credits from our wind investments and the 2018 tax reform item that I mentioned earlier Our 2019 effective tax rate was 9 9   Excluding the benefits of tax repairs  our 2019 effective tax rate would have been 20 6   Looking forward  we expect that 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16  to 17   This includes the effects of the unprotected tax benefits that are being refunded to customers following our recent Wisconsin rate decision Excluding these benefits we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20  and 21   At this time  we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2020  Our projections show that we ll be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our capital plan  Turning to our cash flow statement  our FFO to debt was 18 5  in 2019  Looking ahead  we expect FFO to debt to be in the range of 16  to 18  We re using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401  k  plans  options and other programs  Going forward  we do not expect to issue any additional shares  Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were  2 5 billion in 2019  a  112 million increase from 2018  Turning now to sales  We continue to see customer growth across our system At the end of 2019  our utilities were serving approximately 10 000 more electric and 14 000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago  Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on page 13 and 14 of the earnings packet  Overall  retail deliveries of electricity excluding the iron ore mine were down 2 8  compared to 2018 and on a weather normal basis  deliveries were down 1 7  Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 2 6  versus 2018 and by 1 8  on a weather normal basis  This excludes gas used for power generation  And now I ll briefly touch on our 2020 sales forecast for our Wisconsin segment  We are forecasting a slight decrease of 0 50  in weather normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mine  We project the Wisconsin weather normalized retail gas deliveries to increase by 0 7   This excludes gas used for power generation and of course  both of these projections are adjusted for leap year in 2020 Finally  let s look at our guidance for the first quarter of 2020  Last year  we earned  1 33 per share in the first quarter  As you recall  this included approximately  0 04 related to the colder than normal weather in 2019  Factoring in this and the 16  warmer than normal January  we project first quarter 2020 earnings to be in the range of  1 32 per share to  1 34 per share  This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter And with that  I ll turn things back to Gale Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanScott  thank you very much  Overall  we are continuing to perform at a high level on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders  Operator  we re ready now to open it up for the question and answer portion of the call Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  Now we will take your questions   Operator Instructions   Your first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanRock and roll  Shar Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystHey  good morning guys  how are you doing Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWe are good  How are you Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystOh  good  Not too bad  So let me  just a couple of questions here  You guys are backfilling this infrastructure capital budget relatively fast  especially with last week s acquisition  What s the spending shape look like given sort of these recent opportunities  i e   is there any opportunities to provide upside to your current guide or is it just kind of an acceleration of that spend And then Scott  I know you mentioned on the cash tax position being a partial payer  but does that include last week s acquisition  Just wanted to get a little bit of clarity there Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWell  Shar  we will be happy to answer those questions  First  I would view our announcement this week on Blooming Grove as basically an acceleration of the five year plan  If you kind of look at what we ve accomplished so far with what we believe are very high quality projects  we re almost  we re about 38  already in terms of    in terms of the projects that we have    that we ve agreed to acquire  We re at about 38  of the spending we projected in our five year plan But I would view it as an acceleration  and I will tell you why  Our five year plan  which projected about  1 08 billion in this particular segment of capital spending essentially was a happy marriage of the high quality projects that we saw  that we really had a strong interest in  coupled with our ability to utilize all of the tax benefits  You put all that together and it kind of shook out at  1 08 billion  So  Scott  I would view this as an acceleration Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerRight  It s just a timing and when you look at the tax position and we say a very small taxpayer  it s going to be under  15 million   20 million but because of the tax rules there is still some tax payments that are made  But as you know we re slowly starting with the PTCs work into 2021 than  Indecipherable   So that will not be a full taxpayer in 2021  but still when you look at our five year plan  a lot of capacity on our tax side Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd Shar  remember this particular Wind Farm doesn t come into service until the very end of 2020 Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystRight  Got it  Okay  And then just on the regulated renewables  there is obviously a lot that you re doing there  Can I just get a sense on how this could impact your decision to exercise the West Riverside option to purchase maybe up to 200 megawatts of that plant  Is there sort of a read through on that option and whether you would exercise it Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanNo  I wouldn t do any read through on that  That is still something that we are analyzing  still something we re taking a look at  As we continue to review our demand forecasts  our needs  the impact of renewables  but that is still something that s on the table  Shar Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystGot it  And then just lastly  Gale  it s a little bit more of a policy question  I mean  obviously you know  we had a commission announcement last couple of weeks ago around the resignation  So we re obviously likely going to see a bit of a democratic shift with  Indecipherable  appointment  Is there kind of any read throughs that we should be thinking about from a policy standpoint as it looks like the majority may change business as usual  or could this kind of accelerate some of the solar decarbonization plans that are out there Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanMy own sense is  I would look at any additional appointment to the Commission largely as business as usual  But I will say and remind everyone that the Governor has appointed a climate task force  He s announced an aspirational goal late last year to basically have carbon free electricity by 2050 and this task force on which our Company is represented  had its actual first meeting just a week or so ago So during this year  I think you will see some policy recommendations related to decarbonization coming out of this task force  In many ways  the Public Service Commission would in all probability need to implement some of those policy changes if they were adopted  But the policy shift that I would see coming if there is one would really come through the Governor s task force on climate change if that makes sense to you Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystIt does  That s what we thought  Well  congrats guys on continued execution Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanTerrific  And we ll see you soon Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystWe ll see you soon OperatorYour next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanGo bucks Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey  good afternoon Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanHow are you Greg Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystI m good  your stock at par today  congratulations Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanThank you   Speech Overlap   Greg  does that mean we are looking for a bogey or what does that mean Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystWe ll    we will talk about over under on the end of the year offline  Gale  I m happy to wager with you Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanVery good Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThe    Can we unpack the O M performance a little bit  Because it really is quite impressive  If I look at    if I look at page 8 of your release  I think what you re telling me I should be looking at the O M as adjusted for impact of the flow through of tax repairs  right  like that s like the clean number  And it s down dramatically and all the more so I think because when I look at the the rabbi trust activity that that s basically offset in O M by an offsetting adjustment in O M  so if I adjust it for the rabbi trust activity  the O M comparison would be even better than it looks  Is that    I think that s correct  And if so can you unpack for us what the sort of structural    you know  structural savings are that are now flowing through on a full year basis from the activities you pursued sort of permanent benefits and    and I think there was more to come with the investments you ve made in your investment in technology and things like that  So I m just wondering  a  what s the structural improvement in O M  where will it come from and b  what s the follow on from continued activities on that front Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanBe happy to  Let me frame all of this for you and then we re going to let Scott and Kevin weigh in on some of the details  but we did have an exceptional quarter in terms of continued efficiencies across the business and there are a couple of factors that I think are important here  The first is that during 2019  we saw essentially pretty much a full year benefit of the implementation of our ERP system across the entire enterprise So that was helpful  And we are continuing as people get used to that new system  We re continuing to see efficiencies and benefits that we thought we would and then compared to Q4 of a year ago  compared to Q4 of 2018  for example  there were    there were significant O M savings related to the closure of coal fired power plants Remember in    we ve basically over the last several months and year and a half or so  we ve retired three older  less efficient coal fired power plants of units at Presque Isle  up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan  were the latest to be retired in the spring of    in the spring of 2019  We have the Pulliam Plant near Green Bay retired and we had Pleasant Prairie retired So we re seeing    in the fourth quarter we saw O M benefits flow through from no longer having to incur O M for the operation of those plants  Then we had some of our technology investments continue to kick in and as Kevin said  we are projecting additional O M savings that we think we re going to gain here and we re on track to gain in 2020 So Scott  Kevin anything you d like to add Kevin Fletcher    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  You mentioned the ERP  but if you look at common platforms across our system in the fourth quarter of this year  we will complete our customer information system to have that across all of our companies  We have already seen even this past year some savings from what we had in place already  but in addition to that  through last year and focusing on the future just looking at process improvement  So as we look across our jurisdictions do benchmarking  we re looking at common standards and where it makes sense to have a proactive and a similar approaches across our system that has produced some positive results for us on O M reduction and it will continue to Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd Scott  anything to add Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I don t think there s anything else  it is across the enterprise though  Everyone has a O M takeout opportunities  efficiencies to gain Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd we re doing that  Greg  which I m very pleased about and I thought we would be able to  We re doing that while increasing customer satisfaction  So that s one of the reasons I mentioned earlier in my remarks  as we track our operational and financial performance we had a record year across virtually every meaningful measure of performance Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystRight  So there is an incremental improvement on run rate O M as you get to the sort of fully baked savings from the coal plant closures and then there wsa incremental O M benefits  but from the    that you think you ll get from the ERP and also from the rollout of the CIF among other things Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYou ve nailed it  that s exactly right Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you very much guys  Congrats Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanThank you  Greg  Appreciate it OperatorYour next question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America  Your line is open Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi howdy  how you guys doing Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWhat s shaking Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  too much  So just following up on Greg s question here  I think that s really germane  Can we dig in a little bit further as to the prospects to sustain these levels of cost reductions  I mean  they re really quite dramatic  I mean  I think Greg emphasized it enough  but the point being how sustainable are these just given how outsize they appear to be relative to the balance of the sector  not just on a trailing basis but prospectively for  20 here as you think through the balance of your planning period and maybe even to push that point a little bit further  how how identified is it    just not just in  20 but through the balance of your financial period that you re forecasting in terms of these bubbles of reduction Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWell  I ll take a stab at that  Certainly  Scott can add anything  he would like to and Kevin as well  Let me say this  We believe  and I think our track record demonstrates that the kind of cost savings that you saw that we continue to believe we re going to continue on a downward path  those are very sustainable  We wouldn t be publicly committing to them if we didn t think we could absolutely sustain them  So again we took 7  of the day to day O M out of the business in 2019 of the 2  to 3  projected reduction in 2020  And again we re doing this I think in a very highly planned and deliberate way and a good chunk of it is coming really from two areas  One  we mentioned before that we re getting the full benefit of now and that s the    the O M take out from the closure of less efficient coal fired power plants  but the other is the investment in technology  So my view guys would be highly sustainable Kevin Fletcher    President and Chief Executive OfficerGale  I would agree  We just mentioned a couple of things that we re doing  But let me add one more on the customer service side though  We have and are investing in our AMI infrastructure and we ve seen savings from having that in place to reduce the roles of truck that will continue and we ll see those opportunities ahead in the coming years Also leveraging technology like mobile apps as an example  as we get that out into our customers will it be able to have more interaction with our customers and give them opportunities to pay their bills online  minimize paper billing  things of that nature  So I would agree  the sustainability of that is built into a lot of what we re doing customer service side  especially with the things that I just mentioned Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystLet me  if I can  please to jump a little further  What about the compounding nature of that trajectory rate  2  to 3  is impressive but through your forecast  do you anticipate compounding of that trajectory  And then perhaps the really relevant second question is  you ve done it before  how do we think about the cadence of rate cases  And I know we re getting out a little bit  but just given the scale of cost reductions here  certainly the question doesn t seem too early in terms of across any of one of your jurisdictions given the enterprisewide cost reductions that are contemplated here  I mean  i e  pushing them out Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanI m chuckling because we just got through the rate reviews for 70  of our regulated assets Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI know  I recognize that  but then the cost reductions are incredible Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWell  we appreciate that  Let me say this  historically  as you know in Wisconsin  the Commission has liked and has really requested in every two year cadence for rate reviews  Now that s not to say that s set in concrete  we ll take a look at it as we go forward and see where we are and see where the Commission s sentiment is  etc  But long story short  we feel very good about our ability to execute and again do so in a way that maintains high reliability and high levels of customer satisfaction Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  Too early to tell Gale E  Klappa    Executive Chairman Indecipherable  the space Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Excellent  I ll leave it there  Thank you Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanOkay  thank you Julien OperatorYour next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanGood afternoon  Michael Michael Sullivan    Wolfe Research  LLC    AnalystYeah  hey  everyone  Just one more on the O M  what do you guys assume for earned ROEs now that you ve got this kind of different sharing band where you could over earn a little bit before you give back to customers  where does this  these O M savings targets put you on a earned ROE basis Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWe are assuming as we have in the past that we earn the allowed rates of return in each one of our retail jurisdictions Michael Sullivan    Wolfe Research  LLC    AnalystOkay  So  just to clarify  is that like at the electric utilities the 10  or up to the 10 25  that you can do before sharing Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanRight now we re assuming 10  Michael Sullivan    Wolfe Research  LLC    AnalystOkay  And then over to the    the sales growth  So I think for 2020 electric  you re forecasting down a little bit and if we go back to some of your EI slides they re supposed to be a tick up in the next couple of years and more so as you get into  22   23  Can you just give us some color around key milestones that we should be looking for on economic growth that s going to bridge that from down a little bit to up closer to 1  Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYeah  happy to Michael  First of all  the uptick that we continue to project and it s a pretty slight uptick  The uptick that we re projecting in the 2022 2023 timeframe is really driven by the amazing economic development projects that I talked about a little earlier in our remarks  We have not seen any slowdown in terms of the number of economic development projects  the amount of new construction  just a continuing economic growth and the pipeline of projects that are being announced here in Southeastern Wisconsin in particular So we still feel pretty confident about the uptick in the longer term  The shorter term  meaning for 2020 is really driven by  like for example  the large industrial segment  It s really driven by the interviews that our people have with our key account customers and feedback into our projections  It s also driven a bit by weather normalization Remember we had two warmer than normal summers  back to back  So you look at weather normalization  you look at conservation  if you look at real time feedback from our major industrial customers and you put it all together and it s like  Indecipherable  it s in there  that s what comes out  And so in total  a very modest decline  I believe Scott  0 50  is what we re projecting on retail absent the mines Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerCorrect  So a very modest decline and once again the projections that we have in the investor book are really the only projects that we know  It doesn t include the residential and secondary that we expect to come from it  It s just the known projects that have actually started turning there ready  So it just takes a while to build a building and start using that  So we expect those are still on track to be coming and like Gale said  our forecast is really out there talking to our customers and really fine tuning it and the information we have here is the best information we have Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd we re still projecting even with a modest 0 5  decline  we re still projecting 6  to 7  EPS growth Michael Sullivan    Wolfe Research  LLC    AnalystGreat  I appreciate all the color  That s all I had Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanThank you OperatorYour next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanGood afternoon  Praful  How are you Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystVery good  Congratulations on the quarter Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanThank you very much Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  So maybe just I guess the O M point has been already debated and answered  so appreciate that  I think on the energy infrastructure side  the  1 8 billion that was planned  you said you accelerated it with this latest acquisition  do you expect with the tax appetite being what it is further the down the road  do you expect that size to increase through the  20  24 timeframe or do you expect the  1 8 billion to still be the cap Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAt the moment  again  we ll continue to look at this  but at the moment I would view this as an acceleration and the  1 8 billion for the five years is still what we are looking at Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystGotcha  And then when we think about the tax appetite and you ve said that you d be a small taxpayer  how should we think about that tax paying capacity in the  23  24 timeframe  Is that    you still a small taxpayer at that point or is that capacity increasing over time Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  when you still look and your work everything in  we would still be a small taxpayer getting into that  being out in that frame of time if we execute on all these capital projects  largely because of some of the tax rules that are out there  you still have to be a minimal taxpayer for some of the reasons  but we need to execute on all these capital projects to get to that level Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanGiven the tax rules as Scott said  it s highly unlikely that we ll ever in a sustained period of time get to absolute zero  So when we say modest taxpayer  for example  I think Scott mentioned  15 million to  20 million this year  so I hope that put things in context for you Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystYeah  I know it does and I appreciate that  And then just finally in terms of credit and the holdco debt side  I think you started by saying  you ve got improving credit and your holdco debt is now down to 28   Is there any target we should be thinking about around the holdco debt level and also the FFO to debt kind of credit that we should be thinking more longer term Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWe ll let Scott answer that  we do have an internal    an internal cap on where we want to go and where we don t want to go with holdco credit    holdco debt  I m sorry Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So we look at that holdco to total debt it s down to 28   our target is to keep it below 30   Now if there is an opportunity  one year it may pop up or down  but  and we feel comfortable those ranges in our forecast here and the FFO to debt in that 16  to 18  range now  Last year we hit 18 5   but remember  we were at  it is sharing opportunity at Wisconsin utilities    that money will go back eventually to customers So next year  it may be on the lower end of that range  but still within that 16  to 18  range Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd that range as you know well supports our current credit ratings Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystYeah  Got it  All right  Really appreciate it guys  Thanks so much Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYou re more than welcome OperatorYour next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Bank  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanGood afternoon  Andrew  How are you doing today Andrew Weisel    Scotia Bank    AnalystHey  I m  OK  Good afternoon  Just want to elaborate on the contracted infrastructure projects  So as of now what percent of 2020 EPS will come from that segment and let s assume the five year plan stays at  1 8 billion  it seems like the buyers might be upside  What percent of earnings would be coming from that segment in five years Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWell  I can give you the number for this year and obviously  we can do a little bit of public math here  but long story short  we got in 2019  about  0 02 a quarter of earnings from our infrastructure investments  Given the addition this year a full year earnings for Coyote Ridge  which went into service at the end of 2019  I would expect about  0 03 a quarter  Scott Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerCorrect  Clearly about  0 03 a quarter and remember the other projects we announced are in December of next year  So some impact  but not a lot Andrew Weisel    Scotia Bank    AnalystOkay  And then bigger picture  how big are you willing to let that segment be  Obviously there are high quality contracted assets  but they re not the regulated rate base construct  So do you have sort of a mental ceiling of how big that could be as far as earnings mix Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYeah  we do  At the moment  I would say that our internal plan would hold that segment of our business down to about 10  of our earnings Andrew Weisel    Scotia Bank    AnalystOkay  very good  Then just one last one on that same topic  You said you ve accelerated the spending  but you re not increasing it  What s the limiting factor of why you re not increasing it  Is it balance sheet opportunity for specific projects  is it that 10  ceiling  you just mentioned  How do you balance those Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanIt s the happy marriage between the quality projects that we see in the pipeline that we are very interested in and our tax appetite  We have put it all together and the  1 8 billion shakes out to something that we can    we think we can both add quality projects to achieve and maximize our tax position Andrew Weisel    Scotia Bank    AnalystOkay  very good  Thank you Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYou re welcome  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanGood afternoon Michael  how are you Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystAfternoon Gale  I m doing great  Hey  just on those that last line of questioning  is there a reason why you won t or you aren t considering tax equity for continued expansion  considering the tax upside Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanNo  I mean certainly we would be open to something like that in the future if the economics worked out  Right now the economics favor exactly what we re doing Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  And on ATC  has there been any impact on long term planning from the FERC s action on ROE and MISO Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanShort answer  no Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystHas that had any effect Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanNot yet  because as you know  it s now all up in the year again  So these are    as you know very well transmission projects have a long gestation period  So I wouldn t expect there to be some kind of a knee jerk reaction in the first 30 or 60 days  particularly with all the appeals going on and the uncertainty of what the final result will be Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerExactly Gale  And we re recording at 10 38   remember our long term plan we were assuming 10 2   So 10 38  is a little north of that Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  And I may have missed this before  but where do you guys stand in terms of dividend payout ratio targets and what s the future growth rate for dividends  just going to track along with EPS at this point Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanThat s the plan  Our policy is to pay out in a range of 65  to 70  of earnings  So a dividend payout ratio that is 65  to 70  of earnings  As I mentioned earlier  we re right smack dab in the middle of that range right now  So we would project that dividend growth would be in line with the growth in earnings per share Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  That s all I got for now  Thank you Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAll right  thank you OperatorAnd your next question comes from Michael Lapides with GS  Your line is open Michael Lapides    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi guys  thanks for    Hey  Gale  thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter  I actually have several  they re all gas related and I ll just kind of rattle them off  First of all  your gas demand forecast of I think it s 0 7   Can you remind me when the last time you did sell 1  gas demand growth in Wisconsin  That s the first question The second question is  where do you stand on the permitting and regulatory approval for their gas LNG facility at Wisconsin that you talked about a couple of months ago or a while ago  And then finally any incremental thoughts on the need for new gas fired generation either as part of the transformation or just meet demand growth Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAll right  we ll be happy to try to take those off one by one  I think weather normal  we were at 1 8  on retail gas  So we had a 1 8  growth in retail gas consumption on a weather normal basis in 2019  You could probably go back in terms of when we re we last below 1   whatever year with gas natural gas prices got to double digits I think we did not grow meaningfully at all in terms of natural gas demand from the retail side of the business  Scott Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s exactly  When you think about it  yes  we ve had 3  to 4  growth  last year was 1 8  but now what we re really forecasting is really the customer growth aspect not assuming any more conservation  but also assuming that people don t turn their houses from 69 to 74  people are going to stay comfortable  We ve also seen a lot of conversions  the last couple of years from industrial or there all an environmental goals to go convert from coal and oil to natural gas  So you only convert once  So basically our forecast now is based on customer growth Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd Michael on the LNG as far as the approval process  it s under way and as I ve said in my prepared comments we expect approval and we would begin construction in the summer of 2021 for operational in 2023 Michael Lapides    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  And then on the gas generation side and kind of thinking about the mix of gas versus coal fired generation Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanMix of gas versus coal fired Michael Lapides    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  Just in terms of thinking about new gas generation needs Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWell  as you know we have an option with Alliance  That s a buy into at some point between now and say 2024  a portion of their new gas fired combined cycle that s being built right now  that option is still on the table  We haven t made a final decision  Beyond that  we don t have any plan to propose any construction of new gas fired generation and of course  regardless of whether we add gas fired generation or not  the percentage of gas fired generation in our total mix will be going up and coal will be coming down as we ve already retired about 40  of our existing coal fired generating capacity Michael Lapides    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Thank you  guys  Much appreciate it and congrats on a great quarter and great execution Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanThank you so much  Michael OperatorYour next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI  Your line is open Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst Speech Overlap   I m already losing the bet so far this year Gale  but it s one of those bets  in truth  I d be happy to lose  but anyway  I just wanted to go back to the comment on what your expectations are as they sort of bake into your earnings growth aspirations  the 5  to 7   You said that you re targeting the authorized ROE without and not assuming that you maximize your opportunity to get into the higher end of the range Should we assume that the midpoint of your guidance represents earning the authorized return and sort of like the high end represents the ability to achieve other factors like earning that extra 25 basis points or if I m not thinking about it correctly  Can you give us some guidance as how you re thinking about that opportunity and what it might mean for your guide for your earnings outlook Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanGreat question  Greg  Everybody in the room is nodding their head  you ve got it  If we were modeling it  as we know you would be  we would assume fully authorized rate of return gets us to the midpoint of the guidance and then upside from there if we were to get into sharing Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you  Thank you very much  Bye  byeGale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYou re welcome OperatorYour next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYou lost a bet last year  Mike Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystOne last question  I forgot to ask this  This is more of a strategic question but around the country  you re seeing some cities ban improvements on the natural gas distribution systems and going for full electrification of heating and everything else and obviously  the view from the Upper Midwest winter is a little bit different than places like California  but do you have any view on where this is all going in terms of natural gas infrastructure spending and you guys are kind of the experts at the turnarounds    of the turnaround business there Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWell  it s a very good question and I think you are correct  In the less    in the warmer climates and the more tempered climates  there is clearly a push by some of the more active environmentalists to not only move away from coal  but now we have a beyond gas campaign that we re seeing  For us  I think  Michael  it comes back to pure practicality and the recognition that if it s 40 below in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan  a heat pump is simply not going to keep your houses warm or even if it did  it would be so incredibly expensive that you simply couldn t deal with it So for our Upper Midwest area and with the market share that we have for home and commercial heating with natural gas  I just don t see a major churn away from that for many  many years to come  I think the other    the other piece of it is natural gas heating  natural gas furnaces continue to get even more efficient And there are better ways I think in terms of running the economy and continuing to reduce CO2 emissions  And if you look now at across the US and in the Upper Midwest  the number one contributor to CO2 emissions is no longer power generation  for example  it s transportation  I think that the low hanging fruit here in terms of continuing to decarbonize the economy  particularly in a region like the one we served is not moving away from natural gas home heating  it s actually electrification for vehicles Kevin  I don t know if you have any view on that Kevin Fletcher    President and Chief Executive OfficerGale  I think you summed it up very well  The other thing that I ll just will add is technology continues to evolve on the gas side  we ll continue to be in a part of that and looking at it  But I think you summarized our position and our philosophy very well Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanHope that responds to your question  Michael Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystYeah  Great  thank you very much  Talk to you soon OperatorYour next question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYeah  Vedula  how are you doing  Well  apparently not so well OperatorVedula Murti  your line is open Vedula Murti    Avon Capital    AnalystGood afternoon Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanHi Vedula Vedula Murti    Avon Capital    AnalystOne item I wanted to make sure I understood because you know  this is a line item and I just want to make sure  if you could explain it to me  can you explain to me what kind of how the rabbi trust works kind of how it s funded  its duration and kind of how it replicate itself over its life Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanSure  we ll be happy to take a stab at it and I m going to let Scott do that  I will say this  we have to make sure that all of you don t look at the rabbi trust in isolation  As in many ways  the rabbi trust is    the earnings in the rabbi trust offset the cost of some of our benefit plans  And I think conceptually  that s an important point to remember  Scott Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  that s exactly it Gale  So the rabbi trust is really set up by Integrys and we ve inherited that investment vehicle and that is related to some of the deferred compensation that individuals from Integrys had earned through the years  So what the rabbi trust does is what we do is we try to match the best we can the expense of the deferred comp that s in the utilities with the investments in this rabbi trust So if the rabbi trust goes up a dollar usually the deferred comp expense goes up a dollar or vice versa  So it s really trying to match that  We have those funds they re tied up  specifically for the deferred comp  So there is nothing else we can use for them  So we have to do and we ve thought the best thing to do was try to mirror and match the hedging as much as possible Like Gale said though  you can t look at it in isolation  just for accounting purposes it has to be on this line  Indecipherable  recorded Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd Vedula so far  and again we inherited that in 2015 with the Integrys acquisition  So far our strategy  our matching strategy  if you will  has worked exceptionally well Vedula Murti    Avon Capital    AnalystSo as I think about this  is it    is the variance here tied to stock market performance  or performance of Wisconsin equity  Wisconsin Energy s equity specifically or what creates the    what creates the variances both up and down on this Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAll right  And again we ll let Scott give you more detail but long story short  we know what investment options are people who ve got the deferred comp are in  In other words  we know what investment options they ve selected  We can    we can blend that with our investment options in the rabbi trust Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And a lot of the investment options are dealing with equities in the deferred comp and that s what we re trying to match it the best we can  It s not perfect  but the best we can with equities in the rabbi trust and so far the correlation has been pretty high Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd like 99  been really good Vedula Murti    Avon Capital    AnalystAnd so this is a static thing going forward  There is no new participants or incremental    Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanNo  no new participants Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt s static and it slowly goes down as participants withdraw from the old Integrys deferred comp  So it s slowly going down Vedula Murti    Avon Capital    AnalystOkay  And I guess also I guess  and the other thing obviously this is    this is clearly part of the strategies in terms of the    on the income tax expense line in terms of the wind credits and everything like that  clearly  if we take a look at page ten  say a major that s a very important positive factor and year over year  it is very large increase  how should we be thinking about that in terms of within the our earnings guidance range  about the variance going forward there Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWe can certainly give you the comparison of what we achieved in terms of the Infrastructure segment earnings in 2019 versus our projection in 2020  And as I mentioned earlier  the Infrastructure segment gave us about  0 02 a share uptick in earnings each quarter during 2019  And with the addition of Coyote Ridge Wind Farm in South Dakota  which went commercial at the end of last year and will give us a full year this year  we would expect  0 03 a quarter from the infrastructure investments in wind Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And I think overall when you look at it    that s including the unprotected we re giving back in the credits to our customers that effective tax rate is in that 16  to 17  range Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd to clarify  we earn incremental penny a quarter in 2020 in terms of the earnings Vedula Murti    Avon Capital    AnalystYeah  So given the fully diluted share count it would appear then that  that variance should be something similar not as dramatic year over year Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYeah  that s exactly right Vedula Murti    Avon Capital    AnalystOkay  And it s only about three weeks to pitchers catchers  so how are the Brewers Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanBrewers are interesting  they re kind of reshuffling the deck a little bit  just signed a pitcher yesterday  but I m more focused right now on 41 and 6 for the Bucks Vedula Murti    Avon Capital    AnalystOkay  Well  good luck there  thank you Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanThank you  Vedula OperatorAnd your last question comes    I m sorry    your next question comes from Andrew Levi with Exodus Point  Your line is open Andrew Levi    Exodus Point    AnalystYeah  that Greek freak Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanHey  Andy  how are you Andrew Levi    Exodus Point    AnalystI m doing great  love watching them play  I m sure you do too  have you got a big game tomorrow  down to Denver though Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWe do  we do  Yeah  yeah  But I think Janis  Phonetic  will be back in the lineup Andrew Levi    Exodus Point    AnalystYeah  I hope so  So just kind of following Michael Weinstein s questions and just on kind of natural gas  I guess  and you ve kind of answered it already  but just also just in the context of like ESG and obviously ESG seems not to be favoring natural gas  So maybe just explain how you deal with that and then separately  and I agree with everything that you had said earlier about nat gas Is kind of looking at kind of the landscape and if you look at LDCs or companies that are very    having natural gas  their stocks have not done as well of late  and the multiples have come down  And so I m just wondering kind of where your  Indecipherable  that  And at the right price would you add gas distribution customers to your mix beyond what you have already obviously you have a large LDC in Illinois and a smaller one in Wisconsin Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWell  good question  Andy  you know  you never say never  but let me put it this way  at the right price obviously hitting the three criteria that we ve talked about for acquisitions and we would always take a hard look  I would though because you recognize if you re making an acquisition of any kind of Company LDC or not you re basically making a very long term bet Our assets  as you know are very long lived assets  So would and I m saying this just theoretically if an LDC in North Dakota came up for sale at the right price  we probably would be a lot more interested in that than if it was in San Diego Andrew Levi    Exodus Point    AnalystI understand and then just as far as ESG and how you kind of think maybe obviously that it s an evolving idea or investment basis  Do you think as far as natural gas  they ve gone or not they  but it may not be the right way to look at it and there are other things to focus on the ESG side Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanWell  again a good question  Andy  My sense  and we ve done    we ve done dozens of ESG visits  Right now  and I think for the foreseeable future  the ESG focus for infrastructure companies like ours seems to be heavily  heavily focused on CO2 emissions and what s your plan is to basically decarbonize the generation fleet That swamps any other kind of discussion that we ve had with any ESG oriented investor and again we ve had hundreds of these discussions over the course of the last couple of years  In fact  everyone now whether you are ESG focused or not everyone is beginning to ask ESG questions  but I would say that in 99 out of 100 meetings  the real focus is on is really on CO2 emissions and there we ve got a great story to tell The other thing that I would point out and we are one of the first utilities in the country to set a methane reduction goal and I think you re going to be seeing because the climate scientist as you know  really believe that methane emissions are far  far more potent  perhaps 25 times more potent than CO2 is a greenhouse gas I think you re going to be seeing some increasing focus on methane emissions and there the kind of upgrade work we re doing to modernize the natural gas distribution network  particularly in Chicago is really important  So those are the kinds  that s the flavor of what we re    of what we re hearing in our ESG visits today  Andy Andrew Levi    Exodus Point    AnalystOkay  thank you  Gale and  Speech Overlap Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYou re welcome  Well  thank you OperatorAnd your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates  Your line is open Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanPaul  you re last  but not least Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates LLC    AnalystI hope not  So let me ask you something here  Just to follow up on Vedula s question  The rabbi trust if I understand your answer  basically is offset by deferred comp expense  so there really isn t any net income benefit of any significance  you see driving earnings going forward or in terms of results for 2019  am I understanding it correctly Scott J  Lauber    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerCorrect  2019 may have been an anomaly because we had so much O M coming out of the utility that we are into the sharing  but for the most part there is no benefit from that at all  but it would have been small amount Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanAnd nothing Paul that we re planning on in terms of benefit for 2020 Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates LLC    AnalystOkay  And then in terms of Foxconn  there is some local articles about the adverse administration looking at renegotiating the tax benefits because of I guess the way the Foxconn thing has been sort of rolling out  and I was wondering if you had anything to share on that or what does that mean in terms of the outlook for the the Foxconn to economic development contributions that you guys have been expecting  Indecipherable  Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanRight  Good point  Let me just reiterate first what I mentioned in our prepared remarks and that over the past two years Foxconn has invested already over  500 million in Wisconsin  I can tell you again  I ve said before  focus on what s going on in the campus rather than the media reports  But I can tell you  I was actually with the Governor yesterday  He and I appeared together at an economic development conference here in Milwaukee  and he went out of his way to say that he believes his responsibility is to help make Foxconn successful in Wisconsin  So again that s as of 9 30 yesterday morning in a very definitive comment from the Governor himself Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates LLC    AnalystOkay  great  And then just finally on the wind transaction with Google  as the offtake  but that s for the life of the project  Is that correct Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanSo that would be a 12 year offtake agreement Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates LLC    AnalystThat s 12 years  OK  and then just generally speaking  given the credit quality of Google and stuff  just to make sure I understand this  That s a better rate of return that you re getting  you guys perceived    you guys expect to get a better return associated with that project than what you re getting in your regulated business  do I understand you guys right in that Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYou understand us absolutely correctly and the experience that we ve had so far with the other infrastructure investments that are operational  experience in 2019 is proving that out Paul Patterson    Glenrock Associates LLC    AnalystOkay  awesome  Thanks so much Gale E  Klappa    Executive ChairmanYou re welcome  Thanks for the call  All right  well folks that concludes our long conference call for today  Thank you so much for participating  If you have any other questions we re always available  please contact Beth Straka

It was no surprise  therefore  to see the stock sell off over the following weeks  but note the wicks to many of these candles  they are all to the lower body suggesting price support and buying into the weakness to be followed by the two bar reversal in mid April  This has provided the springboard for the current rally once again characterized by lower wicks and rising prices on good volume  Immediately ahead on the weekly chart we now have a low volume node  and with little in the way of price resistance  and no doubt helped with a recovery in the indices  should take the stock through the minor resistance at  80 and on towards  81 and beyond in due course ",2019-05-14,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/not-all-ships-rise-and-fall-with-the-tide-200421445,200421445

141596,363111,WEC,5 Stocks To Avoid If The Fed Hikes Rates,opinion,There has been an unending stream of debate about the possibility of a rate hike by the Fed at the September meeting that is currently underway  The much awaited decision will be delivered at 2 p m  today  followed by a conference by Fed Chairwoman  Janet Yellen The past few weeks have seen a number of Fed officials providing mixed comments regarding a rate hike in September  If the FOMC does not hike the interest rate this month  the next probability for the same lies in December  No changes are expected in the November meeting due to the proximity to the general elections as well as the lack of a scheduled press conference by the Chair post the meeting The Fed StanceThe probability of a rate hike at the September meeting increased significantly after Yellen s speech at Jackson Hole where she stated that the case for a rate hike had  strengthened in recent months   Post the speech  another voting Fed member  Fischer  acknowledged that Yellen s comments could mean a rate hike in September and perhaps two hikes in the year Earlier in the month  several Fed officials commented on the need for a rate hike  While some expect and advocate it sooner this month  some believe the Fed can afford to be patient for a hike later this year  A number of financial analysts and economists are expecting the hike this month itself  Although a near term hike is uncertain  the probability of a rate hike before the year is out remains high Utility  A Sector to AvoidUtility stocks are a favorite with conservative investors  The companies in this space provide low risk stocks with a high yield  making them particularly appealing in a bearish market  However  utilities are an expensive business to ensure maintenance of nonstop supply of basic amenities including fresh water  gas and electricity  which require a large inflow of funds  The capital intensive companies are subject to significant adverse impact caused by interest rate hikes Utility companies typically have high levels of debt as they require constant infusion of funds for organic growth as well as for infrastructure upgrade projects  The funds generated from the operations of the company are utilized more for dividend payouts  with a relatively lower percentage being invested back as capital An increase in interest rates would raise the borrowing costs considerably  weighing on profits which in turn will affect the dividend paying capacity of these companies  Moreover  companies in the sector are preferred over bonds due to their high dividend yields  But a higher interest rate would make bonds more appealing to investors  An increase in the interest rate would likely adversely impact utility companies by making it costlier for them to borrow funds Stocks to AvoidWe have screened five utility stocks that should be avoided if the Fed hikes rates  These stocks already pay out a relatively low dividend yield compared to the rest of the companies in the sector  If the Fed raises rates  the dividend yield might fall further  thus reducing the appeal of these companies Moreover  these stocks have been trading near their 52 week high prices  If the companies in the sector face a contraction  these stocks are likely to plunge lower than their counterparts  The fact that these stocks hold a sell rated Zacks Rank further supports our expectation Black Hills Corporation   NYSE BKH   is an energy company that generates wholesale electricity and produces natural gas  crude oil and coal  The company s
