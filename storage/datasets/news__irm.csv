14731,236246,IRM,Factors To Impact Iron Mountain  IRM  This Earnings Season,opinion,Iron Mountain Inc    NYSE IRM   is set to release second quarter 2019 results on Aug 1  before the market opens  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in revenues  while its funds from operations  FFO  per share might register a decline In the last reported quarter  this real estate investment trust s  REIT  normalized FFO of 48 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents  Results reflected higher labor costs in its North America businesses in March and lower than expected growth in revenues Over the preceding four quarters  the company surpassed the FFO per share estimates on three occasions and missed in the other  the average positive surprise being 1 44   This is depicted in the graph below Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain has been making significant efforts to shift its revenue mix to faster growing businesses  like emerging markets  data center and other complementing business segments  In line with this  during the second quarter  the company expanded its footprint in Bangkok with the acquisition of InfoZafe s storage and information management services business  With this acquisition  the company aims to focus on faster growing Asian markets and enhance returns for its regional business by capitalizing on the global digital transformation trend Hence  this shift in business mix will continue to drive the company s revenues and boost its adjusted EBITDA margins  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues from storage is pinned at  666 million  indicating year over year growth of around 13  Additionally  the company s geographically diversified and large scale property portfolio is anticipated to support its upcoming results  In addition to a leading market position in the North American storage and information management market  the company enjoys recurring storage rental revenues  Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter 2019 revenues is pinned at  1 07 billion  calling for a 0 5  year over year improvement Although the company s storage and record management business is sought to be durable  stored records itself are becoming obsolete  Further  falling activity rates and unfavorable price of recycled paper have been depressing Iron Mountain s service revenues  Understandably  the company s total adjusted service revenues for the quarter under review will likely decline 2 2  year over year to  391 million Moreover  service revenue activity level from the company s North American Data Management Business segment witnessed fall in the first quarter  This will likely continue in the second quarter as well  with storage rentals from Iron Mountain s North America data management business predicted to slip 4 3  year over year to  66 million  In addition  in the first quarter  Iron Mountain s results were negatively impacted by rise in storage operating expenses and higher labor costs in the company s North America business  This has likely continued into the second quarter as well  dragging down the company s adjusted EBITDA margins Also  the competitive landscape of the records and information management industry is anticipated to have resulted in aggressive pricing  denting Iron Mountain s margins  In fact  revenues from the company s North American records and information management business are expected to have remained flat year over year to  539 million Lastly  prior to the second quarter earnings release  the company s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter FFO remained unchanged at 51 cents in a month s time  In addition  it indicates an 8 9  year over year decline Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at

What s Next for Iron Mountain 
While Iron Mountain has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Iron Mountain was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  0 58 on  1 08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 22 on  4 29 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

You can see 
Microsoft s shares have gained  29 4  in the past year  outperforming the S P 500 s  gain of  2 4  during the same period  Microsoft is benefiting from growing user base of its different applications like Office 365 commercial  Dynamics  Outlook mobile and Teams  Moreover  Azure s expanding customer base is a key catalyst  
Microsoft s gaming segment is performing well  primarily driven by a combination of Xbox Live  Game Pass subscriptions and Mixer  which are driving user engagement  Further  acquisitions like PlayFab and GitHub expand Microsoft s total addressable market  TAM  and penetration  Additionally  expanding partner base is notable  
However  projections of a moderating growth rate in commercial cloud gross margin  and OEM Pro and Windows commercial businesses is a headwind  Moreover  stiff competition from the like of Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Sony and Nintendo remains a headwind 
 You can   
Shares of Home Depot have gained  32 8  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Retail Building Products industry s  28 3  increase  The Zacks analyst thinks that this is attributable to a positive earnings surprise trend recorded for more than five years  which continued in second quarter fiscal 2019  
Earnings benefited from progress on strategic investments as well as a favorable U S  consumer backdrop and a steady housing market  Meanwhile  the company s top line lagged estimates but improved year over year on robust comps performance  Its efforts to provide an interconnected shopping experience to customers  with innovative products and improved productivity  position it for growth  
Despite these gains  lumber price deflation remained a drag on the company s sales and comps in the fiscal second quarter  Further  it slashed its sales and comps view for fiscal 2019 on lumber price deflation and fears of potential impacts of the newly enacted tariffs

AbbVie s shares have lost  27 3  year to date  versus the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s decline of  0 6   AbbVie beat estimates for earnings and sales in the second quarter and raised its earnings guidance for the second time this year  
The Zacks analyst thinks AbbVie s key drug  Humira  is performing well based on strong demand trends despite new competition  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential  AbbVie has been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta  
Moreover  it has an impressive late stage pipeline  comprising several products with multibillion dollar potential expected to be launched in the near term  The acquisition of Allergan  NYSE AGN   if successful  should diversify AbbVie s revenue base and accelerate its non Humira business  Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets is a big headwind in 2019

141085,362600,IRM,Why Iron Mountain Stock Declined 2  Last Year,news,"What happened
Shares of Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM  lost 1 67  in 2019  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence 
A high valuation on the shares and slow revenue growth have caused the stock price to remain flattish in recent years  Through the first three quarters of 2019  revenue advanced by just 0 6  year over year  while earnings from continuing operations were up 9 6   

So what
Iron Mountain is a leader in helping organizations store and retrieve data and records  Despite single digit growth on the top line  the stock typically trades at a high price to earnings ratio because of the company s high margins and visibility in revenue  But since the company already does business with 95  of Fortune 1000 companies  there hasn t been enough growth in Iron Mountain s core market to move the stock higher lately 
Now what
Management has been investing in higher growth areas  including emerging markets and new sales categories like fine art  entertainment services  and consumer storage  Iron Mountain also has a growing data center business  which made up 5  of total revenue in 2018  
Also  through an initiative called Project Summit  Iron Mountain is targeting cost cuts over the next few years as it reinvests resources in greener pastures  Management expects the project to add about  200 million in annual EBITDA by 2022  That would provide a modest bump to current EBITDA  which is expected to come in at  1 43 billion to  1 45 billion for 2019  
As investors wait for some of these initiatives to take effect  the stock currently pays a dividend yield of 8   That looks attractive at first glance  but keep in mind that future dividend increases may be limited  The payout ratio is currently 177   which means Iron Mountain is paying out more than it makes in annual profits  However  one of the goals with Project Summit is to increase cash flow to allow for more dividend increases over the long term  
But investors might want to think twice before buying the stock strictly for the dividend  If profits don t grow as expected  that could mean dividend cuts down the road ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pf311,2054447
141086,362601,IRM,Is Iron Mountain Stock a Buy ,news,"Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM  is something of an anomaly among real estate investment trusts  REITs   There is  quite literally  no other REIT exactly like it  for reasons I ll explain shortly  Now add in 10 years  worth of annual dividend increases and a roughly 8  dividend yield  and income investors should be intrigued  Here s a primer on what you need to know before you decide to pull the trigger on this high yield REIT 
The good stuff
Iron Mountain s core business is providing storage for paperwork  OK  that might not be exactly what you were expecting when I said it was unique  However  this is a pretty sizable business  and Iron Mountain is a giant in the space  It hardly has a monopoly  but it certainly has a scale that few  if any  can match 

What s particularly nice about this business is that once a company puts boxes of paperwork into Iron Mountain s care  it very rarely wants them back  And companies certainly don t want to take their boxes and move them to a new provider  To put some numbers on that  Iron Mountain has a 98  customer retention rate  and roughly 50  of the boxes for which it is responsible remain in its care for at least 15 years  This is a sticky business  
This core physical world operation is helping to fund an expansion into the digital realm    so Iron Mountain isn t a one trick pony  and it isn t sitting on its laurels  It is using its existing connections with business partners to sell the data center services it is building out  Look at it as providing storage in a new  high tech way  It currently has 14 data centers located in key markets around the world  Over time  investors should expect this new business to become Iron Mountain s main business   
That said  with the long term nature of its physical storage operations  a full digital makeover could take a very long time  This isn t a bad thing  however  because it means that Iron Mountain can take its time  and there s plenty of leeway for minor missteps along the way 
The bad stuff
So far  so good  but there s always something to worry about 
The first key issue is that Iron Mountain s physical storage business feeds a number of service oriented businesses it runs  This is a mixed blessing  and I could have mentioned it in the section above  However  demand for services waxes and wanes  so this revenue isn t as stable as the fees Iron Mountain earns for storing boxes  For example  services revenue fell 3 7  in the third quarter of 2019  and it was down 1 9  through the first nine months of that year  It is an important part of the company s business  but one that isn t exactly a stable grower  
The next negative is related to the first one  The business of storing boxes full of paper is mature and  in developed markets  in decline  It is a slow decline  to be sure  and one that the company s digital transformation is meant to address  But the paper storage business is really a cash cow  not a growth engine  And as it slowly withers  many of the services that Iron Mountain provides  like shredding  will shrink with it  So the digital push is a necessity  and vitally important to the REIT s long term future  It has to go well or Iron Mountain s future will be bleak 
Iron Mountain s 8  yield  meanwhile  is fairly high  given that the average REIT  using the Vanguard Real Estate Index ETF as a proxy  is about 3 4   Why so high  One of the big reasons is that Iron Mountain s debt load is material  with financial debt to equity sitting at roughly 0 93 times  Even though there really isn t a direct peer to which Iron Mountain can be compared  that ratio is well above those of some of the bellwether names in the REIT space  To be fair  the recurring nature of Iron Mountain s revenue suggests it can handle the debt burden  And it is building out a new business  which requires cash to construct and buy new assets  So there s a reason for the leverage  But that doesn t mean investors can ignore that leverage 

IRM Financial Debt to Equity  Quarterly  data by YCharts
Finally  there s dividend growth and dividend safety  During the third quarter conference call  Iron Mountain announced that dividend growth would be slowing down so it could free up more cash to invest in its digital business  That s a mixed blessing  with management highlighting that it is better  long term  for investors that the company supply the demand in this new business by expanding than grow the dividend at a higher rate  This is probably true  That said  the third quarter was the first time in a year that the dividend was actually covered by funds from operations  FFO   which are like earnings for an industrial company  
The REIT would likely argue that its adjusted FFO  AFFO   a non standard figure  is higher than its FFO  which is true  So the dividend coverage is probably better than it looks  Only the company doesn t give an easy way to see that  because it doesn t report AFFO per share  To put some numbers on this one  the FFO payout ratio was roughly 98  in the third quarter  it was over 100  in the four previous quarters   while the AFFO payout ratio was a touch under 80  once you go through the step of dividing the gross AFFO number by the number of shares outstanding 
There s a big difference there in terms of dividend safety  and investors can t afford to simply buy Iron Mountain and forget they own it  Indeed  a heavy debt load and skimpy FFO dividend coverage are two important warning signs that a dividend could be at risk  
What to do 
Conservative investors should probably err on the side of caution here and not buy Iron Mountain  The heavy debt load  plan to slow dividend growth  and a tight FFO payout ratio are risks that probably aren t worth the sleepless nights  However  dividend investors with a bit more risk tolerance might want to take a deep dive  The company has clearly seen that it needs to change  and is taking action to do just that  The transition period will take some time to work through  but if Iron Mountain is successful in the shift toward digital storage investors will likely reward it with a higher price  The hefty 8  yield will pay you well for sticking out the ups and downs as the company works to shift in the new direction  Just make sure you keep an eye on the debt load and the dividend coverage as you monitor the progress management is making ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pi98k,2059763
141087,362602,IRM,Iron Mountain  IRM  To Post Q3 Earnings  What s In The Cards  ,opinion,Iron Mountain Incorporated   NYSE IRM   is set to release third quarter 2019 results on Oct 31  before the market opens  The company s results will likely reflect year over year  y y  growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this real estate investment trust  REIT  posted normalized FFO of 54 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents  Results reflected organic growth in its storage rental revenues Over the preceding four quarters  the company surpassed the FFO per share estimates on three occasions and missed in the other  the average positive surprise being 1 50   This is depicted in the graph below Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain enjoys a steady stream of recurring revenues from its core storage and record management businesses  RIM   This is expected to have buoyed its top line growth for third quarter 2019 as well  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter storage rental revenues from its North America RIM segment is pinned at  315 million  indicating y y growth of 2 6  Further  Iron Mountain has been making diligent efforts to enhance its storage segment performance by focusing on expansion in international markets  specifically  the emerging ones  These efforts are anticipated to have driven the company s revenues and net operating income  NOI  during the September end quarter In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly storage revenues is pinned at  673 million  calling for y y growth of 2 4   Further  the third quarter storage NOI is expected to improve 4 5  year over year to  556 million Moreover  Iron Mountain s strategy to supplement its storage segment s performance with expansion in faster growing adjacent businesses  primarily data centers  is expected to have aided the company s quarterly performance  In fact  data center wins have strengthened the company s data center platform  This is expected to result in a 6 4  sequential increase in third quarter revenues from global data center business However  as archiving of original hard copy documents losses its relevance  paper needs are shrinking at the enterprise level  resulting in contraction of physical storage volume  Further  volume decline in North America has resulted in aggressive pricing  which is expected to have kept the company s margins under pressure in the quarter under review In fact  third quarter storage rental revenues from the company s North America data management segment are expected to have recorded y y decline of 1 4  to  67 million In fact  service revenue activity level from the company s North America data management segment witnessed persistent fall in first half 2019  This trend is expected to have continued in the third quarter  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues from the North American data management segment is pegged at  95 million  calling for a decline of 2  year on year Lastly  the company s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter FFO remained unchanged at 58 cents over the past month  Nonetheless  it indicates 5 4  improvement year over year Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn t conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Iron Mountain this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of a FFO beat  That is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best

141089,362604,IRM,Iron Mountain  IRM  Beats Q3 FFO Estimates,opinion,"Iron Mountain  IRM  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  0 62 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 59 per share  This compares to FFO of  0 55 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 5 08   A quarter ago  it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of  0 51 per share when it actually produced FFO of  0 54  delivering a surprise of 5 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times 
Iron Mountain  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  posted revenues of  1 06 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 30   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 06 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Iron Mountain shares have added about 3 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 5  
What s Next for Iron Mountain 
While Iron Mountain has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Iron Mountain was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  0 63 on  1 09 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 29 on  4 29 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

141090,362605,IRM,3 Bargain REITs Paying 8    But Cheap For A Reason  ,opinion,"Income hunters that made their way into real estate investment trusts  REITs  at the start of 2019 are rolling in more than rent checks right now  Not only did they enjoy the sector s generous dividends  they enjoyed big price gains to boot 

Even the  dumbly indexed  Vanguard Real Estate ETF  NYSE VNQ  peeled off a sweet 28 9  in total returns last year  That s its best showing since 2014  and more than double its average annual return of 11  plus over the past decade 
But do these big 2019 gains mean that we re due to regress in 2020 
I ve previously warned about the   Not only are we limiting our upside with expensive shares  but overpriced property owners tend to yield less  too 
Unfortunately  today  the entire sector looks quite expensive  REITs on average are trading for almost 19 times funds from operations  FFO  a quintessential profitability metric for real estate companies   I typically want to buy into REITs when they re cheaper from a P FFO perspective  Our pickings are slim 
However  not every REIT followed the sector into the clouds in 2019  In fact  a few took it on the chin  and as a result trade far cheaper than their lofty peers and sport screaming dividends to boot 
Could This Troubled Trio Turn It Around in 2020 






These three beaten down REITs are cheap in terms of their cash flows  and boast yields all the way up to 8 6   But are they cheap for a reason 

Taubman Centers  NYSE TCO 
Dividend Yield  8 6 
Price FFO  6 2
Let s start out with Taubman Centers  TCO   which is quite cheap at a mere 6 2 times its trailing 12 month funds from operations 
Taubman is a retail REIT  which immediately answers the question  What happened   once you discover that TCO s stock plunged 32  in 2019 
Specifically  Taubman owns  manages and or leases 26 regional  super regional and outlet shopping centers in the U S   that s a problem  and in Asia  more encouraging  







To the company s credit  it has been working for years to improve various aspects of the business  Taubman s tenant mix is much more diversified than it once was  which has driven more than three consecutive years  worth of quarterly tenant per square foot sales growth  It s also been dealing with its debt issues  extending its primary line of credit and selling 50  of its interest in Starfield Hanam  to real estate funds managed by Blackstone  NYSE BX   to raise  300 million in cash 
Indeed  if you look at the company s operational performance since 2016  it would appear that 2019 s thud which included a disappointing third quarter report that investors met with ire was merely an anomaly 
But one of the factors impacting that Q3 report is a reminder of the uphill climb Taubman and most traditional shopping center REITs have to contend with  dying retailers  CEO Robert Taubman said in the most recent conference call that the bankruptcy of Forever 21 had a  significant impact   That s despite the loss of just two of Forever 21 s locations 
The dividend is at least for real  The payout has been growing steadily for years and represents only 73  of this year s full year FFO estimates  But an uncertain landscape for brick and mortar retail puts most retail REITs in question  Taubman might be set up for a dead cat bounce simply because it s so cheap  But a long term retirement solution  Hardly 

 Hersha Hospitality Trust   NYSE HT 
Dividend Yield  8 3 
Price FFO  6 6
Hersha is a bi coastal hotel REIT sporting a collection of 48 hotels  totaling more than 7 600 rooms  in cities such as New York  Boston  Los Angeles and Washington  D C  Its properties house high quality upscale  luxury and lifestyle transient hotels  spanning well known brand names such as Hyatt  H  and Marriott  MAR   but also independent hotels such as Philadelphia s five diamond The Rittenhouse 

That didn t matter in 2019  Almost everyone in the hospitality real estate industry struggled   Pebblebrook Hotel Trust   NYSE PEB  lost 5    CorePoint Lodging   NYSE CPLG  fell by 13   Hersha  though  was among the worst at a 17  loss 
I believe in lodging s potential long term  and catering to upper class customers is almost a winning formula more often than not  But Hersha s 2019 isn t an isolated incident  Just look at how funds from operations have been trending over the past few years 






While CEO Jay Shah expresses quite a bit of optimism in the company s quarterly results  as well as some legitimately strong results in important hotel metrics such as RevPAR  the fact remains that it s struggling in key markets  most notably New York City 
HT s payment has remained flat for almost five years now as a result of its weak results  and as I frequently preach    for better or worse 
Upscale Hotels  But Downmarket Price Action






Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM 
Dividend Yield  8 1 
Price FFO  10 8
Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM  is truly a rare breed of a REIT  providing something that many companies still need  shredding and document storage 
It provides a lot more than that  too  out of necessity  As companies go increasingly paperless  that s less product for Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM  to keep locked up or destroy  So it has branched out into data centers  document scanning  analytics and workflow automation 
But it s not happening fast enough 






The  first level  numbers don t seem to indicate that  Growth has been pretty steady of late  albeit with a hiccup in 2019 
The problems lie underneath  For instance  consider that through nine months in 2019  data center operations accounted for just 6  of revenues  Data management accounted for 9   Records and information management  which includes its shredding business  was half IRM s year to date sales  and that part of the business continues to shrink 
It s clear management isn t pleased with its progress on modernizing  The day of its earnings release  it also announced a  transformation program  called Project Summit that s  designed to accelerate execution of Iron Mountain s stated strategy  In a nutshell  it s simplifying its org structure and streamlining management  cutting costs  
That s not to say IRM can t become a digital juggernaut somewhere much farther down the line  but for now  its legacy business is in decline while it struggles to make hay in where its future lies 
The final strike against Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM  for now  Its pace of dividend growth over the past four years 
2016   13 2017   6 8 2018   4 2019   1 2 These 8   yields are far from perfect  which is why their stocks are trading a such steep discounts  But it is possible to find bargain yields that are a bit more ideal for your retirement portfolio  Dare I say  these stocks are near perfect for any retiree hoping to live on dividends forever 
 Perfect  Retirement Income   Start 2020 By Quadrupling Your Yield
There s nothing inherently  safe  about 7  8  yields 
What makes a high level of income right for retirement is a company s ability to sustain and grow that payout over time while still funneling money into growing the business 
That s what allows you to afford your home  afford your utilities and afford a high quality of life  even if the broader stock market doesn t cooperate 
You can lock up that level of safety from the dividend rich stocks in my 






Nest eggs are being stretched paper thin because medical innovations are helping us live longer than ever before  meaning retirement accounts must last far longer than they were ever intended to  But this is 2020  not 2000  10 year Treasuries don t pay 6 6  anymore they pay 1 8   The 2  3  yields on most Dow stocks just won t cut it  either 
Instead  investors especially those with more modest nest eggs need roughly 3x to 4x the yield of the broader market  And those substantial income checks need to survive not just through 2021 or 2022  but literally decades down the road 
My Perfect Income Portfolio offers exactly that  In fact  several of my readers have emailed me to tell me this portfolio has literally doubled  tripled  or in a few cases actually quadrupled their annual income 
Also  this is a buy and hold portfolio  This isn t a crazy options tactic or a set of short term swing trades  It s just a set of under the radar  contrarian income plays that can quickly build your wealth without piling on the extra risk of gambling on newspapers and dying retailers

on Feb 3  after market close  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in its funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Pasadena  CA based urban office real estate investment trust  REIT   which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses  delivered an in line performance with respect to FFO per share  Results reflected decent internal and external growth  The company witnessed continued strong leasing activity and rental rate growth during this period Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions  met in another and missed in the other  It came up with an average positive surprise of 0 45  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history Alexandria Real Estate Equities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderStrong leasing activity and rental rate growth helped Alexandria excel in the first nine months of the year  Given the company s portfolio of high quality and well located life science assets in key life science clusters  this trend is expected to have continued in the fourth quarter as well Additionally  high demand for Alexandria s Class A properties in AAA locations is likely to have boosted occupancy in the company s portfolio in the December end quarter  This  in turn  is expected to have driven decent rent escalations and positive rent spreads However  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the October December period remained unchanged at  1 79  over the past 30 days  Nonetheless  it suggests year over year growth of 6 6  For full year 2019  the company expects adjusted FFO per share of  6 95  6 97   The company s 2019 guidance is backed by expectations for occupancy in North America  as of Dec 31  2019  in the band of 96 7 97 3   rental rate increases for lease renewals  and re leasing of space of 28 31   and same property NOI growth of 1 5 3 5   Notably  the Zacks Consensus estimate for full year 2019 FFO per share is currently pinned at  6 97  indicating 5 6  growth year on year Key Developments in Q4On Nov

manufacturing production and next generation cell  Further  it will offer a workforce development platform that will accelerate translation of emerging technologies into cost effective and high impact medicines aimed at preventing  treating and curing devastating diseases  This will improve patient lives and reduce the cost burden of diseases on society Alexandria has played a pivotal role in developing life science cluster in the Greater Boston area  It has provided leading life science companies with highly effective  first in class infrastructure and strategic venture capital  thereby facilitating innovation  job growth and economic diversity in this significant cluster  In fact  its asset base in Greater Boston spans more than 6 5 million RSF of office laboratory space that is highly leased  This includes 5 million RSF in the Cambridge submarket Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Alexandria this

This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 7 69   A quarter ago  it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of  0 54 per share when it actually produced FFO of  0 55  delivering a surprise of 1 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times 
Iron Mountain  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  posted revenues of  1 06 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 19   This compares to year ago revenues of  991 24 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Iron Mountain shares have added about 10 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 8  
What s Next for Iron Mountain 
While Iron Mountain has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions

141198,362713,IRM,REITs To Watch For Earnings On Apr 26  DLR  IRM  KIM   CUBE,opinion,We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust  REIT  space is bustling with activity  In fact  there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week  of which Digital Realty Trust   NYSE DLR    Iron Mountain Incorporation   NYSE IRM    Kimco Realty Corporation   NYSE KIM   and Cubesmart   NYSE CUBE   will release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26 Per our latest   total  Sector earnings for the Jan Mar quarter are expected to be up 27  on 4 7  increase in revenues  as compared to the prior year quarter  In fact  the sector witnessed 0 6  earnings growth in the prior quarter  primarily due to 4  rise in revenues Notably  with the underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs  performance  not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind  this season Therefore  let s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above mentioned REITs  first quarter results Digital Realty Trust is a data center REIT that offers colocation and interconnection solutions for domestic and international tenants through its portfolio of data centersNotably  data center REITs have been experiencing a boom market  of late  Additionally  demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  Other than enjoying high occupancy  these markets are also absorbing new construction at a faster pace  Further  according to a Cisco forecast  data center IP traffic is projected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 25   over the 2016 2021 period Notably  Digital Realty  with its high quality date centers  is well poised to benefit from this trend  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for occupancy of 90  for the first quarter indicates year over year growth of 1 1  However  Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry  In fact  the company competes with several data center developers  owners and operators  many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty  Also  there are a number of local developers in the United States  and several regional operators in Europe  Asia and Australia  Amid this  aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data center market in the quarter to be reported   Read more   Hence  prior to the first quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations  FFO  per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at  1 57  over the past month Moreover  our proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive   and a bullish Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  In fact  though Digital Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3  its Earnings ESP of  0 25  makes surprise prediction difficult Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four occasions  the average beat being nearly 2 18   This is depicted in the graph below Digital Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Iron Mountain s focus on setting up data center businesses bodes well for the company   Internal storage rental growth rate for 2018 is expected in the 3 3 5  range  backed by volume growth and pricing improvement  We believe stellar organic growth and the company s initiatives to expand its core storage business will benefit the first quarter results Nevertheless  Iron Mountain has grown its business principally through acquisitions  which have affected its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill  Hence  a highly leveraged balance sheet is predicted to have limited any robust margin improvement in the quarter   Read more   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon to be reported quarter is pegged at 50 cents  This indicates a 4 2  increase year over year Furthermore  with an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank of 2  our proven model does not conclusively show that the company will likely beat estimates this season  You can see The story about Iron Mountain s surprise history is better told by the chart below Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Kimco Realty is taking long strides  and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision  In fact  for first quarter 2018  the company continued aggressively selling its non core assets In line with its strategy  the company announced dispositions of 21 shopping centers  spanning 2 3 million square feet of space  for  219 5 million in the first quarter  Of this  the company s share included  210 2 million  High disposition activity can lead to earnings dilution and depress the company s growth momentum in the quarter to be reported   While challenges faced by retail REITs have been well documented  recent data from real estate research firm Reis states that U S  retail real estate vacancies remained moderately unchanged at 10  for first quarter 2018  In fact  the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record high defaults by retail corporate Although Kimco is actively enhancing omni channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers  it might take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results   Read more    Although the company has an Earnings ESP of  0 51   an unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  makes it difficult for our proven model to conclusively predict a likely earnings beat this season Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   CubeSmart is a self administered and self managed real estate company focused on the ownership  operation  acquisition and development of self storage facilities in the United States Notably  the self storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes  improving job market and rising incomes  as well as events like marriages  shifting  death  and even divorce  Also  due to shorter leasing periods  this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike Nevertheless  increased supply of self storage units in a number of the company s markets during the Jan Mar quarter is predicted to have affected its performance  This might have dampened its same store revenue growth as well   Amis these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues of  144 9 million indicates 8 9  year over year growth  Further  the company s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 39 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged  over the past month  The figure reflects 8 3  rise from the prior year quarter In fact  though it has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3  its Earnings ESP of  0 37  makes surprise prediction difficult Over the preceding four quarters  the company met the FFO per share estimates in two occasions and beat in the other two  resulting in an average positive surprise of 1 91   This

But Cohn opposed the plan to impose tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports into the US The European Union said Wednesday it has been circulating a provisional list of US products it could hit with levies to counteract US tariffs

Economic News  US steel tariffs were announced this week  set to go into effect in 2 weeks  Here s what happened the last time the US imposed steel tariffs  which was done by G W  Bush in 2002 

The Bush administration withdrew the tariffs in December 2003  about 21 months after they were imposed  but not without a cost  The Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition found that 200 000 US workers in manufacturing industries lost their jobs as a result of the tariffs 
The US added 313 000 new jobs in February  the biggest gain in a year and a half and clear evidence that a strong economy has plenty of room to keep expanding The increase in hiring easily blew past the 222 000 forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch  Job gains in January and December were also much stronger than initially reported 
Despite the big increase in hiring  wage growth did not keep up  Hourly pay rose 4 cents to  26 75 an hour  but the yearly increase in wages tapered off  The 12 month increase in pay slipped to 2 6  from a revised 2 8  in January  Still  the strong report makes it a virtual lock the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when senior officials meet this month  The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 1  
The economy added 54 000 more jobs in January and December than previously reported  Altogether  the economy has gained an average of 242 000 new jobs in the past three months  That s much stronger than the 182 000 monthly average in 2017  Yet even as the unemployment rate falls and firms complain more loudly about a shortage of skilled workers  they still aren t really laying out the red carpet for new or old employees 
The amount a worker earns per hour has been rising gradually in the past few years  but wage gains still trail the 3  to 4  annual increases that typically prevail at the height of an economic boom  Source  MarketWatch  


Week Ahead Highlights  There will be more pushback against the steel and aluminum tariffs next week  as economists and investors weigh in against the potentially disastrous effects of a global trade war 

The prospect of import tariffs could damage the US economy by raising costs for US manufacturers and consumers  while prompting its trading partners to impose their own levies on US exporters  increasing their costs also and sapping overseas demand 
Daniel Pinto  a co president at JPMorgan Chase  said in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday that the US equities could fall by between 20 and 40  over the next three years if a global trade war breaks out   Source  Reuters

141274,362789,IRM,General Dynamics Clinches A New  106M Contract For ESB 5,opinion,"Defense behemoth General Dynamics Corp  s   NYSE GD   National Steel and Shipbuilding Co   NASSCO  business division secured a modification contract from the U S  Navy  The deal aims at procuring additional long lead time material  engineering and non production support for the Expeditionary Mobile Base 5  ESB 5   The original contract was awarded in Jun 2016 
Notably  Expeditionary Mobile Base  ESB   formerly known as the Mobile Landing Platform  MLP  or Afloat Forward Staging Base  AFSB   is a highly flexible ship that offers logistics movement from sea to shore  supporting a broad range of military operations 
Details of the Deal
Valued at  106 2 million  the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command  Washington  D C  The majority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Crozet  VA  San Diego  CA  Iron Mountain  NYSE IRM   MI and many other locations across the U S  The deal will utilize fiscal 2016 and conversion  Navy  funds  while the work is expected to be over by Mar 2017 
Per the terms of the agreement  NASSCO will procure whole ship sets including interior outfittings  steel plates  hull and piping  ventilation and machinery insulation  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  emergency switchboards  piping  valves  steel shapes  ballast water treatment system  Aqueous Film Forming Foam system  and knuckle boom crane GENL DYNAMICS Price
 

    
ESB   NASSCO
ESB ships operate as mobile sea bases  providing the Navy Fleet with a critical access infrastructure that supports the flexible deployment of forces and supplies  whenever necessary  Interestingly  the commercial designing of ESB class of ships are based on the Alaska class crude oil carrier  also built by General Dynamics  NASSCO 
In Jun 2015  General Dynamics delivered the Navy s first Expeditionary Mobile Base   USNS Lewis B  Puller  ESB 3    as part of the original MLP program  ESB 3 can accommodate 250 personel and has been designed to support MH 53 and MH 60 helicopters  NASSCO is currently constructing the second ESB  i e  ESB 4 and is under contract to build a third  i e  ESB 5  Construction for ESB 5   the latest model in this fleet of ships   will be complete by 2017 
Our View
Currently  the ESB constitutes the centerpiece of the U S  Navy s forward deployed airborne mine countermeasures mission  AMCM   It aims at facilitating the operations and maintenance of airborne mine countermeasures detachment personnel and equipment 
Being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear powered submarines  General Dynamics already enjoys a dominant position over its peers in the U S  Navy  Added to that  its sole privilege to win contracts related to the U S  government s AMCM further boosts its business in the shipbuilding and marine systems space  Going forward  management has raised the company s 2016 outlook for its Marine business segment by  100  200 million  to which we believe the recent modification contract will contribute noticeably 
Zacks Rank   Other Stocks to Consider
General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank   2  Buy   A few better ranked stocks in the aerospace and defense sector include Engility Holdings  Inc    NYSE EGL    AAR Corp    NYSE AIR   and Leidos Holdings  Inc    NYSE LDOS
