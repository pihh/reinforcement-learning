198694,420210,CVS,Why CVS Health  CVS  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  CVS Health  NYSE CVS   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 57  
For the most recent quarter  CVS Health was expected to post earnings of  1 77 per share  but it reported  1 84 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 95   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 70 per share  while it actually produced  1 89 per share  a surprise of 11 18  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for CVS Health lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CVS Health has an Earnings ESP of  1 53  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 12  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cvs-health-cvs-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200498713,200498713
198695,420211,CVS,CVS Health  CVS  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when CVS Health  NYSE CVS  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 5  
Revenues are expected to be  64 21 billion  up 18  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CVS Health 
For CVS Health  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that CVS Health will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CVS Health would post earnings of  1 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 84  delivering a surprise of  3 95  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CVS Health appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cvs-health-cvs-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200504921,200504921

198704,420220,CVS,First peanut allergy therapy gets backing from U S  regulators  expert advisers,news,"By Tamara Mathias and Saumya Joseph
 Reuters    A U S  Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday recommended approving the first therapy for peanut allergies  which affect over 1 6 million children in the United States  despite raising concerns about the risk of severe allergic reactions it poses to young patients 
The body of independent advisers voted 7 2 in favor of effectiveness and 8 1 backing safety of the therapy Palforzia  developed by  Aimmune Therapeutics Inc   O AIMT   The verdict of the panel is traditionally an influential factor in the agency s final decision 
Peanut allergies are the leading cause of death from food induced allergic reactions in the United States but a lack of approved preventive treatments has left patients and caregivers desperate for options 
Palforzia  previously known as AR101  is an oral immunotherapy consisting of fixed doses of powdered peanut that is sprinkled over food daily 
While it does not aim to cure peanut allergy  the treatment s clinical trials have shown that patients consuming small doses of the substance to which they are allergic become desensitized over time  reducing the likelihood or severity of a reaction to it 
Aimmune says extended therapy will result in patients tolerating at least one peanut s worth of the protein which causes the anaphylactic reaction  protecting them from accidental consumption of the food 
Industry projections suggest that  if a number of treatments in development are approved  by 2027 the U S  peanut allergy therapy market could be worth  3 9 billion  with Aimmune capturing about two thirds of that market  according to research firm GlobalData 
Patient advocacy groups have been keenly awaiting an FDA greenlight  which would offer the hope of relief to parents living in constant fear of their children being accidentally exposed 
While some allergy specialists in the United States provide non approved versions of oral immununotherapy  analysts say Aimmune s more precisely dosed oral drug could bring in more than  1 billion in annual sales at its peak 
 It would be comforting for our community to have this option   Kenneth Mendez  who heads patient group Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America  told Reuters ahead of the panel meeting 
However  some experts worry that the treatment might give patients a false sense of security and trigger risky behavior  Others say it puts patients at unnecessary risk  because the very nature of the drug poses a risk of an allergic reaction 
Dr  Robert Wood  director of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine  says he believes the excitement will be tempered when patients realize what being on therapy involves 
 I will offer the treatment to all patients and recommend it to no one   he said 
FDA representative Sofia Chaudhry told the panel on Friday that the agency was still deciding on what safety restrictions or  REMS  requirements to place on the drug 
 We do take a very conservative approach   she said

198705,420221,CVS,CVS drug coverage plan based on outside pricing review is off to a slow start,news,"By Caroline Humer
NEW YORK  Reuters    A CVS Health Corp  N CVS  health plan that uses an outside drug pricing group to help it decide whether to cover certain new medicines has gained little traction with customers  according to its top medical executive  and has drawn fierce criticism from patient advocacy groups 
The company has held back on marketing the pharmacy benefit plan while it talks to these groups  CVS said 
The plan  launched a year ago  is based on analyses by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review  ICER   a Boston based group that assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices 
Using ICER s cost effectiveness assessment  CVS decides whether to include second or third medicines entering the market if there are already similar ones in the plan 
Opposition to the CVS plan is part of much broader concerns cited by drug companies and advocacy groups  many of which receive funding from the pharmaceutical industry  Some say that ICER s analysis based on additional years of  quality life  gained from a given treatment is arbitrary and disregards the costs of drug development and patient needs 
More than 50 groups  including drugmakers  PhRMA  the industry s main lobby group  and other advocacy groups  have provided comment during a public input period included in a review by ICER of its assessment methods  Many asked ICER to eliminate price recommendations from its efficacy analyses 
ICER has defended its methods  which are based on a widely used cost effectiveness analysis 
The soft rollout of CVS  ICER related product comes as employer health plan sponsors   its biggest clients   are showing increased concern over their cost for new high priced drugs  and are considering refusing to pay for them at all  CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said in a recent interview 
If corporate customers follow through on that threat  CVS said it could change tactics with the plan 
Rising drug prices  particularly for expensive specialty treatments for severe or deadly conditions  have pushed annual U S  healthcare spending to  3 65 trillion  and made them unaffordable for many individuals 
Earlier this year   Novartis  AG  S NOVN  launched Zolgensma  a more than  2 million gene therapy for a rare but deadly disease called spinal muscular atrophy 
The new CVS program  cited as an example of ICER s growing influence on U S  drug pricing  would not apply to such a breakthrough treatment  It is a tiny plan by CVS standards as the company manages pharmaceutical benefits for more than 102 million people and also owns Aetna  NYSE AET  insurance and a national pharmacy chain 
NOT WIDELY PROMOTED
The plan s scope is limited to so called me too drugs  those where similar effective treatments already exist  and aims to pressure drugmakers to set lower prices  For example  two of three very similar drugs for migraine approved in 2018 could have been excluded  but drugmakers set prices ICER deemed cost effective 
CVS has limited sales and marketing for the plan while it talks to patient groups who oppose it  About 240 000 CVS employees and a few large clients  employees are enrolled thus far  The company declined to comment on exact membership 
 We are not widely promoting this program   Brennan said  adding that CVS is working to address patient groups  concerns 
Meanwhile  Brennan said some employers are considering refusing to pay for million dollar treatments like gene therapy  They are saying   I m not going to cover these kinds of therapies no matter what their comparative effectiveness is if they ve got a really high cost  
Large healthcare consultant and brokerage Mercer said it has begun to field similar concerns 
 We have certainly gotten some plan sponsors saying  What if we don t cover specialty drugs    said David Dross  who runs Mercer s managed pharmacy practice  Two years ago  it never received any such questions  he said 
Steve Wojcik  an executive with the National Business Group on Health which represents large employers  said he does not believe many will take that drastic step 
Still  ICER President Steven Pearson said employers tell him they worry about their ability to cover everything and have suggested they might drop some high cost treatments  He said employers can use cost effectiveness analysis to help them manage their spending 
ICER has responded to outside criticism by meeting with patient advocates and by adding new measurements for a drug s effectiveness  such as the value of life years gained  which does not focus on quality of life improvements  Pearson said 
Since 2015  ICER has published up to a dozen reviews each year of drugs and classes of medicines 
Most U S  private insurers now use ICER clinical and cost analyses to inform coverage negotiations with drugmakers  ICER funding primarily comes from a non profit foundation  but drug companies and health insurers provide some funds for ICER related activities ",2019-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cvs-drug-coverage-plan-based-on-outside-pricing-review-is-off-to-a-slow-start-1991743,1991743

Typically  advisors peg 15  to 20  of total income saved each month as a goal   but if you want to retire earlier  you probably have to ratchet that number up to 40  or 50  of your income  Not a feat easily accomplished when you review your take into account that a good portion of your paycheck goes to essential  non negotiable lifestyle items  However  if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle changes and sacrifices  it s possible

What s Next for CVS Health 
While CVS Health has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

The company reported earnings of  1 62 on revenue of  61 65 billion  above estimates from Investing com for earnings of  1 50 on revenue of  60 39 billion 
The upbeat results from CVS did little to prop up support for the broader healthcare sector  as sentiment has been soured by ongoing pressure from politicians  many of whom continued to push for measures to bring down drug costs  The Health Care Select Sector ETF  NYSE XLV  was basically flat Wednesday and is up just 3 3  this year

198733,420249,CVS,CVS Health  CVS  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects CVS Health  NYSE CVS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 77 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 3  
Revenues are expected to be  63 03 billion  up 33 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 75  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CVS Health 
For CVS Health  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 05  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that CVS Health will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CVS Health would post earnings of  1 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 89  delivering a surprise of  11 18  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CVS Health appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cvs-health-cvs-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200480126,200480126

198735,420251,CVS,U S  seeks to cut dialysis costs with more home care versus clinics,news,"By Caroline Copley and Caroline Humer  Reuters    The Trump administration is working on a new payment approach for treating kidney disease that favors lower cost care at home and transplants  a change that would upend a dialysis industry that provides care in thousands of clinics nationwide  The goal is to reduce the  114 billion paid by the U S  government each year to treat chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease  a top area of spending  The U S  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS   which provides Medicare health benefits to more than 55 million Americans  is looking at a trial payment design that would improve care in the early stages of kidney disease  increase access to kidney transplants and favor home dialysis over clinic based treatment  CMS head Seema Verma told Reuters in an interview    A lot of the way the program has been set up  it creates a lot of perverse incentives to actually keep people in an institutional setting   said Verma  who first signaled in a speech this year that CMS wanted to curb costs and improve quality of life for kidney disease patients through a new payment structure  Indeed  consultants say home dialysis has been slow to take off because doctors prefer to send patients to clinics  The changes pose a particular risk to DaVita Inc and Fresenius Medical Care AG  which operate more than 5 000 U S  dialysis clinics and control around 70 percent of the market   Shares in Fresenius Medical Care were down 3 percent at 0817 GMT after the Reuters report  They could also provide an opening for new rivals  including CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS   which seeks to offer lower cost home dialysis  and startups Cricket Health and Somatus  which focus on early intervention to slow progression to kidney failure   We have to be open to what I m hearing coming out of  CMS   that they want to look at different ways for us being paid and how can we really try to create more opportunities for these patients to be better served   Fresenius Medical Care Chief Executive Rice Powell told analysts  The company is expanding in home dialysis with its  2 billion purchase of NxStage  a U S  maker of home use dialysis machines  Fresenius Medical Care said it plans to convert some dialysis clinics into  transitional care units  to train people for care at home  It aims to boost the percentage of its U S  customers using home dialysis to more than 15 percent by 2022 from around 12 percent currently  DaVita recently launched new technology  including remote monitoring and telehealth  to improve the patient experience at home and  champions  home dialysis  a company spokeswoman said  KIDNEY DISEASE ON THE RISE Nearly 15 percent of the U S  adult population was suffering from chronic kidney disease in 2018  fueled by growing rates of diabetes and hypertension  according to the government s U S  Renal Data System  In 2016  more than 720 000 people were estimated to have progressed to kidney failure  That is forecast to climb as high as 1 26 million people by 2030  Without a transplant  patients with end stage kidney disease require dialysis to clear their blood of waste and excess fluid  which involves spending three to five hours hooked up to a machine three times a week   Home dialysis would not only be cheaper  since it would not require nursing assistance once a patient is properly trained  but could be done at night  freeing people for a regular work schedule  DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care offer two forms of home dialysis  hemodialysis  which requires a machine and special filter much like in clinics  and peritoneal dialysis  which utilizes the lining of the abdomen to filter waste from the blood  CMS is considering the benefits of peritoneal dialysis  which is used more widely outside the United States  Peritoneal dialysis machines are around the size of a desktop printer  smaller than home hemodialysis machines  DaVita believes home dialysis could eventually account for up to 25 percent of treatments if physicians are educated on its merits  and it plans to build fewer new clinics  Meanwhile  U S  pharmacy chain CVS is preparing to enter the dialysis business and has more retail outlets than Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita clinics combined  as well as deep enough pockets to drive disruption   CVS said last April its kidney care plans involve a program to identify the disease early and delay the need for dialysis  It will also seek regulatory approval for its own home dialysis device   CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo  in an interview  said it wants a home care solution  which is going to be more patient friendly and we believe lower cost than the therapies that exist today    Medicare pays for home dialysis  but adoption has been slow  Only around 8 percent of end stage renal disease patients were on home dialysis in 2016   The U S  Department of Health and Human Services  which oversees CMS  is also seeking to increase the number of kidney transplants through proposals it hopes will expedite access to organs  More than 20 000 people received kidney transplants in the United States in 2018  a fraction of the more than 100 000 people on the waiting list   CMS has also finalized new rules that beginning next year will offer financial incentives for new drugs to treat kidney failure   KILLER GAP  Proponents of home care say more frequent dialysis can improve patient outcomes by avoiding the so called  killer gap    a two day wait between clinic sessions associated with increased hospitalization and death  Hospitalization accounts for about 40 percent of Medicare spending on dialysis patients   Imagine if we could keep patients out of the hospital by dealing with this killer gap     giving them the tools to treat themselves   said John Milad  CEO of Britain based Quanta Dialysis Technologies  which is working on a simpler dialysis machine for home use   The savings that are available there are as big as everything that is being spent on dialysis   CVS is working on its home hemodialysis device with DEKA Research   Development Corp  a New Hampshire based company owned by Segway scooter inventor Dean Kamen  according to sources familiar with the arrangement  Startups including Quanta  France s Physidia and California based Outset Medical  are working on user friendly dialysis machines for home use  U S  based Cricket Health and Somatus use data analysis to detect high risk chronic kidney disease patients earlier  educate them on treatment options and provide home dialysis services   Cricket CEO Arvind Rajan said the government could save money via a flat fee to manage patients earlier in the disease and reward providers who keep costs down   
 The most profitable thing you can do is keep a patient from kidney failure and the least profitable thing you can do is have the patient on in center dialysis   he said ",2019-03-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-seeks-to-cut-dialysis-costs-with-more-home-care-versus-clinics-1796575,1796575

This drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9 59  
For the most recent quarter  CVS Health was expected to post earnings of  1 70 per share  but it reported  1 89 per share instead  representing a surprise of 11 18   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 50 per share  while it actually produced  1 62 per share  a surprise of 8  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for CVS Health  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CVS Health currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 46   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

198772,420288,CVS,3 Retail Stocks Likely To Stand Tall This Earnings Season,opinion,The earnings season has reached its pinnacle but a chunk of  sector releases are still awaited  The sector comprises of apparel   shoes  discount and department stores  e commerce players and retail pharmacy to name a few Per the latest   the sector is anticipated to witness top line growth of 7 6  with bottom line expected to remain flat year over year  The earnings season has witnessed releases from about 36  of the retail companies in the S P 500 cohort For the companies that have reported results so far  total earnings increased 3 9  on 10  higher revenues  We note 64 3  of the companies have been successful in beating earnings  and revenue estimates Factors Shaping the OutcomeA buoyant consumer environment and strategic endeavors undertaken at the company level are working in favor of the sector  It goes without saying that the sector s prospects are closely tied to the purchasing power of consumers  In fact  strengthening labor market  improved consumer confidence and rising disposable income are conducive to higher consumer spending  An uptick in this metric is always welcome news for retailers Notably  retailers are also making prudent investments  focusing on cost savings and constantly revisiting their loyalty and marketing programs to engage better with customers  These apart  enhancement of omni channel capacities  introduction of new brands and refurbishment of stores have also been playing crucial roles  Simultaneously  the companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts and mobile point of sale capabilities to make stores attractive These efforts have been aiding the top line performance for quite some time now  and the to be reported quarter is not likely to be an exception  However  one cannot ignore the fact that the sector has turned highly competitive with the increasing dominance of e commerce players on account of consumers growing preference for online shopping  This has compelled a number of brick and mortar players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and bolster shipping and delivery capabilities While these endeavors drive sales  they entail high costs  Continued investments in innovation  data and analytics  and new capabilities to speed up the digital transformation results in higher operating costs  Additionally  any deleverage in SG A rate  higher labor and occupancy costs  and increased marketing and other store related expenses are concerns  Margins will remain one of the key areas to watch out for this

198781,420297,CVS,Can CVS Health  CVS  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  CVS Health  NYSE CVS   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 69  
For the most recent quarter  CVS Health was expected to post earnings of  1 50 per share  but it reported  1 62 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 07 per share  while it actually produced  2 14 per share  a surprise of 3 38  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for CVS Health  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CVS Health has an Earnings ESP of  3 21  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on August 7  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-cvs-health-cvs-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200438894,200438894

DoseMeRx  an advanced precision dosing tool to help physicians and pharmacists accurately dose patients  high risk parenteral medications based on individual needs  resulting in significant improvements to mortality  risk  and patient outcomes  Already available in over 100 hospitals and infusion providers worldwide  DoseMeRx s precision dosing capabilities will now be combined with TRHC s proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation  MRM  technologies in order to enhance and accelerate medication safety solutions available in the hospital setting  Adding Another Prescription for Wellness In early March  Oppenheimer analysts reworked their estimates model to account for a recent  285 million convertible share offering and  you guessed it  another key acquisition  Oppenheimer analyst Mohan Naidu lowered his price target for Tabula Rasa HealthCare to  88 from  97  while reiterating an Outperform rating on the shares after the company announced the acquisition of PrescribeWellness for  150 million in cash  The analyst believes the acquisition should provide leverage to Tabula Rasa HealthCare in pushing its solutions into the pharmacies by expanding on PrescribeWellness relationships to promote the combined company s proprietary technologies  This synergy should add high margin service revenues to the numbers  with Naidu expecting growth in about 20  range  The Oppenheimer analyst team increased their 2019 and 2020 estimates to incorporate the higher growth implied in company guidance and also the contribution from the acquisitions  Their 2020 revenue estimate went up to  322 million from  310M  In early April  investment bank Piper Jaffray reiterated their bull case for TRHC    Tabula Rasa HealthCare Strengthened by SinfoniaRx Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Wieland kept his Overweight rating and  73 price target on Tabula Rasa HealthCare after its SinfoniaRx unit put out its annual report  saying the company s key metrics demonstrate its ability to  help health plans meet CMS requirements and help pharmacists generate revenue   Wieland noted that the unit strengthens the value proposition of the combined Tabula Rasa HealthCare platforms and he remains positive on its revenue growth potential of over 20  for years to come  Since reporting earnings in late Feb  here is where other analysts stand on their forward valuation  i e   price targets     Cantor Fitz 3 1   99Benchmark 3 15   90Stifel Nicolaus 3 5   70Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  3 6   55  obviously the Neutral view here  And here was commentary from the Cantor analyst in late January when shares were trading  68    Tabula Rasa shares attractive with 50  upside potential Analyst Steven Halper reiterated an Overweight rating on Tabula Rasa HealthCare with a  99 price target  After meeting with management the analyst says the company remains upbeat regarding adoption of its Medication Risk Mitigation platform  Halper continues to believe Tabula Rasa is poised for sustained long term growth amid  favorable  policy and market tailwinds  Halper viewed the stock as attractive up near  70  and he recently reiterated his  99 target  implying over 80  upside from between  50 and  55  CMS  New Value Based Payment Program is a Catalyst for TRHC Finally  as healthcare stocks recover from the fallout of last month s  single payer panic  and  Medicare for All  scares  Tabula Rasa has found opportunity in the chaos  On April 25 commended a new initiative from the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  and Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS  to introduce new payment models for primary care that will require payment for health and outcomes rather than fee for service  According to HHS Secretary Alex Azar  these models represent the biggest step ever taken toward building an American healthcare system that pays for value  The CMS projects that the new voluntary programs will shift at least a quarter of people in traditional Medicare out of fee for service  which will motivate providers to compete for these beneficiaries and be rewarded for their ability to keep patients healthy and out of the hospital  among other quality measures  And on April 18  Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Wieland put out a note saying that TRHC stock weakness brings a  compelling entry point   Wieland said he was  incrementally more positive  on Tabula Rasa HealthCare s growth outlook after traveling with the company s CFO Brian Adams  He also noted that a new CVS Health  NYSE CVS   CVS  partnership provides a  strong validation  of Tabula Rasa s value proposition  and multiple opportunities should result in a higher margin product mix  He reiterated an Overweight rating on Tabula Rasa HealthCare with a  73 price target  Bottom line for Tabula Rasa  TRHC   There are few ways to directly capitalize on the IT trends in medical records  systems  and data management    especially after Athenahealth was taken private  So for me

198809,420325,CVS,CVS Health  CVS  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CVS Health  NYSE CVS  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 51 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2  
Revenues are expected to be  60 52 billion  up 32 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 03  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CVS Health 
For CVS Health  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 22  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CVS Health will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CVS Health would post earnings of  2 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 14  delivering a surprise of  3 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

198825,420341,CVS,Should Value Investors Pick CVS Health  CVS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CVS Health Corporation   NYSE CVS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CVS Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  CVS Health s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that CVS Health has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for CVS Health stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  CVS Health has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CVS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CVS Health currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CVS Health a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for CVS Health is just 0 9  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 0  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  CVS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though CVS Health might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives CVS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter as well as the full year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 1 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCVS Health is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 41   should boost investor confidence However over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion

Trade hopes drive market despite anomaly of Materials and Industrials underperformance
US Treasury yields flirt with a top reversal  a bearish signal for equities
Bitcoin climbs back above  4 000

Key Events
European shares and futures on the Dow  S P 500 and NASDAQ 100 flashed green across the board  extending the rally seen yesterday on Wall Street  as investors found some steady footing ahead of a crucial speech by Federal Chair Jerome Powell 
The STOXX Europe 600 rallied  buoyed by miners and energy producers  as traders took their cues from a bullish Asian session where regional benchmarks such as Japan s Nikkei 225 outperformed   1 02   though the Japanese benchmark closed well below its highs  paring 2 29 percent from its intraday high  Australia s S P ASX 200   0 06 percent  was the only regional index to close in negative territory  dragged lower by materials stocks 
Global Financial Affairs
Yesterday  US equities extended a rebound on hopes of easing trade tensions between the world s two largest economies  The natural exception were small cap stocks   0 80    whose luster fades each time traders see a light at the end of the US China trade dispute tunnel  Conversely  the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed   0 44 percent   suggesting optimism on a trade resolution was the main market driver during the session 
Equities did in fact reverse losses after the White House s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the meeting between China s leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump is an opportunity to  turn the page  on trade relations  Ironically  Kudlow s reassurance did nothing for trade dispute proxy sector Materials   1 22    the clear underperformer  Industrials   0 17    the other most affected sector during trade jitters  also lagged behind  We found no explanation for this anomaly 
The S P 500 advanced 0 33 percent  sealing two day gains of 1 87   The second worst performing sector after Materials was Energy whose fate is tied with oil s woes which still managed to close more than a full percentage point above the main laggard   0 28    Health care   1 04   fared as the day s winner  advancing for a third straight day as CVS Health  NYSE CVS  s and Aetna  NYSE AET  shares continued to surge after winning state approval for their  69 billion merger on Monday 

CVS gained 2 13  on Tuesday  bringing its three day gains to 5 87   Technically  the trading pattern is developing a potential massive H S bottom since November 2016 
The NASDAQ Composite   0 01   barely managed to hold on to this week s gains 

Meanwhile  the yield on 10 year Treasurys extended a consolidation after Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida supported gradual rate hikes ahead of Powell s speech today 

The dollar initially edged higher but later wavered around neutral levels  Technically  the greenback reached 0 6  below the November 12 close and 0 20 percent from the November 12 high  Any additional gains will extend the medium term uptrend and take the USD to the highest levels since June 2017 
The pound was mildly positive amid new developments in the battle between UK Prime Minister Theresa May and Parliament  as May appeared to abandon her attempts to get her draft Bexit proposal voted without amendments  European bonds and the euro meandered 
Bitcoin climbed above  4 000 after plunging earlier in the week 
Brent crude also rebounded to about  61 a barrel  though it later slipped into negative territory  Overall  the recent shifts in the oil market seem to have swayed the direction of the broader commodities spectrum this year 
Later today  Powell s speech will be scrutinized for any clue  however subtle  on whether the pace of the Fed s interest rate tightening will slow down to any extent  Recently  investors have reacted strongly to the continued removal of the central bank s unprecedented accommodation  which was the main tailwind for the longest bull market on record  Clarida said risks to the US economy are  less skewed to the downside   while St  Louis Fed President James Bullard was more cautious  telling Reuters that officials must monitor possible  cracks  in the American recovery and that growth is going to slow in 2019 and 2020 
We have repeatedly argued that interest rates are the main driver of long lasting market moves  while the US China trade story will be less impactful in the longer term  Nevertheless  trader focus will also be turning to the long awaited meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires this week  with the outcome remaining highly uncertain after Trump s recent mixed messages

The U S  stock market is closed Wednesday in observance of the National Day of Mourning for President George H W  Bush  Futures trading is open  however  and some investors are trying to figure out their next move after one of the worst trading sessions of 2018 on Tuesday 
One factor that Wall Street is considering this week is the uncertainty surrounding U S  China trade talks  Over the weekend  it seemed that a G20 meeting between officials from both sides went well  with initial reports suggesting that a 90 day halt on new tariffs had been agreed to 
But on Tuesday  a series of tweets from President Trump and rumors of frustration and confusion from the Chinese sent stocks tumbling  as all of a sudden the existence of a 90 day truce looked questionable 
That concern was cooled to an extent overnight  with Chinese officials announcing that they are  confident in implementing  trade commitments made to the U S  Still  questions remain  Does that statement refer to a truce  or reported pledges to buy more U S  goods  Could it also include movement on intellectual property issues  What about the topic of cracking down on fentanyl  Clear answers to these questions are seemingly unavailable right now 
Elsewhere  we learned about the ongoing scandal related to Les Moonves  departure from CBS   NYSE CBS    The former chief executive recently left CBS after being accused of sexual misconduct  and now  according to a new report from the New York Times  it looks like the network might be able to avoid paying Moonves   120 million severance package 
Moonves may have disqualified himself from that massive payout by destroying evidence and lying to investigators  the Times reported 
Another big story today comes from CVS   NYSE CVS    which just closed its merger with Aetna  NYSE AET  last week  A huge talking point behind that deal was that it would allow CVS new ways to save customers money on drugs and treatments 
Today  CVS announced what may be its first step in that direction  a new pricing strategy for its prescription benefit subsidiary CVS Caremark  Among other things  this plan will allow CVS to pass through 100  of drug rebates to its health plan clients

198855,420371,CVS,The year s biggest deal is far from certain,news,"CVS Health  NYSE CVS  s massive acquisition of Aetna  NYSE AET  could face heightened regulatory scrutiny amid the Trump administration s new regulatory regime 
Aetna s stock is trading about 10  below the per share offer price  reflecting investor uncertainty that the deal will get approval 

 A year ago  CVS Health s  69 billion acquisition of Aetna would ve probably skated past regulatory proceedings  But things have changed under the Trump administration  and investors don t look particularly confident that the mega deal will be approved 
This uncertainty around the deal   the biggest to be announced in 2017   is being reflected by Aetna s stock  which is trading near  184 a share  roughly 10  below the  207 a share offer made by CVS 
This discount serves as a handy gauge of sentiment around the deal   if investors think approval is likely  they will trade Aetna s shares near the proposed deal price   and its depth at present time doesn t paint the most promising picture 
In the minds of investors  the deal s sticking point is Makan Delrahim  the US Department of Justice s new antitrust chief  In his short time on the job  he s been less receptive to so called  vertical  mergers  which involve the combination of two companies that hold different places in the same supply chain 
Case in point  Delrahim s recent handling of AT T  NYSE T  s attempted acquisition of Time Warner  While it may appear to be a textbook vertical deal  the Justice Department has sued to block it  calling the deal anti competitive and warning against higher monthly television bills for customers 
Still  the Trump administration s resistance of the deal must be taken with a grain of salt  considering the president s past criticisms of CNN  which is owned by Time Warner  Trump was expressing displeasure around the merger as far back as 2016  when he said in a speech that it was  too much concentration of power in the hands of too few  
So the question now becomes  will Delharim  and by extension the Trump administration  be as tough on future vertical mergers as they ve been on the AT T Time Warner deal  Are they leading a new crusade against this type of deal  or was that a specific case driven by a personal agenda 
One large deciding factor could be the effect the proposed CVS Aetna merger has on drug prices  If the two firms are able to combine to lower middleman expenses  that might allow the deal to survive the regulatory gauntlet 
And that  in turn  would likely boost Aetna s stock price closer to the offer price of  207  if not above it  The company s stock climbed 1 8  to  184 48 in early trading on Monday  Meanwhile  CVS s shares dropped 3 2  ",2017-12-05,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-years-biggest-deal-is-far-from-certain-954688,954688

198891,420407,CVS,Should Value Investors Consider CVS Health  CVS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CVS Health Corporation   NYSE CVS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CVS Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of nearly 11 0  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 5  If we focus on the long term PE trend  CVS Health s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  In fact  the current level stands close to the lows for the stock  indicating that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 31 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that CVS Health has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for CVS Health stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  CVS Health has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  CVS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CVS Health currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CVS Health a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though CVS Health might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C  This gives CVS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Notably  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter has seen 13 estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision  while the full year estimate has seen 15 upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 9 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has jumped 9 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus    However  this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term  Nonetheless  the positive analyst sentiment hints at favorable ongoing prospects Bottom LineCVS Health is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 29  out of more than 250 Zacks industries  which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a

198967,420483,CVS,Big Pharma s Plan B,opinion,"Big pharma seems set to follow a script that it has followed before    and one that many other industries have followed  Faced by growth challenges  regulatory challenges  and the decreasing effectiveness of price hikes as a growth strategy  big pharma companies look set for a wave of mergers and acquisitions  Consolidation is already happening in other parts of the healthcare sector    for example  the recent purchase of insurer Aetna  NYSE AET  by pharmacy retailer CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  
Big pharma in the United States has long relied on price increases to support profit growth  That history now increasingly faces the wrath of public opinion and the scrutiny of regulators  Companies are still raising prices  but the writing is clearly on the wall  Many major pharma companies raised prices for 2018 in the past week  However  they have spent much of the past year waging a campaign to direct public dissatisfaction about drug prices away from themselves and towards other parts of the drug supply chain  such as insurers and pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs   PBMs are third party administrators of prescription drug programs for commercial health plans  self insured employer plans  and various other private and public health plans  They contract with pharmacies  negotiate discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers  and process and pay prescription drug claims 
In the long run  however  this intra industry war is a distraction  The regulatory writing on the wall has been clear for years  and became clearer during the 2016 election campaign  in which both major candidates called out high drug prices and pledged to use the Federal government s buying power to negotiate them down  Last year s chaos around healthcare reform took those negotiations off the table  However  the current administration s determination to get the  best deal  possible is one of its enduring traits  and come what may politically  we think the era of high drug price increases is drawing to a close  2017 s clarification of approval pathways for biosimilars    generic versions of complex  large molecule drugs    is an example of how the current administration favors direct action through regulators  rather than contentious debate in Congress  wherever possible 
The market s attitude towards pharma and biotech seems to confirm us in this opinion  Since their peaks in mid 2015  pharma has fallen nearly 30   biotechs are flat  and the S P 500 in the same time has returned more than 30   These are industries that are under a cloud because their basic model for growing profits is threatened 

So with pricing power eroding  and likely to erode further  they are likely this year to turn increasingly to an old playbook    mergers and acquisitions  Mergers  when they work  will permit rationalization and cost cutting  Acquisitions will bring in growth by buying it instead of incubating it in house  reducing research and development expenses and allowing venture capital to take the risks  and much of the reward  when it funds the small  development stage biotechnology companies which are the most powerful engines of innovation in modern medicine 
As investors  we see two ways in which this trend could benefit us  One is through a close examination of mergers as they are proposed and occur    where betting on teams that have proven themselves capable of such corporate transformation  and where careful analysis of the synergies suggests that the match will be a fruitful one  can unlock value for shareholders  The second is through careful monitoring of development stage biotech firms    those whose technologies are in  hot  research areas that will attract the attention of large pharma buyers looking for access to new high growth treatments more immune to the impending price wars 
Investment implications   Although the pharmaceutical and biotech industries are facing a moment of truth  and pricing power for drugmakers is being eroded and will continue to be eroded  they are likely to begin moving to another playbook    mergers and acquisitions  Be on the lookout for pharma mergers led by competent and proven teams that are likely to produce streamlined new companies and unlock shareholder value  Also  continue to monitor the landscape of new biotechnologies  in order to find the development stage companies that are likely to be acquisition targets for large  growth hungry pharma firms ",2018-01-12,Tim Shirata,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-pharmas-plan-b-200279751,200279751

Elsewhere look for Gold consolidate with a downward bias if it resolves soon while Crude Oil continues to plow higher  The US Dollar Index also looks to continue higher while US Treasuries continue lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets look best to continue to bide time moving sideways 
Volatility looks to remain low but creeping higher  sucking out the tailwind from the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show clear weakness in the IWM  with the SPY and QQQ a little stronger short term  The QQQ is the best looking longer term  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Zubsolv  Balanced investment to capture growth
Increased investment in promotional activities depends on opportunities to gain market share  market access improvements and legislative change nationally  Increasing the number of patients with unrestricted access to Zubsolv and further growing the profitable cash and commercial segments are a key focus  Federally  proposed changes to government policy would expand access to opioid dependence treatment through both current and new prescribers

Zubsolv  Market share gains all roundZubsolv made market share gains in Q315  growing in the main commercial market and regaining share in the highly profitable cash segment  This helped to boost the gross net sales ratio  also aided by a one off revision related to assumed rebate levels  The commercial segment remains the main focus for Orexo and Zubsolv continues to increase its share  which will be key for driving future growth 
First US government moves to increase accessIn what could potentially be significant changes to the US opioid dependence market  the US government has announced plans to increase access to medication assisted treatment  MAT   such as with Zubsolv  with goals to double the number of physicians authorised to prescribe buprenorphine  This is currently limited to 30 000 physicians  with around 6 000 active in treating  all have a 100 patient cap  If realised  these goals could substantially expand the current market

199137,420653,CVS,Anatomy Of A Trade  CVS,opinion,"The broad markets are making new all time highs  Stocks are breaking out everywhere  You want to participate but you keep hearing from the television that the market is due for a correction  I could tell you to just turn off the television  but there ways to deal with this discomfort as well  Let me illustrate what I am doing with one stock right now 
CVS Health  NYSE CVS  had a great run higher over the back half of 2014  Since February though it pulled back in a shallow retrenchment  It bottomed a few weeks ago when the long lower shadows appeared on the weekly candles on the chart below  That chart shows the rising trend with the 20 week SMA  and that it reconnected with that moving average as it bottomed  Now moving back higher  the price is over the 20 week SMA and has support from the RSI to continue 
That momentum indicator remained bullish through out the pullback  The MACD though continues to look lower  but is flattening  The volatility indicator  the Bollinger Bands  are getting tighter  This is often a precursor to a move  All sets up for a big move higher  And looking at the move up into the pullback  you could establish a target over 125 

I added this stock to client accounts but with a twist  As a long term position  I protected the downside until the early august earnings report by adding a August 100 95 Put Spread  This cost about  1 20  and with the price of the stock at 102 60 gives about  3 80 in risk  assuming I stop the stock if it moves under 100  But to reduce that cost somewhat I also sold a June 26 Expiry Covered Call on the 105 Strike for about 80 cents  This drops my risk to only  3 
But the story is not over yet  By selling that Covered Call  I have capped the upside in the trade  but only for 1 month  My goal will be to continue to sell covered calls as these expire  or move out the maturity  to collect more premium and further lower my cost on the protective collar to zero or below  With weekly options in CVS this is very possible

Our house is full of them  Now that Christmas is approaching we will likely see a set of cuddly polar bears with a red elf hat  It is all great  and the kids love it but Mom  maybe you can get them a different kind of gift from CVS this year 

The chart for CVS stock has been in a good uptrend since this time in 2011  It took a pause  going through a consolidation through the first half of the fall until breaking higher in late October  But since early November another consolidation has set in  It has traded in a channel between 89 15 and 91 40 since Veterans day  by the way   no presents from then   It appears it may be ready to break that channel higher now  The 20 day SMA is rising and acting as support  The momentum indicator RSI is moving back up as it bounces above the mid line and the MACD is rounding out  for a reversal higher  A move above the channel would target a run to 100  Why not give the grandkids a possible 11  return this year

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for CVS to report 1 05 EPS and  32 538B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 17 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 07 EPS and  32 516B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting CVS to beat EPS estimates from Wall Street by 2c per share while coming up  22 million short on revenue 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting CVS s EPS and revenue 5 times each  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a small to moderate difference of estimates between Estimize and Wall Street 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 02 to  1 18 EPS and from  32 117B to  32 700B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wider range of estimates on CVS than usual 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of EPS estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter both Wall Street and the Estimize community both raised their EPS and revenue expectations  The Wall Street EPS consensus rose from 98c to  1 05 while the Estimize consensus climbed from 97c to  1 07  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus increased from  32 110B to  32 538B while the Estimize consensus rose from  32 225B to  32 516B   Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects  1 06 EPS and  32 569B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 3rd overall among over 4 350 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 59  and 54  of the time respectively throughout over 2000 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity expects CVS to beat the estimates on revenue but report between the expectations of Wall Street and Estimize on EPS 
On Friday CVS Caremark will be the third of the big 3 pharmacy chains to report earnings  So far we saw great numbers from Rite Aid but a disappointing report from Walgreen  Investors are showing a wide range of estimates on the Estimize com platfor which signals uncertanty around this report  With that being said the consensus from the community is that CVS will beat EPS estimates by 2c per share but come up slightly short of Wall Street s revenue projection

199158,420674,CVS,Diagnosing CVS As It Tests All Time Highs,opinion,"CVS Corporation  NYSE CVS  broke above short term resistance earlier this week and is testing the all time high price level  Stocks making new all time highs are often described by pundits as one that you should  take off some risk  in  Does that really make any sense  If you sell every stock that makes an all time high then as the market keeps making all time highs you will be on the sidelines watching  uninvested  I guess the bright side is that you will have more time to play golf or what ever else you enjoy 
I am not trying to discourage proper risk management  but come on  You got to be in it to win it  So what do you do  With a stock like CVS there are plenty of options  Literally 

The chart does have some things in it that raise caution  The bearish Shark Harmonic has a Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  at 79 nearby  Of course that could always morph into a longer Shark with PRZ at 80 05  Or the prior top could halt its progress  But the momentum indicators  RSI and MACD  suggest there is more upside 
If you are long this stock already then you can add protection by buying a collar  This is selling a covered call and buying a put or put spread  With earnings coming up on August 5th  maybe a August 9 Expiry 78 75 Put Spread  offered at 62 cents as I write   That is less than 1  cost to protect the downside to the 200 day moving average  below the last consolidation  And if you sold the August 29 Expiry 81 Calls  making them Covered Calls  the options combination comes at no cost  and still allows for 2 5  upside over the next month

199159,420675,CVS,Listening To The Megaphone In CVS,opinion,"CVS Corp   NYSE CVS  has been a very strong stock  It has been in an uptrend since breaking out of a consolidation range at then end of 2011  Like every stock it has not had a straight walk higher  There have been pullbacks and advances that have moved it higher  Many of those pullbacks have reversed upon touching or just below the 100 day Simple Moving Average  SMA   This happened last week as well  So what is different now 
The chart above shows that trend and the importance of the 100 day SMA  But it also shows the making of an expanding wedge pattern  Also known as a Megaphone  traders like to think if it as a reversal or topping pattern  And it can be  But it is more formally an expanding range and can be watched for a break both ways  In the present iteration the break would look for a  6 50 move  so over 84 the target becomes 90 50  But failure at the top trend line of the megaphone carries a potential trade back to the bottom of the pattern  From there you can look again for a break or reversal
