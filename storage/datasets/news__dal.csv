48864,270379,DAL,Delta Airlines Gains Altitude,news,"The airline business is a tough one  and not all carriers survive the cyclical nature and geopolitical challenges  Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL   an industry leader in 2020  was plunged into bankruptcy in 2005  Management was humbled and the company survived  eventually building itself into one of the most successful airlines of the past decade 
On January 14  Delta reported full year 2019 results showing impressive gains  helped by its strategic partnership with American Express  fleet optimization  and a pending joint venture with South America s largest airline  
But the party s not over yet  Delta Airlines has put several strategic initiatives in place that will yield increased revenue and improved margins in the next few years 
Lucrative co branding adds up
An important driver of future growth is the partnership between Delta and American Express  The co branding contract was renewed for 11 years  running to 2029  The agreement increases income to Delta from  4 1 billion in 2019 to nearly  7 billion by 2023  Delta American Express cardholders increased by 1 1 million in 2019  notching the third consecutive year adding more than one million new card holders 
Plans are in the works for Delta and American Express to relaunch the credit card portfolio with new ways cardholders can earn miles  driving new cardmember growth and card usage 

Updated equipment yields cost savings and efficiency
Delta Airlines plans to reduce maintenance costs and boost productivity by simplifying its diverse fleet  Management says the airline could eventually operate just eight fleet families  down from 12 next year  As Delta phases out old airplanes  it is replacing them with higher capacity aircraft  capitalizing on the high passenger volumes the airline has attracted 
Fleet optimization reduces costs while increasing revenue per departure  making for enviable efficiency  Delta reported 2  fuel efficiency improvement through fleet renewal and other initiatives in 2019  Investment in new aircraft lays the groundwork for stability when the cyclical airline industry slows down 
Delta anticipates significant international growth  making a deal in September for 14 large wide body Airbus A350s with new strategic partner LATAM Airlines  NYSE LTM   CEO Ed Bastian said   This gives us an opportunity to expand our A350 fleet  which we have a relatively sub scale number of at 15 today  
A pivotal joint venture opens a lucrative market
Finally  Delta s pending joint venture with LATAM  Latin America s largest airline  promises to make Delta as competitive in South America as it is in other international markets 
At present  Delta lacks scale in South America  The partnership with LATAM changes that as Delta gains access to major South American hubs and connecting traffic it hasn t had access to before  This should drive strong revenue growth for Delta as it becomes more appealing to the lucrative business traveler flying between the U S  and South America 
The joint venture must go through the regulatory review process  which can take a long time  The fact that Delta has such low market share in South America should smooth antitrust approval  though  In the meantime  they intend to start code sharing this year 
What does this mean for investors 
In terms of customer service  Delta is one of the best airlines flying today  It was rated the No 1 airline in the Business Travel News Airline Survey for a record ninth consecutive year 

The airline has strategic catalysts in place for growth  namely the joint venture with LATAM Airlines  the long term co branding agreement with American Express  and fleet optimization  Those efforts will put it in a stable position for the inevitable cyclical slowdown sometime in the future 

Delta s results for fiscal year 2019 were solid  Adjusted earnings per share came in at  7 31  a 30  increase year over year  and total revenue increased to a record  47 billion  up 7 5   Total expense increased 3 9   in line with the company s guidance 

Delta shares pay a 2 6  dividend  which has increased steadily since 2013  and trade at only 8 5 times earnings  Considering the strong economy  cost reductions  and profitable partnerships in place for the long term  Delta shares seem like a bargain  All indications are that investors will be well rewarded for years to come ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pldvv,2064992

The severity of the virus  ultimately  will dictate the market s reaction and just because indexes had managed to shrug off the contagion from outbreaks in the past doesn t mean that will be the case this time   For one  coronavirus comes during the important Lunar New Year  when Asia tends to see peak travel and consumer spending   As of Friday  Beijing had shut down parts of the Great Wall  as well as 16 cities  restricting movement of some 46 million people  and canceling many events related to the Lunar New Year    There are concerns that the coronavirus may spread quickly within and beyond China  causing economic and market damage  This is particularly a concern as travel ahead of the Lunar New Year is getting underway   wrote Jeffrey Kleintop  Charles Schwab s chief global investment strategist  China also extended the holiday to Feb  3  to help contain the virus   The Wall Street Journal reported that the incubation period for the virus is around 14 days  citing health officials  People are most likely not contagious before symptoms develop 










A pandemic couldn t come at a worse time for China s sluggish economy  which slowed to 6 1  rate of annual growth last year  according to gross domestic product figures released last Friday  which reflected the lowest reading for Beijing in nearly three decades   The upcoming Lunar New Year celebration could accelerate the virus s spread as well as its economic impact   wrote analysts at Wells Fargo Securities  led by Jay Bryson  in a Wednesday report   Meanwhile  WHO has thus far avoided declaring an international health emergency but was convening to discuss the outbreak again on Monday  And travel related stocks have taken a hit this week thus far  Shares of Priceline com parent Booking Holdings Inc

48878,270393,DAL,Delta crew failed to warn controllers about Los Angeles fuel dump   FAA,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  flight crew that dumped fuel on several Los Angeles area schools before making an emergency landing  causing minor injuries to schoolchildren  did not inform air traffic controllers it planned to do so  the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  said Wednesday 
Delta Flight 89  which was turned back for an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport after departing for Shanghai  dumped fuel on the playgrounds of at least four elementary schools in its flight path  causing minor injuries to at least 44 children and adults on the ground  the Los Angeles County Fire Department said on Twitter 
None of the children or adults needed hospitalization  the department added 
 A review of yesterday s air traffic control communications shows the Delta Flight 89 crew did not tell air traffic control that they needed to dump fuel   the FAA said   In this emergency situation  the fuel dumping procedure did not occur at an optimal altitude that would have allowed the fuel to atomize properly  
Before making emergency landings  planes often dump fuel to reduce their weight for safety reasons  The FAA said in a statement that air crews will typically notify air traffic control of an emergency and indicate the need to dump fuel  with controllers then directing the crew to an appropriate fuel dumping area  The agency said it is continuing to investigate the circumstances behind the incident 
The Los Angeles Times obtained audio of the conversation  quoting a controller asking the Delta pilot about fuel 
 OK  so you don t need to hold to dump fuel or anything like that   the control asked  The pilot responded   Negative  
Delta said on Tuesday it shares  concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children at a school in the area  and said the fuel was dumped to reach a safe landing weight 
Delta declined to comment Wednesday on the FAA statement but said on its website that 13 airline cleaning crews worked with school crews  to clean all outside surfaces that students could come into contact with   The schools all reopened as scheduled on Wednesday ",2020-01-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/delta-crew-failed-to-warn-controllers-about-los-angeles-fuel-dump--faa-2060513,2060513

48893,270408,DAL,Can Delta Air Lines Stock Keep Soaring in 2020 ,news,"In the past  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  had a poor reputation as a slow and stodgy legacy airline  The darkest hour came in 2005  when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  Since emerging as an independent company in 2007  Delta has rebranded and restructured a culture of excellence  achieving a reputation that has now earned it  industry leading reliability and record customer satisfaction  
Delta will hope to wrap up a solid 2019 when it reports Q4 earnings on Jan  14  Here s what investors need to know about Delta and expect from its earnings report 
The paradigm shift

DAL data by YCharts
The past decade was nothing less than revolutionary in terms of investor sentiment toward airline stocks  All six major airline stocks ascended over 200  in the 2010s  beating the S P 500 during one of the best bull markets in history 
In years past  even top investors like Warren Buffett criticized the cyclical nature and capital intensity of airlines  That changed in 2016 when Berkshire Hathaway purchased shares of four major airlines  one of which was Delta  Buffett then added more than 5 million shares in 2019 

Q3 earnings and Q4 outlook
Delta reported Q3 2019 basic earnings per share  EPS  of  2 32    a 29  increase year over year  YOY   With the economy booming and the summer travel season in full swing  third quarter earnings are typically one of the best for airline stocks  For Delta  it was outstanding  CEO Edward H  Bastian noted    W e had  a  record summer in terms of both volumes and revenues  so all time high revenues for us  
Most of the growth for air travel is from emerging markets  but Delta was able to increase domestic revenues by 8  in the third quarter of 2019  Basic earnings per share for the nine months ended Sept  30  2019 stand at  5 61 versus  4 20 from the same period in 2018  a 33  increase 
Delta is forecasting Q3 2019 EPS of  1 20 to  1 50  wrapping up 2019 guidance of  6 75 to  7 25 and a 2020 outlook of  6 75 to  7 75  Although 2020 isn t expected to have the same YOY growth as 2018 to 2019  Delta s earnings  compared to the price  make it a powerhouse value stock 
Financial analysis

DAL data by YCharts
Between May 2019 and July 2019  Delta increased its quarterly dividend by 15   fueling a decade that ended with a 570  increase to its dividend  The company s 2 5  dividend yield is the highest of all airline stocks  making Delta a competitive dividend stock  as well 
In terms of value  Delta used  468 million of its  1 43 billion in free cash flow  FCF  from 3Q 2019 for   208 million in share repurchases and  260 million in dividends   The company expects total 2019 free cash flow to be about  4 billion and is guiding for  4 billion for 2020  as well  meaning cash flow is strong enough to cover current payouts and future dividend raises  On top of that  Delta s price to free cash flow is second only to Southwest Airlines  and its price to earnings  P E  ratio sits at just 8 2  which is less than a third of the current S P 500 s P E ratio  
What to watch
Delta Air Lines had nothing short of a banner decade full of record breakers and improving economics for the industry as a whole  For 4Q 2019  investors should look to make sure that earnings come in between the  1 20  1 50 range and the cash flow outlook stays where it is  Despite Delta stock s 223  surge in the 2010s  the core valuation metrics remain low  meaning Delta s stock appreciation is well deserved 
Keep in mind that the airline industry is cyclical  meaning profits could stall or drop in a slowing economy  That being said  low fuel prices and growing demand for air travel in emerging markets are two tailwinds that should persist over the long term  making Delta Air Lines a solid income and value stock to round out your portfolio ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phvl6,2058996
48894,270409,DAL,Delta s Strong Results Lift Airline Sector,news,"By Kim Khan 
Investing com   Airline stocks caught an updraft Tuesday after Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  came in with solid quarterly numbers ahead of trading 
Delta reported fourth quarter earnings of  1 70 per share  excluding items  blowing past the consensus forecast of  1 40 compiled by Investing com 
Total revenue rose 6 5  from the same quarter a year ago to  11 44 billion  topping expectations of  11 34 billion 
Shares of Delta  NYSE DAL  rose 4  in midday trading 
United Airlines  NASDAQ UAL  was up 2   JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ JBLU  gained 0 4  and American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  climbed 1 6  
The SPDR S P Transportation ETF  NYSE XTN  rose 1  
 There s no question that we re picking up new customers  but that s not the main driver of our performance   Delta CEO Ed Bastian told Reuters  citing a strong brand and customer loyalty at a time when air travel demand continues to rise 
Demand is rising at a time when the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX is keeping much needed capacity off the U S  market  enabling airlines to charge higher fares  Delta profits from that more than most because it has no 737 MAX aircraft  
Demand is rising at a time when the grounding of the Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX is keeping much needed capacity off the U S  market  enabling airlines to charge higher fares  Delta profits from that more than most because it has no 737 MAX aircraft  
Bastian sees the trend continuing in the first quarter with estimated revenue growth of 5  to 7  year on year as demand continues to rise  at record levels  
Delta wants to remain a customer of both Boeing  NYSE BA  and Airbus  PA AIR  but Bastian said the longer Boeing takes to decide on the NMA   its new midsize plane    the fewer options the airline has  Airbus  A321XLR and A330 could be alternatives to the new Boeing jet  he said

joining us on our December quarter and full year call  Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO  Ed Bastian  our President  Glen Hauenstein  and our CFO  Paul Jacobson  Our entire leadership team is here in the room with us for the Q A  Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta s financial performance  Glen will then address the revenue environment  and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow To get in as many questions as possible during the Q A  please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up Today s discussion does contain forward looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events  All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements  Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in our SEC filings We ll also discuss non GAAP financial measures  All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find a reconciliation of our non GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir delta com And with that  Ed Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jill  Good morning  everyone  We appreciate you joining us today  Earlier  Delta reported our full year results  including the December quarter pre tax profit of  1 4 billion  which is up  240 million compared to last year  Our EPS in the quarter increased 31  to  1 70  with pre tax margins expanding 140 basis points to 12 4   The December quarter performance was a great finish to what was truly an outstanding year on all fronts  strategically with the American Express renewal and the announcement of LATAM and we also have partnerships operationally with best in class completion factor and on time performance  and financially with industry leading revenue  profits  and cash flow 2019 was the best year in our history  The topline grew 7 5  to  47 billion  positioning Delta as the largest carrier by revenue in the world  We delivered  6 2 billion in pre tax income  an improvement of more than  1 billion over 2018  setting a new record for Delta and the US airline industry  Full year earnings per share improved 30  over the prior year and we generated  4 2 billion of free cash flow with  3 billion returned to owners  These results simply would not be possible without the incredible work of our Delta team  I am pleased we ll recognize our employees  performance in 2019 with  1 6 billion profit sharing  This marks the highest profit sharing in Delta s history and is the sixth consecutive year of  1 billion or more in profit share  We could not be happier for our people For our customers  we continue to run the world s most reliable airline  We ended the year with 165 cancel free days across the entire Delta branded system with 281 zero cancel days on our mainline operations  representing an entire month s worth of improvement over the record performance that we set in 2018  Recently  Delta was named 2019 s Most On time North American Airline by FlightGlobal for the third year in a row  Exceptional operational performance  along with unmatched customer service is why more people than ever are choosing to fly Delta In 2019  we flew 204 million customers  a 6  increase over 2018  And over the last decade  we significantly improved the quality and reliability of Delta s operations  And as a result  our customer satisfaction scores have more than tripled  Domestic Net Promoter Score is now regularly in the 50s  with nearly 5 point improvement over the course of 2019  Delta s continued investment in our operations  product  service  airports  and technology are reshaping customers  perception of our brand And our journey to improve continues daily  and we plan to keep climbing by powering our culture of service through technology  Last week  I had the honor of delivering the opening keynote address at the Consumer Electronic Show  where we outlined Delta s vision for the future of travel  unveiling innovative technologies to better serve customers and give our employees the best tools to use in the world Delta is leading the industry in every dimension  In five short years  Delta will celebrate its 100th anniversary  It s amazing to think how far we ve come but even more exciting to look ahead  2020 is off to a good start  The U S  consumer and travel demand remain healthy  Our brand has strong momentum and we have a pipeline of commercial initiatives that support another year of revenue growth in excess of GDP  Consistent with our plan that we outlined at Investor Day last month  we expect to grow 2020 revenue by 4  to 6   This is on top of the 15  growth that we ve delivered over the last two years  Our full year earnings outlook of  6 75 to  7 75 per share positions Delta for the sixth straight year of pre tax profit in excess of  5 billion  Free cash flow is also expected to remain strong at  4 billion in 2020  This would bring Delta s three year cumulative free cash flow to over  10 billion by the end of this year By leveraging a solid financial foundation with increasingly diverse revenue streams and building brand momentum  we are demonstrating an unprecedented level of earnings and free cash flow consistency for this industry  This is enabling us to reinvest in our business at a level that others cannot match  This reinvestment is extending our competitive advantages and when combined with a great brand powered by the very best people in the business  we have the engine to drive meaningful long term value for our customers  our employees  and our owners With that  I d like to turn the call over to Glen and to Paul to go through the details of the quarter Glen Hauenstein    PresidentThanks  Ed  and good morning  First  I d like to thank the entire Delta team for delivering a record year in 2019  It s their hard work that enabled  47 billion in revenue  an increase of more than  3 billion over prior year  The 7 5  growth was broad based with strength in both business and leisure  improvements in domestic and international  and double digit growth in loyalty and MRO Total unit revenues improved 2 8   sustaining our revenue premium to the industry of more than 110  and outpacing non fuel unit cost growth of 2   We continued to diversify the topline with 53  of our revenue generated by premium products  loyalty  and other non ticket revenue sources  Premium product revenue grew 9  in the year to  15 billion  We ve continued to improve and invest in the premium experience and we are seeing increasing product affinity  On average  70  of customers that fly in premium products purchase an equal or better product on a future trip We are providing SkyMiles members more options to use miles anywhere they can use cash with Delta  Since launching Upsell with Miles a little over a year ago  1 2 million customers have redeemed miles  contributing  135 million of incremental revenue and we continue to expand capabilities most recently with the ability to pay it for bag fees using miles Brand preference for Delta is stronger than ever  We are seeing momentum in customer satisfaction scores and in 2019 Business Travel News named Delta the world s best airline for business travel for the ninth year in a row  More customers are choosing to interact directly with us with 52  of trips purchased directly from Delta during the year  Digital is our fastest growing distribution channel  Mobile revenues grew by 35   driven by an active user base of over 24 million customers  Total loyalty revenues grew 18   We added the highest number of SkyMiles members in our history with over 6 million new enrollments  We also acquired 1 1 million new co brand cards  setting a new record and marking the third consecutive year of more than 1 million co brand acquisitions  We deepened our customer engagement to drive 12  growth in mileage redemptions in program spend  This is the fifth year of double digit growth for portfolio spend  In 2019  our renewed contract with American Express benefited revenue by approximately  500 million Delta s close relationship with American Express is a strategic advantage that is truly unique  In 2019  total contributions grew by 20  to  4 1 billion  We expect this to reach  4 4 billion in 2020 and grow to nearly  7 billion by 2023 on a combination of improved rates  continued acquisition momentum  and spend growth Enhancing customer loyalty and building trust is at the heart of our business  And together with American Express  we are finding new and innovative ways to reward customers for their loyalty  Later this month  we will be launching our new portfolio of card offerings  The redesigned cards deliver new and richer rewards that will continue to increase customer benefits and drive future card acquisitions Turning to the December quarter  we delivered a strong close to the year with topline revenue growth of 7 2   Total unit revenue growth of 2 4  beat guidance and marked our 11th consecutive quarter of improvement over prior year  Passenger unit revenue was up 1 4  over prior year  led by strength in domestic and Latin  Holiday travel came in ahead of expectations  driven by strong consumer sentiment and a condensed booking period between Thanksgiving and Christmas  Domestically  we saw strength in business and leisure demand with solid yield gains on peak travel days Premium product revenue outpaced our expectations growing 9  in the December quarter on top of last year s 10  growth  Domestically  revenue was up 7 7  on a 1 6  improvement in unit revenues  Corporate demand was strong at up 6  and premium products remain a key contributor  up 11  year over year Similar to the September quarter  we saw revenue and margin improvement in every domestic hub with revenue up 10  in coastal hubs and 6  in core hubs  Internationally  revenue grew 2  on flat PRASM  Latin was the best performing entity with 6 3  PRASM improvement  a 3 point improvement sequentially  Brazil and Mexico  both delivered double digit PRASM gains  In the Atlantic  PRASM declined 1 6   almost entirely driven by FX  Pacific revenue stabilized on a 3 point sequential PRASM improvement  While China remained soft  trends improved in Japan and Delta Premium Select performed well  as we continue our fleet in product transformation  The new and reconfigured aircraft now on 80  of our Pacific routes  we have the Delta One suites and Premium Select products in place  In the March quarter  we expect total unit revenues to increase by 5  to 7  on unit revenues up flat to up 2   The sequential change in unit revenues from the December quarter is due to lapping last year s American Express contract benefits and MRO engine volume timing  Importantly  PRASM growth remains consistent at approximately 1 5  in both 4Q  19 and 1Q  20  March quarter expected capacity growth includes approximately 2 points of leap year and the launch of service to India In 2020  our plan of 4  to 6  revenue growth is driven by four areas  Strengthening brand preference  better selling and servicing of our products  continuing to win with business and corporate travelers  and driving increased loyalty with more customers  Corporate and leisure demand trends remain healthy  The overall outlook for corporate travel is positive  In our most recent survey  80  of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their spend in 2020  Momentum in premium product revenue is continuing in 2020 with the ongoing modernization of our widebody fleet and improvements in how we sell and distribute premium products  We also expect additional growth from American Express and MRO  albeit at a more moderate rate than in 2019 In our network  we are expanding service in coastal hubs  refocusing on opportunities in our core and developing our partnerships with LATAM  We expect to begin our codeshare relationship in the March quarter  In December  we launched new service from JFK to Mumbai and revenue trends are ahead of forecast  We expect approximately a 1 point unit revenue pressure in the transatlantic as the route develops throughout the year  In the first half of the year  Delta will consolidate Tokyo operations at the preferred downtown Haneda Airport  We will also shift Beijing service to the new Beijing Daxing Airport  These moves are strategically important and are the final steps in our multi year restructuring journey in the Pacific Over the last decade  Delta has established a global scale advantage through an unprecedented network transformation and by building a leading portfolio of partnerships around the world  This evolution provides the foundation for an acceleration of returns over the next decade as we mature and grow investments in fleet  partners  facilities  and technology  Delta s continued investment ensures that we extend our competitive advantages  Our culture  operational reliability  global network  customer loyalty and an investment grade balance sheet retain our leadership position in the industry  In closing  we delivered an outstanding 2019 and are off to a very strong start in 2020 Now  I ll turn it over to Paul Paul Jacobson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Glen  Good morning  everyone  and thank you all for joining us  In 2019  we delivered pre tax income of  6 2 billion  more than a  1 billion improvement versus prior year and over  300 million higher than Delta s prior record  Pre tax margin expanded by 160 basis points to 13 2   Earnings grew 30  to  7 31 per share  Cash flow was also a key performance highlight  We generated over  4 billion in free cash flow while continuing to invest in our people  our fleet  our partners  and technology These investments are generating strong returns with an after tax return on invested capital of 16 2  in 2019  This represents nearly 500 basis points of improvement since 2010  all while doubling our invested capital base  In the December quarter  pre tax margin expanded 140 basis points to 12 4   This was above guidance on stronger unit revenue  lower fuel and a net  80 million gain that resulted from selling our stake in GOL and beginning to unwind our relationship  Excluding this gain  pre tax margin grew 70 basis points and earnings beat consensus by approximately  0 21 While total expense grew 6 9  in the quarter  half of that growth was due to pension expense  the markup of benefit related balance sheet obligations and profit sharing from the growth in profits  These cost increases were partially offset by lower fuel expense  which declined  370 million primarily on lower market fuel prices  Non fuel unit costs were up 4 4  in the quarter  in line with our guidance  For the full year  non fuel unit costs came in at 2   consistent with our long term target despite the pressures we saw in the back half of the year  For the March quarter  we expect non fuel unit costs to increase 2  to 3   While fuel has been volatile over the last month  based on yesterday s price  we expect March quarter fuel price of  2 00 to  2 20 per gallon  in line to slightly above prior year  Combined with the outlook on revenue Glen provided  we expect March quarter pre tax margin to be roughly flat year over year Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow  During 2019  we generated  8 4 billion of operating cash and invested  4 5 billion back into the business  Free cash flow of  4 2 billion resulted in nearly 90  of net income converted to free cash flow As outlined at Investor Day  we are planning capital spending of  4 5 billion in 2020 as we continue to replace our fleet and invest in product and technology  These investments are transforming Delta s fleet to drive margin benefit through higher customer satisfaction  increased premium seats and significant fuel efficiency improvements  which is helping to drive our sustainability goals  Returns on these investments are strong and the compounding benefits of reinvestment support long term growth Delta s investment grade balance sheet remains an important competitive advantage  Including the debt we raised during the quarter  our leverage ratio was 1 7 times at year end  This puts us at the low end of our targeted adjusted debt to EBITDAR range of 1 5 to 2 5 times  Bad debt issuance was  1 5 billion of unsecured debt  made up of five year and 10 year notes  The blended unsecured rate of 3 24  is the lowest for these durations in Delta s history  The proceeds funded the majority of the acquisition of 20  equity stake in LATAM  With LATAM tender now complete  we will begin recognizing 20  of LATAM s earnings in the non operating line beginning in the March quarter Moving to pension  we are actively managing our obligation through a combination of funding and asset returns  In the December quarter  we contributed an incremental  500 million of voluntary contributions into the plan  bringing elective contributions in 2019 to  1 billion  For the year  planned asset returns were about 19 5   fueled by strength in the US equity markets  which will drive favorability in our 2020 pension expense  And while lower discount rates impacted the liability  our funding strategy and strong returns helped improve our funded status of 75   This is a 700 basis point improvement over prior year and nearly double the funded status in 2012  In 2019  Delta s unfunded liability also improved by  1 billion We plan to make  500 million of elective contributions in 2020  Under airline relief  recall  we have no mandatory contributions through 2024  Strong cash generation allows us to reinvest in the business  while also addressing these balance sheet obligations and simultaneously consistently returning capital to shareholders  In the December quarter  we returned  225 million in share repurchases and  259 million in dividends for a total of  3 billion in 2019  We ended 2019 with  1 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization  which we expect to complete by the middle of this year  It is our powerful brand  unmatched competitive advantages  and the collective efforts of all Delta people that allow us to continue to deliver industry leading results and drive long term values for our owners  our customers and for our people  and I m truly excited for the year ahead Consistent with the guidance changes announced at Investor Day  we are no longer providing quarterly EPS but are well on track to deliver full year earnings per share of  6 75 per share to  7 75 per share in 2020  and we expect another strong year of free cash flow with expectations for  4 billion again this year  bringing our three year cumulative free cash flow total to over  10 billion by the end of 2020 And with that  I ll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q A Jill Greer    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  Paul  Shannon  we re ready for the question and answer period with the analysts  if you could give them instructions on how to get in the queue Questions and Answers OperatorCertainly   Operator Instructions  And our first question will come from David Vernon of Bernstein David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystHey  good morning  guys  Thanks for the time  So as you think about the decision to sort of accelerate the investments in technology and experience  maybe even going after some adjacent revenues in rideshare through partnership and that kind of thing  is this    are these activities going to be funded kind of within the existing capital envelope or do you expect Delta to kind of maybe spend a little bit more over the next couple of years as you look on kind of executing the vision you laid out at CES Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerHey  David  thanks  Yes  the capital that we spoke of at CES and the technology that we displayed is within the envelope that we ve been working within in technology  but one of the things that we ve done over the last several years is    up to our investment in technology and we re now on our capital level  running at about  500 million a year in technology  However  for the first couple of years of that  a lot of it was just focused on infrastructure and resiliency and the data sets and data architecture that s now finally starting to be able to produce this type of technology and innovation that you re seeing  And so it s going to be more heavily weighed going forward toward business and commercial application as compared to infrastructure but it sits within the envelope we ve been using David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystAnd maybe just as a quick follow up  as you think about the return on this incremental investment  is this going to be sort of a gradual enhancement to the revenue premium that you earn or do you see some sort of step changes in opportunity along the way  whether it s material cost out or revenue opportunities  kind of  within the next three to five years Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerI think it s both  David  Certainly the revenue opportunities are significant  We do go through in this past year  we looked at what we thought the    our digital investments and new product offerings this year generated and we estimate about  200 million of incremental revenue  whether it be using SkyMiles as a currency to upsell the new generation shopping and booking tools that we have  opportunities also sit on the cost front with better decision support in high routes and optimizing the fleet and making certain that we re able to ensure that our crew are best utilized and any downtimes are minimized and I could go on  There is a long list of opportunities that we have So I think it s going to be both the cost opportunity as well as a strong enhancement to the brand as we build closer and closer digital connections with our customers  204 million customers a year  the only way you can build that connection with them at the personal level that they choose is digital and we re off to a great start David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystAll right  Thanks  guys OperatorOur next question will come from Helane Becker of Cowen Helane Becker    Cowen   Co  LLC    AnalystThanks very much  operator  Hi  everybody  and thank you very much for your time  Glen  I know you said that you re seeing strong demand on the corporate side  and I m sure that s true  but you know I m starting to hear from some companies that they re thinking about cutting expenses and asking their employees to rethink some travel and I m wondering if you re seeing any signs of that among your top corporates or if you could just mention maybe where you re seeing the strength  Is it a particular industry group Glen Hauenstein    PresidentNo  I think we re seeing strength across the board and we ve heard this from time to time that people are worried about corporate spend and travel  but it seems to be in a very good position as we head into 2020 and as a matter of fact  last year we did see a little bit of weakness in manufacturing  but we re starting to lap that and we re starting to see some positive momentum coming out of that sector  So generally  we re seeing some very good signs from our corporate Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the only thing I d add to that Helane  this is Ed  is that we re certainly seeing some weakness as Glen touched on in Asia with the China issues and some of the tariff discussions that split over into Korea and few of the other Asian economies  But fundamentally  Glen s right  the health of our businesses in the U S  and the U S  corporate is doing quite well Helane Becker    Cowen   Co  LLC    AnalystOkay  Okay  thank you  And then just as a follow up to that  would you rather see faster growth in leisure traffic or faster growth in corporate traffic Glen Hauenstein    PresidentWe ve experienced both  I think we like them both equally and I think what we re seeing in leisure is really    what we re seeing in leisure really is an interesting separation of people who are looking for quality and willing to pay higher fares or upsell into better products and services at the highest quality airline in the U S  So  we see an increase in yields on high leisure  Phonetic   which is very good for the industry Helane Becker    Cowen   Co  LLC    AnalystRight  So what you re seeing is leisure travelers buying up and fewer people in that basic economy bucket  Is that a way to interpret your comment Glen Hauenstein    PresidentThat s a way to look at it Helane Becker    Cowen   Co  LLC    AnalystOkay  All right  great  Well  OK  thanks very much for your help  I appreciate it OperatorAnd our next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research  LLC    AnalystHey  good morning  Thanks  Helane  just said segwayed nicely into my question actually  You mentioned leisure seeking quality  Glen  is there a point where you view basic economy as being brand dilutive to the point where maybe it doesn t really fit the Delta concept anymore as you guys try to sort of focus on that higher quality Glen Hauenstein    PresidentI think from the beginning we ve been really clear that we want to have the best in class products and services  no matter what your travel needs are  and I think we would always see for entry level customers who are only sensitive to price that we would have best in class there  As a matter of fact  you might think that our over investment is highest in basic economy  but that s the entry point and once they see the quality of service that Delta people provide  I think they stay with us throughout their entire life cycle and that s an important product for us to continue to maintain Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research  LLC    AnalystOkay  And then if you think big picture  take a step back for a second and think over the next five to 10 years  would you ever get so comfortable with your loyalty and value proposition to intentionally drive down your load factors  Just a few points with an eye on driving RASM  pretty much entirely through driving a yield premium  which    so the idea would be really you change the overall feel of the flying experience with less crowds and less pricing volatility to really truly differentiate yourself as a premium brand and feel airline Glen Hauenstein    PresidentI think we re always looking at what that is and I think we ve taken steps really structurally  Let s say  we invented Comfort Plus in the domestic arena  I think what we would see maybe is the continued adoption and demand for that product builds over time that we might create more of that on existing fleets  which would take the density out  I can t see us ever wanting to fly with a few seats  But I can t see us wanting to sell a plane that is meeting the demands of our customer base that might include more premium even than we have today Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research  LLC    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from Andrew Didora of Bank of America Andrew Didora    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  good morning  everyone  I actually had a follow up question on the tech investments  I guess   Technical Issues   500 million you re spending on tech capex  how do you think about the ROI needed on that spend relative to say on a new plane order or plane refresh Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerWell  Andrew  we need to do both  right  This is not    we re not trading off technology for planes  We need to have    continue the enhancement of our fleet  that s clearly where the bulk of our capex goes is into our fleet and the modification of our aircraft  We re going to be taking 80 new airplanes into the fleet this year and those and    but those fleet investments are also then facilitating technology as we bring new technology on board with fleet  So I don t    I don t look at them as differentiators or trade offs  We ve got an overall capex budget that we look at as a Company  We try to stay within the 50  threshold  plus or minus of operating cash and that s how we get there  Now  we do certainly look at ROI and returns on every one of our digital investments and capital initiatives and I m pleased to say they ve been producing largely the results we d expect Andrew Didora    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  thank you  And Glen  I know in the press release and you ve been breaking out the domestic results by both core hubs and coastal hubs  As you think about growing your network over the next one to two years  what segment of those do you see the biggest capacity opportunity then  And then as a follow up  just    I assume the core hubs are Atlanta  Detroit  Minneapolis and Salt Lake  but do you see any of the coastal markets moving into the core bucket anytime soon  Thank you Glen Hauenstein    PresidentI think they re core  they re just not geographically centered  So your ability to connect traffic when you re in Seattle is a lot less than when you re in Salt Lake City or Atlanta or the other ones you named  So we have really used our first mover advantage post merger to take advantage of having the opportunity to consolidate positions in some of the key coastal markets like Seattle  Boston  Los Angeles  New York  but we did that at    little bit at the expense of growing connectivity in our interior hubs  And so over the next several years  we ll be working on continuing to improve the products and services we offer at the coastal hubs but really refocusing a little bit on growing the interior hubs to improve the connectivity in our interior hubs Andrew Didora    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  Hey  good morning  everyone  I guess just two quick ones here  Paul  I just want to make sure I heard you right  the LATAM running that through the P L  I know it closed late in the fourth quarter  but I guess  nothing really shows up in the fourth quarter  Is it beginning in the March quarter  Did I hear you right on that Paul Jacobson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s correct  Mike  beginning in the March quarter Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  And then with respect to getting to the 20  as I recall  I don t know if there was a sort of conversation about whether or not it was going to be one or two board seats  do you have a better sense    do you know whether or not you have two board seats at LATAM as a result of that  Has that been figured out Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerYes  we have two board seats  Mike Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  great  Great quarter  Thank you Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Thanks  Mike OperatorAnd we ll now hear from Jamie Baker of JP Morgan Jamie Baker    JP Morgan    AnalystHey  good morning  everybody  First question for Glen  and it s a follow up to a topic that we discussed last quarter regarding the potential to generate an international RASM premium at some point  I m curious if the fourth quarter result or the first quarter outlook shows any progress in this regard  And secondly  does the full year guide have any specific assumptions or should we treat any potential evidence of an international RASM premium as upside to the guide Glen Hauenstein    PresidentYeah  I think we are continually working to improve our international unit revenues  And I think this fourth quarter was a    we re moving in the right direction and we see those trends continuing into the first quarter  We can t see yet what our competitors are doing  but I think we have an opportunity to continue to increase our relative performance and our absolute performance as we go through 2020 and hopefully beyond what we have in our plan Jamie Baker    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  Second for Ed  It s related to ESG  I know you spoke about the topic at Investor Day  you gave some examples of Delta s environmental consciousness  I m not sure if you saw Larry Fink s letter this morning  I mean what I keep struggling with on this topic is fleet  We ve commended your fleet strategy for some time now  specifically running a higher average age than your competitors  I just have to wonder if we re on the cusp of that possibly coming back to haunt you and whether ESG compliance necessitates bringing the fleet age down  which in turn has capex implications  I m not quite sure how to phrase the question  but how would you respond to somebody telling you that your fleet strategy is incompatible with growing ESG mandates  How about that Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerLet s say it s an interesting way to put it  Jamie  Listen  we take our ESG and very specifically  our environmental and sustainability requirements and goals to heart  And hopefully  you heard me not only at the Investor Day  but also at CSI closed on that topic specifically  It s something that fleet plays a big part of  Candidly being somewhat having an older fleet actually has given us opportunities to move faster in that space maybe than others  Every plane we put in  and we re putting in 80 new planes that are 25  more fuel efficient than the planes that we re retiring  We at Delta were the only airline back in 2012 that voluntarily capped our carbon footprint at 2012 levels  No other airline has done anything like that  We re looking at ways by which we can go even more aggressively  Fleet is only    fleet s an important part of the solution  but there is many more things to this in terms of how we engage and I think you re going to be hearing us talk more and more about that over the course of the year  I didn t get a chance to see Larry s letter though  I did hear a little bit about it this morning and I think his message is right Jamie Baker    JP Morgan    AnalystThat s helpful  I really appreciate it and I know it s been a busy morning  I wasn t calling you out for not having seen the letter yet  You got bigger things to do  Ed  Thanks again  great quarter  Bye bye Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jamie Glen Hauenstein    PresidentThanks  Jamie OperatorAnd our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey  thanks for taking the questions  Can you clarify your revenue growth guidance versus your RASM guidance into the first quarter  It feels like based on what schedules you re showing  the implied RASM guidance is flattish whereas your explicit RASM guidance is up 1   Phonetic   Is that just a lower refinery year over year or what accounts for that difference Jill Greer    Vice President  Investor RelationsHey  Duane  It s Jill  The refinery sales are slightly lower year over year  but we exclude those from TRASM anyways  And so I think you re just    there s schedule  there s a completion factor adjustment you have to make to schedule  but the revenue growth that we re looking at is a solid 5  to 7  in the first quarter  the total revenue growth Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  great  And then just on the pension  understand you expect a tailwind this year  but can you just talk explicitly about what pension expense was in 2019 and what you expect it to be in 2020  Thanks for taking the questions Paul Jacobson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So thanks  Duane  We had mentioned going in that we had about  250 million of pressure year over year in 2019 as a result of the pension returns in 2018  While we haven t given specific guidance  we    if you look at year over year  we were up about I think 16  in 2017  So you can look back and see the sensitivity around that Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse Joe Caiado    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  thanks very much  Good morning  everyone  My first question just on the LATAM partnership  Apologies if I missed it and Glen you may have talked about it  but I think the codeshare with some of the affiliates slated to begin here in Q1  can you just give us an update on where you are with those government approvals and when in Q1 you think you can launch that  And just as a quick follow up to that  is there a rough estimate that you could share with us on expected 2020 revenue contribution from LATAM Glen Hauenstein    PresidentI ll start with the first one which is easier is that no  we re not going to share that today  On the second issue is by country and I believe this week we received the ability to code in Colombia  We expect Peru and Ecuador to follow shortly  And then the longer    a little bit longer tent in the fall  So those should all be up and running back in 1Q  So a little bit longer holding the tent is Brazil and Chile  which we expect later this year Joe Caiado    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  Thank you for that  And then just a quick one for Paul on CASM Ex  your Q1 guidance right in line with the full year  Should we expect that to be fairly level loaded through the year or are there any big sort of moving pieces that you expect in the year that could drive some quarterly swings in that 2  to 3  trajectory Paul Jacobson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Joe  what I would say is we re obviously not going to give quarterly guidance on CASM for the rest of the year  but as a general rule  if you look at our CASM trajectory in past years  it s been pretty skewed with a lot of volatility  We ve taken a conscious effort in 2020 to try to balance that across to make that cost performance more disciplined throughout the year and that s very intentional Joe Caiado    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  I appreciate that  Thanks  everyone OperatorOur next question will come from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    AnalystHey  good morning everyone and congratulations on a pretty impressive quarter  So  Paul  you guys have had really strong cash flow here and not to be too much of a cheerleader but it is a differentiated experience on your carrier  So  I guess  is there any positive momentum here in capex where you d say  hey  actually  we want to spend a little bit more  does it reprioritize fleet over the airport experience over technology are maybe strategic or do you want to stay with this very balanced capital allocation strategy Paul Jacobson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  first of all  thank you for the comments  Brandon  I think the balanced approach has worked very  very well for us in an effort to balance multiple constituencies  whether it s cash flow performance into the enterprise  but driving return on invested capital  We obviously have a lot of demands on capital when you look across the space and the things that we want to do  Prioritization and pace of implementation is an important piece of that  It s not always just capital  it s having the resources to deploy that capital and make sure that it s delivering the benefits and the results  So while I d say  we do have some room around the edges  you ve seen us do that over time  take advantage of opportunities that are out there  we want to hold roughly to that balanced allocation over time Jill Greer    Vice President  Investor RelationsBrandon  If I could weigh in also is that  I d say if there was any area that we d look if we had opportunities to accelerate somewhat  it s in the airport infrastructure and construction  We re in the midst of a very significant build out and clearly the sooner we can get that done  the better  So not suggesting that we re going to change any capex assumptions  but to the extent we had any capital that was available to be allocated  that d be one place I d look for using it Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    AnalystOkay  everyone  thank you OperatorAnd we ll hear next from Savi Syth of Raymond James Savi Syth    Raymond James   Associates    AnalystHey  Glen  I    Good morning  everybody  Glen  I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the regional trends  LATAM  you had a tougher comp versus 3Q  but the performance is still pretty good  I m just wondering as you kind of look forward  generally  what are you seeing from a trend perspective and is there any kind of region where we start to come on tough comps Glen Hauenstein    PresidentWell  we are seeing continued strength in the domestic U S  arena  That s great news for us and we re seeing  I think  some really good green shoots in the transatlantic  We ve had currency issues over the last couple of years since  18 and now that we re going to be lapping them as we move through this year  I think we re poised really well for a nice run on the transatlantic  We ve seen in the transpacific after our multi year restructuring that this is the last piece and there is some uncertainty maybe around the airport moves that we are going to have  those are two major airport moves for us  closing Tokyo and Narita after being there for almost 50 years  That s a big move  And so uncertainty over how many people will prefer Haneda  But I think ultimately  we are very  very confident that Haneda is a better airport to serve Tokyo than Narita  And so there may be some ripples there that it would be unique to us as we have the largest footprint in Haneda and then of course  moving to Daxing in Beijing might be a little bit of a headwind for a short period of time  but again we think that s the right move for us because the connectivity at that airport is going to be far superior in the long run to what s at capital So the Pacific  I think  we re encouraged at the signs  Today s signing or the signing of the agreement  Phase I agreement with China is going to be a good thing for us and if there is an upside to the Chinese  there has been really no capacity or there have been capacity reductions in the U S  to China for the first time in the year  So traffic continues to build into China and capacity is being reduced  So that s always a good thing for the airline industry And then in Latin  we ve seen really good strength in both Mexico and Brazil  and we expect that to continue and then accelerate as we can begin to code with LATAM throughout the year  So I think we ve got a really good base for international  which is encouraging and the sequential trends and the improvements are all moving in the right direction for us Savi Syth    Raymond James   Associates    AnalystThat s very helpful  Thank you  And  Paul  if I d quickly ask just on Trainer  generally what you re expecting  especially now that IMO 2020 has come and gone  Just some quick thoughts on what your expectations are for Trainer and feel in general Paul Jacobson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Savi  So  2019 saw Trainer produce a profit at  75 million free cash flow positive and really a strong contribution to our overall relative fuel story  In 2020  obviously  we ve seen at least where we sit today  significant improvement in crack spreads at the refinery over last year  We expect about breakeven performance compared to about a  35 million loss last year  So we re looking forward to another sizable contribution overall  both in terms of the performance of the refinery as well as the contribution across the commercial space in our fuel procurement Savi Syth    Raymond James   Associates    AnalystThank you OperatorAnd our next question will come from Myles Walton of UBS Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystThanks  Good morning  A lot has changed in the month since the Analyst Day on the MAX continued push out there  shut down a line  likely a slower delivery rate  And so I m kind of curious as you look at your place in the ecosystem  are you taking a lot of active decisions to capture some of that or is this more of a view to benefit through pretty much passive behavior let it come to you  I m just curious how much active management you re thinking about versus simply having the premium revenue come your way  Thanks Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerMyles  this is Ed  We    we ve all been watching the MAX story for the last year and none of us have a very good crystal ball  We re operating our plan  We re not deviating on the plan based on news flow  We have a strong plan for 2020 and to the extent we pick up some marginal revenue  which we clearly have this year  That s great  Again  I would caution everyone  I would not suggest that s premium revenue that we re picking up  because I think the other airlines has done a very nice job of covering their most important revenue pools  but on the margin  we ve clearly been a beneficiary and as long as the MAX stays out of the sky  I guess  we will continue to be one Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystAnd the follow up on the MRO benefit you might get from further aftermarket work running hot  what s the growth rate  I know you said deceleration with the growth rate you have baked in for  20 Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerGrowth rate in 2020 Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystYeah Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerI don t think we ve disclosed that  What we ve talked about really as longer term  there is some growth  But the big growth story in the MRO is a couple of years out as the geared turbofan platform and the Rolls platforms start to enter more service and start to mature  That s where we do expect the MRO revenues to double over the next two to three years from today s level Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thank you Jill Greer    Vice President  Investor RelationsShannon  we re going to have time for one more question from the analyst community OperatorCertainly  we will take our final question from Stephen Trent with Citi Stephen Trent    Citi    AnalystGood morning everybody and thanks very much for taking my time  Just first you mentioned on your Amex credit card growth through 2023  To what degree should the revenue growth be driven by the new brands you re introducing Glen Hauenstein    PresidentNo  we don t disclose the makeup of the construction of the increases  But what we have said is that we expect it to grow from  4 1 billion this year to  7 billion by 2023 and we have a very good component plan  I think we outlined the three pieces that include card spend growth  that included new acquisitions and make changes in the core contract and those three make up those components Stephen Trent    Citi    AnalystOkay  Very helpful  And just one quick follow up  As a follow up to Mike Linenberg s question way back  When you think about LATAM Airlines  are there any things that you see in the business that perhaps at this very early stage look stronger than you expected or maybe a little bit more challenging than you expected  I appreciate you might not be able to give us much color  but I just thought I d ask Glen Hauenstein    PresidentThese are the very early days and we are very  very excited about that partnership and we think it s going to have great long term benefits  We can only see a little bit as the relationship is just starting  And we are just starting to put some of the key components in place with interline agreements  But what we have seen has exceeded our expectations in the early days and we re very optimistic that this is going to be a game changer for us in Latin America Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerIf I could echo Glen s comments  we re very impressed with the leadership team at LATAM as Cueto  Roberto  the entire team is first class group  I think we are going to find as we start to build out the JV with appropriate regulatory approvals  you re going to see this spool up faster than probably any of our other JVs  I think this is really good alignment  There is focus and there is a lot of growth opportunity for both carriers throughout the Americas  So we re very  very pleased Stephen Trent    Citi    AnalystOkay  That s very helpful  Let me leave it there  And thank you again Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerThank you Jill Greer    Vice President  Investor RelationsThat s going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call and I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes  our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Tim Mapes    Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing   Communications OfficerSo we have a few more minutes with the team  I d reiterate Jill s comments earlier to please just hold your questions to one  maybe a short brief follow up and we ll try to get through as many of these as we can  Thank you OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question will come from Leslie Josephs of CNBC Leslie Josephs    CNBC    AnalystHi  good morning  Thanks for taking the question  On the investments on tech  do you guys see Delta becoming sort of a travel platform like for corporate travelers  sort of like an Amex or a Concur  something like that  And then my second question  if you just have any update on what s going on with the pilots and mediation  Thank you Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerLeslie  on your first question  we absolutely do see ourselves as becoming an extended travel platform  We re not going to be looking to get in the TMC space or compete with outfits like Concur  but what we are doing is  from a consumer standpoint  looking to continue to extend the brand using the FlyDelta app  It s more of a digital concierge bringing partners such as Lyft closer into the app  So making it easier for our customers to have an end to end experience through travel on the Delta app and all the way through hotel partners and other ways by which we can take stress out of the consumers  experience  That s    that was the message at CS  and I think it was received well and that s where we re going  We re not going to comment on pilot negotiations  So  I ll pass on your second question Leslie Josephs    CNBC    AnalystOkay  And just on the app  so that s more for individual consumers  not corporate platforms or corporations Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerThis is very much focused on individual consumers  There is clearly some corporate benefits  but right now  we re really focused on serving all customers Leslie Josephs    CNBC    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News Mary Schlangenstein    Bloomberg News    AnalystHi  I just wanted to try again on the pilots  So  would you at least confirm whether or not you re seeking intervention by the National Mediation Board in the negotiations Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerWe are not going to comment on the state of any negotiations with the pilots on any question  Sorry  Mary Mary Schlangenstein    Bloomberg News    AnalystOkay  Thank you Ed Bastian    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Just to clarify  we think it s not appropriate to be talking publicly about it  It s a    obviously  it s a great opportunity for us and our Delta pilots to work together to make sure that they re the best compensated and rewarded for what they do OperatorAnd our next question will come from Ted Reed of Forbes Ted Reed    Forbes    AnalystThank you  My question is for Glen  I imagine that the 10  coastal growth in hubs includes Boston and I d like to know if you anticipated that American would start to grow so fast in Boston  but they re growing very rapidly there and they added three new routes this morning Glen Hauenstein    PresidentYeah  I think we ve had an incredible success in Boston and Boston customers are choosing us at  Indecipherable   As a matter of fact  the third quarter data from the government just came out and we were in a virtual dead heat with JetBlue as the largest revenue carrier in Boston  So I think we made great progress and I think customers will stick with us  and so we ll see who ultimately are the winners and losers in Boston  but I know we are    we ll be a winner Ted Reed    Forbes    AnalystDid you anticipate that American might start to grow there Glen Hauenstein    PresidentI don t know what anybody else is going to do and so this is a very competitive industry and people grow and shrink and I think that in the long term the better products    what we ve consistently saying with is  as long as we think we can provide the best products and services  we re ultimately going to win Ted Reed    Forbes    AnalystAll right  Thank you OperatorAnd our next question will come from David Slotnick of Business Insider David Slotnick    Business Insider

48928,270443,DAL,Delta wants to use tech to improve flying experience,news,By David Shepardson LAS VEGAS  Reuters    Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Tuesday the company plans to use technology to shift employees away from rote tasks and improve the flying experience for passengers  Delta took center stage at Tuesday s opening event at the annual four day CES technology conference   a spot typically held by an automaker or traditional technology companies   Bastian offered a litany of technology improvements aimed at improving the sometimes unpleasant experience of flying  He said Delta has invested billions in technology upgrades over the last five years  including real time bag tracking   Our people should not be spending their time taking tickets and scanning boarding passes  They re way too talented for that   Bastian said at the CES technology forum in Las Vegas  He said the airline s goal is to get  Delta people from out behind the counter so they can assist you  solve your problems in real time   Delta is working with start up companies  including one company to keep airplane cabins clean that uses antimicrobial lights and another start up to help transport and monitor pets  Surveys show price is the top factor when most passengers buy tickets and as a result many airlines have increased charges for services that were previously included in the lowest ticket prices  like picking seats or carrying on a bag   The Atlanta based airline said it will launch  virtual queuing  later this month with its app  to notify customers when their seat   not just their flight   is boarding   aimed at preventing lengthy lines  Delta said it is using artificial intelligence and machine learning to try to reduce delays  Its AI platform  analyzes millions of operational data points   from aircraft positions to flight crew restrictions to airport conditions   to create hypothetical outcomes   Delta also wants passengers to be able to start a movie on one flight and pick up where they left off on the next flight  Delta will test a feature like a  binge button  that would allow a passenger to watch an entire session of a TV show and pilot a program that will recommend future viewing based on prior viewing behavior  Bastian said research shows people are more likely to cry when watching a movie in the air versus on the ground because they are in an  elevated emotional state   Delta said its research shows entertainment can play a key role in helping customers relax while traveling  Delta also plans to test  do not disturb  or  wake me for meal service  features for coach passengers on some longer flights ,2020-01-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/delta-wants-to-use-tech-to-improve-flying-experience-2054460,2054460

48938,270453,DAL,Delta Air Lines Predicts That 2020 Will Be Another Great Year,news,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  has been a consistent outperformer in the airline industry in recent years  The airline has won a loyal following due to its industry leading reliability and a reputation for good service  It also has a dominant position in its three biggest hub markets  Atlanta  Detroit  and Minneapolis St  Paul 
As a result  Delta has reliably produced strong earnings and free cash flow over the past five years  At the company s investor day on Thursday  management predicted that 2020 will be another year of profit growth and solid free cash flow  That makes Delta Air Lines stock look like a great bargain at its current valuation of just eight times earnings 
Earnings on the rise
Delta Air Lines has delivered strong earnings growth over the past decade  Most dramatically  adjusted pre tax income more than doubled from less than  2 billion in 2011 to  4 5 billion by 2014 as Delta honed its revenue generation capabilities  As a result  the stock surged from around  8 at the beginning of 2012 to nearly  50 by the end of 2014 
EPS has continued to rise since then  driven by lower fuel prices  the reduction of the federal tax rate  share buybacks  and further progress on differentiating Delta s products and services to improve its pricing power  Adjusted EPS is on track to end up around  7 in 2019  more than double its 2014 level  Despite this continued EPS growth  Delta stock has stalled out  spending the last five years oscillating between  40 and  60 

Delta Air Lines stock performance  Data by YCharts 
This multiple compression is a strong indication that investors don t think Delta s current level of profitability and cash flow is sustainable  However  Delta Air Lines shows no sign of faltering 
More of the same next year
Back in October  Delta spooked investors when it projected a sharp slowdown in earnings growth for the fourth quarter    even though much of the slowdown was related to one time factors    and stated that adjusted nonfuel unit costs were likely to rise 2  to 3  in 2020  But at the company s recent investor day  management provided a much more optimistic outlook 
First  while Delta does face cost headwinds from higher pay and other staffing investments to support growth  the carrier expects that fuel efficiency will improve by about 2  and pension costs will decline significantly due to strong asset returns in 2019  These factors will help mitigate the airline s underlying cost headwinds 
Second  management is confident in another year of solid top line growth  with revenue rising 4  6  year over year to around  49 billion  Continued revenue growth from Delta s credit card partnership with American Express  the expansion of ancillary businesses like aircraft and engine maintenance  and rising demand for premium seats should all help boost revenue 

The net result is that adjusted EPS should reach a range of  6 75 to  7 75  The low end of that range would represent a modest year over year decline  but the high end translates to double digit EPS growth 
Delta Air Lines is also on track to deliver another year of strong free cash flow in 2020  despite investing heavily to upgrade its fleet  Adjusted free cash flow should reach  4 billion for the second consecutive year  up from  3 2 billion in 2017 and  2 4 billion in 2018 
The outlook beyond 2020 is very promising
If anything  Delta s prospects will improve further in the years after 2020  First  the airline has a huge long term cost opportunity from simplifying its fleet and shifting more flights toward larger  more cost efficient aircraft  The next steps in that journey are the retirement of Delta s MD 88 and MD 90 fleets in late 2020 and 2022  respectively 
Second  Delta will continue to diversify its revenue streams  In conjunction with some recent aircraft deals  it locked in contracts for thousands of future engine shop visits for other airlines  As a result  third party maintenance revenue is on track to more than double by 2024 from the 2019 base of  880 million 
Third  revenue growth from the Amex partnership is set to surge in the years ahead  rising from  4 billion in 2019 and an estimated  4 4 billion in 2020 to an estimated  7 billion by 2022 
In short  despite Delta Air Lines  strong track record from the past decade  investors still seem to be underestimating the company  Delta is taking advantage of that situation by steadily repurchasing stock to shrink its share count and drive even faster EPS growth  It also pays a generous dividend that yields nearly 3   This makes Delta stock extremely attractive ",2019-12-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/p3eqk,2041397
48939,270454,DAL,Southwest can be sued for bumping passenger who spoke Arabic  U S  judge,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    A federal judge on Thursday rejected Southwest Airlines Co s  N LUV  bid to dismiss a discrimination lawsuit by an American of Iraqi descent who was removed from a 2016 flight after another passenger heard him speak in Arabic and feared he might be a terrorist 
U S  District Judge Donna Ryu in Oakland  California said Khairuldeen Makhzoomi could try to show that  Islamophobia   coming amid a  sensitive political climate   was a factor behind his removal  and that Southwest s claim he was removed because he appeared to make threats was pretextual 
Ryu said Makhzoomi could seek damages from Southwest for alleged violations of federal and California civil rights laws  but dismissed claims of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
The Dallas based carrier had argued there was  at most a scintilla of evidence  suggesting racial animus  and said its employees acted reasonably in considering Makhzoomi a possible safety threat 
Southwest did not immediately respond to requests for comment  One of its lawyers declined to comment 
 The case is moving forward  and we look forward to trial   said Zahra Billoo  a lawyer for Makhzoomi  A trial is scheduled for Feb  3  2020 
The incident occurred on an April 6  2016 Southwest flight awaiting takeoff to Oakland from Los Angeles 
Makhzoomi  then a 26 year old public policy student at the University of California  Berkeley  had been talking with his uncle by cellphone after attending a dinner featuring United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki moon 
Two police officers and Southwest customer service manager Shoaib Ahmed removed Makhzoomi from the plane after a woman who had been seated nearby became agitated  and reported having heard him use words associated with suicide martyrdom 
 I would say the fact that  American  was said next to it  and I m on a plane  I wasn t sure what to make of it   the woman  her name shielded by a pseudonym  said in a deposition 
Makhzoomi  a U S  citizen who arrived in the country as an Iraqi refugee  denied making threatening statements  and denied Ahmed s claim that he had used the words bomb  ISIS  jihad and martyrdom on the plane 
Southwest s lawyers also represent Ahmed 
Makhzoomi was questioned by local law enforcement and the FBI before flying home on Delta Air Lines  N DAL   after Southwest decided not to rebook him and instead refunded his ticket  court papers show 
The case is Makhzoomi v Southwest Airlines Co et al  U S  District Court  Northern District of California  No  18 00924 ",2019-12-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/southwest-can-be-sued-for-bumping-passenger-who-spoke-arabic-us-judge-2045495,2045495
48940,270455,DAL,If You Invested  500 in Delta Airlines  IPO  This Is How Much Money You d Have Now,news,"Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  has come a long way from starting as a crop dusting company in 1924  Deciding to purchase larger planes in 1928 and obtain routes for the United States Postal Service led Delta on a successful path until the September 11th terrorist attacks  high jet fuel prices  and increased competition from low cost competitors pushed Delta into bankruptcy in 2005  Shortly afterward  shares of Delta became public during the launch of the IPO on May 1  2007  at  20 per share  
Purchasing shares of a company on the first day of trading can provide additional risk and volatility  however  the risk was worth the reward for Delta shareholders holding shares for over 12 years 
How much money you would have from investing in Delta Airlines 
A shareholder investing  500 in Delta s initial shares would have received 25 shares in total  Fast forward to today and those 25 shares would be worth  58 58 per share  worth  1 464 50  After removing the initial investment  a shareholder is sitting on a profit of  964 5  Including the  134 45 in dividends received  a shareholder s total profit would be  1 098 95    a 219 79  return on investment  Looking directly at share price appreciation  a shareholder would have gained a 9 37  compound annual growth rate  CAGR     beating the S P 500 s 6 61  CAGR during the same period  

Is Delta still growing 
Two high flying opportunities are on Delta s doorstep  consisting of a new partnership with a South American airline and the recent  4 billion investment in a terminal at LaGuardia Airport in New York 
Delta recently joined forces with LATAM Airlines in September    an airline based in Latin America serving North and South America  Subject to approval  Delta will invest  1 9 billion in common shares of LATAM and an additional  350 million to support the partnership  Announcing that the partnership will show benefits to earnings per share during the  next two years and that the transaction will not impact existing financial commitments to shareholders  should make shareholders optimistic  
This partnership will allow Delta to provide routes to South America that wouldn t have been possible without the LATAM partnership    allowing Delta to expand and develop a competitive position  Assuming the regulatory approval is smooth  Delta should see revenue performance in the next two years  Delta s management estimates an additional  1 billion annually from the partnership 
In addition  Delta has invested  3 4 billion in a terminal at New York s LaGuardia Airport  consisting of 37 gates  This investment provides several benefits for the airline  including reduced waiting times and the ability to serve a multitude of aircraft varieties  which gives the airline increased flexibility  The investment only accounts for 4  of available seat miles  ASMs   however  passengers flying out of LaGuardia provide significant revenue for Delta in both international and short haul flights  Lastly  the operational flexibility associated with owning a terminal will be a competitive advantage in the future 
Should shareholders buy  hold  or sell Delta Airlines 
The outlook from Delta s management is optimistic going forward  It was announced in an investor presentation that maintenance revenues are expected to double in 2024 from the 2019 revenue of  880 million  which is driven by new engine offerings  
In addition  a continued partnership with American Express  NYSE AXP  is expected to provide significant revenue growth in the coming years  Delta accounted for 8  of American Express global billings and 21  of cardmember loans in 2018  which shows the importance to both companies as Delta is expected to generate  4 4 billion from the partnership in 2020  Delta expects the revenue generated from the partnership to reach  7 billion by 2023 
Several factors for Delta Airlines provide a positive narrative to keep holding on to shares purchased during the IPO  As Delta retires the old MD 88s and MD 90s in 2020 and 2022  respectively  the company plans to become more efficient by expanding the fleet of efficient Airbus A220s and A321s  providing cost savings going forward  A forward dividend yield of 2 75  adds to the attractiveness of this airline in combination with strong fundamentals and high hopes for the future by management  making shares of Delta a buy headed into 2020 ",2019-12-27,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/p9cod,2048916

48955,270470,DAL,Italy appoints new administrator for struggling Alitalia,news,"MILAN  Reuters    Italy s industry ministry appointed on Friday a new temporary administrator for Alitalia  after his three predecessors ended their mandate without finding a solution for the struggling airline

Sources had told Reuters last month that Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli would ask the current administrators   Daniele Discepolo  Enrico Laghi and Stefano Paleari   to quit to make room for a single administrator with more powers 
A consortium of potential investors   comprising Italian railways group Ferrovie dello Stato  infrastructure group  Atlantia   MI ATL  and U S  carrier Delta  N DAL    decided not to present a binding offer for Alitalia last month after months of negotiations

48956,270471,DAL,Key Words  The CEO of the largest airline carrier has one simple reason why Wi Fi on planes isn t free,news,"Delta Air Lines Inc  s chief executive officer  Ed Bastian  said last year that he d like to offer Wi Fi free on his airline s flights  and reiterated that point at CES in Las Vegas on Tuesday  but has noted that offering the service would crash the system   Speaking during a conversation in the fall at the Economic Club of Washington  which aired on Bloomberg last year  the 62 year old Bastian told Carlyle Group private equity luminary David Rubenstein  who hosts an eponymous interview show on the news platform  that charging for internet access actually prevents too many people from using it    It s available on almost all of our planes   Bastian said of Wi Fi service  noting  though  that the carrier s smallest regional jets don t have internet access   I m a firm believer that we need to make Wi Fi free across all of our service  and we are working towards that   he said to applause   Bastian explained in greater detail why offering it free is a no go for now  Here s his take   He went on to say that Delta has tested free Wi Fi a number of times  but has found the heavy traffic difficult to manage  He joked that traveling at 30 000 feet in the air should be advantageous in terms of Wi Fi performance  since planes are technically closer to the satellite networks  but he noted that the big difference is that a plane is traveling at 500 miles an hour  which can degrade service  At popular digital conference CES on Tuesday  Bastian said he is aiming to bring free Wi Fi on its flights in the next few years   I m confident we will reach the goal within the next couple of years at speeds as fast as on the ground   he said   However  MarketWatch s Jon Swartz at CES in Las Vegas  writes that free Wi Fi may be a  quantum leap  for air carriers and notes that airlines have enough trouble providing consistent in flight internet at any price  Delta is the largest U S  carrier by dint of its  37 billion market value  In October  Delta reported quarterly earnings that beat forecasts  but costs have been climbing as the carrier absorbs increased staff overtime as well as the impacts of numerous storms  Bastian has said that he expects this cost inflation to continue into this year  Delta s shares

48957,270472,DAL,Key Words  The CEO of the largest airline offers one simple reason that Wi Fi on planes isn t free,news,"Delta Air Lines Inc  s chief executive officer  Ed Bastian  said last year that he d like to offer Wi Fi free on his airline s flights  and reiterated that point at CES in Las Vegas on Tuesday  but has noted that offering the service would crash the system   Speaking during a conversation in the fall at the Economic Club of Washington  which aired on Bloomberg last year  the 62 year old Bastian told Carlyle Group private equity luminary David Rubenstein  who hosts an eponymous interview show on the news platform  that charging for internet access actually prevents too many people from using it    It s available on almost all of our planes   Bastian said of Wi Fi service  noting  though  that the carrier s smallest regional jets don t have internet access   I m a firm believer that we need to make Wi Fi free across all of our service  and we are working towards that   he said to applause   Bastian explained in greater detail why offering it free is a no go for now  Here s his take   He went on to say that Delta has tested free Wi Fi a number of times  but has found the heavy traffic difficult to manage  He joked that traveling at 30 000 feet in the air should be advantageous in terms of Wi Fi performance  since planes are technically closer to the satellite networks  but he noted that the big difference is that a plane is traveling at 500 miles an hour  which can degrade service  At popular digital conference CES on Tuesday  Bastian said he is aiming to bring free Wi Fi on its flights in the next few years   I m confident we will reach the goal within the next couple of years at speeds as fast as on the ground   he said   However  MarketWatch s Jon Swartz at CES in Las Vegas  writes that free Wi Fi may be a  quantum leap  for air carriers and notes that airlines have enough trouble providing consistent in flight internet at any price  Delta is the largest U S  carrier by dint of its  37 billion market value  In October  Delta reported quarterly earnings that beat forecasts  but costs have been climbing as the carrier absorbs increased staff overtime as well as the impacts of numerous storms  Bastian has said that he expects this cost inflation to continue into this year  Delta s shares

48958,270473,DAL,Delta predicts 2020 profit growth  CEO says more people turning to air travel,news,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO  Reuters    Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  sees another annual rise in profit and revenue in 2020 driven by what Chief Executive Ed Bastian called a growing interest in air travel by consumers across the generational spectrum 
 People are more inspired to travel   Bastian told Reuters ahead of the carrier s investor day  citing the increased affordability of flying and advances in social media and technology  even as environmental and  flight shaming  activists threaten air travel growth in Europe 
Atlanta based Delta is forecasting 2020 profit of  6 75 to  7 75 per share  versus analysts  mean estimate of  7 06 according to IBES data from Refinitiv  on revenue growth of 4  to 6  and  4 billion of free cash flow 
Still  Bastian said Delta s investors and customers are also increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of air travel and cited airlines  ability to protect the environment as an existential threat to their growth 
For 2020  the chief risk to Delta s earnings forecast is any deterioration in U S  consumer health  he said 
On Wednesday  the International Air Transport Association  IATA  said overall airline profit is on course to fall faster than it initially expected in 2019 as trade wars hit global commerce and broader confidence  though it predicted a modest recovery next year 
Delta s 2020 revenue target already takes into account uncertainty on the timing of a return to service of the  Boeing Co   N BA  737 MAX  which has forced U S  competitors Southwest Airlines Co  N LUV    American Airlines Group  Inc  O AAL  and United Airlines Holdings Inc  O UAL  to cancel flights in a marginal benefit to Delta  which does not own the aircraft 
The 737 MAX was grounded after a fatal crash in Ethiopia in March  about five months after another fatal crash in Indonesia 
Delta also announced on Thursday a deal for its Delta Private Jets subsidiary to partner with Wheels Up  a private aviation company with 190 aircraft  to create one of the world s largest owned and managed fleets of private jets 
While private aviation has a larger environmental impact than commercial flying  Bastian said empty legs as jets are repositioned account for 40  to 50  of private flying  By making it more accessible and affordable  the jets can be better utilized 
 It s not something we ll ever market as sustainable but certainly as an improvement   Bastian said 
Delta will hold an equity stake in Wheels Up but did not disclose the size of the holding or any financial details 
As for the carrier s pursuit of a stake in Italy s struggling Alitalia  Bastian said he is still interested in investing but has not yet met with the airline s administrator appointed by the Italian government last week ",2019-12-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/delta-predicts-2020-profit-growth-ceo-says-more-people-turning-to-air-travel-2039755,2039755

48984,270499,DAL,JetBlue enters basic economy battle with new fare options,news,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO  Reuters    JetBlue Airways Corp  O JBLU  on Tuesday became the latest U S  airline to launch a low fare option in an effort to rival basic economy offerings from major airlines and meet competition from ultra low cost carriers 
The new fare  to be called  Blue Basic   will allow one carry on bag   space permitting   and free seat selection 24 hours before the flight  but those passengers will be the last to board the plane 
 There is a growing customer segment that really values low fares and that are willing to trade off certain benefits   JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty told Reuters 
The three biggest U S  carriers    American Airlines Group  Inc  O AAL   Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  and United Airlines Holdings Inc  O UAL    have all rolled out basic economy fares in reaction to the growth of no frills carriers  Spirit Airlines   N SAVE  and Frontier Airlines  even as they court higher paying passengers with new premium fare options 
 Basic economy has proven to be a revenue driver for airlines that have implemented it and should drive incremental revenue growth in 2020 despite expectations for industry unit revenue to decline   Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a recent note about JetBlue to investors 
For travelers willing to pay for early boarding  free advanced seating and flexibility with travel changes  JetBlue is launching a separate fare option called  Blue Extra  
New York based JetBlue  which boasts that it has the most leg room in coach  has said it expects its new fare options to add about  150 million to revenue in 2020 
The  Blue Basic  fare can first be found on routes like Ft  Lauderdale  Florida to Nassau  Bahamas or New York s JFK to Long Beach  California before being rolled out to most of JetBlue s other routes over the next month or two  a spokesman said ",2019-11-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jetblue-enters-basic-economy-battle-with-new-fare-options-2018676,2018676

American  the world s largest airline  has been struggling with dismal stock and revenue performance and strained labor relations  putting pressure on top management to turn things around 
Ironically  Kirby landed at United from American in 2016 after the board passed over him as a potential leader in what was described as succession planning for the longer term 
But given diverging performance at the two airlines since Kirby s departure   with United s shares doubling and American s losing about 25    industry insiders and analysts have questioned the leadership of American Chief Executive Doug Parker and heir apparent Robert Isom  and had speculated about Kirby s possible return 
 American is now without a future pilot   said Eric Schiffer  chairman of Reputation Management Consultants 
When American ousted Kirby  it mentioned the  marketability  of its executives and elevated Isom  then chief operating officer  to the role of president 
 When American picked Isom his strength was on the operational side  With the airline lagging not only in profitability but also in operations  you can understand why people question whether that succession plan still makes sense   aviation analyst Seth Kaplan said 
American said in an e mailed statement it has an ongoing succession planning process  which the company s board of directors discusses regularly 
A person familiar with the board s thinking said the succession plan with Isom remains in place 
Parker and Isom have blamed lengthy flight delays and cancellations this year on the Boeing  N BA  737 MAX grounding and an  illegal work slowdown  by mechanics  The mechanics union has denied the allegations and is in contract talks with the airline  which is aiming for a deal within months 
American s operational results improved for the third consecutive month in November  when the airline also set a record with seven days without flight cancellations  according to a Dec  4 letter to employees by David Seymour  senior vice president of operations 
 They are a more reliable airline this quarter than last  but there s a lag time in perception  and in a way they re in a vicious cycle  without the finances to think long term   Kaplan said 
Glen Hauenstein of Delta  N DAL  and Richard Anderson of Amtrak have surfaced as possible contenders at American  However  Hauenstein is believed to have signed a non compete agreement with a view to eventually replacing Delta s Ed Bastian as CEO  and some question whether Anderson wants to return to the airline industry after tenures as CEO of Delta and Northwest Airlines 
 American needs a great leader and there aren t many options  which is a concern for shareholders   Schiffer said 
At Southwest Airlines Co  N LUV   insider Tom Nealon is widely seen as the likely successor to CEO Gary Kelly 
Meanwhile  Kirby   who worked alongside American s Parker for two decades before his departure   will replace Oscar Munoz as CEO of United in May with a pledge to continue the airline s growth ",2019-12-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/as-united-airlines-seals-ceo-succession-plan-eyes-turn-to-american-2035499,2035499

49020,270535,DAL,New Pratt engine checks after Swiss A220 diverts to Paris,news,"PARIS VIENNA  Reuters    Pratt   Whitney  N UTX  recommended checks on engines on Airbus  PA AIR  A220 aircraft and some Embraer  SA EMBR3  jets after a Geneva bound Swiss jet diverted to Paris with an engine problem  prompting the grounding of the rest of the airline s A220 fleet 
French air accident investigators classified the problem that disrupted the Swiss flight shortly after departure from London Heathrow as a  serious incident  and said it would be investigated by the U S  National Transportation Safety Board 
Swiss  owned by Germany s Lufthansa  DE LHAG   said it had grounded its fleet of 29 Airbus A220 jets for a review of their engines 
 Only after a comprehensive inspection will the aircraft return to regular flight operations   it said in a statement  adding  numerous flights  would have to be canceled 
The diversion was the latest in a series of technical glitches involving new generation Geared Turbofan engines from Pratt   Whitney  part of United Technologies  N UTX  
A spokesman for the engine maker said it was recommending additional fleet wide checks for versions of the engine that power the Airbus A220   an engine known as the PW1500G   and the upgraded Embraer 190 195 E2 
A similar engine for the larger A320neo family  Airbus s most sold aircraft  was not affected 
 Pratt   Whitney and our airframe OEMs  manufacturers   working in coordination with the regulatory authorities  have recommended additional inspections of the low pressure compressor for PW1500G and PW1900G engines to keep the fleet operational   a spokesman said 
 The engines continue to meet all criteria for continued airworthiness  We are working closely with our customers to minimize disruption to their operations  
The spokesman did not say when the recommendation had been made or what deadline existed for the checks 
Delta Air Lines  N DAL  said its A220 jets were flying as normal 
Airbus said it was aware of Tuesday s incident involving the aircraft operated by Swiss and that it was working with Pratt   Whitney

49021,270536,DAL,Alitalia gets qualified thumbs up from Atlantia  state railways,news,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN  Reuters    Italian loss making airline Alitalia won a commitment from toll road operator  Atlantia   MI ATL  and state railways Ferrovie dello Stato  FS  on Tuesday to come to its rescue provided a number of conditions were met 
The green light will avert the threat of liquidation hanging over the ailing carrier as an Oct  15 deadline set by the industry ministry for a deal expires 
Two sources close to the matter said the Industry Ministry was expected to extend the deadline to give the sides time to iron out certain issues  It was not possible to obtain an immediate comment from the ministry 
Several hurdles still must be overcome before the third turnaround attempt in Alitalia s history can be launched 
The state driven plan involves setting up a new company to hold the good assets of Alitalia and receive a cash injection expected to be around 1 billion euros   1 1 billion  from the rescuers 
In two separate statements on Tuesday Atlantia  controlled by the Benetton family  and FS said they would proceed with binding offers for the airline as long as a leading carrier was also willing to invest in the flagship carrier 
Atlantia and FS have been in talks since July with Delta Air Lines  N DAL  but on Tuesday mentioned neither the U S  carrier nor German carrier Lufthansa  DE LHAG  which has recently said it could be interested 
The two Italian investors said they were each ready to take a minority stake in the new Alitalia but added more work was needed to find a deal on a business plan and a governance structure 
An investment by Atlantia in the airline could help mend fences with Rome following threats by the ruling coalition 5 Star Movement to revoke the group s motorway concessions after a bridge collapse last year that killed 43 people 
Atlantia runs half of Italy s 6 000 kilometers of toll roads through its ASPI unit which generates one third of core profit 
In their statements on Tuesday  Atlantia and FS asked for European Union clearance for financing provided to Alitalia by the state since 2017  which amounts to 900 million euros   992 8 million  so far 
Sources have said the airline might need more cash to survive until the rescue plan kicks in 
The two companies also asked for further help from the government for possible job cuts relating to the turnaround of Alitalia

49049,270564,DAL,Delta swings from market weakness to strength in Latin America,news,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO  Reuters    A surprise  1 9 billion investment by Delta Air Lines  N DAL  in LATAM Airlines Group  SN LTM  is likely to fire up competition in South America as the weakest U S  carrier in the region joins up with the strongest homegrown player 
Atlanta based Delta had long struggled to get a better foothold in the Latin American market  lagging United Airlines  O UAL  and American Airlines  O AAL   whose longtime partnership with LATAM gave it a comfortable lead 
With the Delta deal  that reigning power couple has split 
Dominance in Latin America   an air travel market expected to double in the next decade   has been fiercely disputed by the top three U S  carriers for good reason  Eight of every 10 passengers in Latin America traveling outside the region are bound for North America  according to industry group ALTA 
Following its breakup with Chile based LATAM last month  American Airlines quickly announced new flights next year from Miami to Chile and Peru   destinations where the two had been coordinating their routes with regulatory approval 
 This shows you that the  American LATAM  partnership ultimately ended up undermining supply   said Carlos Ozores  a principal at consulting company ICF   There was no competition because these were two carriers that coordinated their fares and worked as one  
American said it had  expanded routes and lowered prices  as a result of its coordination with LATAM in Chile and Peru 
The combined strength of LATAM and American ultimately doomed their partnership  as Chile s top court ruled in May that they could not expand their cooperation on travel to the United States 
By contrast  Delta s historic weakness in the region has become a distinct advantage  allowing it to leapfrog competitors without facing as much regulatory scrutiny 
 American and LATAM had a number of overlaps that created issues   Delta Chief Legal Officer Peter Carter told investors last month   And we just don t have that here  
LATAM declined to comment 
American said in a statement it  remains the largest U S  carrier to both Latin and South America and we look forward to competing and growing in this region of the world  
American also announced an additional daily flight from Miami to Sao Paulo starting in 2020  a market where it did not have the level of coordination as in Chile or Peru  This will create stiffer competition  especially in Miami  a hub for both LATAM and American and a top destination for Latin Americans 
 It s a very risky move because Delta is not very strong in Miami and American is very strong there   said Luis Felipe Oliveira  ALTA s executive director 
BEYOND BRAZIL
Delta has worked for much of the past decade to improve its standing in Latin America  investing in Brazil s Gol Linhas Aereas  SA GOLL4  in 2011 and Grupo  Aeromexico   MX AEROMEX  the next year  In 2016  it made an offer for Colombia s Avianca Holdings  CN AVT p   but was rebuffed in favor of United 
In recent years  Delta has grown frustrated with the Gol partnership  which did little for its South American push beyond Brazil  LATAM and Avianca have broader regional ambitions  investing in domestic airlines outside their home markets 
 So the natural thought is     that produces a return that s below your average return   Glen Hauenstein  Delta s president  told investors last month regarding the prior regional strategy 
Delta is in the process of selling its stake in Gol  and redoubling efforts in Colombia  Chile and Peru  which account for a combined 45  of South American travel to the United States  compared with just 29  percent from Brazil 
Air traffic in each of the three countries is expected to more than triple between 2020 and 2040  according to a forecast prepared by CAF  a Latin American development bank owned by countries in the region 
Colombia even rivals Brazil for U S  travel  Last year  3 million travelers flew between Brazil and North America  compared with 2 7 million who flew between Colombia and North America  according to worldwide industry group IATA  Colombia  which has a quarter of the population of Brazil  is also expected to grow its economy more quickly than its larger neighbor 
 The major market that we want to be in is Colombia   Delta s Hauenstein said 
LATAM is already making ambitious moves there  In May  it announced a  300 million investment in Colombia aimed at challenging market leader Avianca  which has allied with United and Copa Holdings  N CPA  in their own regional play 
Delta is hoping it is arriving in time to reap the benefits of LATAM s groundwork ",2019-10-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/delta-swings-from-market-weakness-to-strength-in-latin-america-1992942,1992942

49052,270567,DAL,GE s Gaping Pension Deficit Is Just a Tiny Part of Companies   269 Billion Gap,news," Bloomberg     General Electric s  NYSE GE  gaping pension deficit certainly stands out for its size  But the company is hardly the only one at risk of potentially shortchanging some of its employees come retirement 
All across corporate America  underfunded pensions have become the norm  Even now  a decade after the financial crisis  the largest plans face a shortfall of  269 billion  right about where it was 10 years ago  Years of low interest rates have largely offset gains in the stock market  Companies haven t helped matters by lavishing money on shareholder rewards and clinging to assumptions about returns that proved to be too rosy 
The situation isn t likely to improve any time soon  particularly if interest rates keep falling  Even though a banner year in both stocks and bonds lifted returns on the largest pensions by 12  this year  their liabilities have grown even faster  according to consulting firm Milliman  And while GE s move to freeze benefits and set aside money will help trim its  22 4 billion pension shortfall by as much as  8 billion  Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said last month that low rates could boost those same liabilities by roughly  7 billion 
In other words  unless companies take even more drastic steps  they re currently doing little better than treading water 
 Plan sponsors are getting concerned that we ve had a historic equity run in the market and they re still sitting on underfunded pension positions   said Steve Keating  managing director at BCG Pension Risk Consultants 
Part of it has to do with what s called the discount rate  which for corporate pensions typically corresponds to yields on highly rated corporate bonds 
Simply put  the lower the discount rate  the less a plan assumes it will earn over time  That means the plan needs to set aside more money today to cover retirement benefits a company has promised to pay its employees in the years and decades to come  In August  the discount rate fell to an average of 2 95   the lowest level in the 19 year history of Milliman s pension funding index 
Defined benefit plans  like your traditional corporate pensions  have largely disappeared from view in the past couple of decades as companies have embraced plans like 401 k s  Employers can opt to contribute to those plans  but it s the employees who are responsible for choosing the right investments and are solely on the hook if those investments fare poorly 
Nevertheless  there are plenty of older employees and retirees that are collectively still owed tens of billions of dollars in benefits that companies have failed to adequately fund 
GE s predicament underscores the scope of the problem  On Monday  the company said it would freeze pension benefits for more than 20 000 employees and set aside as much as  5 billion to cover future obligations   For those who didn t grow up with pensions   freezing  benefits essentially means whatever you ve accrued thus far is what you get from that plan  and no more  regardless of how many more years you work for that company   And for GE  that helps reduce the amount they ll ultimately need to pay out 
Yet at the end of 2018  GE owed benefits to at least 600 000 people worldwide  amounting to nearly  92 billion in future payouts  Globally  its pension plans had just  69 billion in assets 
To be fair  many companies probably didn t expect interest rates  which fell to rock bottom levels as a result of the Federal Reserve s crisis era monetary policies  to stay so low  Outside of brief periods during parts of 2013 and 2018  when bond yields looked like they were finally about to return to historical norms  they ve kept falling  That s had real world consequences for retirees who not only rely on a fixed income  but are also living longer as well 
 Even though the equity markets have done pretty well this year  it s been hard for them to make up ground  because of low rates  said Beth Ashmore  a managing director for retirement at Willis Towers Watson  NASDAQ WLTW  Plc  Despite the stock market run since the crisis   funding levels really haven t recovered as much as everybody would have hoped  
While many companies have plenty of money to plug or significantly reduce their pension deficits if they wanted to right now  others do not  GE has  32 billion in cash and equivalents  enough to wipe out its deficit  setting aside  of course  its many other debt obligations   On the other hand  Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   has  6 4 billion in unfunded liabilities and just  2 billion in cash 
Some have sought to transfer their pension liabilities to life insurers  The market for single premium buyouts reached  26 billion last year  according to data from industry group Limra  Earlier this year   Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   said that it struck deals with Prudential Financial Inc  NYSE PRU   and Athene Holding Ltd  to transfer billions in pension obligations 
Others like  United Parcel  Service Inc  NYSE UPS   have taken advantage of low borrowing costs to finance their pension contributions in the debt markets  Chipping away at a shortfall can help companies cut back on payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp   a government agency that helps backstop plans  The agency has been ratcheting up rates for companies that maintain pension deficits in recent years  in an effort to get them to plug those shortfalls 
 I think CFOs  in some ways  want to take control and start to thoughtfully reduce the size of their pension plan over time   BCG s Keating said 
Whatever the case  it s often the employees who end up losing out  Freezing pensions has become a more popular strategy for companies in recent years  A decade ago  about 20  of Fortune 500 companies with pension plans in place since 1998 had frozen their plans  according to Willis Towers Watson  Since then  that figure has swelled to 42  
 In a situation of  corporate battlefield surgery   this tends to be a typical  if unfortunate  casualty   said Julian Mitchell  an analyst at  Barclays   LON BARC  Plc ",2019-10-09,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ges-gaping-pension-deficitis-just-a-tiny-part-of-companies-269-billion-gap-1993802,1993802

1  US China Trade Talks to Resume
The U S  and China are set to resume trade talks Thursday against the backdrop of rising optimism that discussions could pave the way to at least a little progress on trade 
China does not expect this week s talks to lead to a meaningful agreement  but it is open to the idea of a  partial deal   Bloomberg reported  citing sources 
Beijing reportedly could give into some non core concessions such as more purchases of agriculture goods like soybeans  But it is not willing to budge on key points that have dogged trade talks for months such as subsidies for Chinese companies or the  forced technology transfers  that require U S  companies   seeking entry into China   to partner with a local company 
The talks come as trade tensions flared earlier this week when the U S  blacklisted 28 Chinese organisations and accused them of human rights violations against ethnic Uighurs in China s Xinjiang province 
The ban was likely a tactic to ramp up pressure on China ahead of the talks  though it unlikely  negates the possibility of a partial agreement from the two countries   Nomura said in a note to clients 
 2  Retail Inflation  Jobless Claims Due

1  Trade talks resume
Top level trade negotiations between China and the U S  are due to resume in Washington after a two month hiatus 
 With both sides having ramped up the pressure earlier this week with measures against the NBA on the one side and Chinese makers of surveillance equipment on the other  the chance of a comprehensive rapprochement is close to zero  meaning that the next two days will principally be an exercise in damage limitation 
Background briefings from both sides have created a confusing backdrop  with Bloomberg talking up the chance of an interim deal that could lead to a scheduled increase in U S  tariffs being pushed back again  However  the South China Morning Post and Fox have both played down the chance of agreement  citing officials as saying that the talks may be broken off after one day 
2  Turkey ground troops enter Syria
Turkey sent its ground troops into northern Syria to establish a 20 mile buffer zone along its southern border  from which it hopes to drive out Kurdish militia who were instrumental in defeating ISIS and who now hold a large number of ISIS fighters in prison 
It then intends to resettle some of the Syrian refugees currently in Turkey in the safe zone  Turkey has accepted over 3 5 million refugees from Syria since the start of the latter s civil war 
Turkish airstrikes which began on Thursday are reported to have inflicted numerous civilian casualties  Kurdish forces have responded by shelling points in Turkey  The Turkish lira fell to a four month low against the dollar

According to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  investors see an 86  chance of the Fed cutting rates by another 25 basis points at its Oct  30 meeting 
In a speech late on Wednesday  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell highlighted the risks to the global economy from the current uncertainties over U S  China trade and Brexit

49080,270595,DAL,Delta buys  1 9 billion LATAM stake  snatching partner away from American Airlines,news,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO  Reuters    Delta Air Lines  N DAL  said on Thursday it would buy a 20  stake in LATAM Airlines Group  SN LTM  for  1 9 billion  creating a major new airline partnership and ending the Chilean carrier s ties with American Airlines 
The surprise deal with Latin America s largest carrier will give Delta a much bigger footprint in the region  a key growth market in which LATAM flies to dozens of destinations including cities in Argentina  Peru and Brazil 
The LATAM deal is Delta s largest since it merged with Northwest Airlines a decade ago 
 American Airlines Group  Inc  O AAL   which has long been the leading U S  carrier in the region and was pursuing a deeper route alliance with LATAM  said the loss of its Chilean partner would not have a significant impact on its financial results 
American added that its LATAM partnership had limited upside after the Chilean Supreme Court struck down the two carriers  plans for further route cooperation that would have also involved oneworld alliance members British Airways and Iberia 
 This is a body blow for American  but not a lethal body blow  It means that Delta will have more access to Latin America than it did before  but American already has much of that in its back pocket   independent aviation analyst Mike Boyd said 
Following its tie up with Delta  LATAM will exit oneworld and pursue route options with Delta and its partner Grupo  Aeromexico   MX AEROMEX   which belong to the rival SkyTeam alliance  It has not  however  decided whether to officially join SkyTeam 
Oneworld said LATAM had advised it would leave the alliance in  due course  in line with contractual requirements  without naming a specific date 
Airlines increasingly have bilateral codeshare arrangements outside major alliances  Qantas Airways Ltd  AX QAN   a oneworld member  said it would retain its codeshare partnership with LATAM despite the Chilean carrier s departure from the alliance 
DELTA PARTNERSHIP
As a result of the deal  Delta will sell its stake in Brazil s largest airline Gol  SA GOLL4   a LATAM rival 
Delta does not expect regulatory obstacles for its tie up with LATAM  where it will gain representation on the board of directors  The plan envisions growth for both carriers  which currently overlap on only one route  Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters 
 I think it s a great fit   he said 
Atlanta based Delta expects the LATAM deal to be accretive to earnings per share over the next two years and add  1 billion in revenue growth over five years  Bastian said 
Delta is using newly issued debt and available cash for the deal  It will also provide LATAM with an additional  350 million to help it transition out of oneworld and plug into Delta s network 
The two can start code sharing before they receive government  regulatory and anti trust approval for the larger tie up  a process Bastian said he expects to take between 12 and 24 months 
Delta will also acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and assume LATAM s commitment to purchase another 10 A350s to be delivered between 2020 and 2025 for an undisclosed sum 
Apart from its stake in Grupo Aeromexico  Delta also has holdings in Air France KLM  PA AIRF   China Eastern  SS 600115   Virgin Atlantic and Korean Air Lines Co s  KS 003490  parent company 
It has also been negotiating a 10  stake in Alitalia  CAITLA UL  as part of its strategy to boost its international presence through equity investments  That plan has not changed with the LATAM deal  which Delta started studying about three months ago after an approach by a third party  Bastian said

Airbus is at the center of the feud  with the World Trade Organization poised to authorize the U S  to impose tariffs on almost  8 billion of European goods due to illegal state aid provided to the planemaker  The U S  duties  which could hit as soon as October  will target jetliners and aircraft parts as well as luxury products such as wine and leather goods  according to the U S  Trade Representative s office 
An Airbus factory in Mobile  Alabama  depends on imported components to build the company s top selling A320 family jets  which are also made in Europe and China  Airbus plans to expand the U S  site to build the smaller A220 as orders increase from customers such as Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   and JetBlue Airways Corp 
Airlines for America  a trade group representing U S  carriers  said tariffs on jetliners and aircraft parts would hurt the aviation industry and the broader economy 
Faury echoed that view  saying the imposition of tariffs  will increase prices  it will have an impact on the cost of travel    Airbus s planes typically source about 40  of their parts from the U S   he said 
In a separate WTO case  the EU claimed that Boeing  NYSE BA  benefited from illegal subsidies  including from the state of Washington  That case is likely to conclude next year 
Faury said Airbus would continued to push for a negotiated settlement between the U S  and the EU

49083,270598,DAL,Airbus s Expansion in Alabama Could Ease Trump Tariff Burden,news," Bloomberg     Airbus SE s  PA AIR  plans to lift jet output at a factory in Alabama could help curb its exposure to U S  tariffs set to be imposed on planes imported from Europe 
Build rates at the Mobile plant currently stand at five A320 series narrow body aircraft a month  up from four last year  and Airbus is committed to a further increase in production  according to the Toulouse  France based company 
While the U S  factory has a theoretical capacity of eight A320s a month  Airbus hasn t indicated when that rate might be reached  a spokesman said Thursday 
Airbus was spared the full impact of the tariffs in a move by the U S  that may be aimed at protecting local jobs  The list of goods slated for duties includes  new airplanes  from the four European countries deemed by the World Trade Organization to have provided it with illegal launch aid 
That means components and large structures like wings can be shipped from Europe for assembly in Mobile without incurring levies  though the degree to which the exemption will provide a workaround depends on how much of Airbus s U S  backlog can be satisfied from the Alabama plant 
Expansion there won t help Airbus avoid duties on wide body aircraft  which it only makes in Europe  Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   and United Airlines Holdings Inc  have about 90 such A330 and A350 planes on order between them  according to Airbus s order and delivery figures for August 
Airbus currently produces about 60 A320 series narrow body jets a month worldwide  and aims to lift that rate to 63 by 2021 
The company has seven other final assembly lines for A320s in addition to Mobile  four in Hamburg  Germany  two at its headquarters in Toulouse  France  and one in Tianjin in China  A further unit may be added  most likely replacing the A380 superjumbo line in Toulouse that s earmarked for closure  Mobile has also begun assembling A220 jets  with the first deliveries due next year 
While terms of the U S  tariffs would appear to open the door for Airbus to supply U S  customers from its China site without incurring the new penalty  doing so could risk worsening existing confrontations over trade ",2019-10-03,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbuss-expansion-in-alabama-could-ease-trump-tariff-burden-1991384,1991384

The expanded joint venture would replace two previously approved arrangements in the U S  United Kingdom and U S  Continental Europe markets and will allow for additional benefits like more options on European flights  the person said

EU antitrust regulators in February cleared Air France KLM  Delta and Virgin Group to acquire joint control over Virgin Atlantic  saying they did not see any competition concerns

49108,270623,DAL,Exclusive  Brazil facilitates deportation of its nationals after U S  pressure,news,"By Lisandra Paraguassu
BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazil is making it easier for the United States to deport undocumented Brazilians by asking U S  airlines to board deportees even when they have no valid passports  following pressure from the Trump administration  three Brazilian government sources said 
The Federal Police sent airlines a memo in June allowing them to board Brazilian deportees with just a certificate of nationality issued by a consulate if they lack a valid passport  previously needed to travel to Brazil  the sources said 
The move by right wing President Jair Bolsonaro s government aims to facilitate repatriation of deportees by U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  NYSE ICE   and efforts by the Trump administration to speed the removal of undocumented immigrants 
The officials  who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter  said Brazil has come under increasing pressure from the Trump administration to facilitate deportations of its detained nationals  to the point of risking sanctions 
They did not detail what kind of sanctions 
 When Donald Trump became U S  president  illegal immigration became a central political issue  Pressure increased a lot and Brazil was even threatened with sanctions   one of the sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters 
Brazil was labeled as  at risk of non compliance  with the repatriation of deportees in a U S  Department of Homeland Security report in March on the barriers ICE faces to timely removal of detained immigrants 
Trump has been cracking down on recalcitrant countries that do not accept immigrants ordered deported  under an executive order issued immediately after he took office 
The deportation of undocumented Brazilians has risen from 1 413 in fiscal year 2017 to 1 691 in fiscal 2018  with Brazilians the sixth largest group of nationals being removed from the United States  according to ICE data 
This fiscal year there have been 1 117 removals of Brazilians through June 10  ICE said  The U S  fiscal year runs from Oct  1 through Sept  30 
Brazil s Foreign Ministry confirmed that certificates of nationality are issued by its consulates in the United States when detained deportees have exhausted their appeals process and have no passport  Brazilian passports are issued only to nationals who apply for them 
Many countries have arrangements with the U S  government and foreign countries that allow for a document   other than a passport   issued by an embassy or consulate to serve as an authorization to travel 
Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  and American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  did not respond to requests for comment 
As of December  there were 334 Brazilians in ICE detention awaiting trial or deportation  the ministry said 
Since he took office in January  Bolsonaro has established close ties with Trump and the two are looking to negotiate a trade agreement 
Bolsonaro has made disparaging statements about immigrants  In March  speaking on Fox News during a visit to Washington  he praised Trump s plan for a wall on the Mexican border  adding that  most immigrants do not have good intentions  
His son Eduardo Bolsonaro  whom he has nominated to be Brazil s ambassador in Washington  told reporters during that visit that illegal Brazilian immigrants were  a problem for Brazil  an embarrassment to us  ",2019-08-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive-brazil-facilitates-deportation-of-its-nationals-after-us-pressure-1963537,1963537

Venezuela has suffered a severe economic and political crisis over the past several years  including wide spread shortages of basic goods and soaring inflation  which has also caused debts owed to the airlines to pile up 
Due in large part to strict currency controls in place since 2003  the government of President Nicolas Maduro has for years failed to reimburse the airlines in hard currency for ticket sales in local currency 
 Right now  recovering this money is a lost cause   said Peter Cerda  IATA s regional vice president for the Americas  on the sidelines of the Aviation Day industry forum held in Panama City 
 We hope that in the future  when there s a change of administration  it allows us to have a dialogue about recovering that money   he added 
Cerda added that IATA  which represents some 240 airline companies  has not had any talks with Maduro s government in two years 
As Venezuela s economy has continued to shrink  airlines like Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL   Deutsche Lufthansa AG  DE LHAG  and LATAM Airlines Group SA  SN LTM  have cut their service to the South American country  Other carriers like  Air Canada   TO AC  and  American Airlines Group  Inc  O AAL  stopped their flights in and out of Venezuela citing security concerns

WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS  issued rules on Sunday to implement new restrictions on Americans who have recently visited China to address the threat of the coronavirus 
Airline officials said Sunday the new rules will mean they must now ask all U S  bound passengers if they have visited mainland China  Airlines are expected to scrutinize passports of travelers  and warned the new rules could require passengers to arrive even earlier for U S  bound flights 
American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  Inc said Sunday it encouraged U S  bound passengers  to arrive at the airport three hours early as we expect this additional screening will lengthen the normal check in process  
The United States said Friday that for flights departing after 5 p m  EST Sunday  it will bar entry to nearly all foreign visitors who have been in China within the last two weeks 
The Trump administration is limiting flights from China and for Americans who have visited China within the last 14 days to eight major U S  airports for enhanced screening  New York s JFK  Chicago s O Hare  San Francisco  Seattle Tacoma  Honolulu  Los Angeles  Atlanta and Dulles in Washington  DC 
Three more airports   Newark  Dallas Fort Worth and Detroit   would be added on Monday  DHS announced on Sunday 
The new rules do not impact cargo only flights  DHS said 
American Airlines temporarily halted all flights to mainland China on Friday  while Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  said Sunday its last flight had departed China before it planned resumption of flights in May  United Airlines is scheduled to continue China flights through Wednesday before halting flights through March 27 
Many other nations are imposing similar restrictions 
Airlines must ensure foreign visitors arriving in the United States have not visited China within the last two weeks and Americans who traveled within the last 14 days to China are flying to one of the seven designated airports 
Airlines said they are working to ease the burden on gate agents by also including questions about China travel online and at check in lobbies  and adding new signs 
A spokeswoman for a group representing U S  airlines said Sunday  carriers will continue to comply with all government rules and regulations  
DHS warned that  travelers without a nexus to China  may also be routed through one of the screening airports if it is discovered mid flight that someone else on their flight has been in China in the last 14 days 
Americans who have been in Hubei  China province within 14 days of their return will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine  U S  citizens who have been in other areas of mainland China within the last 14 days  will undergo proactive entry health screening and up to 14 days of self quarantine   DHS said

195356,416872,DAL,Qatar Airways in talks to buy 49  RwandAir stake  interested in increasing LATAM investment,news,"By Alexander Cornwell
DOHA  Reuters    Qatar Airways is in talks to buy a 49  stake in Africa s RwandAir  and is interested in doubling its holding in LATAM Airlines Group  SN LTM  to 20   its chief executive said on Wednesday 
A stake in an African airline would widen its reach in one of the world s fastest growing aviation regions  and potentially help it bypass restrictions imposed on it by some Arab states 
 We are very tough negotiators     we will take our time to negotiate   Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al Baker told reporters in Doha 
Qatar Airways already owns stakes in British Airways parent International Airlines Group  L ICAG   China Southern  SS 600029   Cathay Pacific  HK 0293   and LATAM 
It bought some of its stakes in other airlines since once lucrative markets the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia banned it from its airspace following a regional political dispute 
Qatar Airways has been forced to fly longer routes to avoid the blocked airspace of some of its neighbors 
The ban does not apply to non Qatari airlines flying to Qatar  RwandAir could potentially carry passengers from Africa over the blocked airspace to the state owned airline s Doha hub without any airspace restrictions 
RwandAir could not be immediately reached for comment 
Qatar Airways agreed in December to take a 60  stake in a new airport in Rwanda 
Baker  one of aviation s most well know executives  also said the airline could be interested in increasing its holding in LATAM  and working with fellow shareholder Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  
 When the right opportunity comes and at the right price we will look at increasing our investment in LATAM   he told Reuters 
Qatar Airways  which holds a 10  stake  would be interested in having a stake that is the  same like Delta   which is 20   he said 
Delta surprised the industry when it announced in September it was taking a  1 9 billion 20  stake in the South American airline group 
Qatar Airways has historically had a contentious relationship with Delta and other major U S  carriers  which have accused Gulf airlines of receiving unfair government subsidies  distorting competition and costing Americans jobs  The Gulf carriers have rejected such accusations 
However  Baker said had no ill feeling towards Delta  and was willing to work with the U S  airline at its hub in Atlanta

SHANGHAI BEIJING  Reuters    The United States angered China on Friday with a warning to Americans not to travel there because of a coronavirus epidemic that has rattled the global economy with increasing disruption to business supply lines 
Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan  the flu like virus first identified earlier this month has resulted in 213 deaths in China  Wuhan and the surrounding region are in virtual quarantine 
More than 9 800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions  with Russia  Britain  Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday 
 Do not travel to China due to the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan   the U S  State Department said  raising the warning for China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq 
Beijing  which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington  responded sharply  It noted the World Health Organization  WHO  has commended Chinese containment efforts and not recommended travel or trade curbs 
 The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions  but very soon after that  the United States did the opposite   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said   It s truly mean  
Many other countries have also advised citizens to put off non urgent travel to China  After reporting its first two cases of the illness  Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China  its biggest trade partner 
Panama s canal authority said vessels that had passed through countries where coronavirus had been confirmed had to report that to authorities 
Singapore  a major travel hub in Asia  stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders

In the latest impact to big name corporations  South Korea s  Hyundai Motor   KS 005380  said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak  Sangyong Motor  KS 003620  said it would idle its plant in the South Korean city of Pyeongtaek from Feb  4 12 for the same reason 
Home appliance maker Electrolux  ST ELUXb  issued a similar warning 
French carmaker PSA  Peugeot  Citroen  PA PEUP  said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid February 
After holding off as the crisis grew  the WHO said on Thursday that the epidemic did constitute a public health emergency of international concern  a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination 
However  WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organisation had confidence in China s capacity to control the 2019 nCoV virus 
 We would ve seen many more  2019nCoV cases outside China by now  and probably deaths  if it were not for the government s efforts and the progress they ve made to protect their own people and the world   he tweeted 
 Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies  We urge countries and companies to make evidence based  consistent decisions

VIRUS EPICENTRE
The roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province  where Wuhan is the capital  have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease  But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river  a Reuters witness said  and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan 
Wuhan s Communist Party chief said the city should have acted earlier to contain the virus 
China s statistics show just over 2  of infected people have died  suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002 2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  SARS  
But economists say its financial impact could be bigger than SARS  which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of  33 billion to the global economy  since China s share of the world economy is now far greater 
The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human to human transmission   as opposed to people coming infected from China   in four countries  the United States  Germany  Japan and Vietnam  Thailand said it too had such a case 
Rising public alarm over the epidemic has brought a wave of anti China sentiment abroad and led airlines to cancel or reduce flights  with airline crews pressuring carriers to act 
U S  carriers Delta Air Lines  N DAL  and American Airlines  O AAL  became the latest major airlines to suspend flights after the U S  travel advisory

195382,416898,DAL,Beyond Meat Shooting Beyond Expectations,opinion,"While recent news coming out of Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND   is mixed  it s weighted toward the positive side That s why investors weren t completely put out with the unsuccessful trial at Restaurant Brand International s Tim Hortons outlets in Canada  The Beyond Burger apparently wasn t quite what their customers wanted  So  following a scale down in September to two provinces  Ontario and British Columbia  the chain parted ways 
It was always meant to be a limited period item to help management separate the demand from the hype  But it was a big disappointment for Beyond Meat investors  because the company was expecting to get into 4 000 of its 4 800 locations in the U S  and Canada  However  both parties said they might collaborate again later This bit of bad news came at around the same time as some good news  It was reported that the family Diner Denny s had concluded a very successful trial in its Los Angeles restaurants  after which the company decided to bring the Beyond Burger  called  Denny s Beyond Burger  to all its 1 700 locations across the U S  and Canada 
The company is touting the same advantages over beef to those wanting to go  flexitarian   more protein  less saturated fat  no cholesterol  and as far as vegetarian sourcing goes  no soy  no gluten  no GMO  What s more  participating restaurants were offering guests a free Beyond Burger with the purchase of any beverage between 11 00 a m  and 10 00 p m as part of a single day promotion campaign And that isn t all  Perhaps the most important news is that KFC  also thrilled with the reception the company s Beyond Fried Chicken received at its first trial location in Atlanta  has decided to expand the test to 63 more locations in and around Nashville  Tennessee and Charlotte  North Carolina  The broader test is designed to help it determine the uptake at its other locations across the U S 
The companies have particularly focused on taste and texture with the vegan fried chicken offering  as taste is what gives KFC its popularity and texture is very important in a chicken offering because of the way that meat falls apart when bitten into  KFC can take Beyond Meat international  as the company has 23 000 stores in 140  countries and is the number one fast food chain in China  Denny s is already a done deal and KFC looks like it s getting ready for a big launch  So the question then is  will the company be able to serve up this big order  Turns out  it anticipated a surge in demand in 2020 and so  in November  tripled its pea protein supplies for the year 
Last month  it extended its agreement with French pea protein supplier Roquette for an additional period of three years  Now  Roquette is also scaling up its capabilities  It s investing more than half a billion euros over five years to expand its existing facility in France and open a new one in Manitoba  Canada 
It s also making acquisitions to boost its textured protein capabilities  Pea protein is the primary source ingredient  so it makes sense to corner supply  The fact that it seems to have succeeded in this  says a lot about its growth prospects this year Beyond Meat s valuation makes it impossible to recommend buying the stock  The shares have all the good news priced in and then some  Investor optimism seems ludicrous at this point  Okay  the company seems to be doing everything right  it s winning deals and all  but everyone seems to be discounting the upcoming competition from traditional meat producers  other vegan meat producers and lab meat producers that will very soon flood the market with alternatives 
So even if the product is better than the competition  the fact that there ll be more competition will have an effect on prices  and therefore  its profitability  Prices have to come down or growth has to catch up  or a little bit of both  So if you ve already put in money  hold tight  because this ship is unlikely to move much lower  But if you haven t  the risk to picking up shares is significant Stocks worth buying instead are  Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    Encana Corp    NYSE OVV    Owens   Minor   NYSE OMI   or Advantest   OTC ATEYY    since all of them have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Free  Zacks  Single Best Stock Set to DoubleToday you are invited to download our latest Special Report that reveals 5 stocks with the most potential to gain  100  or more in 2020  From those 5  Zacks Director of Research  Sheraz Mian hand picks one to have the most explosive upside of all This pioneering tech ticker had soared to all time highs and then subsided to a price that is irresistible  Now a pending acquisition could super charge the company s drive past competitors in the development of true Artificial Intelligence  The earlier you get in to this stock  the greater your potential gain ",2020-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beyond-meat-shooting-beyond-expectations-200504150,200504150

195386,416902,DAL,DAL Vs  RYAAY  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Transportation   Airline sector might want to consider either Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  or Ryanair  RYAAY   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both Delta Air Lines and Ryanair have a Zacks Rank of   1  Strong Buy  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
DAL currently has a forward P E ratio of 7 93  while RYAAY has a forward P E of 17 92  We also note that DAL has a PEG ratio of 0 57  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  RYAAY currently has a PEG ratio of 1 12 
Another notable valuation metric for DAL is its P B ratio of 2 43  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  RYAAY has a P B of 2 97 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DAL s Value grade of A and RYAAY s Value grade of D 
Both DAL and RYAAY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that DAL is the superior value option right now ",2020-02-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dal-vs-ryaay-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200506177,200506177

195392,416908,DAL,Coronavirus  Weaker PPI Hitting AUD USD,opinion,"Fears of an increase in the contagion of the coronavirus have been causing a selloff in the Australian dollar across the board    As we discussed during the U S  China trade war  the Australian economy is directly tied to China s economy   China is a large importer of Australian goods and services   Therefore  if China s economy is to slow down because of the Coronavirus  the Australian economy may slow down as well   There have already been talks of the virus knocking off up to 2  from China s Q1 GDP   Businesses are temporarily shutting down   Airlines are halting flights to China for as long as 3 months  NYSE Delta Air Lines  just announced    All of this is causing a slowdown in China and  therefore  a potential slowdown in Australia 
In addition  the latest inflation data is not helping   Earlier  Australia released its PPI for Q4   The actual print was 0 3  vs  0 5  expected and 0 4  previous   Add bad economic data into the mix and it s a recipe for AUD USD to trade lower into the weekend 
Last week  we discussed how AUD USD was at an inflection point ahead of employment data   The headline data was better than expected and it gave the pair a temporary bounce    As we noted last week  AUD USD was at a confluence of support and resistance areas  including trendline  necklines  moving averages and Fibonacci Retracement levels  However  as news of the Coronavirus began to spread  price broke lower and quickly hit the target of the head and shoulders pattern near  6720

Price is currently closing in on recent lows from late summer near  6670  which are levels that haven t been seen since 2009   If price breaks  6670  we must look for Fibonacci extensions for next possible support levels   6582 is the 127 2  extension from the October 2 low to the December 31 high   The next Fibonacci extension level is the 161 8  extension at  6460   Horizonal resistance above at  6750  and then the downward sloping trendline from back in June 2018 near  6800   The previous support zone  which now acts as resistance  from before the employment data begins at  6825

195409,416925,DAL,SkyWest  SKYW  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Shares of SkyWest  SKYW  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 0 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  66 05 in the previous session  SkyWest has gained 1 7  since the start of the year compared to the 3 1  move for the Zacks Transportation sector and the 2  return for the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 30  2019  SkyWest reported EPS of  1 79 versus consensus estimate of  1 73 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 74  
For the current fiscal year  SkyWest is expected to post earnings of  6 67 per share on  2 97 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 12 per share on  3 09 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 03  and 4 01   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
SkyWest may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
SkyWest has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 9 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 5 6X versus its peer group s average of 5 6X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  SkyWest currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if SkyWest meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though SkyWest shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does SkyWest Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of SkyWest have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Air France KLM SA  AFLYY   Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes  GOL   and Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for SkyWest  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/skywest-skyw-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200499623,200499623

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Delta shares have added about 1 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 8  
What s Next for Delta 
While Delta has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Delta was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 99 on  10 93 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 18 on  48 91 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

195416,416932,DAL,Delta  DAL  Upgraded To Strong Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Delta is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Delta  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Delta
For the fiscal year ending December  2020  this airline is expected to earn  7 18 per share  which is a change of  1 8  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Delta  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The fading of the Middle East geopolitical appears to have run its course   Oil prices are steadying for a second consecutive trading session as traders await the next saga between the U S  and Iran   Iran saw a second consecutive night of massive protests after Iran s government admitted to the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane  
President Trump also added fuel to the anti government protests after tweeting a warning over to Iranian leaders not to harm their protesters   Trump is keeping the pressure on Iran and it seems almost inevitable that Iranian leaders will deliver another attack to a U S  ally  

Oil prices also received some support from various oil leaders at an oil summit in Dhahran  Saudi Arabia    Saudi Aramco   SE 2222  CEO Amin Nasser s delivered his first comments since the Aramco IPO   Nasser attempted to calm market concerns of the vulnerability of Aramco s defenses at their facilities   He reiterated that there is enough supply in market to ease concerns   Baker Hughes CEO also provided a more optimistic target for oil prices with a range of  65 to  75 a barrel  
Oil prices remain vulnerable as long as West Texas Intermediate crude remains below the  60 a barrel level   Risks remain plentiful in the Middle East and as US shale growth slows in 2020  prices should be supported and not just slide back down towards the low  50s region 
Safe havens are under pressure as Iranian tensions wind down and as further trade optimism brews from the US and China   The phase one trade deal are not expected to be released until after the signing  but leaks are suggesting the enforcement terms are written in favor for the Chinese   While the rhetoric from both sides appears very constructive  most experts anticipate no major trade deals until after the US Presidential election in November 

Gold prices could reassert its longer term bullish trend if last week s low is not breached   Buyers are attempting to defend the  1 540 level  so we should see limited downside in the first half of the week  If earnings season kicks off much better than expected  we could see the yellow metal target  1 510   
As markets await the finalization of the phase one trade deal  the Chinese yuan has firmed up as trade tensions have eased   Trade optimism amongst the two world s largest economies has kickstarted a yuan strengthening trend that could continue as China s economy shows signs of coming back to life   While the yuan could see further appreciation here  the currency could ultimately see the PBOC s counter cyclical factor limit a significant breakout here   The yuan could eventually see its rally stall around the 6 80 level  
Bitcoin
Bitcoin s bearish trend appears to have been snapped as crypto trading volumes surged last week   Interest with digital coins have returned as geopolitical risks remain in place as the temporary easing of tensions in the Middle East likely appear to be short lived   Bitcoin and other altcoins are showing renewed interest as investors are seeing a firm bottom put in place  the  6 300 region which is where mining costs are reportedly averaging   Bitcoin still has a large amount of bearish catalysts  but in the short term   6 000 to  10 000 could be the key range until the halving event in early May ",2020-01-13,Ed Moya,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-open--stocks-rise-ahead-of-busy-week-oil-steadies-gold-slides-yuan-rallies-200498216,200498216

195438,416954,DAL,Delta Air Lines  DAL  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 14  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 9  
Revenues are expected to be  11 34 billion  up 5 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 83  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Delta 
For Delta  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 22  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Delta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Delta would post earnings of  2 27 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 32  delivering a surprise of  2 20  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

195447,416963,DAL,Can Value Investors Consider Delta Air Lines  DAL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Delta Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 18  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 61  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Delta Airlines  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 10 16 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares favorably with the Transportation Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 67  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile Delta Airlines has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 7 86  which is lower than the current level  So  so it is fair to say that a more value oriented path is ahead of the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Delta Airlines has a P S ratio of 1 65  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 39x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Delta Airlines currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Delta Airlines a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Delta Airlines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of D  This gives DAL a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  While the current quarter estimate has seen no upward and two downward movements  the current year estimate has seen one upward and four downward movements over the past two months This has had a negative effect on the consensus estimate  While the current year consensus has dropped 2 8  over the past two months  the next year estimate has inched down 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Delta Air Lines  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite such bearish analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDelta Airlines is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 24  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank  past industry performance and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in

195469,416985,DAL,First Class Or Coach  The State Of Delta Before Its Earnings Call,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  has been flying high and beating estimates the last few quarters  and the airline is on the runway to profitability once again  
According to Zacks Investment Research  based on analysts  forecasts  the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is  2 27  The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was  1 8  This implies a rise of 23 8  YoY 
But when it comes to the alternative data  which can give us more insight into how competitors are doing across metrics besides revenue and stock trends  other airlines might have slight edges over Delta in many regards 
The only place we could find Delta as a clear number one is for number of flights that come in on time  Delta is first in on time arrivals for its flights    
But among every other conceivable list and metric  Delta is not number one  That doesn t mean Delta isn t great at what it does  or doesn t see record profits  but it can t quite seem to get to number one 
Delta is second to American in total revenue  miles flown  fleet size  brand value  and passangers carried  second in profits to Southwest  third in number of routes  and fifth in destinations served 




In late 2017  Delta dropped to third in total number of employees by LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  count  So while all airlines are doing better than ever  and employing more people  Delta is now working with less than United and American  But it s lkely that Delta isn t bothered by any of this  Hiring is up  its stock is up  and this could all just be bad optics by forced comparison 




When we look at social media data  Southwest and Jetblue soar past Delta in total number of likes  follows   Talking About  counts   Were Here  counts  check ins  and more  The marketing for Southwest and Jetblue is relentless  and noticable  and it appears this is an area Delta can improve on if they want to really go for number one on all the lists mentioned above 




Delta is at 1 5 million followers  which is respectable  but only 4th best out of the top 6 U S  based airlines 
But it really doesn t seem like that is bothering Delta  which is just cruising along on good news ahead of its earnings call tomorrow  Delta seems like a company that marches to the beat of its own drum  which is commendable  considering Thinknum Alternative Data also prides itself in doing the same

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 20   A quarter ago  it was expected that this airline would post earnings of  2 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 35  delivering a surprise of 2 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Delta  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry  posted revenues of  12 56 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 38   This compares to year ago revenues of  11 95 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Delta shares have added about 8 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 5  
What s Next for Delta 
While Delta has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Delta was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

195487,417003,DAL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  SkyWest  American Airlines  Southwest Airlines And Delta Air Lines,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 30  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  SkyWest Inc    NASDAQ SKYW    American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL    Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   and Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  4 Airline Stocks to Gain on Trade Optimism   Low Fuel CostThe aviation sector has been bogged down by the ebb and flow of the prolonged U S  China trade tensions  The Sep 14 drone attacks on Saudi Arabia s oil facilities was also quite a blow as it sparked fears of a bump up in fuel costs However  things are looking up for airlines after Trump expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement with China  The fuel cost threat is also low after Saudi Aramco reportedly restored oil production earlier than expected  Hence  analysts no longer expect airlines to lower capacity by reducing frequencies or stopping fleet operations in underperforming routes Optimism on the Trade FrontTrump recently said that a deal to put an end to the more than a year long tariff dispute with Beijing could arrive sooner than expected  Trump added that China desperately needs the trade war to end since their economy is getting severely affected  The president also said that people in China are losing jobs as companies in the country are shifting operations to other nations  including America Adding to the optimism  Beijing has recommenced significant purchases of pork and soybeans from Washington  confirmed China s Ministry of Commerce  Precisely  the market is pinning hopes of positive developments when the countries conduct trade talks  likely in early October in Washington Oil Price to Remain LowThe price of oil has declined as Saudi Arabia restored crude production capacity ahead of market expectations  The unexpected rise in U S  oil inventories also led to the commodity s southbound journey  Last week  crude oil inventories in the United States increased 2 4 million barrels  per the Energy Information Administration  This was quite unexpected as the analysts were expecting the oil stockpiles to decline 249 000 barrels  per CNBC Notably  the United States has been producing crude uninterruptedly in huge volumes since drillers in the shale plays  especially the prolific Permian Basin  are getting more efficient in producing the commodity with lesser number of rigs  Thus  the production glut is likely to keep crude in the bearish territory  even though there might be short term fluctuations Airline Profits to RiseThe airline traffic in the domestic market is positively correlated with consumer confidence and their financial health  Although consumer confidence is low and hiring has been slowed  the high possibility that the two big economies will strike a deal to end the trade dispute is likely to restore confidence of Americans and drive job addition The interest rate cut by the Central banks in the United States and Europe will drive the global economy and boost business spending  thereby increasing business travel  Moreover  there will likely be an improvement in freight demand  improving outlook for cargo planes On the cost front  the weak crude pricing scenario signifies lower fuel cost for airlines  thereby aiding profits  Notably  fuel generally accounts for nearly 30  of airlines  costs Stocks to GainIt is probably the best time for investors to keep an eye on airline stocks  This is because there is a high possibility that the global business environment for airlines will improve as a whole  thanks to optimism on the trade war front and the likelihood of fuel costs remaining low We have shortlisted

195488,417004,DAL,Will Delta  DAL  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry 
This airline has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 64  
For the last reported quarter  Delta came out with earnings of  2 35 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 29 per share  representing a surprise of 2 62   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 90 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 96 per share  delivering a surprise of 6 67  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Delta  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Delta has an Earnings ESP of  0 88  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 10  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-09-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-delta-dal-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200469551,200469551
195489,417005,DAL,Delta Air Lines  DAL  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 10  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 28 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  26 7  
Revenues are expected to be  12 59 billion  up 5 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 47  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Delta 
For Delta  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 49  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Delta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Delta would post earnings of  2 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 35  delivering a surprise of  2 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Delta appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-air-lines-dal-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200470365,200470365

195502,417018,DAL,4 Airline Stocks To Gain On Trade Optimism   Low Fuel Cost,opinion,The aviation sector has been bogged down by the ebb and flow of the prolonged U S  China trade tensions  The Sep 14 drone attacks on Saudi Arabia s oil facilities was also quite a blow as it sparked fears of a bump up in fuel costs However  things are looking up for airlines after Trump expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement with China  The fuel cost threat is also low after Saudi Aramco reportedly restored oil production earlier than expected  Hence  analysts no longer expect airlines to lower capacity by reducing frequencies or stopping fleet operations in underperforming routes Optimism on the Trade FrontTrump recently said that a deal to put an end to the more than a year long tariff dispute with Beijing could arrive sooner than expected  Trump added that China desperately needs the trade war to end since their economy is getting severely affected  The president also said that people in China are losing jobs as companies in the country are shifting operations to other nations  including America Adding to the optimism  Beijing has recommenced significant purchases of pork and soybeans from Washington  confirmed China s Ministry of Commerce  Precisely  the market is pinning hopes of positive developments when the countries conduct trade talks  likely in early October in Washington Oil Price to Remain LowThe price of oil has declined as Saudi Arabia restored crude production capacity ahead of market expectations  The unexpected rise in U S  oil inventories also led to the commodity s southbound journey  Last week  crude oil inventories in the United States increased 2 4 million barrels  per the Energy Information Administration  This was quite unexpected as the analysts were expecting the oil stockpiles to decline 249 000 barrels  per CNBC Notably  the United States has been producing crude uninterruptedly in huge volumes since drillers in the shale plays  especially the prolific Permian Basin  are getting more efficient in producing the commodity with lesser number of rigs  Thus  the production glut is likely to keep crude in the bearish territory  even though there might be short term fluctuations Airline Profits to RiseThe airline traffic in the domestic market is positively correlated with consumer confidence and their financial health  Although consumer confidence is low and hiring has been slowed  the high possibility that the two big economies will strike a deal to end the trade dispute is likely to restore confidence of Americans and drive job addition The interest rate cut by the Central banks in the United States and Europe will drive the global economy and boost business spending  thereby increasing business travel  Moreover  there will likely be an improvement in freight demand  improving outlook for cargo planes On the cost front  the weak crude pricing scenario signifies lower fuel cost for airlines  thereby aiding profits  Notably  fuel generally accounts for nearly 30  of airlines  costs Stocks to GainIt is probably the best time for investors to keep an eye on airline stocks  This is because there is a high possibility that the global business environment for airlines will improve as a whole  thanks to optimism on the trade war front and the likelihood of fuel costs remaining low We have shortlisted

195508,417024,DAL,Delta  DAL  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Delta is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Delta  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Delta
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this airline is expected to earn  7 07 per share  which is a change of 25 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Delta  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5 5  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

195567,417083,DAL,Delta  DAL  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this airline is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Delta is 11   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 24 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 24 4  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Delta has an S TA ratio of 0 76  which means that the company gets  0 76 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 74  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Delta is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 5 4  this year versus the industry average of 0 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Delta have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4 9  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Delta has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Delta well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-dal-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-200448044,200448044
195568,417084,DAL,Powell Gives Space For Growth  Market Overreacts   5 Picks,opinion,On Jul 31  after its two day FOMC meeting  Fed decided to reduce benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 2 2 25   in line with market expectations  Notably  this was the first rate cut by the central bank since Dec 16  2008  when the economy fell in the great recession Despite this  Wall Street plunged as the three major stock indexes    the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite    fell 1 2   1 1  and 1 2   respectively  While both the Dow and the S P 500 witnessed the largest single day decline since May 31  the Nasdaq Composite saw the biggest daily decline since late June Although market participants were expecting a quarter percentage point of cut  they were taken aback by Fed Chair Jerome Powell s comment that this rate cut is  in the nature of a mid cycle adjustment to policy  and to  insure against downside risks  but no signal that this the start of a lengthy rate cut cycle  This is a clear indication that further rate cut in this year is not guaranteed  while investors were looking for one or two more Rate Cut Expectations May Become Counter ProductiveThe sole purpose of any central bank to reduce interest rate is uplift business investment thereby generating growth in the economy  Low interest rate will reduce the cost of funds to both corporates and individuals  Consequently  corporates and individuals will borrow more to invest in businesses or in stock markets  which will likely result in higher growth However  if the central bank gives signals that more rate cuts are coming in the next two four months  then should corporates borrow more today  Rather they will wait for rate to be lowered again in order to avail funds at a cheaper rate  Continuation of this cycle will put the economy nowhere and ultimately the Fed may need to resort to zero or negative interest rate  meaning taxation on bank deposits Moreover  the Fed has decided to end its  3 6 trillion balance sheet downsizing program effective Aug 1  The program was initially decided to be terminated at the end of September  This bond portfolio reduction program of the central bank  which started in October 2017  has so far drained  618 billion from the economy Recessionary Fear OverblownThe Fed cited three reasons  lingering trade conflict with China and the imposition of tariffs and counter tariffs  a slowing global manufacturing sector  and muted inflation in the United States  as the primary reasons for the rate cut  Notably  Fed s favorite gauge of inflation    the core PCE Price Index    rose 1 6  in June  below its target rate of 2  A rate cut is generally associated with an impending recession  However  the U S  economy is still holding ground despite going through the historically largest expansion spanning 11 years The second quarter 2019 GDP of 2 1  was better than the consensus estimate of 1 8   Personal consumption expenditure jumped 4 3   the highest since the fourth quarter of 2017  after growing a mere 1 1  in the previous quarter  For July 2019  the Conference Board s measure of consumer confidence index skyrocketed at 135 7  approaching the 18 year high of 137 9 recorded in October 2018 A robust labor market  which added 172 000 jobs per month on average in the first half of 2019  a record low unemployment rate of 3 7   and gradual increase in wage rate are likely to sustain U S  consumer expenditure  thereby eliminating the chance of a recession any time soon  Moreover  core durable goods order    a key metric to track business investment plan    jumped 1 9  in June  marking the highest monthly gain in core factory orders since February 2018 Fed Maintains Steady Monetary Stance in 2019The Fed has corrected itself since the beginning of 2019 and adopted a dovish monetary stance after aggressively following hawkish policies in 2018  which were largely blamed for a market rout along with trade related concerns   Year to date  Wall street is continuing its dream run with the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite up 15 2   18 9  and 23 2   respectively  This impressive performance is primarily owing to the central bank s stable and accommodative monetary stance despite severe concerns about reaching a trade deal with China In June  Powell reiterated Fed s commitment to act as appropriate to sustain U S  economic expansion  In Jul 31  in his lecture on FOMC decision  the Fed Chair once gain reiterated his earlier commitment  Powell said   It s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts   while adding   I didn t say it s just one  move  Once again  an indication of more cuts is not ruled out if the central bank thinks it is genuinely needed   Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in stocks with

195575,417091,DAL,5 Stocks Basking In The Glory Of Relative Price Strength,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains Screening ParametersRelative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than

195585,417101,DAL,Delta  DAL  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  62 24 in the previous session  Delta Air Lines has gained 23 6  since the start of the year compared to the 17  move for the Zacks Transportation sector and the 13  return for the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 11  2019  Delta reported EPS of  2 35 versus consensus estimate of  2 29 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 3  
For the current fiscal year  Delta is expected to post earnings of  7 04 per share on  46 81 billion in revenues  This represents a 24 6  change in EPS on a 5 35  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 32 per share on  48 97 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 3 99  and 4 6   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Delta may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Delta has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 8 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 6 8X versus its peer group s average of 5 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 0 48  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Delta currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Delta fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Delta shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-dal-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200439741,200439741
195586,417102,DAL,Delta Air Lines  DAL  Is Up 3 44  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Delta Air Lines currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here

Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for DAL that show why this airline shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For DAL  shares are up 3 44  over the past week while the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry is up 2 7  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 9 08  compares favorably with the industry s 2 11  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Delta Air Lines have increased 5 98  over the past quarter  and have gained 21 53  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 4 14  and 9 82   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to DAL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  DAL is currently averaging 5 471 970 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with DAL 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost DAL s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 64 to  7 04 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that DAL is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Delta Air Lines on your short list ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-air-lines-dal-is-up-344-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200439847,200439847

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 62   A quarter ago  it was expected that this airline would post earnings of  0 90 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 96  delivering a surprise of 6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Delta  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry  posted revenues of  12 54 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 30   This compares to year ago revenues of  11 78 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Delta shares have added about 19 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 4  
What s Next for Delta 
While Delta has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Delta was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

195600,417116,DAL,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Delta  DAL ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   This company  which is in the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This airline has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4 51  
For the last reported quarter  Delta came out with earnings of  0 96 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 90 per share  representing a surprise of 6 67   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 27 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 30 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 36  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Delta  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Delta has an Earnings ESP of  0 93  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 11  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-delta-dal-200436518,200436518

195611,417127,DAL,Should Value Investors Pick Delta Air Lines  DAL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Delta Air Lines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 6  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 31  If we focus on the long  term PE trend  Delta Air Lines  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 10 62 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 83  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Delta Air Lines has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 35  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Delta Air Lines  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Delta Air Lines has a P S ratio of about 0 83  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 31 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Delta Air Lines currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Delta Air Lines a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Delta Air Lines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of B  This gives DAL a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  at the best  The current year has seen two upward revisions compared to one downward revision in the past sixty days  whereas the next year estimate has seen one upward revision compared to two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate increased 0 15  in the past two months  whereas the next year estimate declined 0 28   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Delta Air Lines  Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such mixed estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDelta Air Lines is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  the company carries an unfavorable industry rank  bottom 41  out of more than 250 Zacks industries   which makes us cautious about the broader factors Moreover  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through

195621,417137,DAL,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Delta Air Lines  DAL  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  in Focus
Delta Air Lines  DAL  is headquartered in Atlanta  and is in the Transportation sector  The stock has seen a price change of 8 46  since the start of the year  The airline is paying out a dividend of  0 7 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 59  compared to the Transportation   Airline industry s yield of 0 24  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 99  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 40 is up 6 9  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Delta Air Lines has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 44 56   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Delta s current payout ratio is 24   This means it paid out 24  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  DAL expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 70 per share  with earnings expected to increase 18 63  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  DAL is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-delta-air-lines-dal-could-be-a-great-choice-200425630,200425630

195631,417147,DAL,Delta  DAL  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Delta is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Delta imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Delta
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this airline is expected to earn  6 65 per share  which is a change of 17 7  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Delta  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Delta to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-05-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-dal-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200423052,200423052

195636,417152,DAL,Air France KLM CEO hunt signals industry strategy shift under Macron,news,By Richard Lough PARIS  Reuters    The hunt for a new chief executive to lead Air France KLM  a group hobbled by union resistance to cost cutting at its French brand  is testing President Emmanuel Macron s resolve for a lighter state touch on the economy  Macron s government has told the Franco Dutch airline group its very survival is at stake if it fails to become more competitive and undergo the painful reforms completed by carriers such as British Airways  L ICAG  and Lufthansa  DE LHAG  as they battle low cost airlines and Gulf carriers  In what would signal a subtle shift in French industrial strategy  two sources familiar with Macron s thinking said the government is open to considering a non French national as chairman of the group for the first time   This chairman would sit above one chief executive for Air France  who would almost certainly be a French national  and one for KLM  one of the sources said   It is just one option on the table  Macron s office expects to receive a shortlist of candidates from the group s interim management by the end of next week  a third source familiar with the matter said   The Air France KLM group  PA AIRF  has been led by French chief executives since its formation in 2004  a demand of the French state  its largest shareholder and one with heavy influence over the group s board thanks to its outsized voting rights  The last  Jean Marc Janaillac  resigned in May after losing a fight over pay with Air France staff  His role as group chief executive and chairman as well as chairman of the Air France unit has prompted a rethink of the structure   Paris  readiness to consider a foreigner to oversee a revamp of the airline s strategy and negotiations with Air France unions reflects Macron s desire to create pan European companies that can withstand globalization  even if that means placing control of a national asset in foreign hands    What we want to do is to create European champions   a finance ministry official said  speaking on condition of anonymity   It s not of primary importance that the boss has to be French    It wouldn t worry us if we ended up with an aviation specialist from Europe   Delta Air Lines  N DAL  and China Eastern Airlines  SS 600115   which both hold 8 8 percent stakes in Air France KLM  declined to comment  Two names have leaked to media in past weeks  Philippe Capron  the financial head of Veolia Environnement  PA VIE   pulled out after French ministers said they wanted an aviation specialist and that he was one of several candidates  Le Figaro reported on Monday that Catherine Guillouard  chief executive of French public transport group RATP  was being considered for the top job at Air France KLM  Two sources told Reuters she was not an official candidate  INVESTOR PRESSURE The job of Air France KLM chief executive may not be one that widely appeals   The next company chief will face the unenviable task of having to break union resistance to reduce Air France s swollen cost base  while keeping increasingly frustrated Dutch KLM staff onside  A wave of strikes this spring at Air France over pay cost the group some 350 million euros   410 97 million  and led to the ouster of Janaillac   Sources say KLM officials are frustrated at French staff s chronic labor conflicts and blame Air France s weak handling of the powerful SNPL pilots  union for the group s fragile state  Investors are frustrated too  The group s share price has slumped 47 percent so far this year   Asked recently if the group could have a Dutch chief executive  KLM CEO Pieter Elbers responded   why not   The pressure from investors to slash costs has intensified as rising fuel costs and overcapacity squeeze margins   Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned after Janaillac quit that he would not soak up the airline s losses   Overseeing a restructuring of Air France KLM would cement Macron s reputation as a reformist and modernizer   Restructuring     is what is required to move Air France KLM forward  Anything else will be history repeating itself   said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska  STATE EXIT  Macron could go further and sell down France s 14 3 percent stake in Air France KLM  a move that would deliver a potent message that he is serious about liberalizing the economy  The state s exit from the airline group would hand its leadership more freedom to stare down the unions    IAG chief executive  Willie Walsh just stared them down until blood came out of their eyes and they gave up   said aviation consultant Andrew Charlton   AccorHotels  PA ACCP  announced last month it was looking at buying all or part of the French state s stake   an option the government has not closed the door on but which faces obstacles   The government is studying things and is closed to nothing  but the first priority is to find a new leadership team for Air France KLM   the finance ministry official said  AccorHotels  overseas investors could  however  complicate any deal  Its main investors are from China and the Gulf  whose own airlines compete with Air France KLM on long haul routes   European Union rules also require more than half of a European airline s capital to be held by member states or EU nationals    Accor s capital today is not sufficiently European for it to work   said a second source familiar with the discussions  There would  however  be ways to overcome this  analysts say   The state s holding remains an open question  Nonetheless  analysts are encouraged by broader comments on the future of Air France KLM coming out of the French finance ministry    The noises heard out of the finance ministry definitely signify a change in attitude toward Air France KLM from the French state  said Roeska    And they fit with Macron s wider strategy

Based on these metrics and many more  DAL holds a Value grade of A  while LUV has a Value grade of C

Flying has gotten cheaper across the board in recent years  but Delta is beating its major U S  rivals at retaining a premium on tickets sold to bigger spending business travelers  The highest 10 percent of one way Delta fares started at  521 last year  down 12 percent from 2014  according to ICF Inc   which crunched the numbers for Bloomberg  United Continental Holdings Inc  s fares in that category fell 16 percent  while comparable ticket prices at American Airlines Group Inc  dropped 21 percent 
 Since Delta controls more business revenue than American or United  that gives them fewer seats that face really low cost competition and their fares are diluted less than American or United   said Ben Baldanza  former chief executive of Spirit Airlines Inc 
Given the payoff  all the carriers are chasing the prosperous by lavishing perks on them  Delta equipped its new Airbus SE A350 international planes with private suites in the business class cabin  each with a sliding door  United is rolling out its Polaris brand international business cabins with lie flat seats and direct access to the aisle  while American added sit down dining in its lounges for people holding first class international and transcontinental tickets

195660,417176,DAL,Can Delta  DAL  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This airline has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 91  
For the most recent quarter  Delta was expected to post earnings of  1 27 per share  but it reported  1 30 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 36   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 74 per share  while it actually produced  1 80 per share  a surprise of 3 45  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Delta  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Delta has an Earnings ESP of  0 54  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 10  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-delta-dal-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200403894,200403894
195661,417177,DAL,Delta  DAL  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Delta basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Delta  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Delta
This airline is expected to earn  6 58 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 16 5  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Delta  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Delta to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-04-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-dal-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200404354,200404354

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
Busiest Spring Ever for U S  Airlines 
 According to a projection by Airlines for America   A4A     the trade organization for leading U S  airlines   companies in the airline space are set to be extremely busy in the 2019 spring travel season  Mar 1 Apr 30   The projection mirrors a 4 3  increase in passengers flying to various destinations over the period compared with last year 
This bullish forecast further confirms a solid demand for air travel  Affordable ticket prices have also contributed to the favorable projection  With the advent of spring  many people spend on outdoor activities and traveling  After all  very few can travel in the harsh winter months characterized by inclement weather 
A4A s Projection
According to the forecast put forward by the Washington based trade group  passengers traveling on U S  airlines during the spring travel period this year will reach an all time high of 158 2 million   Notably  151 7 million people chose to travel by air in the same period last year  The forecast translates into 2 59 million fliers per day during the above mentioned period 
To meet the surge in travel demand  U S  carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 129 000 per day  Also  with the U S  economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong  more Americans planning for vacations 
Affordable airfares in addition to rising disposable income and low unemployment have provided added incentive for consumers to opt for air travel  Driven by the above reasons  the two month period is likely to see 106 000 additional passengers taking to the skies per day on various U S  carriers 
Impressively  the solid spring season travel forecast made by A4A comes close on the heels of the findings of the A4A commissioned research  conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs 
According to the survey  50  participants revealed that they flew at least once in 2018  The figure compared favorably to 39  recorded in 1997  Per the research findings  72  Americans resorted to air travel for personal reasons including vacations  with overall flight satisfaction exceeding 80  last year 
Oil Price Decline Bodes Well for Airlines
The upbeat performance by airline stocks during the 2018 Thanksgiving holiday period and the bullish projection for the spring travel season this year coincide with the decline in oil prices  With oil prices declining in excess of 20  from the highs of  76 a barrel touched in October 2018  operating expenses of airlines have decreased 
In line with the decline in oil prices  carriers have issued a favorable projection for the metric  For example  American Airlines anticipates fuel costs between  1 97 and  2 02 per gallon in the first quarter of 2019 compared with  2 10 recorded in the year ago quarter  The same for 2019 estimated to be between  1 99 and  2 04  lower than  2 23 in 2018 
American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
Low Taxes  A Boon 
The current tax law  which came into effect in late 2017  is a huge positive for the airline industry  A considerably lower corporate tax rate is boosting cash flow and improving the bottom line of carriers  Huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases  among others  Shareholder friendly activities apart  lower tax related outflow of most carriers have enabled them to undertake employee friendly activities such as profit sharing 
Carriers like SkyWest and Alaska Air have already increased their dividend payouts this year  Dividend hikes from the likes of Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines are expected through 2019

If you are hesitant about whether to put your money in bonds or stocks  a key metric that can show you the right direction is earnings yield  It is the reciprocal of the price to earnings  P E  ratio  This ratio is very useful in figuring out undervalued stocks and comes in handy for comparing stocks with the market or fixed income securities 
Earnings yield can be computed as  annual earnings per share market price  x 100  While comparing similar stocks  the one carrying high earnings yield should provide higher returns 
This ratio is useful for comparing the performance of the market with the 10 year Treasury yield  When the yield of the market index exceeds the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks are said to be undervalued in comparison to bonds  This means that investing in the stock market is a better option for a value investor 
However  while T bills are free of risks  investing in stocks always carries some inherent risks  Hence  it will be wise to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 36   A quarter ago  it was expected that this airline would post earnings of  1 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 80  delivering a surprise of 3 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Delta  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry  posted revenues of  10 74 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 80   This compares to year ago revenues of  10 25 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Delta shares have lost about 4 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3  
What s Next for Delta 
While Delta has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

195714,417230,DAL,One Trade Not Worth Considering In 2019  Airline Stocks,opinion,"Investors in airline stocks had a rough ride in 2018  Turbulence was spurred by a variety of industry specific issues including highly volatile oil prices  capacity expansions which include adding routes and bolstering hubs  all of which cut into profit margins as well as slowing demand from lucrative business travelers  Share prices remained under pressure throughout the year 
It doesn t seem as if 2019 will be any different  During the past 10 days  airline executives have trimmed profit forecasts in a bid to prepare investors for a more troubled journey ahead  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  jolted the sector on January 3  when the company cut its revenue forecasts for the second time in two months 
Fourth quarter revenue from each seat flown a mile  referred to as unit revenue  will rise 3  from a year earlier  according to the Atlanta based airline  down from a previously forecast 3 5  gain 
The news from the largest US carrier  American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  wasn t promising either  Last week  the company trimmed its guidance for 2018  saying it now expects adjusted earnings of  4 40  4 60 a share for 2018  down from an October forecast of  4 50  5 a share 
American also cut its expectations for unit revenue  They predicted that fourth quarter unit revenue rose 1 5  from a year ago  after previously projecting it could climb as much as 3 5  
According to American Airlines management   a lower than anticipated improvement over a strong fourth quarter of 2017 in the domestic market   is the main culprit for the guidance cut  which is similar to the reasoning used by Delta to explain its unit revenue miss 
Buy Shares After Recent Plunge 

The pullback in airline shares after their poor guidance has been tempting many investors to take a position in these stocks  which now appear to be cheap  Shares of Delta and American can be purchased for less than 10 times each company s forward price to earnings multiple 

Delta  which closed at  48 56 on Friday  is close to the lowest level since the summer of 2018  American Airlines  which finished last week at  31 80 has taken an even bigger hit  extending its plunge over the past year to more than 45  
Despite the recent sector weakness  in our view  the majority of cyclical factors still don t favor taking a position in airline stocks  If oil prices don t recover quickly they will continue to pressure airline margins at a time when the outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain 
In the past  lower fuel prices helped increased air travel as travelers benefited from attractive fares in a booming global economy  This time  however  the situation is much more complicated  Although lower airfares might boost travel  airlines could be losing pricing power as slowing global travel demand hurt additionally by factors such as trade wars could leave more seats empty  further cutting into airline profits 
Bottom Line
For long term  by and hold investors airline stocks have rarely been a good bet  That s one of the main reasons these stocks are cheap 
During the past one year period  as a group  airline stocks delivered a negative return of 19 5   more than double the losses for the broader S P 500  Delta Airlines reports Q4 2018 earnings on Tuesday  January 15 before the open  Expectations are for EPS of  1 27 on revenue of  10 83B  American Airlines reports fourth quarter results on Thursday  January 24  before markets open  Consensus calls for EPS of  1 04 on revenue of  11 06B 
With markets and the economy on a highly uncertain path  no matter what the most recent results indicate  we advise investors to stay clear of airline stocks in 2019 ",2019-01-14,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/airline-stocks-a-trade-not-worth-considering-in-2019-200375079,200375079

195720,417236,DAL,Delta Air Lines  DAL  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 10  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 27 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  32 3  
Revenues are expected to be  10 87 billion  up 6 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 61  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Delta 
For Delta  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 88  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Delta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Delta would post earnings of  1 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 80  delivering a surprise of  3 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Delta appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-air-lines-dal-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200372608,200372608

195743,417259,DAL,Why Delta  DAL  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Airline industry 
This airline has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3 18  
For the last reported quarter  Delta came out with earnings of  1 80 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 74 per share  representing a surprise of 3 45   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 72 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 77 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 91  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Delta  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Delta has an Earnings ESP of  4 95  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 10  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-delta-dal-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200367094,200367094

195782,417298,DAL,Oil Collapse Pushes Loonie Lower  ECB Minutes And U S  Inflation In Focus,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The US dollar index is marginally higher on Thursday  attempting to extend the massive gains it posted in the previous session  Dollar yen is up by 0 21   having touched a fresh high for the year earlier  Meanwhile  the Loonie dropped on Wednesday as oil prices collapsed  erasing the gains it posted after the BoC raised rates  to trade much lower in the aftermath 
STOCKS  US markets closed lower yesterday  as trade concerns remained the dominant theme  Some spectacular losses in oil prices also pushed energy stocks lower  The Dow Jones dropped by 0 88   the S P 500 by 0 71   and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite by 0 55   However  sentiment seems to have turned around  as futures tracking the Dow  S P  and Nasdaq 100 are all currently signaling a higher open today  The shift in appetite was evident in Asia too  which was a sea of green  Japan s Nikkei 225 and Topix climbed by 1 17  and 0 46  respectively  while in Hong Kong  the Hang Seng gained 1 48   Europe was a similar story  with futures pointing to a higher open for all the major benchmarks today 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices collapsed on Wednesday  with WTI falling by 5 0  and Brent collapsing by 6 9  in the day  In dollar terms  WTI dropped by  3 73  and Brent by  5 46  The massive losses followed news that Libyan oil exports will soon return to normal levels  bringing back a significant chunk of supply to the market  A surge in the US dollar  data showing Saudi Arabia continues to raise its production  and concerns around the impact of trade tensions on oil demand  may have played a role too  In precious metals  gold plunged yesterday as well  pressured by a strengthening US dollar  Since the yellow metal is denominated in dollars  a strengthening greenback renders it less attractive for investors using foreign currencies  It s currently trading near  1 244  not far above its lows for the year  at  1 238 

Major movers  BoC hikes  but loonie ends lower as oil collapses  dollar roars backThe Bank of Canada  BoC  raised interest rates yesterday  as was widely anticipated  The tone of the accompanying statement was neutral overall  acknowledging that the Canadian economy is strong and will likely require higher interest rates over time  but also that uncertainty surrounding trade tensions has risen lately  The Loonie jumped on the decision  It appears investors were expecting a much more worried tone by policymakers  and hence even a neutral stance may have come as somewhat of a hawkish surprise 
That didn t last though  The Loonie gave back all its gains even before Governor Poloz s press conference started  and continued to trade much lower in the subsequent hours  The losses appear to have been driven more by movements in the oil market and a surge in the US dollar  rather than anything Poloz said  Even though the weekly EIA crude inventory data showed a massive drawdown  that was dwarfed by news that recent supply disruptions in Libya have been resolved  and the nation will soon ramp up its crude exports  WTI plunged by almost  4  posting its largest one day drop in two years  Since Canada is a major oil exporting economy  the collapse in oil was seen as undermining the nation s export revenue  hence pushing the Loonie lower 
Meanwhile  the US dollar gained across the board yesterday  with some relatively hawkish comments from Chicago Fed President Evans potentially aiding the move  He appeared quite relaxed about further hikes  saying that whether the Fed raises rates once or twice more this year is not that important in the big picture  Coming from someone who is usually ultra cautious  his remarks likely amplified expectations for two more hikes this year  Stronger than expected US PPI data may have played a role too  Dollar yen is 0 21  higher on Thursday  posting a new high for the year of 112 37 
The euro reached a seven week high against the yen  which has been losing ground despite escalating trade tensions  after a media report suggested the ECB could raise rates earlier than September 2019  It said some policymakers believe their forward guidance does not rule out a hike as early as July 2019  The ECB minutes today will be scrutinized for any color on the subject Day ahead  ECB minutes and US CPI eyed  Brexit White Paper and eurozone industrial production also dueThe releases that are likely to prove the most market sensitive out of Thursday s calendar are the ECB s official record of its latest meeting  as well as US consumer price data  The release of a White Paper on Brexit by the UK government could also gather attention 
Krona pairs will be gathering attention as Swedish inflation will be hitting the markets at 0730 GMT  while at the same time the Swedish central bank will be publishing the account of its latest monetary policy meeting 
At 0900 GMT  eurozone industrial production data for May will be made public  Output is anticipated to accelerate on both a monthly and yearly basis compared to April  Perhaps of more importance for euro pairs though  will be the ECB s minutes pertaining to its June meeting due at 1130 GMT  During that meeting  the central bank surprised by committing to end its asset purchases by year end  However  it left an overall  dovish taste  to the markets by pushing back expectations regarding the timing of the delivery of a rate hike  leading to a sell off in the euro  As the record of the meeting is made public  investors will want to assess the strength of the commitment to end asset purchases  as well as maybe when a rate increase is most likely to materialize 
Concerns over global trade were also likely discussed during the ECB s June meeting  and any comments on the issue and the risks posed by increased protectionism will be generating interest  Meanwhile  any updates on the US China spat during Thursday s trading will be closely monitored 
The US will be on the receiving end of June inflation data as gauged by the consumer price index  CPI  at 1230 GMT  Month on month  headline CPI  is projected to grow at 0 2   the same as in May  while year on year growth is expected to reach a six and a half year high of 2 9   from 2 8  in May   Core CPI  which strips out volatile food and energy items  the rise in oil prices is supportive of a higher headline CPI reading   is forecast to grow at 2 3   from 2 2  in May  Yesterday s producer price index  PPI  beat supported the case for two more rate increases by the Federal Reserve as the year unfolds  Another positive surprise in today s data is likely to further boost such expectations  consequently pushing the greenback higher  Lastly  weekly jobless claims data are also due out of the US at 1230 GMT 
In the UK  all eyes will be on the release of the much anticipated Brexit White Paper by Theresa May s government  While a 3 page outline of the agreement was already released on Friday  today markets will get a glance at the full 100 page document  The details will be studied to determine how  workable  and  realistic  the UK s proposals are  with the verdict likely to have a sizeable impact on sterling  Should it be seen as a practical plan that increases the likelihood for a  smoother Brexit   the pound could benefit  and vice versa 
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker  a non voting FOMC member on 2018  will be speaking at 1415 GMT  In the meantime  a meeting between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and EU Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini at 1100 GMT might be of interest  especially in light of the recent developments relating to global trade 
In equities  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  will be releasing its quarterly results before today s opening bell on Wall Street Technical Analysis  EUR USD looking bearish to neutral in the near termEUR USD has retreated from Monday s four week high of 1 1790  eventually falling to a one week low of 1 1665 on Wednesday  while it is currently trading not far above the aforementioned trough  The Tenkan sen is below the Kijun sen  this being a signal for a bearish bias  though the two lines have flatlined  an indication that bearish momentum has lost steam  Overall  the near term picture is looking bearish to neutral 
A more hawkish ECB than initially thought after the completion of June s meeting  is likely to push the pair higher  Initial resistance to advances may come around the current level of the 50 period moving average line at 1 1693  including the 1 17 round figure  The current levels of the Tenkan sen  1 1711  and Kijun sen  1 1727  lie not far above and may act as resistance as well 
On the other hand  a relatively dovish ECB  is expected to exert selling pressure on EUR USD  A first line of support to declines may occur from the area around the 100 period MA at 1 1657  which also encapsulates yesterday s one week low  1 1665   as well as the Ichimoku cloud top  also at 1 1665   The Ichimoku cloud bottom at 1 1623 would be eyed in case of steeper losses

195787,417303,DAL,Exclusive  Flying into the eye of Hurricane Irma with U S   Hurricane Hunters ,news,"By Phil Stewart THE EYE OF HURRICANE IRMA  Reuters    The sky darkened  lightning flashed and a jolt of turbulence shook the cabin of the hulking Air Force turbo prop aircraft as it plied its way toward the eye of Hurricane Irma  one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded  Piloting the four engine  WC 130J aircraft was Air Force Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Jim Hitterman  who over the past 22 years has flown into 40 to 50 hurricanes   Every storm is different but he likens the experience to driving through a car wash   with one big difference   As you re driving through that car wash  a bunch of gorillas start jumping on top of your car   Hitterman said  adding that sometimes shaking gets so bad  he cannot see his instruments   On Friday and Saturday  Reuters accompanied the Air Force Reserves   Hurricane Hunters   whose hard won data taken directly from the center of storms like Hurricane Irma are critical to U S  forecasts that save lives  Experts say U S  satellite data simply cannot do the job   We can estimate by satellite what the strength and size of a hurricane is  But only if you go into the hurricane can you really get an accurate measure of its exact center location  the structure  the maximum winds   said Rick Knabb  a hurricane expert at the Weather Channel and a former director the National Hurricane Center  The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron s  Hurricane Hunters  are based at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi  Mississippi  Its members trace the origin of hurricane hunting to a 1943 barroom dare by two then Army Air Corps pilots to fly through a hurricane off Texas  Today  the missions are carried out largely by Air Force reservists who  after a few days or weeks of chasing storms  return to their jobs in the civilian world  Hitterman  49  flies for Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  most of the time and  as a hobby  races motorcycles   The flight meteorologist  Major Nicole Mitchell  is an experienced television news meteorologist and mother of an eight month old baby boy  She normally lives in Minnesota  The way Mitchell sees it  the more accurate her data is  the more accurate the forecasts can be that tell U S  citizens whether to evacuate their homes as Irma or other storms advance   It s a fact that we make a difference   she said  RISKY BUSINESS Mitchell s plane would make four passes in total through Irma s eye during that mission  some entries and exits more turbulent than others  Its final pass came on Saturday  as Hurricane Irma walloped Cuba s northern coast  Irma s interaction with Cuba s terrain weakened the storm from a Category 5 to a Category 4 hurricane but U S  National Hurricane Center warned the storm was anticipated to strengthen again   Irma was expected to hit Florida on Sunday morning  bringing massive damage from wind and flooding to America s fourth largest state by population  Millions of Florida residents have been ordered to evacuate  Despite the severity of storms like Irma and the undeniable danger on the ground  these U S  flights into hurricanes have an incredible safety record   not one aircraft has been lost in more than four decades  The last time was in 1974  But they are not without risk  Some six hurricane or typhoon hunting aircraft have been lost in total  costing 53 lives  according to the Weather Underground website  Jeff Masters  director of meteorology of The Weather Underground  recalled an extremely close call during a flight into Hurricane Hugo in 1989 organized by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA   which also fields its own turbo prop aircraft   The pilot lost control of the aircraft  one of the engines caught on fire  and the aircraft descended rapidly  all because satellite data had given his crew the sense they were flying into a Category 3 storm  It turned out to be a Category 5  They were flying much too low for a storm that potent    We went in at 1 500 feet  which is a no no in a Category 5 and we got clobbered   recounted Masters  The pilot was able to recover control after entering Hugo s eye  On the mission into Irma  jolts of turbulence also shook the equipment in the cabin as it neared the eye of the hurricane  Emergency parachutes swayed   But then  suddenly  everything in the plane settled down   It was safe enough to take off seat belts  The flying was smooth   Inside the eye  the sky opened up  The dark  eyewall    the surrounding ring of clouds   could be seen outside the cockpit window  DRONES AND SONDES Masters says someday drones might be able to do the risky job now done by experienced air crews   But  from the cockpit of this Hurricane Hunter flight  that possibility still seems distant   This aircraft  like all of the 53rd s 10 WC 130J planes  are specially equipped to gather meteorological data and send it to the U S  National Hurricane Center  Some of that equipment is operated manually   That includes releasing sensors through the belly of the aircraft that  as they fall  transmit storm data including Irma s pressure  wind speed and direction  As the mission got underway  the sensors   known as dropsondes   appeared to be malfunctioning  Technical Sergeant Karen Moore  the loadmaster who releases the dropsondes from the aircraft  among many other duties  said she could not get its GPS signal as it fell into Irma s winds  So  Moore took out a screwdriver and literally started fixing them on the fly  one by one  That is something a drone would not be able to do  Hitterman said he also could see a future where pilotless planes fly into hurricanes to get the data Americans need

195789,417305,DAL,Airline Stock Outlook  High Costs Pose Short Term Challenges,opinion,"The airline industry is benefiting from strong demand for air travel  Declining air fares along with a much improved job market and rising disposable income have provided consumers an added incentive to opt for air travel  The bullish projection by the Airlines for America  A4A  for the ongoing summer season confirms the robust demand  The association expects the season to be the busiest one for U S  carriers in terms of air travel 
However  the rise in fuel costs has hurt airline stocks big time  Oil prices have risen roughly 10  year to date  Since expenses on fuel are significant for airlines  an increase in oil prices is unfavorable for the space 
In fact  the bearish forecast by the International Air Transport Association   IATA   on current year airlines  profitability highlights the fact that the woes are likely to continue for carriers  The research firm predicts global net profit for the industry to be  33 8 billion  much lower than the 2018 profitability forecast of  38 4 billion  unveiled in December 2017  Escalating oil prices apart  labor and interest costs also weighed on the profitability forecast

Headwinds like high fuel and labor costs  capacity related issues and technological glitches have contributed to investors  pessimism surrounding the space 
The   which is a 25 stock group within the broader   has underperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year 
While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 12 1   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Transportation Sector have rallied 13 4  and 0 8   respectively 
One Year Price Performance

Airline Stocks Trading Cheap
Thanks to the industry s underperformance over the past year  the valuation looks really cheap now  One might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  ratio  which is often used to value airline stocks  given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses 
This ratio is essentially utilized by buyers to come to a conclusion regarding the reasonability of a target s valuation 
The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 6 07  near the lowest level over the past year  When compared with the highest level of 7 29 and median level of 6 31 over that period  there is apparently plenty of upside left 
The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio for the S P 500 is 11 49 and the median level is 11 36 
Enterprise Value EBITDA  TTM 

 
However  as transportation stocks have unique characteristics  a comparison of the group s EV EBITDA ratio with that of its border sector is probably the best approach  Such a comparison ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount  The Zacks Transportation Sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 10 09 and the median level of 7 66 for the same period are significantly above the Zacks Airline Industry s respective ratios

Underperformance May Continue Due to Bleak Earnings Outlook
The strong balance sheets of major carriers have enabled them to engage in shareholder and employee friendly activities  Additionally  strong demand on the back of a buoyant U S  economy coupled with low air fares may help airline stocks in delivering improved shareholder returns in the near future 
But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead  The above ratio analysis already shows that there is hardly any value oriented path ahead and one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term  
One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry s prospects of a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies  Empirical research shows that a company s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock 
One could get a good sense of a company s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year s reported number  but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates 
While the consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Airline industry of  3 59 per share shows a year over year deterioration  the trend in earnings estimate revisions is not favorable either 
Price and Consensus  Zacks Airline Industry

Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s earnings potential 
The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 11 4  downward since Mar 31  2018 
Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions

 
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects
The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued underperformance in the near term 
The Zacks Airline industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  244  which places it at the bottom 5  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry s rank has been bearish over the past five weeks 
 

 
In fact  the basis of this bearish outlook could be the downward trend  albeit some fluctuations  in top line that airlines have been showing since the beginning of 2015 
 

 
Airline Stocks Promise Long Term Growth
While the near term prospects look unwelcoming for investors  the long term  3 5 years  EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Airline industry appears upbeat  The group s mean estimate of long term EPS growth has been showing an upward trend since January 2018 to reach the current level of 13 4   This compares to 9 8  for the Zacks S P 500 composite 
Mean Estimate of Long Term EPS Growth Rate

 
In fact  the basis of this long terms EPS growth could be an increase in free cash flow for the industry since the beginning of the current year 
 

 
The increase in free cash flow bodes well for airline stocks  as far as their dividend paying capacity is concerned  This is because dividends are paid from a company s cash flow  We note that airline stocks like Southwest Airlines Co   LUV  have raised their dividend payouts this year  Moreover  an uptick in such shareholder friendly activities in the space is likely due to the massive savings resulting from the new tax law 
Investors prefer dividend paying stocks  as these are financially stable and mature  and can also generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions  Therefore  our anticipation that airlines will fly high in the long run is justified 
Bottom Line
Even though factors like an improving unit revenue scenario  increased demand for air travel  cheap valuation and infrastructural developments to attract more passengers are positives for the sector and might contribute to long term growth  we believe that that airlines will fly low in the short term mainly due to the surge in fuel costs  According to IATA  jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 27 5  to  70 per barrel this year  Fuel bill is likely to account for 24 2  of total costs in 2018  21 4  in 2017  
Overall  the industry might not be able to tide over the challenges in the near term and therefore none of the stocks in our airline universe currently hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   However  below is a stock that has been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

passengers for sandwiches on shorter flights and cutting leg room on short haul business to help fit in more seats per plane   Ryanair was quick to try to capitalize  using references to comedies  Airplane  and  Little Britain  on social media to suggest passengers book with it instead  Critics in the British media questioned BA s strategy and the way it was positioning itself in a competitive market   How long will passengers continue to pay through the nose if they are receiving a service the cheapest budget airline would be ashamed of   mid market newspaper the Daily Mail wrote on Monday  On customer review site Skytrax  BA had a score of 5 10  with many reviewers saying they feel the airline s economy class on short haul is now no better than a budget carrier  By comparison  low cost carriers Ryanair and easyJet score 6 10  while Lufthansa  DE LHAG  and KLM  PA AIRF  score 7 10   RBC analyst Damian Brewer said that the latest BA problems could hit future revenues for parent company IAG  L ICAG    This is  in our view  a very unhelpful development for BA customers   and hence IAG shareholders   he wrote in a note  adding that sister carrier Vueling also experienced operational problems during the peak summer period last year   CHARM OFFENSIVE NEEDED Spanish listed shares of IAG  which also owns carriers Iberia and Aer Lingus  dropped 2 5 percent on Monday after an outage which is likely to cost tens of millions of pounds in compensation and other refunds  Analysts said BA needed a charm offensive after being criticized for its response over the weekend   There needs to be an important communications exercise after this  to give assurances that the systems  back up systems and risk plan is as good as it can be   said Davy transport analyst Stephen Furlong   But this has happened before with other global airlines  and the stock market effect for these other airlines really wasn t big   he added   BA CEO Alex Cruz said on Monday that he was  profusely sorry   and that the problems were due to a power surge that also knocked out its back up systems and had nothing to do with outsourcing  The GMB union had blamed IT shortcomings on a decision to shift work to India last year  Some wondered why IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh  a former head of BA and better known in Britain than Cruz  had not appeared in public  Kunal Kothari  UK All Cap equity analyst at Old Mutual Global Investors  a top 10 shareholder in IAG stock  said he did not expect lasting financial repercussions for the group    As long as an airline deals with outages in a sensible and customer friendly way  lasting brand damage is unlikely   he said   Without a full investigation I just don t think cost cutting can be blamed   he added   IT FAILINGS Gil Hecht  the CEO of Israel based IT outage prevention firm Continuity Software  told Reuters that providing such incidents happened no more than once a year  people would probably carry on booking   Other airlines have swiftly recovered after a one off financial hit from IT glitches   Delta  N DAL  had to cancel 2 300 flights over a three day period in August after a power outage grounded its flights  The incident knocked  150 million off its pretax profit for the quarter  while Southwest Airlines  N LUV  also downgraded revenue targets last year after a computer outage forced it to cancel more than 2 000 flights  Airlines  reservations and IT systems are often a combination of modern systems built on top of technology from the 1960s  The need to keep systems running 24 7 means it is hard to shut them down for a full overhaul  Hecht of Continuity Software said the Delta outage had spurred interest from firms looking to improve their resilience  and that in the last two years  there has been a 500 percent increase in demand for business continuity technologies   It is possible for British Airways and other airlines to do a better job  but some of it is a financial decision   he said  Speaking after the Delta incident last summer  a senior Lufthansa manager said the carrier s main operations center in Frankfurt had continuity measures built in but that the airline also had a back up center at a separate  undisclosed location   Michael Gierse  a fund manager at Lufthansa shareholder Union Investment  said all companies  not just airlines  should have a board member responsible for IT

195813,417329,DAL,Pennsylvania pipeline fight could upend international oil flows,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Jessica Resnick Ault NEW YORK  Reuters    Refiners from the Midwest United States are fighting for access to a vital Pennsylvania pipeline   a move that could cripple their East Coast competitors and redraw the map for international flows of crude and fuel into coveted coastal markets  The regulatory dispute centers on a proposal by pipeline operator Buckeye Partners  to that state s Public Utilities Commission  The plan would reverse the flow of fuels on a section of Buckeye s 350 mile Laurel Pipeline  which currently flows from the East Coast to Pittsburgh  Because pipelines only flow in one direction  the change would effectively block five East Coast refineries from serving Pittsburgh   with Midwest refiners picking up their market share  The commission will decide on whether to allow Buckeye to reverse the flow from Pittsburgh  near the state s western border  to Altoona  a small city about a hundred miles to the east  For a map detailing the proposal  see   Initially  such a reversal would cost East Coast refiners about  10 million annually  according to a study gasoline marketer Gulf Operating commissioned to include in its objections to the Buckeye proposal  Piping gasoline to Pittsburgh yields some of their highest per barrel profits  But opponents  including East Coast refiners and some state lawmakers  are far more worried that such a decision would presage a reversal of the entire pipeline  That would take Midwest fuels all the way to Philadelphia on the state s eastern border  where it connects to distribution networks serving the entire eastern seaboard  For Buckeye  the move represents a bet that surging Midwest refiners will be better customers   keeping its pipeline full to capacity   than their struggling East Coast counterparts  The stakes are much higher for the refiners involved  Midwest refiners could gain a huge market opportunity to pipe fuels into the East Coast  the largest U S  gasoline market  Their products could also make their way to the New York Harbor  a major gasoline trading hub  where they would likely displace imports from Europe that currently account for about 23 percent of the fuel consumed in the region  For East Coast refiners  access to the Laurel pipeline is a matter of survival   I have terrible anxiety  to say the least  when I see this proposal   said Anthony Gallagher  business manager for the local Philadelphia pipefitters union  speaking at a recent hearing on the proposal in Harrisburg  the state s capital   It will totally choke off these refiners  and they will have to start laying people off  Then  they will shut down   Buckeye s proposal has also drawn formal objections from state lawmakers and two refiners from the Philadelphia region  Philadelphia Energy Solutions  PES  and Monroe Energy  a subsidiary of Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL   Together  they employ about 1 000 people  The two other firms operating East Coast refineries   PBF Energy and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX    also own Midwest refineries  which gives them conflicting economic interests in the outcome  PBF Energy and Phillips 66 did not respond to Reuters  requests for comment  and neither has filed comments with the commission  PES and Monroe declined to comment to Reuters but filed formal written objections to the commission  Monroe argued that approving Buckeye s plan would require East Coast refiners to  reduce output or sell petroleum products at drastically reduced prices  into an already oversupplied market  A delegation of Philadelphia area lawmakers sent a letter warning the commission of  devastating economic effects   Buckeye s attorney David MacGregor countered that consumers will reap the economic benefits  Midwest refiners  he said at a recent commission hearing  could lower gas prices throughout Pennsylvania and lessen the region s reliance on imported oil  A decision on the reversal is not likely until the fall and rests with the five member state board  The five board members declined to comment through a commission spokeswoman  SURVIVAL STRUGGLE East Coast refiners have already closed plants because of their precarious competitive position  The region s refineries currently meet about one fifth of gasoline demand on the East Coast  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  The rest comes from Gulf Coast refiners  via the Colonial and Plantation pipelines  and imports from Europe and Canada  Currently  Pittsburgh can access fuels from either the Midwest   through other pipelines owned by Buckeye   or the East Coast  whichever is cheaper at the time  Losing that market would be a blow to the East Coast plants  but the impact would be far more dire if Buckeye ultimately seeks to reverse the flow of the Laurel line all the way to Philadelphia  That s why both Philadelphia refineries and other opponents have argued that regulators must consider Buckeye s broader intent   a possible reversal of flows along the entire pipeline   in deciding the current dispute over reversing a smaller section    It is imperative that there be a full investigation  of Buckeye s long term plans  Philadelphia Energy Solutions argued in a filing to the commission  In an interview with Reuters  a Houston based Buckeye executive would not rule out seeking future reversals that would extend Midwest refiners  pipeline access to Philadelphia   We go where the market wants us to go   said Bill Hollis  a Buckeye senior vice president  THE COMPETITIVE EDGE  CHEAP CANADIAN CRUDE The market is tilting in favor of Midwest refiners mostly because they can access cheaper crude than their East Coast counterparts  Midwest refiners including Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  and Husky Energy and Phillips 66 have added nearly a half million barrels of daily refining capacity in the last ten years  tailoring their systems to run crude out of Canada and North Dakota s Bakken shale oil field  Today  Midwest refiners process 80 percent of the crude that the U S  imports from Canada  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   and crude from Western Canada can be purchased for  14 a barrel less than benchmark U S  crude  Midwest refiners can access Canada s crude via pipeline  East Coast refiners have to pay more to get it shipped on boats or trains  Adding to their competitive advantage  Midwest refiners will soon be able to tap Bakken crude through the nearly completed Dakota Access Pipeline  The East Coast refiners import most of the oil they turn into gasoline and diesel from West Africa and South America  and the region must import gasoline from Europe and Canada to meet local demand  Buckeye s proposal is a bet on the future of the Midwest refineries   and against those on the East Coast  Hollis said

195822,417338,DAL,British Airways resumes flights from London after IT outage causes chaos,news,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Kylie MacLellan
LONDON  Reuters    British Airways resumed some flights from Britain s two biggest airports on Sunday after a global computer system failure created chaos  leaving planes grounded and thousands of passengers queuing for hours 
BA said it aimed to operate the majority of services from London Heathrow on Sunday and a near normal schedule from Gatwick  the capital s second busiest airport  Heathrow authorities  however  said they expected further delays and cancellations of BA flights 
 We are continuing to work hard to restore all of our IT systems   BA added in a statement   We are extremely sorry for the huge disruption caused to customers  
Heathrow told passengers not to travel to the airport unless they were rebooked on other flights 
British Airways canceled all its flights from Heathrow  Europe s busiest airport  and Gatwick on Saturday after a power supply problem disrupted its flight operations worldwide and also hit its call centers and website 
A spokeswoman for BA could not immediately detail the exact number of flights canceled on Saturday 
Alex Cruz  the chairman and chief executive of BA  part of Europe s largest airline group IAG  LON ICAG   said there was no evidence of any cyber attack 
CHAOS FOR PASSENGERS
Thousands of passengers queued for hours in departure halls at the airports on a particularly busy weekend  Monday is a public holiday and many children were starting a one week school holiday 
While British Airways could face a one off financial hit from the cancellations  the risk to its reputation among customers could be more damaging in the long term effect 
It is already facing declining customer ratings following unpopular decisions made as it faces competition from low cost airlines  These include starting to charge for food on short haul flights last year to cut costs 
Terminals at Heathrow and Gatwick became jammed with angry passengers  with confused BA staff unable to help as they had no access to their computers  according to passengers interviewed by Reuters 
Some passengers expressed frustration on Twitter over missing bags and long waits in telephone queues to speak to BA staff 
 We are refunding or rebooking customers who suffered cancellations on to new services as quickly as possible   BA said  adding that it had introduced more flexible rebooking policies for passengers affected 
While other airlines have been hit by computer problems  the scale and length of BA s troubles were unusual

195823,417339,DAL,5 Airline Stocks Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates In Q1,opinion,"The current projection for Q1 earnings season is very encouraging  Per the latest   the bottom line for S P 500 companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 16  on a year over year basis  Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7 4   The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year  Out of which  11 are projected to exhibit double digit earnings growth One of those sectors is the   wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 14 3   Notably  this highly diversified sector includes airlines among others  We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with promising fiscal and regulatory policies from the current administration bode well for the sector The Q1 earnings season will be kicked off by Delta Air Lines  Inc   NYSE DAL  on Apr 12  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Multiple Headwinds Hurt Airlines in Q1Airline stocks had a rough time in the January March period mainly due to weather related disruptions  Notably  key players in this space had to cancel multiple flights in the first quarter due to quite a few storms in the first quarter  Apart from Winter Storm Grayson in January  successive nor easters in March disrupted airline operations significantly due to multiple flight cancellations In fact  in March  there were reportedly more than 10 000 flight cancellations due to successive nor easters  It is believed to be the worst month in five years in this regard  The increase in the number of flight cancellations in the first quarter resulted in significant revenue losses for airline operators and this is likely to hurt top line growth in the upcoming earnings season Additionally  oil prices were up approximately 8  in the January March period  On Mar 21  crude had jumped above the psychologically important  65 per barrel level  representing a spectacular recovery from the  26 a barrel mark touched in late February 2016  In fact  the first quarter of 2018 saw U S  oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 We note that high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures  Given this backdrop  we expect high fuel costs to limit bottom line growth of carriers in Q1 Zacks Industry RankThe above struggles for the airline space is well reflected by the bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 169 carried by the 27 member   Notably  the unfavorable rank places the industry in the bottom 34  of the 250  groups  We put our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half outpaced the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The Zacks Industry Rank for this sector has also improved immensely  given the industry s 200  rank only a few months ago Click here to know more  
Some Prevalent TailwindsDespite the above mentioned challenges  there are a few bright spots in the sector  Evidently  the unit revenue scenario is steadily improving for airline stocks  This can be made out from the bullish Q1 unit revenue forecasts from leading carriers like Delta and United Continental The improved unit revenue projections highlight the strong demand for air travel on the back of a buoyant U S  economy   Furthermore  the bullish forecast for spring travel by the Airlines for America   A4A     a premier trade organization   highlights the improvement on the revenue front  In fact  strong demand for air travel backed by an improving economy  a much improved job market and rising disposable income is likely to aid results in the to be reported quarter Moreover  the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate on multiple downward revisions due to the above headwinds may not make earnings outperformance too difficult for carriers in the soon to be reported quarter  For example  the Zacks Consensus for the first quarter of 2018 at United Continental is 27 cents per share  comparatively less than the year ago figure of 37 cents  Moreover  in the preceding quarter  the consensus mark for earnings in was pegged at  1 34 at United Continental  Naturally  the lowered bar should make it easier for companies to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q1 In view of the above commentary  it would not be a bad idea to add airline stocks  despite the above mentioned hiccups  to one s portfolio for handsome returns Selection of OutperformersWith the airline space being densely populated  the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one  Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one s stock picking prowess  the Zacks methodology might provide some relief Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank  1  2  Buy  or 3 and a positive   the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

195825,417341,DAL,Should You Sell These Underperforming Warren Buffet Stocks ,opinion,"After a promising start to 2018  major stock indexes forfeited their yearly gains over the past few weeks amid heightened concerns about a looming trade war between the U S  and China  Now  as investors look to rebound from what has been a tough stretch for many  it could prove prudent to dig deep into the tried and true strategies of Wall Street s top figures 
One of those top performers is  of course  the legendary Warren Buffett  Dubbed the  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  for his decades of success  Buffett has amassed billions of dollars through a meticulous brand of value investing that touts patience and confidence  Simply put  Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway  firm are icons of the investing world 
Berkshire Hathaway s U S  long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks  with the five largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62  of its total value  This portfolio is tracked by a large swath of investors looking to mimic the success of Berkshire s legendary CEO 
But not even Berkshire Hathaway has made it through 2018 s early volatility unscathed  and with most of the public lacking the patience of Buffett  some followers of the portfolio might consider ditching some of its worst performing stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Wells Fargo   Company    NYSE WFC   
Commercial banking giant Wells Fargo has been marred by a fraudulent account scandal that tracked back to upper management  calling the company s business practices into question and damaging its public reputation  More recently  interest rate uncertainty has caused headwinds for the finance sector  Shares of WFC have slipped more than 13  so this year  lagging the S P 500 s nearly 2  drop 
Buffett has been forced to publicly defend Wells Fargo at times  with the bank remaining one of Berkshire s largest holdings  On top of that  Wells Fargo has underperformed from an earnings standpoint  missing consensus EPS estimates in the previous quarter and inspiring a significant selloff 
The company has an opportunity to turn things around with its new report on Friday  Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting that Wells Fargo will post earnings growth of 7   but revenue is expected to be down year over year and could add more pressure to the situation 
Still  earnings estimates have trended slightly higher throughout the quarter  indicating that the company s fortunes could be improving  WFC is holding a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  heading into its report date  Meanwhile  shares are trading at just 10 9x forward 12 month earnings  which is a discount to the stock s median Forward P E of 12 5 displayed over the past year 
The Kraft Heinz Company    NASDAQ KHC   
Kraft Heinz remains one of Berkshire s largest holdings  but the stock has underperformed amid a continued shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food  The stock has tumbled more than 21  so far this year  and shares are hovering just above their 52 week low 
These headwinds are putting pressure on Kraft s earnings outlook  Within the past 60 days  the company has witnessed seven revisions to its full year EPS estimates  with 100  agreement to the downside  Analysts now expect the company to post earnings growth of 8  on net sales growth of 1  
This negative estimate revision activity has earned KHC a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Still  the Zacks Rank is only designed to be a one  to three month indicator  and Kraft s dividend yield of 4 1  is likely to keep buy and hold investors on board 
Southwest Airlines Co     NYSE LUV   
Southwest was one of Berkshire s 10 largest holdings at the end of 2017  followed shortly by fellow airline company Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    Unfortunately  industry wide headwinds including lower than expected demand for spring travel have punished these stocks  Heading into the day  LUV was down more than 17  on a year to date basis 
Management has a bearish view on unit revenues for the first quarter of 2018  The carrier now expects revenue per available seat mile to be flat  down from the previous forecast of growth between 1  and 2  from the prior year quarter 
This negative outlook has put a damper on analyst sentiment for Southwest  Over the past two months  LUV has witnessed six negative revisions to its full year earnings estimates  with 100  agreement among revising analysts  This negative revision activity has given the stock a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

195832,417348,DAL,Should Investors Avoid Delta  DAL  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   dipped on Friday after the company announced that hundreds of thousands of customers might have had their credit card information compromised as part of a cyberattack  This isn t good news for investors or Delta as the airline approaches the release of its first quarter 2018 earnings results 
Delta  on Thursday that hundreds of thousands of customers  credit cards could have been hacked via a vendor that operated a chat feature on Delta s website  In the wake of this breach  investors need to be even more cautious about Delta  as any data driven selloff  coupled with the current market wide volatility  could spell trouble 
With that said  one of the best ways for investors to elude the possibility of continued volatility would be to avoid Delta if the company is also likely to underperform its earnings estimates 
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Delta s Q1 earnings to sink by 5 2  to hit  0 73 per share  Delta has also experienced a few downward earnings estimate revisions recently 
But this still doesn t tell investors if Delta is expected to fall short of this earnings estimate  Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise  in one way or the other 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
In contrast  a stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or worse  coupled with a negative Earnings ESP  is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season 
Delta is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and is projected to see its revenues climb by 7 3  to  9 82 billion  However  the airline giant also currently sports an Earnings ESP of  0 88   This means that Delta might be a stock investors should avoid ahead of earnings 
Delta is set to report its first quarter 2018 earnings results before the market opens on Thursday  April 12

195877,417393,DAL,Buy These 3 Airline Stocks Soaring Amid Profit Sharing,opinion,"Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   announced on Valentine s Day that the company is set to pay out more than  1 billion in profit sharing to its employees as part of its continued program to spread the wealth  Other U S  airline firms also joined the party  and at the moment  this trend seems to be a sign of strength and stability in the industry 
The Atlanta based airline company noted that this is the fourth straight year it will share over  1 billion with its employees  Delta boasted that its profit sharing program goes far beyond the recent wave of one time payments that companies such as Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA   and AT T   NYSE T   made after the new Republican tax reforms were enacted  The airline also noted that its total annual compensation has increased by  
 Our industry leading profit sharing and compensation philosophy reflects a decision we made a long time ago to share in the company s success each year with our people who make it possible   Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement   Rather than make a one off payment like other companies  Delta is invested in highly competitive base pay  an industry leading annual profit sharing plan  and monthly bonuses each year when the airline performs well  
Delta might be leading the charge to distribute profits across the company  but it is certainly not alone  With that said  let s take a look at three U S  airline powers  including Delta  that have been able to share the wealth while maintaining a strong outlook  
1        Delta Air Lines  Inc   DAL 
Prior to yesterday s announcement  Delta employees received  1 1 billion in 2015   1 5 billion in 2016  which the company cited as the largest corporate profit sharing payout in U S  history  and another  1 1 billion in 2017  Amid this current tight labor market  Delta s employee compensation plan could go a long way to securing a strong workforce  The company is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and rocks an overall  B  VGM score  which is supported by its  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system 
Investors should note that we have witnessed 10 upward earnings estimate revisions with 100  agreement to the upside for the company s fiscal 2018  Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Delta is projected to see its earnings soar by nearly 29  in its current fiscal year  Amid this effort to share the wealth  Delta is also projected to expand its bottom line at a healthy annualized rate of 11 60  over the next three to five years 
2        Southwest Airlines Company   NYSE LUV  
In January  Southwest joined the list of companies that awarded employees bonuses of  1 000  On top of that  the Dallas based airline announced last week that it would share  543 million through its profit sharing plan  which the company noted is equivalent to more than five weeks of pay  Southwest is currently Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports an overall  A  VGM grade 
The low cost airline giant also looks poised to continue to expand its bottom line  despite its commitments to spend more money on its employees  Our consensus estimate is moving higher on the back of strong analyst revision agreement for the current fiscal year  Southwest is expected to see its earnings surge 32 79  in the current quarter and 42 86  in 2018  Looking further down the road  Southwest is projected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 11 22  over the next three to five years 
3        American Airlines Group  Inc    NASDAQ AAL  
This U S  airline giant is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and boasts an  A  grade for Value and a  B  for Momentum  Like Southwest  American announced that it would pay out  1 000 bonuses to employees  which the company said would cost  130 million  American will also  shell out another  241 million to its employees as part of a profit sharing program 
It does not appear that the company s recent wave of profit sharing will hurt American s bottom line  The airline firm is expected to see its earnings per share hit  5 80 in 2018  which would mark a nearly 19  increase  Investors should also be aware that American has earned 10 upward earnings estimate revisions with 100  agreement to the upside for 2018  as well as five for the following year

195884,417400,DAL,Airline Industry Outlook   February 2018,opinion,"It seems that airline stocks are back in favor after being laid low for the better part of 2017 due to headwinds like the back to back hurricanes and higher fuel costs  The resurgence of airline stocks can be made out from the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 10 9  over the last three months 
Lets delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the turnaround 
Bullish Unit Revenues 
The improving scenario with respect to unit revenues is a big positive for airlines  For example  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL   while revealing better than expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017  predicted total unit revenues  excluding refinery sales   a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier  to increase in the band of 2 5  to 4 5   on a year over year basis  in the first quarter of 2018 
Delta expects to perform well on this front in 2018 as well  with passenger revenue per available seat miles  PRASM  growth estimated in each quarter  Delta carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  in the first quarter of 2018 to increase in the range of 2 4  year over year   
Furthermore  rising fuel costs might lead to a rise in ticket prices and boost revenues  
New Tax Law Likely to Aid Airlines
On Dec 22  2017  President Trump signed the much anticipated tax bill into law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   Under the  1 5 trillion tax overhaul package  corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21  from 35   The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow  which in turn will aid the bottom lines of carriers 
Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate  the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States 
In fact  some market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low cost carriers like Alaska Air Group  ALK  and JetBlue Airways  JBLU  more than the legacy carriers  This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago  Consequently  they are utilizing past losses to avoid paying cash income taxes  so they do not stand to benefit immediately  tangibly  by the tax cuts  However  their smaller rivals are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they had been paying higher taxes 
Naturally  low cost carriers like Alaska Air  Southwest Airlines  LUV  and JetBlue have declared bonuses   1 000 per member  following the tax overhaul  Among legacy carriers  American Airlines has declared a bonus 
However  all types of airlines  low cost or legacy  invest significantly in capital expenditures  In the new tax scenario  these companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately  which was not allowed earlier  As a result  their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions 
For example  Delta  which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4  and 6  on a year over year basis  lifted its earnings per share guidance  anticipating the new tax law to boost its results  The company now expects earnings per share in the range of  6 35 to  6 70  previous outlook   5 35 to  5 70  
More Shareholder Friendly Activities Likely
Courtesy their financial prosperity  airlines have been consistently rewarding their shareholders  For example  United Continental Holdings  UAL  and JetBlue announced new buyback programs late last year  Alaska Air announced an increase in its quarterly dividend payout  while unveiling its fourth quarter 2017 results  Moreover  the likes of Delta and Southwest also hiked their quarterly dividend payouts last year 
We expect an uptick in these shareholder friendly activities from carriers following the new tax law  Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills  more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others 
Bullish IATA Forecast for 2018
In December 2017  the International Air Transport Association   IATA   provided an encouraging outlook for the global airline industry  IATA predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry in 2018  This is much higher than the profitability forecast of  34 5 billion for the current year  The bright projection can be attributed to strong demand for air travel 
Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4 7  in 2018 from 4 6  estimated in 2017  The top line is projected at  824 billion in 2018 compared with  754 billion expected for 2017 
Optimism surrounding the air cargo business has also improved  Cargo revenues are forecast to increase to  59 2 billion in 2018  estimated revenues for 2017 are  54 5 billion   According to the forecast  air travel growth of 6  is expected for 2018  The estimated figure for 2018 is above the average growth of 5 5  in the last 10 20 years 
Improving Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable Scenario
The Zacks Industry Rank of 81 carried by the 24 member  also highlights the fact that its stocks are back in favor  Notably  a favorable rank places the industry in the top 32  of the 250  groups enlisted  The bullish stance on the industry is further augmented by the fact there were 12 positive estimate revisions in the fourth quarter of 2017 
Also  the Zacks Industry Rank has improved immensely  given the industry s 200  rank only a few months ago 
We put our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1

Valuation Signals More Upside
Going by the EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization  ratio  which is often used to value airline stocks  given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses  the industry doesn t look expensive at this point 
The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 6 5  which compares favorably with the market at large  as the current EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is at 12 7  The industry s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside 
Some Headwinds Remain
Despite the air of optimism surrounding the airline space  there are few headwinds of which one must be mindful  The constant rise in fuel prices  currently hovering around the  65 a barrel mark  do not bode well for airlines as fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies 
IATA projects that jet fuel prices will escalate to around 12 5  to  73 8 per barrel in 2018  The fuel bill is likely to account for 20 5  of total costs in 2018  18 8  in 2017   High labor costs are also hurting the bottom lines of carriers as they are constantly inking deals with various labor groups  courtesy their financial prosperity 
With their financial status likely to improve further mainly due to the savings from the new tax law  such deals are likely to continue pushing up labor costs  Moreover  glitches like the scheduling error at American Airlines  also have the potential to disrupt operations of carriers 
Furthermore  natural calamities like the recent winter storm Grayson cause significant revenue losses to airlines leading to multiple flight cancellations  Moreover  issues related to passenger dissatisfaction have been hurting U S  carriers for quite some time 
Capacity related fears gripped airline investors in the recent past  particularly in 2015   The fears were re ignited  when United Continental  while releasing fourth quarter results on Jan 23  stated that it expects 2018 capacity growth between 4  and 6  year over year  Moreover  similar growth in the metric is forecast in 2019 and 2020 as well  Following the guidance  investors fear that similar actions might be taken by rivals  triggering a price war 
Bottom Line
The above write up suggests that despite a few headwinds  the overall sentiment is positive surrounding airlines  The introduction of the new tax law makes us believe that good things are in store for airlines in 2018  Given the significant reduction in taxes we expect the already cheap airline stocks to fly higher  going forward

195885,417401,DAL,Airlines To Soar On Tax Cut  Economic Growth  Better Results,opinion,"Airline stocks have rebounded nicely after struggling for most of 2017  Headwinds ranging from flight cancellations and the resultant loss of revenues due to hurricanes and other calamities  high costs and customer dissatisfaction contributed to the sector s struggles in the year gone by 
However  things are looking up for stocks in the space post hurricanes  The fact that the overall picture is brightening up for airlines can be made out from the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 10 9  over the last three months 
Impressive Q4 Highlights Turnaround
The ongoing Q4 reporting cycle has seen major sector participants like Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL   American Airlines Group  AAL   Southwest Airlines  LUV  and United Continental Holdings  UAL  reporting better than expected earnings per share and revenues 
Moreover  their performances with respect to unit revenues  a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier  have been impressive  More heartening are the projections provided by these key sector participants with respect to this closely watched metric 
For example  American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat miles  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  to increase in the band of 2  to 4  in the first quarter of 2018  Southwest Airlines expects first quarter revenue per available seat mile  RASM  to rise between 1  and 2  
Non Fuel Unit Costs Likely to Hurt Less Going Forward
Apart from bullish unit revenues  the bottom lines of carriers are likely to be less severely impacted by non fuel unit costs going forward  This is evident from the improved outlook provided by the key sector players with respect to cost per available seat miles  excluding fuel  
For example  Southwest Airlines expects unit costs  excluding fuel and oil expense  profit sharing and special items  to grow in the band of 0 5 1 5  in the first quarter of 2018  The projection is favorable compared with the 4 1  rise in the metric in the fourth quarter  American Airlines expects unit costs  excluding fuel and special items  to increase 2  year over year in 2018  which again is better than the reading in the fourth quarter of 2017 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to Boost Airlines
Airlines are expected to get a significant boost from the new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   The optimism can be made out from the fact that the likes of American Airlines  Southwest Airlines  Alaska Air Group  ALK  and JetBlue Airways  JBLU  declared bonuses following the tax reform JetBlue carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
American Airlines stated on its fourth quarter conference call that it expects to receive cash tax refunds to the tune of approximately  170 million in both 2019 and 2020 pertaining to the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax 
Moreover  in the new tax scenario  companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately  which was not allowed earlier  This provision will benefit airlines hugely as they spend extensively on this front 
Furthermore  the huge savings due to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others  This means good news for shareholders too as dividend hikes and more buybacks are likely going forward 
Improving Domestic Economy Bodes Well
With the domestic economy on a solid footing  it is of little surprise that U S  stock markets are hitting all time highs on a fairly regular basis   Bullish domestic data released recently are indicative of the healthy position of the U S  economy 
Improvement in domestic economy bodes well for travel focused stocks like airlines  With consumer confidence remaining strong  more and more Americans are taking vacations  Further  cheap ticket prices have been an added incentive for consumers  who are benefiting from a much improved job market and rising disposable income 
IATA Forecast Hints at More Profits in 2018
IATA predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry in 2018  This is much higher than the profitability forecast of  34 5 billion for the current year  The bright projection can be attributed to strong demand for air travel  The bulk of the global profits in 2018 is expected from the North American region   16 4 billion   The estimated figure is higher than that in 2017

195886,417402,DAL,Factors That May Get In The Way Of An Airline Revival,opinion,"There is no denying that stocks in the airline space are witnessing good times on the back of a number of tailwinds like improved unit revenues and financial prosperity  Despite the optimism  there are certain roadblocks one must be mindful of before investing in the sector  Let s delve into the details 
Rising Fuel Costs Hurting Bottom Line
Fuel costs are on the rise lately  with oil prices crossing the  60 a barrel threshold  This upsurge can be attributed to the decision of OPEC member nations and Russia to extend production cuts to the end of 2018  This upsurge  however  does not spell good news for carriers 
As fuel costs represent one of the largest input costs for airline companies  the rise in oil prices naturally pushed up operating expenses  in turn  hurting the bottom line of carriers 
In fact  in the last three months  oil prices have increased significantly  The fact that fuel costs are on the rise can be made out from Delta Airlines   DAL  fourth quarter earnings report  Average fuel price  adjusted  was up 20 9  year over year to  1 93 per gallon at this Atlanta  GA based carrier 
The scenario is unlikely to change this year  Delta  which carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   expects fuel prices  including taxes and refinery impact  between  2 05 and  2 10 per gallon in the first quarter of 2018  which is much higher than the year ago figure  You can see 
Moreover  the International Air Transport Association   IATA   projects that jet fuel prices will escalate around 12 5  to  73 80 per barrel in 2018  The fuel bill is likely to account for 20 5  of total costs in 2018  18 8  in 2017  
Labor Related Issues   Another Drag
Apart from the rise in fuel costs  the surge in labor expenses is hurting the bottom line of carriers  This is primarily due to deals inked by carriers with various labor groups 
Evidently  the improved financial health of the carriers has not gone unnoticed by their employees  who are eager to get a share of the pie  This has propelled frequent new labor deals across the airline industry 
Even in the ongoing fourth quarter of 2017  labor costs have limited the bottom line growth of carriers  For example  at American Airlines Group  AAL   expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 7   This was primarily due to the significantly higher pay offered to pilots by the company to operate unassigned flights during the busy winter travel period 
This followed the infamous scheduling glitch  which allowed pilots of the carrier to take leave during the winter holiday period  giving rise to an acute pilot shortage during the busy travel period  The crisis was finally averted after talks between the company and its pilots  union   Allied Pilots Association 
The surge in labor costs is augmented in IATA s forecast for 2018  According to the projection  expenses related to labor are expected to be the largest expense item for airlines this year  Labor costs are projected to account for 30 9  of total expenses  and total unit costs are expected to increase 4 3   much higher than the 1 7  increase in 2017  
Moreover  issues related to labor strife have been hurting airlines quite a bit  Recently  Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings   RYAAY  pilots resorted to a four hour strike  This was the first time its pilots ever struck 
Computer Glitches Hurting Airline Operations 
American Airlines is not the only carrier to suffer from a scheduling glitch  A similar issue had hurt Ryanair Holdings  According to a   the carrier had to cancel 2 000 flights  resulting in significant customer dissatisfaction 
Technical glitches  in fact  have been creating a nuisance for carriers  For example  in November 2017  a  disrupted operations at Southwest Airlines  LUV   Operations at British Airways were also crippled last year due to a major IT system failure  Since expenditure on technological infrastructure is significant for stocks in the airline space  their profitability might be hurt in the event of such malfunctions 
Capacity Related Woes   Declining Airfare
Woes related to capacity overexpansion plagued airline stocks in the not so distant past  particularly 2015   These fears were re ignited when United Continental Holdings  UAL   while releasing fourth quarter results on Jan 23  stated that it expects 2018 capacity growth between 4  and 6  year over year  Moreover  similar growth in the metric is forecast for 2019 and 2020  Following the guidance  investors fear that similar actions might be taken by rivals  triggering a price war 
Capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain well below the highs of mid 2014  despite the recent resurgence  Moreover  airfares have remained low  with the metric declining in November  Capacity over expansion is believed to be the primary reason for the decline in airfares  Low air fares are favorable for fliers but a drag on the top line of carriers due to their lesser profits 
Other Headwinds
Issues related to passenger dissatisfaction have been hurting U S  carriers for quite some time  Alaska Airlines  the wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska Air Group  ALK   was the latest sufferer in this regard  when it was  sued by the family of an elderly lady who died last year following a fall in an escalator at the Portland  OR airport 
Natural calamities have also been responsible for laying airlines low by disrupting their operations  The latest such instance came when winter storm Grayson wreaked havoc in January 2018  With the storm disrupting normal life  travel plans were thrown as major airline operators had to cancel multiple flights 
Moreover  it is a well documented fact that acts of terrorism have the potential to harm airline stocks due to the possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears  The deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct 1  2017  hurt travel to the gambling haven  thus impacting tourism as Las Vegas is a popular tourist spot 
The  in June 2016 led to the crashing of airline stocks  Other acts of terror across the globe like the 2015 Paris and the 2016 Brussels attacks also spelled doom for airlines 
Conclusion
Thus the airline industry  despite the air of optimism surrounding it  is not bereft of headwinds  The challenges may prove to be detrimental to investors  especially the risk averse ones  unless attention is paid to resolve the above issues

On the surface  it would be expected that some investors might rotate funds out of Treasuries into outperforming stocks  Nevertheless  there are probably two more relevant reasons this is happening now 
1  The BoJ unexpectedly stopped buying long dated bonds something we discussed in detail here exacerbating a pre existing supply glut  as central banks shrink balance sheets  prompting investors to sell off 
This led to 
2  Janus Henderson Group s bond portfolio manager and billionaire Bill Gross kicking Treasuries when they re down   that bonds had entered a bear market  in which the presumed momentum is down while rallies are considered nothing more than corrections  even a shorting opportunity 
Global Financial Affairs

While the Dow set its fourth record yesterday  each new high has been supported by ever diminishing volume  as demand dries out  Of equal interest  even as the S P set its perfect sixth record yesterday  on broader market participation  in which the shares of a growing number of companies keep rising  indicating it s an all encompassing rally  yesterday s trade failed to hold on to early gains  except for the opening gap  By the close gains were pared back from 2 759 14 to 2 751 29  only 0 14 points above the opening price 

The Japanese say that a doji forming in an overbought condition signals that the market is tired  It certainly doesn t mean an immediate reversal  Rather  it s a sign that the price is vulnerable to bearish attacks 
It s natural then to acknowledge that this market is overbought  the Dow Jones posted 70 records in 2017  the highest number of record closes for a year ever for the index  surpassing the previous record of 69  made in 1995  the S P and NASDAQ Composite have each had a perfect 6 record run over the past 6 trading days  including 5 rising gaps  the S P 500 s momentum RSI has reached 79 63  the most overbought condition since October 20 
Internally  the S P 500 s defensive Health Care sector led the advance  gaining 1 18 percent  while Real Esate  a growth sector  led the decline  losing 1 14 percent 
Overall  the bulls remain in control of the US stock market  but bears are actively trying to claw back control 
Most Asian markets headed lower this morning  Japan s TOPIX retreated 0 15 percent  while the Nikkei 225 slid 0 25 percent  South Korea s KOSPI dropped 0 4 percent  but mainland China s Shanghai Composite advanced 0 25 percent and Hong Kong s Hang Seng rose 0 2 percent 
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index followed suit  ending its 5 day rally which had included rising gaps that registered a fresh peak after scaling above the November 1  398 05 high 
While conventional market structure suggests an inverse relationship between stocks and bonds  as investors choose between growth and safety  they are also trying to figure out whether the current bond selloff is an early warning regarding the end of global growth and the rising inflation that would occur  Yesterday  the argument of bond investors scored a point over equity investors 

The dollar index wiped out almost all of yesterday s gains this morning  possibly on the Treasury selloff by international investors  As well  the yen climbed for a second day as traders unwound short positions in the wake of the Bank of Japan tapering ultra long dated bond purchases 
China s central bank weakened its daily yuan fix by the most since September  one day after a report showed it has adjusted its   a move interpreted as an embrace of greater fluctuation in the exchange rate 

The pound extended its decline for a third day after Monday s HPI release in which the MoM metric fell to a negative 0 6 percent from  0 3 percent previously  much lower than the 0 2 percent growth expected  In addition  last Thursday s consumer credit release showing 1 400B fell short of the 1 500B forecast  suggesting the UK s economy is contracting  As well  reports that UK PM Theresa May might create a position for a minister for a contingency plan should a failure to reach a Brexit deal occur undermined sentiment  and last but not least  May s attempt to pick up the pieces after a Trump style cabinet reshuffle  caused uncertainty to spike 

Bitcoin fell through the  15 000 glass floor investors thought was made of stronger stuff  sinking for a fourth day  It was the cryptocurrency s longest losing streak since the December selloff  undoubtedly playing on trader fears of a repeat move 

Crude eased after breaking the  63 level  Its gains were driven by yesterday s API weekly stockpiles report which showed inventories dropped by a much greater than expected 11 2 million  an eight week fall  The commodity s price reached its highest level since 2014  but analysts warn of an overheating market  Technically  the price posted a fresh peak  above the May 5  2015 high of  61 01  completing a formal bottom of the 2014 crash

195897,417413,DAL,Alitalia may cut up to 2 000 jobs in turnaround plan  sources,news,"By Stanley Carvalho and Agnieszka Flak  ABU DHABI MILAN  Reuters    Alitalia could cut up to 2 000 jobs as controlling shareholder Etihad Airways pushes for sweeping changes to turn the loss making airline around  according to sources close to the matter  The Italian carrier may also ground at least 20 planes to cut certain unprofitable routes on domestic and regional services where it is struggling to compete with low cost rivals and high speed trains  the sources told Reuters   It is likely to remain loss making for the next two to three years even if it carries out the job cuts of around a sixth of its workforce and the plane groundings  said one of the sources  But a failure to slow the airline s decline and ultimately reverse its fortunes would not only see Abu Dhabi state owned Etihad take further financial hits on its investment  but deal a significant setback to its European expansion ambitions  It would also represent a defeat for the Italian government  which regards Alitalia as a strategic asset and a matter of national pride  denting its industrial strategy aimed at attracting foreign investment  Yet Rome is in a tough position  as news of possible job cuts at Italy s flag carrier come at a sensitive time   days from a Dec  4 referendum on constitutional reforms that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has staked his political future on  Alitalia said the next phase of its industrial plan would be presented to its board of directors and its staff soon and that it would not comment on any speculation until then  Etihad  which owns 49 percent of the carrier  declined to comment   FRUSTRATION Etihad invested 560 million euros   591 million  in Alitalia in 2014 as part of a wider 1 76 billion euro rescue deal  seeking to expand its global reach with access to Europe s fourth largest travel market  and pledged to return the airline to profitability by 2017   Rome helped engineer the rescue  hailing it an example of Italy s attractiveness for foreign investors  But two years after the deal was signed  Alitalia is losing half a million euros a day  Alitalia management is now studying several options to boost revenues and create an operator that can finally yield a profit  No final decision has yet been taken  sources say   The options include cutting between 700 and 2 000 jobs of the airline s 12 700 workers  according to three sources  This could put Etihad and Alitalia management on a collision course with unions   which have gone on strike over cost cuts in the past   as the busy Christmas travel season nears  Alitalia is also considering grounding at least 20 planes  mostly Airbus 320 aircraft  said two of the sources   The airline is also trying to renegotiate the terms of an alliance with Air France KLM  PA AIRF  and U S  carrier Delta Air Lines  N DAL  to boost traffic on higher margin transatlantic routes   When Etihad took its 49 percent stake in the carrier  it promised to slash costs  turn Rome s Fiumicino airport into an intercontinental hub  improve the airline s cargo business and add new long haul connections from Rome and Milan  keen to expand in Europe s fourth largest travel market  But the turnaround hit problems after low cost airlines such as Ryanair  I RYA  expanded more aggressively in Italy  putting more pressure on Alitalia s domestic and regional services  and after militants attacks across Europe dented passenger numbers  Last month Etihad CEO James Hogan used an interview with Italy s daily Corriere della Sera to vent his frustration about unions who hamper his efforts by taking to the streets over cost cuts and accused Rome of failing to support his turnaround plan  The government responded by saying it had fulfilled all its commitments towards Alitalia  EUROPEAN STRUGGLE Alitalia needs money to invest in its long haul business  but its existing Italian shareholders are unwilling to pour in any more cash   The group of Italian shareholders  which control a combined 51 percent stake and include Italy s two biggest banks UniCredit  MI CRDI  and  Intesa Sanpaolo   MI ISP   have long ceased to take an active interest in the airline   One option discussed is the conversion of a bond into semi equity financial instruments without voting rights  allowing Etihad to invest more without breaching the ownership limit that ensures Alitalia retains its European status  according to two sources   However  whether Etihad is prepared to invest more is uncertain    In the low oil price environment  it will be a big challenge for Etihad to convince Abu Dhabi for more cash   said one of the sources   They ve already pumped in a lot in Alitalia and others  It is time to get some money back   Etihad s first major investment in Europe   Air Berlin   has also proven a struggle to turn around  Etihad is now in talks to buy some of its tourism operations and combine those into a new joint venture as part of a drastic restructuring that will see Air Berlin s fleet halve in size  Ultimately the options for Alitalia remain few and far between  unless another cash rich investor can be found or it can be folded under a bigger and financially stronger European player  industry sources and analysts have said   Italian media suggested that German airline Lufthansa  DE LHAG  could buy into Alitalia  but both airlines denied those rumors    The low cost carriers are getting stronger  Alitalia is weak in Italy and Europe  is a tiny player in intercontinental traffic and has little money to invest   said Andrea Giuricin  a transport analyst at Milan s Bicocca university

195914,417430,DAL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  SkyWest  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes And Deutsche Lufthansa,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 12  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog includeSkyWest Inc    NASDAQ SKYW    Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes   NYSE GOL   and Deutsche Lufthansa  DE LHAG  Aktiengesellschaft   OTC DLAKY   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Clear Skies Ahead for Airlines  3 Stocks to Scoop UpIt seems that airline stocks are back in favor after facing multiple challenges for the greater part of 2017  Sector participants have been hampered by a number of headwinds like disruptions from back to back hurricanes  the devastating earthquake in Mexico  issues related to customer dissatisfaction and high costs  labor as well as fuel  The lackluster performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below  The chart clearly indicates that the  had underperformed the S P 500 Index in the above mentioned period  While the S P 500 index gained 11 9   the industry rallied 8 8  Airlines Laid Low in Q3It is a well documented fact that airline stocks struggled in the third quarter of 2017 due to the negative impacts of the recent natural calamities  Even though most sector heavyweights like Delta  Southwest  American and United Continental topped earnings estimates  the outperformance was primarily owing to the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate In this context  let s consider the case of American Airlines  In the third quarter  the consensus estimate for the carrier s earnings was pegged at  1 39  much lower than the year ago figure of  1 68  The conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate has made it easier for transportation companies to surpass them in the quarter In fact  higher costs led to a decline in quarterly earnings on a year over year basis for most carriers  thus revealing the sorry state of affairs for the sector  While the bottom line fell 7 6  and 5 4  at Delta and Southwest Airlines  respectively  at United Continental the metric was down 28 6   American Airlines also reported a significant reduction in earnings in the same time frame Moreover  multiple flight cancellations and continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the recent natural calamities hurt third quarter results  For example  United Continental s pre tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately  185 million Improved Unit Projections Hint at Brighter Q4Post hurricanes  things are looking up for stocks in the airline space  This is evident from the fact that major players in the sector like Southwest Airlines and United Continental issued improved unit revenue views for the fourth quarter on the back of buoyant demand for air travel and improving yields United Continental now expects fourth quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  in the band of down 2  to flat on a year over year basis  The projection compares favorably with the earlier view that the metric might drop in the band of 1  to 3  Southwest Airlines expects operating revenue per available seat miles  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  to increase between 1  and 2   earlier view had called for the metric to be up slightly to 1 5    in the final quarter of 2017  Hawaiian Holdings anticipates fourth quarter RASM to improve between 1 5  and 3 5   up from the previous view of down 1  to up 2  Dividends Buybacks Attest Solid Financial HealthFinancial prosperity of the sector participants is reflected in the fact that the likes of Southwest Airlines  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  and SkyWest Inc   SKYW  have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year Carriers have also indulged in share buybacks that substantiates their solid financial health yet again  For example  United Continental recently announced a new  3 billion share repurchase program  The company s previous  2 billion share repurchase program announced in July 2016 is expected to be completed by 2017 end In addition to the existing  100 million authorization  Hawaiian Holdings unveiled a new share repurchase program worth  100 million through Dec 31  2019 Notably  the robust financial health of most carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving flying experience for travellers  in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space Bullish ProjectionsOf late  the bullish projections revealed by the International Air Transport Association   IATA   and Airlines for America  A4A  for 2017 profitability and the upcoming winter holiday season  Dec 15 Jan 4   respectively  further highlights the optimism surrounding the space According to A4A  the winter holiday season is expected to be a busy one for U S  carriers  The organization expects 51 million passengers to opt for air travel during the period  reflecting a 3 5  increase from the 2016 figure An improving domestic economy and affordable air fares have resulted in the bullish forecast for this year  The rosy projection for the winter holiday period comes close on the heels of the robust performance of U S  carriers in the Thanksgiving holiday period Even on the global front  the picture seems to be a bright one for airlines  This is signified by the bullish projection issued by the IATA with respect to the profitability level for 2018  The research firm predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry  This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of  34 5 billion  increased from the  31 4 billion predicted in June  The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be  8 90 per passenger in 2018 compared with  8 45 in 2017  Additionally  the improved projection for full year 2017 by Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes  GOL  is indicative of the improving Latin American economy Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 47  out of 250 plus groups  carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads  The favorable rank places the companies in the top 18  of the Zacks industries We put our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Click here to know more  Airline Stocks Should Grace

195915,417431,DAL,Tax Optimism Lifts Stocks,opinion,"The mood was firmly risk on in the Asian session overnight  Investor optimism that Trump will score his first legislative victory since becoming President lifted stocks and is teeing up the markets for a strong Monday 
Tax reform bill progress Last week s concerns that the Republicans could struggle to achieve the majority vote that they need in the Senate have evaporated  as 11th hour wheeling and dealing appears to have brought two wavering Senators back onside  The House and Senate combined version of the US tax reform bill was published late Friday evening and is expected to be voted on this week  The bill could be implemented as early as February 
 Up until Friday s publication  the extent to which individual US firms would benefit from the tax reform bill was unclear  With the details now released  clear winners from the tax code will be US firms which have high tax rates and mainly US based revenues  So  the likes of banks  airlines and oil refineries are expected to be big beneficiaries  Names such as Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  appear to be in the running for a significant boost to earnings 
Valuations look supported Financials were big gainers in the Asian session  on the back of tax reform optimism and this could be expected to feed across to a stronger open for financials in Europe and the US  All year investors have been trying to assess the expected impact of the tax reform bill  which has resulted in the S P soaring 18  this year  Now with the details out  some firms are looking at a boost to earning per share in the region of 15  30   the previously viewed stretched valuations of US stocks are suddenly looking much more supported 
 Disappointment by the Fed last week was overshadowed by progress on the tax bill  which is keeping demand for the dollar solid  The dollar managed to book its third weekly gain versus the euro and is also looking comfortable close to 94 00 versus a basket of currencies 
Eurozone Inflation to tick higher The previous week saw the euro slip after the European Central Bank  ECB  unnerved investors with its weak inflation projections  despite significant uplift in economic growth  Today sees the release of inflation data for the bloc  Inflation  as measured by consumer price index  CPI  is expected to tick up to 1 5  in November  from 1 4  in October  with core inflation forecast to remain steady at 0 9   Should the figures disappoint  the euro could find itself heading southwards towards a strong support at  1 1715 
Brexit in focus as EU states No Special Deal for the UK In a sharp contrast to the political optimism in the US over the tax reform  politics in the UK could weigh on sentiment and see the pound test  1 33 versus the dollar  Prime Minister Theresa May is back in the UK with her cabinet  this week  with yet another row expected to kick off  This time the EU have said that the UK will not be able to strike a bespoke trade deal with Brussels  which will intensify the rift between the Cabinet Brexiteers and the Remainers 
 Today May will look for clarification over whether the UK will be able to sign up to new trade deals during the two year transition period post Brexit  Friday s refusal by the EU  saw the pound drop heavily  any clarification in favour of trade deals in this period could see the pound shake off some of its recent negativity

net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry  This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of  34 5 billion  increased from the  31 4 billion predicted in June   The bright projection despite increased costs can be attributed to the strong demand for air travel  The bulk of the global profits in 2018 is expected from the North American region   16 4 billion   The estimated figure is higher than  15 6 billion expected in 2017 Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4 7  in 2018 from 4 6  estimated in 2017  The top line is projected to come in at  824

departing passenger would be  8 90 per passenger in 2018 compared with  8 45 in 2017  The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 12 5  to  73 8 per barrel next year  Fuel bill is likely to account for 20 5  of total costs in 2018  18 8  in 2017  However  labor costs are likely to be higher  They are expected to account for 30 9  of total expenses in 2018  Total unit costs in 2018 are expected to grow 4 3   much higher than the 1 7  increase in 2017   Unit revenue growth for 2018 is projected at 3 5  5  According to A4A  the winter holiday season is expected to be a busy one for U S  carriers  Moreover  the organization expects 51 million passengers to opt for air travel during the period  reflecting a 3 5  increase from the 2016 figure  The forecast reflects an increase of 80 000 passengers per day from the comparable figure last year  Passenger volumes  on a daily basis  is projected to be in the range of 2 million to 2 7 million Notably  the busiest days for the holiday period are expected to be Dec 21  Dec 22 and Dec 26 while the lightest travel days are projected to be Dec 16  Christmas Eve  Christmas Day and New Year s Eve  To meet the surge in travel demand  U S  carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 91 000 per day  The bullish forecast was backed by an improving domestic economy and affordable air fares 6  Spirit

195949,417465,DAL,Exclusive  Delta s refinery sacrifices profits for lower fuel cost   memo,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK  Reuters    Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  is flooding the New York market with jet fuel from its refinery  sacrificing refining profits in order to lower the carrier s fuel costs  according to a company memo seen by Reuters     The memo  written by the head of Delta s Monroe Energy subsidiary  says the refinery will act against its own financial interest to try to maintain lower jet fuel prices and save the nation s second largest airline money on fuel  its top operating expense      The unusual move  in a unique situation  adds to long standing questions about Delta s decision to purchase the Philadelphia refinery in 2012  Critics have argued that the entire industry benefits from lower jet fuel prices  giving Delta no advantage over its competitors for owning the refinery   Jeff Warmann  who runs the refinery  told employees about the strategy in a July 27 memo  While weak jet fuel margins have hurt the refinery s bottom line  they have also resulted in lower fuel costs for parent company Delta  Warmann argued   Normally with such low product prices  a merchant refiner would shift yields and production to other products  We plan to continue to produce jet fuel and pump it into the New York market  pressuring the price of jet fuel to even lower levels   Warmann wrote   This negatively impacts our refinery economics  but greatly helps reduce Delta s fuel cost    The 182 000 barrel per day  bpd  refinery based in Trainer  Pennsylvania   about 10 miles  16 km  southwest of Philadelphia   produces roughly 40 000 bpd of jet fuel  accounting for roughly 30 percent of the New York Harbor market  experts say  The memo does not say how long it plans on running with this strategy  The New York Harbor market is the center of U S  jet fuel trading  SUBSIDIZING RIVALS   Ed Hirs  an energy economist at the University of Houston and longtime critic of the airline s decision to buy the refinery  said at those levels Delta could influence the prices of jet fuel  but noted that its competitors like Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc enjoy the benefit of those lower costs too  without the burden of running a refinery   They are using shareholder money to subsidize the other airlines   said Hirs  Warmann s memo said the strategy cost the refinery about  30 million in the second quarter  which left it with a  10 million loss for the period  but he said it saved Delta about  100 million   To put that in perspective  Delta reported net profit of more than  1 5 billion in the quarter  Its overall adjusted fuel expense fell  408 million from the same quarter the year before  in spite of  614 million in losses on fuel hedges  a remnant of when prices were much higher  The airline has no fuel hedges for the rest of the year  Three former commissioners of the U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  or CFTC  said in interviews with Reuters that Warmann s comments would likely catch the attention of regulators  but that it is not uncommon for energy companies to try to influence commodity prices  They said companies get into trouble when they manipulate commodity prices and take market positions intended to take advantage of their influence   Delta said the action was legal  and not manipulation   Delta has always said that the refinery is part of an integrated strategy aimed at managing our jet fuel costs  Ensuring supply and lowering fuel costs isn t manipulation  it s a natural consequence of owning the business  We are comfortable that our strategy is fully compliant with the law   a Delta spokesman said Tuesday  PRODUCTION CUT  In recent weeks  the refinery has cut production by nearly 25 percent to help trim high product inventories and weak margins  but nearly all of the cuts have been to gasoline and have not affected jet fuel output  a source told Reuters on Tuesday  East Coast inventories of jet fuel were at 9 2 million barrels last week  lower than at this time of year in the last five years  according to the U S  Department of Energy  Refining margins have been hurt by high inventories  causing some refiners to cut runs to trim stockpiles and boost profits  Spot jet fuel prices fell below  1 a gallon earlier this year  their lowest levels since 2009  according to the Energy Department  An executive at a rival East Coast refinery said on Tuesday that Delta may not be putting pressure on jet fuel prices at all  arguing the rising costs of renewable fuel credits  known as RINs  have played a much more important role in pressuring costs  The executive asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak publicly for the company   CREDITS  Refiners earn credits by blending biofuels like ethanol into gasoline and diesel or buying them in the open market  but jet fuel is exempt from the requirements   The credits averaged about 78 cents apiece in the second quarter of 2016  about 25 percent above the same period a year ago  Jet fuel has sold at a discount against the distillate benchmark price that is roughly equal to the credit price   Jet fuel s discount would be higher than the cost of renewable credits if Delta s strategy was successful  the executive argued    The reason jet is cheap isn t because of Delta  it s because of RINs pricing   the executive said   After profitable years in 2014 and 2015  Delta s refinery lost  10 million in the second quarter  following a loss of  18 million in the first quarter  and the company expects the refinery to lose money this year  
In the memo  Warmann said the combination of high product inventories and the disappearance of cheap domestic crude has conspired to make the third and fourth quarters  very challenging  ",2016-08-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-delta's-refinery-sacrifices-profits-for-lower-fuel-cost---memo-418134,418134

Budapest and Prague will be extra destinations on the airlines  travel route  The carrier currently offers flights connecting Venice from Philadelphia  Earlier in summer this year  the carrier started services to Amsterdam and Rome from Dallas Fort Worth and to Barcelona from Chicago  thus expanding its European presence  At present  American Airlines along with its joint business partners conducts nonstop flights to 23 European destinations from the United States  
This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has been making constant efforts to extend its global reach  To this end  the airline announced plans to purchase a minority stake in China Southern Airlines   NYSE ZNH   in March this year  The carrier has invested approximately  200 million in the Hong Kong listed shares of China Southern  
With this move  the airline seems to follow the likes of Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    which had similarly purchased a 3 55  stake in China Eastern Airlines   NYSE CEA   in 2015  You can see  
Notably  focus of the U S  carriers like American Airlines on the Chinese market is pretty logical  given the projection that China will be the  aviation market by 2024  thereby overtaking the United States

196005,417521,DAL,U S  airlines rethink hedges as oil plunges ,news,By Jeffrey Dastin NEW YORK  Reuters    The lowest fuel prices for more than a decade are proving to be a double edged sword for U S  airlines  While carriers saved hundreds of millions of dollars from oil prices halving since June  they forfeited a large chunk of that gain because of the fuel hedges they bought as protection against oil rising  The bulk of those hedges   which effectively lock in fuel costs in advance   are set at levels that force airlines to pay more for fuel than current market prices  turning them into a hindrance rather than a help  As a result  three of the four biggest carriers   Delta  Southwest and United   said this week they were rethinking their hedging tactics  Meanwhile American  which does not hedge fuel costs at all  is reaping the biggest savings   Southwest Airlines Co said on Thursday its outstanding hedges represented a loss of  1 8 billion through 2018  at Jan  15 prices  However  it still expects a fuel bill that is more than 30 cents per gallon lower this year compared to 2015  or a roughly half billion dollar net benefit  The budget airline has exited some contracts so that 30 percent to 35 percent of its fuel consumption in the second half of 2016 is covered by fuel hedges  down from 60 percent to 70 percent  its Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo said on an investor call  She did not say how much it paid to rid itself of the hedges   While our hedging philosophy has not changed  our tactics have in this environment   said Romo   We will focus on catastrophic protection with no downside risk   she added  referring to more expensive hedges that cap the price an airline will end up paying for fuel  Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  said on Tuesday it has exited hedge contracts for 2016 at a cost of  100 million to  200 million per quarter in order to pocket each dollar that fuel prices decline  It forecast savings at  3 billion this year    You could have made this call a while ago  The pain wouldn t have been so bad   aviation industry consultant Robert Mann said  noting oil oversupply is expected to continue as sanctions on Iran lift and the country pumps extra crude into the market  United Continental Holdings Inc has not added new hedges since July and is evaluating its hedging program structure  acting Chief Financial Officer Gerry Laderman said on the airline s investor call on Thursday  At the same time  United said the oil rout has hurt sales to energy clients near the airline s Houston hub  To make matters worse  lower fuel costs have given big carriers room to chop fares so that smaller  low cost rivals do not undercut them  leading to revenue draining price wars   The big winner is American Airlines Group Inc  The world s largest carrier said its fuel cost was between  1 48 and  1 53 per gallon in the fourth quarter because it has not hedged fuel at all   better than Delta  United and Southwest by some 30 cents or more ,2016-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-airlines-rethink-hedges-as-oil-plunges-381266,381266

196007,417523,DAL,Should Value Investors Consider Delta Air Lines  DAL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Delta Air Lines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 95  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 09  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Delta Air Lines  current PE ratio marginally above its midpoint  which is 9 85  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 18  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Delta Air Lines has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 01  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Delta Air Lines stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Delta Air Lines has a P S ratio of about 0 90  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Delta Air Lines currently has a Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DAL a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Delta Air Lines is just 0 79  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1 43  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Delta Air Lines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives DAL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days and two lower  while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by about 5 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 5 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Delta Air Lines  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDelta Air Lines is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  top 8  out of more than 250 industries  and top Zacks Rank  Delta Air Lines looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company

196015,417531,DAL,After half a century  U S  and Cuba to resume scheduled flights,news,"By Arshad Mohammed and Jeffrey Dastin WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    The United States and Cuba have agreed to restore scheduled commercial airline service for the first time in more than five decades in a deal allowing 110 round trip flights a day between the former Cold War foes  Announced a year to the day after the two countries embarked on a process of normalizing ties  the latest accord will not go into effect immediately but should eventually increase tourism and business on the communist ruled island  Under the pact  U S  airlines will be able to sell tickets on their websites for flights to Cuba but they must first apply for permission from U S  regulators to fly specific routes  Charter flights operated by U S  carriers already connect the countries  The United States and Cuba have agreed to allow 110 round trip flights on U S  airlines to Cuba per day  according to Thomas Engle  deputy assistant secretary for transportation affairs at the U S  State Department   That includes 20 flights to Havana and 10 to each of the other nine international airports in Cuba  he said  adding that no date has been set for final signing of the aviation pact but that nothing was expected to derail it  There will likely be a 60 to 90 day process during which U S  based air carriers will submit proposed routes  suggesting scheduled flights would not begin until the first few months of 2016 at the earliest  The decision to restore ties  made by U S  President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro a year ago  in part reflected Washington s judgment that its policy of isolating Havana politically  economically and diplomatically had failed  While U S  officials still criticize Cuba for human rights  they now believe promoting political and other freedoms is more likely to be achieved through engagement  Although the agreement will eventually make it easier to travel back and forth between the countries  the U S  ban on general tourism to the Caribbean island remains in force  U S  travelers still must meet at least one of 12 criteria to visit  such as visiting family in Cuba or taking part in educational tours or journalistic activity  STILL MANY U S  CUBAN DIFFERENCES  We continue to have differences with the Cuban government  but we raise those issues directly  and we will always stand for human rights and the universal values that we support around the globe   Obama said in a written statement  The United States broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961  two years after Fidel Castro ousted U S  backed dictator Fulgencio Batista in a revolution that steered the island on a leftist course and made it a close ally of the Soviet Union  Since last year s detente  the countries have restored diplomatic ties and reopened their embassies  Obama has also taken steps to encourage closer business ties with the island  However  the longstanding U S  trade embargo on the island remains in place and the United States  Republican controlled Congress has resisted Obama s calls to lift it  Cuba s human rights record still draws criticism from Washington  and Castro s government has made clear the diplomatic opening does not mean Havana plans to change its one party political system  SURGE IN TOURISM The large 110 round trip flights per day quota was negotiated in anticipation of an end to the tourism ban  and designed to encourage airlines to lobby Congress for access  said John Kavulich  president of the nonprofit U S  Cuba Trade and Economic Council  which promotes trade between the nations   This is as much a political document as it is a transportation document   he said   That s by design    Both countries are recognizing that the numbers need to be high so there s a heightened interest by the carriers to want the routes   Kavulich said a flood of U S  visitors might be  disruptive  to Cuba s one party political system  but stressed that the Cuban government needs the revenue  Cuba s embassy in Washington said in a statement on the airline deal that the countries reiterated their commitment to flight security and to protecting civil aviation  from acts of unlawful interference   Kavulich said this was likely a reference to the possibility that people with claims against Cuba might seek to seize Cuban assets in the United States and he suggested that the United States might do its best to protect such assets  Aircraft landing in the United States must meet U S  safety standards  so aging Russian planes in the Cuban fleet will likely only fly domestically within Cuba  Under the deal  airlines from both countries will be able to make commercial agreements such as sharing flight codes and leasing planes to each other  it said   New York based JetBlue Airways Corp  which already operates charter flights to the island  said it plans to apply to schedule service once it has reviewed the aviation deal  Other U S  airlines   American Airlines Group Inc  Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  and United Continental Holdings Inc   have expressed interest in scheduling flights to Cuba  American Airlines hopes to begin scheduled flights to Cuba between the beginning of April and the end of June  pending regulatory approval  vice president of regulatory affairs Howard Kass told

	Chicago  IL  July 19  2017   Stocks featured in this week s Zacks Industry Rank analysis include Air France  OTCMKTS       American  LON         Delta  NYSE        and Southwest  NYSE

Do Airline Stocks Have More Room to Run 

	A Midsummer Night s Dream  Time to travel to the lakes  the beach and the mountains  The Airline Transportation industry is what caught my attention in July 

	Zacks Industry Rank System put Airlines at  13 out of 265 industries we rank  That puts this 25 company strong group into the top 5  

	YTD returns have been  19 8   while the S P 500 offered  10 8   This spells out a nice share price outperformance  But can it continue 

Returns 

	Putting a share price bottom in July 2016  airline stocks soared across 2H 16 and 1H 17  led by two of the three biggest players  American Airlines and United Continental 

	Indeed  shares of American and United nearly doubled  Investors started to gain confidence unit revenue was ready to rise again  after two years of steady declines 

	Over the last three years  falling oil prices have helped airlines return to higher profits  ending a rough patch that saw many carriers file for bankruptcy 

	While the benefits to lower fuel prices are mostly priced in now  this industry group still offers investors good long term investment options 

	In July 2017  these fundamental supply conditions continue to make airlines a good bet  ongoing low fuel prices  low seat capacity and consolidation  On the demand side  investing in the airline industry is a way to capitalize on improved consumer balance sheets  too  Air travel leads GDP growth by a country mile 

	Global commercial airlines made record net profits in 2016 at about  35 billion  according to the International Air Travel Association  IATA   That s way up from nearly  14 billion in 2014    and about the same as in 2015  North American commercial airlines felt the upswing the most  with about  20 billion of that 2016 profit 

	Even Warren Buffett  who had been quite publicly averse to airline investments in the past  announced in fall 2016 his purchase of stakes in American  United  Delta  and Southwest 

	All four stocks continue to experience a nice momentum price run 

	To sum things up  investors have reason to continue to be bullish on air travel  But domestic commercial airlines multi month stock price run has some traders questioning whether enough future catalysts are left in the fundamental drivers   to get in now    and still achieve above average returns 

American  at  54 a share  for example  is back at the top of its stock price range  This price was last seen in the first half of 2015 

	And forthcoming IATA travel revenue data for 2017 may be lower  Read on for that story 

Risks

	The airline industry shoulders a lot of significant risks  Macro factors like sudden shifts in personal disposable income and spending patterns  safety concerns like terrorist attacks  oil price shocks and covering analyst sentiment    all of these can turn quickly  They weigh on airline profits 

	In addition  the USA  welcome mat  has been selectively removed from our airports  The world s tourists  more broadly  have taken notice 

	Executive Order 13769  titled  Protecting the Nation from Foreign Entry into the United States  was an executive order issued by U S  President Trump  It was in effect  except to the extent blocked by various courts  from January 27 th  2017  until March 16th  2017  when it was superseded by Executive Order 13780 

	Prior to March 2017  the time of the 2nd travel ban   an increase of  400 000 foreign visitors to the city in 2017  marking consecutive years of growth since the Great Recession of 2009 

	Forecasts made after the travel bans predicted a decline of 300 000 foreign visitors to New York in 2017  Foreign tourism nationwide mirrors New York City with a forecast change from a 4  increase in foreign travelers to the USA in 2017 now predicting a 3  decline 

	Once in the USA  foreign visitors spend about 4 times more per day than U S  resident travelers in the USA  These foreign visitors sustain about one million travel related jobs   This data is from CNN  

	An article in the Chicago Tribune on March 6th gave more data on the anticipated decline in foreign visitor arrivals to the USA 

		In March 2017  Los Angeles projected 800 000 fewer international tourists in the period 2017 2019 and a  736 million drop in spending 

		Miami Airport  the second largest number of international visitor arrivals next to New York  had seen a 52  decline in flight searches compared to 2016 according to Kayak co uk 

		San Francisco expected a 1 8  increase in foreign visitors in 2017  with a large increase in Chinese visitors expected to offset a decline in European tourists 

	Tourism Economics forecasts projected 4 3 million fewer visitors to the USA in 2017  with  7 4 billion in lost revenue 

	Let s see what actually happens  The U S  Supreme Court will hear arguments and write its opinion on the travel ban later this year or early next year 

	As to longer term risk management    going forward    look for order deferrals on large aircraft  This is not usually a good sign  on future demand at that particular airline 

My 4 Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Airline Picks

	 1  Air France  OTCMKTS       

	 2  American  LON       

	 3  Delta  NYSE       

	 4  Southwest  NYSE       

	Why these 4  Share price momentum is cleanly on  The long term Zacks VGM score is A  in all four cases  That s a  tell   There is more future growth to chase at a reasonable current stock price

196021,417537,DAL,Soaring Stocks In A High Flying Industry,opinion,"The internet never forgets and investors tend to have long memories as well   That is why I was hesitant to write about a sector that historically hasn t been so kind to investors  Of the 22 stocks in this industry  there are 9 that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  which has to be some kind of record 
Now before we go any further  know that this article doesn t come with any extra fees for bags   I won t eject you from this site and forcibly remove you from your seat  The delays you experience will be more about your computer or internet provider  although the Zacks website isn t the fastest    So buckle up and be aware that your closest exit might be behind you 
The Friendly Skies 
Lately  the friendly skies haven t been so friendly   Aside from the removal of passenger by force  there was a recent dust up from a conservative pundit   Selecting your seat seems to be the new way the airlines are using to drum up fees  but at the end of the day  higher fees often mean higher earnings 
Earnings estimates are the driving force behind the Zack Rank and with so many airlines getting positive estimate revisions we end of with the industry soaring the top 3  of all industries 
With 20  returns YTD for the group  let s take a look at a few of the high fliers 
Southwest
Southwest  LUV  is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has some great style score  with a B for value and an A for growth  The company has a so so record when it comes to a recent earnings history with two beats and two misses of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   That is a factor in the Zacks Rank  but not nearly as important as the number of positive revisions 
When I look at the agreement section of the detailed estimates page    all I see is a blizzard of positive estimate revisions in 7  30 and 60 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has moved from  3 76  to  3 90 over the last 90 days  At the same time the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 moved from  4 57 to  4 80 
LUV trades at 16x forward earnings and 18x trailing earnings   A price to sales multiple of 1 8x is also right in line with the industry average 
 Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  Price and Consensus    
I Am A Real American
When Hulk Hogan made his way to the squared circle  also known as the wrestling ring  his theme song had a chorus of  I am a real American   Hulk is strong and my leads ins are weak  but the earnings estimate revisions for American Airlines  AAL  have been strong 
AAL is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and I like this play a lot as it has a positive earnings ESP  This tells me that an analyst has very recently increased estimates over the consensus and analyst that do that with just a week or so before earnings are telling you they are confident in an upcoming beat   The logic is simple  the analyst that waits the longest to publish numbers or update their model has the most information on the quarter 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the coming quarter has been moving higher  The number has soared to  1 82 from  1 56 just 90 days ago  Along the way there were more than 17 earnings estimate revision to the upside   That is a lot of confidence in the quarter 
 American Airlines Group  Inc  Price and Consensus    
A Great Chart
In looking at the chart for the last three months I almost drooled on the keyboard   Deutsche Lufthansa  DE LHAG   DLAKY  is also a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that has an A for value and a D for growth 
I don t want to go too deep into this stock  but clearly  when a German airline is seeing positive estimate revisions as well as a number of our domestic airlines  you know you have a strong sector rotation at hand 
This stock has really soared since the start of the year and you can see on this chart how the earnings estimate revision have been the thrust beneath this stocks wings

YTD returns have been  19 8   while the S P 500 offered  10 8   This spells out a nice share price outperformance  But can it continue 
Returns 
Putting a share price bottom in July 2016  airline stocks soared across 2H 16 and 1H 17  led by two of the three biggest players  American Airlines  AAL  and United Continental  UAL  
Indeed  shares of American and United nearly doubled  Investors started to gain confidence unit revenue was ready to rise again  after two years of steady declines 
Over the last three years  falling oil prices have helped airlines return to higher profits  ending a rough patch that saw many carriers file for bankruptcy 
While the benefits to lower fuel prices are mostly priced in now  this industry group still offers investors good long term investment options 
In July 2017  these fundamental supply conditions continue to make airlines a good bet  ongoing low fuel prices  low seat capacity and consolidation  On the demand side  investing in the airline industry is a way to capitalize on improved consumer balance sheets  too  Air travel leads GDP growth by a country mile 
Global commercial airlines made record net profits in 2016 at about  35 billion  according to the International Air Travel Association  IATA   That s way up from nearly  14 billion in 2014    and about the same as in 2015  North American commercial airlines felt the upswing the most  with about  20 billion of that 2016 profit 
Even Warren Buffett  who had been quite publicly averse to airline investments in the past  announced in fall 2016 his purchase of stakes in American  United  Delta  DAL  and Southwest  LUV  
All four stocks continue to experience a nice momentum price run 
To sum things up  investors have reason to continue to be bullish on air travel  But domestic commercial airlines multi month stock price run has some traders questioning whether enough future catalysts are left in the fundamental drivers   to get in now    and still achieve above average returns 
American at  54 a share  for example  is back at the top of its stock price range  This price was last seen in the first half of 2015 
And forthcoming IATA travel revenue data for 2017 may be lower  Read on for that story 
Risks
The airline industry shoulders a lot of significant risks  Macro factors like sudden shifts in personal disposable income and spending patterns  safety concerns like terrorist attacks  oil price shocks and covering analyst sentiment    all of these can turn quickly  They weigh on airline profits 
In addition  the USA  welcome mat  has been selectively removed from our airports  The world s tourists  more broadly  have taken notice 
Executive Order 13769  titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Entry into the United States was an executive order issued by U S  President Trump  It was in effect  except to the extent blocked by various courts  from January 27th  2017  until March 16th  2017  when it was superseded by Executive Order 13780 
Prior to March 2017  the time of the 2nd travel ban   an increase of  400 000 foreign visitors to the city in 2017  marking consecutive years of growth since the Great Recession of 2009 
Forecasts made after the travel bans predicted a decline of 300 000 foreign visitors to New York in 2017  Foreign tourism nationwide mirrors New York City with a forecast change from a 4  increase in foreign travelers to the USA in 2017 now predicting a 3  decline 
Once in the USA  foreign visitors spend about 4 times more per day than U S  resident travelers in the USA  These foreign visitors sustain about one million travel related jobs   This data is from CNN  
An article in the Chicago Tribune on March 6th gave more data on the anticipated decline in foreign visitor arrivals to the USA In March 2017  Los Angeles projected 800 000 fewer international tourists in the period 2017 2019 and a  736 million drop in spending Miami Airport  the second largest number of international visitor arrivals next to New York  had seen a 52  decline in flight searches compared to 2016 according to Kayak co uk San Francisco expected a 1 8  increase in foreign visitors in 2017  with a large increase in Chinese visitors expected to offset a decline in European tourists Tourism Economics forecasts projected 4 3 million fewer visitors to the USA in 2017  with  7 4 billion in lost revenue 
Let s see what actually happens  The U S  Supreme Court will hear arguments and write its opinion on the travel ban later this year or early next year 
As to longer term risk management    going forward    look for order deferrals on large aircraft  This is not usually a good sign  on future demand at that particular airline

5 Airline Stocks to Take Off on Likely Q2 Earnings Beat 

	The Q2 earnings season is round the corner as far as stocks in the airline space are concerned  The Atlanta  GA based airline behemoth Delta Air Lines  will kick off the earnings season for airline players on Jul 13 

	On the back of multiple tailwinds  stocks in the space are expected to perform well in this earnings season  In fact  the entire transportation sector of which airlines are a part  is projected to come out with flying colors in Q2 
	The bright picture is corroborated by our latest  report  According to the report  the top and bottom lines for this key sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  are expected to expand 8 9  and 3   respectively  in Q2 on a year over year basis  In fact  the readings compare favorably to the figures in Q1 where transportation earnings contracted 17 8   while revenues grew at 6 9  
	As the airline stocks are back in favor despite some hiccups  they are largely responsible for the bright projection for the broader sector  The optimism surrounding airlines is well reflected by the fact that the Zacks categorized  industry has handily outperformed the S P 500 Index during the April   June timeframe  While the S P 500 Index has gained 3 3   the industry added 10 9  in Q2 Why the Surge 
	Issues related to unit revenues   a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier   had negatively impacted airline companies in the recent past  However  the revenue environment has improved as of late  This is reflected in the bullish Q2 unit revenue projections from the likes of American  JetBlue and Delta 
	Moreover  airline companies remain in excellent financial health  which has allowed them to indulge in employee friendly  profit sharing  and investor friendly activities  dividend payments buybacks   For example  the likes of Delta and Southwest hiked their dividend pay outs during Q2  Also  airlines are constantly making investments to modernize their fleet and improve the flying experience of passengers  courtesy their solid balance sheets 
	Additionally  oil prices were down approximately 9  in the April   June period  In fact  by Jun 21  crude had slumped in excess of 20  from its highs of  55 a barrel  touched in late February this year  In fact  lower oil prices mean good news for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures 
	Furthermore  the optimism surrounding airline stocks has not gone unnoticed by Warren Buffet  the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha increased his stakes in American Airlines and Southwest Airlines in the first quarter of 2017 by 8  and 10   respectively  The data is according to a regulatory filing by Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   The interest in airline stocks shown by one of the most revered investors of all time certainly also bodes well for the space Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Favorable Scenario
	The positive developments are reflected by the bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 9 carried by the 22 member Transportation  Airline industry  Also 50  of the stocks in the space are Buy  ranked 

	Notably  the favorable rank places the industry in the top 4  of the 250  groups  The positioning indicates a positive outlook  In fact  our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 

	Given the favorable backdrop  it is very much likely that airline stocks will have a strong showing in their Q2 results  Naturally  it is a prudent idea to add such stocks to one s portfolio for handsome returns How to Make the Right Choice 
	With the airline space being densely populated  the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one  The process is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack  unless one is aware of an appropriate method to make the right choice 
	One way to narrow down the list of choices is by looking at stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  alongside a positive   

	Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology to determine which stocks have the best chance to surprise in their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
	Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   An earnings beat boosts investor confidence in the stock  which is reflected in its rapid price appreciation  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

196062,417578,DAL,Delta Air Lines  DAL  Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 13  before the market opens 
The company has reported a positive earnings surprise of 5 48  in the last quarter  Besides  the carrier has an impressive earnings history  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3 01  
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Delta is likely to beat earnings this quarter as well  because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  1 83   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at  1 67  whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  1 64  A favourable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful  leading indicator for a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Delta currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Note that the stocks with Zacks Rank  1  2  Buy  or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Conversely  the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Delta s Zacks Rank  1 and  1 83  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat on Jul 13 
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Delta is expected to perform well in the second quarter  It has recently received good news with respect to passenger revenue per available seat miles  PRASM   The key metric has increased 2 5  on a year over year basis in Jun 2017 
Following the strong PRASM performance  the carrier expects the metric to grow approximately 2 5  in the second quarter  i e in the upper end of its previously guided range of 1 3   The company expects pre tax margin to be in the band of 18  19  in the second quarter  previous guidance was between 17 19   
We are appreciative of the company s efforts to enhance shareholders  wealth through dividends and share buybacks  At a meeting with analysts in May 2017  Delta had announced that its board of directors approved of a new share repurchase program worth  5 billion  Simultaneously  the company has hiked its quarterly dividend by over 50  to 30 5 cents per share 
The carrier s expansion efforts are also encouraging  For Delta has recently partnered with Grupo Aeromexico to boost its cargo operations across the United States and Mexico  It also entered into a joint venture with Korean Air Lines to create a leading trans Pacific joint venture connecting the U S  with Asia  The collaboration will offer an expanded network  industry leading products and services plus an enhanced customer experience to boot 
However  increasing costs are likely to hurt the bottom line growth in the second quarter of 2017  Cost per Available Seat Mile  including profit sharing  is anticipated to increase in the range of 6 8  in the second quarter  mainly due to higher labor costs   Delta Air Lines  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Other Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the broader transportation sector may also consider American Airlines Group  Inc    NASDAQ AAL    Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK   and Canadian National Railway Company   NYSE CNI    since our model shows that all these stocks possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their next releases 
American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of  3 51  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is expected to release second quarter 2017 results on Jul 28  You can see  
Alaska Air Group has an Earnings ESP of  2 04  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company will reveal second quarter 2017 financial numbers on Jul 26 
Canadian National Railway has an Earnings ESP of  1 03  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company will release second quarter 2017 earnings numbers on Jul 25

196066,417582,DAL,Some LaGuardia  JFK airport workers to strike starting Wednesday,news,"By Jeffrey Dastin
 Reuters    Some security workers and baggage handlers at New York s John F  Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports plan to strike starting on Wednesday night  their union said on Tuesday  potentially affecting travelers and airline operations 
Workers employed by Command Security Corp s subsidiary Aviation Safeguards  who also include wheelchair attendants  have voted to strike starting at 10 p m  Wednesday  the service workers union 32BJ SEIU said in a statement  They say the security services provider has threatened to fire them for organizing for higher wages and benefits 
Command Security s Chief Executive Officer Craig Coy told Reuters the allegations were false and denied the company is anti union 
 We have plans in place with our customers and the Port Authority  and we don t anticipate any significant airport operations disruptions   he said in a phone interview  referring to the agency that operates the two airports 
Coy said only 250 workers are expected to strike  although a union official said she expects some 1 200 to participate 
The union official said she does not know how long the strike will last  and does not expect regulators to intervene to halt it 
Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   which contracts Aviation Safeguards  according to the union  said it would be  taking measures to ensure that our more than 35 000 customers booked through LaGuardia on Thursday are not affected   United Continental Holdings Inc said it has contingency plans in place 
Delta could see a slight effect on revenue from the walkout if business travelers rebook to airlines less reliant on Aviation Safeguards  according to aviation industry consultant Robert Mann 
 It would be along the lines of a localized weather event   he said 
Still  Mann said the demands of lower wage workers could loom as a growing issue for the industry 
 Living wage is a huge issue at the level of the thousands of employees that do this sort of work   he said 
The union said in its statement that airport workers were struggling to survive even as  the airlines have been making record profits and the Port Authority has approved billions of dollars to modernize LaGuardia airport  
The Port Authority said in a statement that it  has taken significant steps in recent years to encourage wage and benefit increases for employees of airline contractors at its airports

Will New Cuba Travel Policy Hurt U S  Airlines 

	On Jun 16  President Trump announced some changes to current U S  policy on Cuba  which were put into action by his predecessor Barack Obama  The new policy is in line with Trump s promise during the campaigning phase  In fact  Trump had  tweeted in November last year that he might terminate the deal  inked by Obama  in the event of Cuba not doing enough for its people 

	Even though  he did not scrap the entire deal  the President announced certain changes in inline with his  America First  principle  Moving ahead  the new administration aims to restrict the flow of US money flowing into the oppressive Cuban military regime  Also  the new policy is dedicated to betterment of the Cuban people by pressurizing the island s government to broaden the private sector and reduce the military s interference in every profitable unit of the country 

	In fact  to keep the Cuban military at bay  the President s policy aims to do away with travel directed toward benefitting the military  intelligence or security services of the island nation  Under the new restrictions  travel to Cuba on an individual basis would not be allowed  Even though individual travel has been banned  group travel is allowed 

A Brief Flashback

	In 2014  President Obama had called for the restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba after more than 50 years  As part of that process  travel restrictions were eased  Subsequently  many U S  airlines started operating commercial scheduled flights to Cuba 

	In Jun 2016  the U S  Department of Transportation authorized six U S  based carriers to operate scheduled flights to nine second tier Cuban cities  The first scheduled commercial flight to Cuba from the U S  was operated by JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ          

	JetBlue Airways carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

	Notably  the approval to fly to Havana came two months later in August  The Havana routes were highly in demand among the US carriers as they collectively applied for the approval to operate nearly 60 flights to Havana on a daily basis  The erstwhile agreement with Obama allowed for only 20 daily roundtrip flights between the nations 

Would Individual Travel Ban Hurt Airlines  

	Currently  the likes of American Airlines Group  NASDAQ           Delta Air Lines  NYSE          and Southwest Airlines  NYSE          operate scheduled commercial flights to Cuba  But following the revised order on Cuba  the carriers have adopted a wait and watch policy regarding their operations to the nation 

	Airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have  said that while their existing operations to the nation would continue  they would abide by any changes that might take place following the announcement of the new policy 

	We note that the travel demand to Cuba had fallen short of expectations  Consequently  the likes of American Airlines trimmed their services to the nation  Lower than expected demand also caused the likes of Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ         and Frontier Airlines to terminate flights there  Despite this factor  the new policy to ban individual travel is likely to hurt the top line of the US carriers operating in the country to some extent 

	In fact  a recent Reuters report had suggested that cruise operators and airlines in the US could lose approximately  in revenues on an annual basis  if Obama s policy was entirely reversed  While the entire policy has not been consigned to flames by the new US government  the prohibition on individual travel to the country might still shrink the revenues of carriers  through lower travel demand  operating in Cuba  a popular tourist destination 

	However  only time will tell the extent to which revenues are actually hurt  Consequently  we expect investor focus to remain on the issue  going forward

Airline Stocks Flying High on Multiple Tailwinds  4 Picks

	Stocks in the airline space are having a good time and are certainly back in favor  despite some challenges  Lets us delve deep to find out the factors behind the change in fortunes of airline stocks 

Improvement in Unit Revenue

	Issues like unit revenue woes which had plagued airlines in the previous year seem to be a thing of the past  This is because the scenario regarding this key metric   a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier   has been improving steadily 

	In fact  carriers like American Airlines Group  NASDAQ          and JetBlue Airways Corp  have unveiled bullish unit revenue forecasts for the second quarter of 2017  JetBlue has also said that the scenario for revenue per available seat miles  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  is expected to vastly improve for the third quarter as well 

	In addition  JetBlue received encouraging news lately when Moody s Investors Service  the rating services arm of Moody s Corp   upgraded the Corporate Family Rating for the carrier to  Ba1  from  Ba3   The firm is impressed by the carrier s strong balance sheet and efforts to deepen focus on its popular Mint service among other factors 

Impressive Balance Sheets

	Moreover  the fact that airlines are in solid financial health can be made out from their employee as well as investor friendly moves  To this end Delta Air Lines  NYSE          and Southwest Airlines  NYSE          have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year  Moreover  they have also shelled out significant amounts to their employees as part of their respective profit sharing schemes 

	Additionally  the robust financial health of most domestic carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving the flying experience for travelers  in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space 

Fall in Oil Prices  A Boon for Carriers

	The recent decline in oil prices bring in further good news for airlines as fuel costs represent a significant portion of their operating expenses  Currently  oil price is hovering around the  40 a barrel mark which represents a significant decline from the levels at the start of the year 

	In fact  crude has lost over 20  on a year to date basis  It is to be noted that lower the oil prices better it is for the carriers  bottom line  Therefore  a sharp decline in oil prices implies that stocks in the airline space will continue to make huge savings thereby bolstering their balance sheets

Airline Stock Roundup  IATA Lifts  17 Profit View  United Continental Calls Off Venezuela Flights 

	The last week was dominated by updates from the International Air Transport Association  IATA   The monthly data released by the IATA revealed a 10 7  year over year increase in demand for air travel across the globe for April 2017  Healthy growth in both international and domestic traffic resulted in a rise in the overall figure 

	Another significant update from the trade association emerged recently when it raised its 2017 profitability outlook for the airline industry to  31 4 billion from the earlier forecast of  29 8 billion  Higher passenger and cargo demand primarily drove the increase in outlook  The bulk of the global profits   15 4 billion  are expected to come from the North American region 

	The IATA updates apart  the Atlanta  GA based airline behemothDelta Air Lines  NYSE          was in the news by virtue of its encouraging May traffic report  The Chicago  IL based United Continental Holdings  NYSE          also grabbed headlines as it has  decided to stop flying to Venezuela from next month due to lack luster demand 

	An expansion related update from Southwest Airlines  NYSE          also gained attention over the past week

	The improved demand scenario is anticipated to result in 4 1 billion passengers taking to the skies in 2017  275 million passengers more than 2016 levels   In the event of this forecast coming true  2017 would witness the highest year over year growth  Read more

	Despite the healthy rise  the ban imposed earlier this year on carrying large portable electronic devices on U S  bound flights from 10 Middle Eastern and African airports appeared to hurt traffic on the Middle East US route  On the other hand  demand for domestic travel climbed 7 7   with growth witnessed in all markets save Australia 

	2  Delta s May traffic   measured in revenue passenger miles  RPMs    improved 1 7  and capacity remained flat on a year over year basis  Consolidated load factor  or percentage of seats filled by passengers  improved 140 basis points to 86 7   This is because traffic expanded while capacity remained flat in the month leading to packed planes  Read more     

	3  Hawaiian Airlines  the wholly owned subsidiary ofHawaiian Holdings  NASDAQ           reported healthy traffic numbers for May  Traffic climbed 8  on a 5  rise in capacity  The greater increase in traffic compared with capacity led to a 240 basis points increase in load factor to 86 7  

	Operating revenue per available seat mile in the second quarter of 2017 is now projected to grow in the band of 7 5  to 10 5   the previous projection had called for a rise of 5 5  to 8 5    The revision was due to better than expected yields primarily in the domestic market among other factors  Fuel cost per gallon  economic  is now projected in the band of  1 6 to  1 7   1 65  1 75 projected previously  

	Hawaiian Holdings sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

	5  Southwest Airlines has begun flight service at Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport  CVG  in a bid to expand  Following this  the carrier offers a total of eight daily nonstop flights  five between CVG and Chicago Midway and three between CVG and Baltimore Washington International Airport  Read more

High Costs Distorted Q1 Earnings Picture

	With labor deals in vogue in the aviation space  labor costs have been on the rise  In the recently concluded Q1 earnings season  growth on the bottom line front was hardly visible for airlines due to high costs  For example  Q1 earnings at Delta Air Lines  NYSE        contracted 41 7  on a year over year basis due to higher costs  At Southwest Airlines  NYSE         the bottom line declined 30 7  year over year 

	Apart from this  fuel costs increased and resulted in bottom line contraction  For example  at American Airlines Group  NASDAQ         total operating expenses climbed 11 4  year over year to  9 billion primarily due to the rise in fuel costs 

	In fact  American Airlines  shares fell on Apr 27  despite better than expected earnings and revenues in Q1  due to its announcement to hike wages of its pilots and flight attendants to match industry leading standards  As a result  American Airlines is likely to see an increase of approximately  230 million in salary and benefit expenses in 2017  and  350 million in each of the following two years 

Repetition Likely in Q2

	Increased costs are expected to hurt the bottom line of carriers in the second quarter too  United Continental Holdings  NYSE        expects unit costs to increase in the band of 4 5  from higher labor costs 

	United Continental carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   

	Hawaiian Holdings  NASDAQ        expects cost per available seat mile  CASM   excluding fuel and special items  to increase in the band of 4 5  to 7 5   mainly due to the sixty three month pay related deal cleared by its pilots in Mar 2017  Fuel cost per gallon is expected in the band of  1 60 to  1 70  which is higher than  1 55 recorded in the second quarter of 2016 

Higher Costs to Hurt Bottom Line

	The International Air Transport Association  IATA  expects 2017 global net profit for the industry to decline 9 8  year over year to  31 4 billion   Average oil price for 2017 is expected to be  54 per barrel for Brent Crude  the comparable figure in 2016 was  44 6 per barrel   With most airlines  including heavyweights in the U S  aviation space inking labor deals  it is of little surprise that labor costs are surging  IATA expects unit labor costs to increase approximately 3  in 2017 

	The research firm has also predicted that airline companies will earn  7 69 per passenger in 2017 compared with  9 1 in 2016  Global net profit margin is expected to decline to 4 2  in 2017 from 4 9  a year ago 

Customer Related Issues

	The passenger dragging incident at United Airlines  the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental  on Apr 9  drew flak from across the globe  resulting in multiple apologies from the company 

	As a fallout of the incident  United Airlines  CEO Oscar Munoz is now no longer guaranteed to be the company s chairman in 2018 

	Another legacy carrier  American Airlines  also found itself in the middle of a passenger fiasco a few days later     a female passenger on one of American Airlines flights was seen crying in a video  uploaded on social media by a fellow passenger  following an ugly altercation with one of the flight attendants  The attendant reportedly hit her with her baby s stroller  The female passenger was subsequently escorted off the flight  The errant male flight attendant was  removed from duty

196112,417628,DAL,Will Delta Air Lines  DAL  Make A Suitable Value Pick  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Delta Air Lines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 13  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 89  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Delta Air Lines  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past three years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Transportation  Airline industry trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 35  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Delta Air Lines has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 27  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  DAL has a P S ratio of about 0 89  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 08 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Delta Air Lines currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Delta Air Lines a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Delta Air Lines is just 0 78  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 19  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Delta Air Lines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives DAL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimate has been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three upward and one downward estimate revisions in the past 30 days  while the current year has seen four upward and one downward estimate revision in the same time frame As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has moved up by 1 3  in the past one month  while the current year estimate has inched higher by 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Delta Air Lines  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDelta Air Lines is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front  Further  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the top 21   out of more than 250 industries   indicating that broader factors are favorable for the company  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Transportation  Airline industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  2017 IPO Watch List Before looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four

196137,417653,DAL,Exclusive   U S  airlines confront cheap oil s flip side  costly hedges,news,"By Catherine Ngai and Jeffrey Dastin  NEW YORK  Reuters    Some major U S  airlines including Delta and Southwest are rushing to finance losing bets on oil and revamp fuel hedges as tumbling crude prices leave them with billions of dollars in losses  according to people familiar with the hedging schemes   In theory  airlines are among the top beneficiaries of a six month slump that halved crude prices to five year lows  Oil is the biggest variable cost for airlines  often representing a third or more of their total operating expenses   But now  carriers such as Delta Air Lines and even Southwest Airlines  known for a successful hedging program that locked in cheap fuel prices before they rose a decade ago  see some of the benefits of cheap fuel eaten away by hedging costs   That is largely because they have used common but risky hedging strategies  among them a  costless collar   selling financial options that pay off when oil prices fall and using the proceeds to buy protection against soaring costs when prices climb  according to three people familiar with the programs   The two carriers have been moving quickly to strategise how to meet demands from brokers and banks for additional collateral to cover potential losses from a strategy that made perfect sense just six months ago  those people said  The airlines have also held a series of meetings that included airline executives  brokers and consultants  according to the people  who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the discussions   With oil prices tumbling faster and further than anyone had anticipated  the collar hedges left the airlines with insurance against high costs they no longer need and on the hook for protection they sold against a further slide  with potential liabilities on the rise   Southwest spokesman Chris Mainz said the meetings were part of a routine  although a rapidly changing market called for close attention    We continue to benefit from declining fuel prices   Mainz said in an email   Obviously we re going to move faster when the price drops in the 40 percent range   Our fuel team  have been very busy actively managing our portfolio to respond to the changes we are seeing in the market    Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said the Atlanta based carrier was not surprised by the slide  having been prepared to meet its financial obligations if needed   BOON TO RIVALS  Southwest  Delta and other carriers that sources declined to name  will benefit from the drop in oil prices because they hedge only a portion of the fuel they buy  Southwest  for example  expects to cover only 20 percent of its fuel consumption with hedge contracts this quarter    Delta expects a  1 7 billion gain from lower fuel prices in 2015  despite  1 2 billion in estimated hedge losses   Yet rival American Airlines  which has not entered any hedge contracts since late 2013  are set to see a greater boost to their bottom lines   Industry consultants say hedged airlines have a few choices to deal with the price slide  including selling forward positions on crude oil or jet fuel  changing the prices at which they hedge or selling assets  such as planes   What airlines exactly plan to do remains unclear  people familiar with the discussions said   A lack of disclosure requirements makes it almost impossible to tell how or when airlines have hedged  and none would discuss details of their strategies   Collar transactions looked well suited to the market when prices hovered around  100 per barrel for most of the past four years  allowing airlines to cap their fuel costs at little or no cost  analysts said     Costless  collars are an effective strategy that works best when prices stay within a range   said John Saucer  vice president of research and analysis  at Mobius Risk Group   But it becomes a very different animal when the market goes against that     In their October quarterly filings  Southwest and Delta said they used a mix of options and fixed price swaps   Southwest also explained that collar trades  carry more risk than purchased call options  because of possibly greater liability when the contracts expire   The world s biggest low cost carrier said that a 25 percent decline of crude prices from Sept  30 would probably force it to pay  615 million in cash collateral  aircraft collateral and letters of credit    Delta said it would pay  800 million to counterparties if oil fell 20 percent between Oct  1  2014 and Dec  31  2015  Brent already has tumbled 36 percent since then to trade at about  60 a barrel on Monday   These hedges weigh on the costs of their future fuel consumption  too   At current prices  Southwest says it expects to keep only about 80 cents of savings for every  1 in oil price decline  while Delta puts this figure at about 65 cents  American instead will reap the full benefit of cheap fuel

196138,417654,DAL,Exclusive  Mexico s light crude  shunned for U S  shale  sails east,news,By Jarrett Renshaw  NEW YORK  Reuters    Mexican crude oil is sailing to the U S  East Coast at the highest rate in over a decade  according to customs data reviewed by Reuters  in a sign deepening discounts help crack open new markets as domestic shale inundates Texas   Delta Air Lines owned Monroe Energy received nearly 500 000 barrels of light sour Mexican crude in September and a similar cargo in October at its 185 000 barrel per day refinery in Trainer  Pennsylvania  according to U S  Energy Information Administration data  It was the refiner s first imports from Mexico since 2009  the furthest the data go back   Monroe has received two more shipments of Olmeca crude from Pajaritos  Mexico since then  totaling some 1 million barrels  according to customs data reviewed by Reuters and available via ThomsonReuters Eikon s Crude Oil Flows system   The recurring deliveries  the most recent on Dec  11  suggest a new term contract with Monroe  industry sources say   Together with separate sales of heavy and medium crude to two plants run by PBF Energy Inc  shipments of Mexican crude to the East Coast hit 38 200 barrels per day  the highest since 2004  according to the EIA figures  That represents about 3 4 percent of Mexico s total crude exports    The new flows  which have not been previously reported  are the latest evidence of how the U S  shale boom is changing global oil trading patterns and forcing foreign suppliers once dependent on the U S  Gulf Coast market to seek out new customers   often by offering hefty discounts   This is especially true for Mexico s relatively higher value Olmeca crude  Though more  sour  or high in sulfur  Olmeca competes with light  sweet U S  shale oil and has been pushed out of the Gulf Coast by similar grades of domestic crude    This is the cascade to the bottom  There s a lot of crude  and not enough demand   said Sarah Emerson  president of Energy Security Analysis   With Gulf Coast refineries backing out of Olmeca  Mexico needs to find new buyers    She added that Brent crude  the global benchmark used by Mexico  has been competitive with WTI  the U S  benchmark   While Mexico s heavier Mayan crude has retained most of its U S  Gulf Coast customers  the state oil firm Pemex has been forced to look for new buyers of Olmeca   The sales also mark the arrival of a new competitor in the East Coast market  now dominated by domestic producers   Finally  the sales also represent a change of strategy at Monroe Energy  which has built up its trading desk and taken control over more of its crude oil sourcing this year   This summer it hired Hugo Zagaria  a veteran trader with deep ties to Latin American producers  a move industry sources say likely explains the deal with Mexico   Pemex officials did not return requests for comments  Monroe Energy spokesman Adam Gattuso said the company  always pursues high quality  competitively crude   but declined to say whether the purchases were part of an ongoing contract    UNUSUAL DEAL  The arrival of Mexican crude on East Coast shores is not unusual as such  but aspects of the Monroe deal are   For instance  The refinery has bought high sulfur oil similar to Olmeca only occasionally over the past four years  according to EIA data  Officials familiar with the refinery say such crude must be blended before it is processed because the refinery is not equipped to handle high sulfur grades   And while PBF Energy has been receiving regular shipments of Mexican crude at its New Jersey and Delaware plants  it was only buying medium or heavy density grades that compete with Venezuelan or Saudi oil rather than with light U S  shale oil   Like other Philadelphia area refineries  Monroe relies largely on Bakken shale oil  which must be trekked nearly 2 000 miles by rail from North Dakota at a cost of some  14 per barrel  or ships similar crude from Texas aboard special U S  flagged tankers for approximately  6 per barrel   However  congested rail lines have caused delivery delays and production cuts at Monroe  forcing refiners to continue buying some oil from overseas producers such as Nigeria and Norway  data show   Now Mexico is making inroads  offering both cheaper transport   shipping from Mexico to the East Coast on a foreign flagged tanker costs just around  2 per barrel   and deep discounts    In January  its Olmeca crude  OSP O  will be sold in Europe at a  4 05 below Atlantic basin benchmark Brent  the biggest discount this year  It is unclear what terms were agreed with Monroe    Mexico is in a position where it needs to find new customers  and if it needs to discount its crude to compete with U S  domestic crude in order to build new relationships  it will do it    said John Auers  executive vice president at Dallas based Turner Mason   Co  an energy consulting firm   Olmeca represents less than a tenth of Mexico s sales  but it has been the hardest hit by soaring U S  crude oil production  with mainstay customers turning elsewhere   For example  in February 2012 two large ExxonMobil refineries in Texas   Baytown and Beaumont   were buying more than 200 000 bpd of light Mexican crude  accounting for the lion s share of U S  imports  EIA data show   In the first nine months of this year  the two plants have imported only 8 000 barrels a day  according to federal data       Additional reporting by David Alire Garcia in Mexico City  editing by Jonathan Leff and Tomasz Janowski

196141,417657,DAL,Using Options To Supercharge Airline Stock Returns,opinion,"LEDE

The airline stock prices have not all participated in the bull market  but using options to invest in the idea that the stocks  won t go down a lot   has in fact been a massive winner  and as important  has revealed the gem all option traders seek    edge  

PREFACE

We can start with a two year stock return chart for four airlines 

Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  is the company we will focus on today   it s in red 



While Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  stock is up about 9  over the last two years  we can also see that American Airlines Group Inc  NYSE AAL  is actually down 13   while United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL  is up 17  and Southwest Airlines Co  NYSE LUV  is up 30  

But  the real analysis starts when we look at the option market 

Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL 

Selling a put is in fact an investment strategy that benefits from the stock  not going down a lot   And while that sounds tame  if not boring  it has been far from that  Here is what selling an out of the money put has returned in Delta Airlines over the last 3 years 



That s a 105  return while the stock was up just 37   Further  the strategy showed 32 winning trades and 7 losing trades  for a win rate of 82   and that brings us to a critical point 

If a trade wins more often than the probability that is priced in  it has edge 

Here is that same thought process  but in English  A 30 delta  out of the money  put should end up in the money about 30  of the time  delta is roughly a measure of probability   In other words  if we sold a 30 delta put  we would expect that we could have a winner 70  of the time 

EDGE

If we can find an option strategy that has a 30 delta  but if selling it wins more than 70  of the time with a positive return  then we have edge  This is exactly what we found with Delta Airlines over three years 

CONSISTENT

Skepticism is natural   what we need to do now is look at this short put over various time periods  We see that it has worked over the last three years  now let s look at the last two years 



That s a 65 7  return while the stock itself has been up just 9   and again we see a win rate above the 70  we would expect with a 30 delta option 

It s not a magic bullet   it s just easy access to objective data 

Finally  we look at this short put over the last six months  these are the results 



That s a 27 4  return while the stock has been up just 16    and again   the 85 7  win rate is larger than the 70  the option market was pricing in 

WHAT JUST HAPPENED

This is how people profit from the option market   it s preparation and edge discovery  not luck 

To see how to do this for any stock or ETF and for any strategy  with just the click of a few buttons  we welcome you to watch this 4 minute demonstration video

Delta expects key PRASM metrics to drop 2 5 3  for the December quarter which compares favorably to initial reports of a 3 5  decline guided in October
Moving forward  Delta must balance rising fuel costs and ticket prices in order retain market share from discount airlines
Delta kicks off earnings season for the airlines with its scheduled fourth quarter report taking place Thursday morning  Major airlines bounced back in the second half of 2016 by offering deeper discounts and a broader recovery in the travel industry  With all indications pointing to strong travel during the holiday months  Delta looks poised to close fiscal 2016 on a strong note 
The Estimize community is calling for earnings per share of 84 cents  26  lower than the same period last year  That estimate has edged lower 32  in the past 3 months  Revenue for the period is forecasted to drop by 2  to  9 34 billion  reflecting a slight improvement from a 6  decline in the third quarter 
Despite weak comparisons  Delta stock typically thrives during earnings season  Immediately through an earnings report shares tend to rise by 1  and continue upwards about 5  in the month following  At the moment shares are up about 30  in the past 3 months from increased optimism 

In an investor update on January 4  2017  Delta indicated that Q4 metrics outpaced guidance deliver in October  Passenger unit revenue  or PRASM  for the December quarter is expected to drop between 2 5 3 0   which compares favorably to initial reports of a 3 5  decline  Average seat miles also saw a significant uptake  increasing 1 5  from a year earlier  A large portion of the increase was credited to strong demand trends  improving domestic yields and more efficient revenue management strategies 
Moving forward  Delta still faces a number of near term headwinds  Discounters remain the number one threat to major airlines especially as fuel costs start to increase in the coming months  Expect names like Southwest and JetBlue to capture greater market share as Delta struggles to balance increasing fuel costs with low ticket prices ",2017-01-12,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-weak-q4-results-end-delta’s-late-surge-200172187,200172187

The highly anticipated launch of the so called revamped A330 depends on the response of airlines and lessors that are being courted just days before next week s event  Still  the company seems to be securing at least two buyers  the sources

 I think the A330neo will be launched at Farnborough  and if not  it won t be long in coming   said a senior industry source 
Future clients could include Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   which is shopping for as many as 50 jets  and Airasia  KL AIRA   which is seeking an A330 upgrade  as well as lessors that have expressed support including Air Lease Corp  NYSE AL  and CIT  Reuters added 

Delta is widely considered most likely to weigh bids from Airbus and rival Boeing later this year 
In June  Reuters reported that Airbus was poised to launch the new version of  the A330 with Rolls Royce as sole engine supplier  but subject to approval from the company s board 
The aircraft will be offered in two versions similar to the two current 253 seat and 295 seat models and offer some 14 15 percent increased efficiency than the existing model

196160,417676,DAL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  American Airlines Group  JetBlue Airways  Delta Air Lines  United Continental Holdings And Southwest Airlines,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   November 30  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include American Airlines Group Inc   NASDAQ     JetBlue Airways Corp   NASDAQ     Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   NYSE     United Continental Holdings  NYSE     and Southwest Airlines Co   NYSE      

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

 

	A 50 year wait comes to an end  with U S  carriers American Airlines Group Inc   NASDAQ      and JetBlue Airways Corp   NASDAQ      commencing flights to Havana  Cuba  American Airlines was the first U S  carrier to operate a commercial flight to the Cuban capital in over five decades  followed by JetBlue  The American Airlines flight was from Miami  while the JetBlue flight took off from New York s John F  Kennedy International Airport  Both flights have already landed in Havana 

Launch Coincides with Cuba Mourning Fidel Castro

	The commencement of direct flights to Havana comes at a time when Cuba is mourning the death of its former leader  Fidel Castro  We remind investors that diplomatic ties between the nations were severed by the U S  in 1961 after Fidel Castro overthrew the Cuban government to set up a socialist state and in the process started to establish strong relations with the erstwhile Soviet Union  In late 2014  President Obama called for the restoration of diplomatic ties with the nation after consulting his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro  Fidel Castro s brother  

	U S  flights to other Cuban cities are already in operation  following the decision of the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  to authorize six U S  based carriers to operate scheduled flights to nine second tier Cuban cities  After the announcement in June this year  the first commercial flight to Cuba from the U S  was operated by JetBlue 

Havana Approval

	However  the approval to fly to Havana came two months later   in August  The Havana routes were highly in demand among U S  carriers as they collectively applied for the approval to operate nearly 60 flights to Havana on a daily basis  The agreement allowed for only 20 daily roundtrip flights between the nations 

	On Aug 31  the U S  DOT granted approval to eight carriers  including American  JetBlue  Delta Air Lines  NYSE       United Continental Holdings  NYSE      and Southwest Airlines Co   NYSE        to operate direct flights to Havana  American Airlines was the biggest winner as the carrier gained approval to operate 35 weekly flights  All the above mentioned publicly traded carriers carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

	With American Airlines and JetBlue having already commenced flights to Cuba  the other carriers are expected to follow suit  The top line of carriers should benefit significantly from operations to the new destination as Havana is a favorite tourist spot 



The Trump Impact

	Despite the optimism surrounding the move  it remains to be seen what stance President elect Donald Trump takes for Cuba  when he assumes office in January 

	In fact  a report appearing on the  mentioned that the President elect recently tweeted that he may terminate the deal in the event of Cuba not doing enough for its people  Hence  the U S  carriers are expected to chalk out schemes to ensure that the deal remains intact 

	We expect investor focus to remain on this burning issue going forward

196164,417680,DAL,Delta s Q4 EPS Soaring By 125   Lower Fuel Costs Help,news,"By    Delta Air Lines  Inc   NYSE DAL   the world s second largest airline  is expected to report a 125 4 percent increase in earnings per share as lower fuel costs and growth in its domestic demand  offset falling performance in its Pacific segment  
The Atlanta based company will report fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday before the market opens  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect  on average  Delta s net income to rise 119 percent to  521 million from  1 1 billion in the year earlier quarter  while earnings per share  EPS  are seen soaring to 63 cents from 28 cents a year earlier 
Revenue is projected to rise 5 percent to  9 03 billion from  8 6 billion the year 
In December the company said it expects fourth quarter operating profit margin to be up from the year earlier quarter s 5 percent to a range of 8 percent to 9 percent 

Delta reported Jan  3 that its December passenger revenue per available seat mile rose 10 percent  driven by continuing strong demand and benefits from the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday  which included more December flying than in the preview holiday season 
 We think DAL is likely to maintain a revenue premium to peers   said Jim Corridore  S P Capital IQ Analysts   Its December unit revenue growth of 10  was aided by a shift in Thanksgiving travel into December  but was well ahead of our expectations  We see DAL as best in class among U S  airlines   said Corridore
Delta s benefitted from a fourth quarter drop in crude oil prices  which declined from  116 per barrel at the end of the third quarter to around  106 at the end of the fourth quarter  In addition  the price per gallon of jet fuel went from  3 05 in September to  2 77 in November  the lowest of the year  according to the Bureau Of Transportation Statistics 
Further  the airline s fuel costs were cut because it produces its own et fuel at the Trainer  Pa   refinery it bought from Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  in 2012 
The company also benefitted from beginning to use the fuel efficient Boeing Company s  NYSE BA  717 200 jet during the fourth quarter 
Delta will also gain from a reversal of its tax valuation allowance 
 With the reversal of the tax valuation allowance  the company expects to record a non cash net gain of approximately  8 5 billion in the December quarter  which will be treated as a special item   Delta said last month 
For all of 2013  Delta expects to record a record  2 6 billion in pretax profit  a 70 percent increase over 2012  with 2 7 points of pretax profit margin expansion ",2014-01-20,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/delta's-q4-eps-soaring-by-125,-lower-fuel-costs-help-261206",261206

It was recently revealed that Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  bought shares in 4 airline stocks 
This was shocking because Buffett has railed against the airline stocks for decades  He first bought into the industry in 1989 when he invested in US Airways and it did not end well  He has been so anti airline over the years he has called them  death traps  for investors

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Warren Buffett Bets on 4 U S  Airline Carriers   Should You 

	The tide seems to be turning for the airlines sector as Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  recently bought stakes in four major U S  carriers   American Airlines Group  NASDAQ      and United Continental Holdings Inc   NYSE       The move naturally found favor with investors since Buffett  the founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway  is commonly regarded as one of the greatest  if not the greatest  investors of all time 

	According to the Omaha  NE based company s third quarter 13 F filing  Buffet has invested in Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   American Airlines and United Continental  The fact that the iconic investor has also betted on low cost carrier Southwest Airlines was revealed via a  

Unexpected Move

	The move has come as a complete surprise since Buffett historically did not favor airline stocks  According to media reports  his last involvement with the airlines sector was way back in the 1980s when he invested in U S  Airways  The experience was anything but sweet and consequently Buffet turned his back on airlines 

	He was so disgruntled with the sector that he once said that  it has eaten up capital over the past century like almost no other business   No doubt his move to buy stakes in major U S  airline stocks was completely unexpected and consequently has attracted a lot of attention 

	The move is all the more surprising since it comes at a time when carriers are facing multiple headwinds like declining air fare  low demand for travel due to security fears  technological problems and Brexit induced uncertainty to name a few 

Recent Tailwinds

	Despite being plagued by headwinds  the third quarter  which recently concluded for airline stocks  did see quite a few airline players including the four in which Buffett has put his money on  reporting better than expected earnings per share   though undoubtedly aided by low expectations 

	In fact  carriers like United Continental Holdings  American Airlines  Alaska Air Group  NYSE      and SkyWest  Inc   NASDAQ        have not only topped earnings expectations but have also outperformed in terms of revenues  In fact  SkyWest s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  bears evidence of the improving condition  You can see    The better than expected third quarter performance can be gauged by the 9 2  gain the NYSE ARCA Airline Index over the last one month 



	Moreover  woes related to unit revenues that have hurt airline stocks for quite some time seem to be easing  American Airlines recently unveiled a bullish outlook on unit revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016  The carrier now expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenues  to decline in the band of 0 5  to 2 5  in the fourth quarter  The view represents a marked improvement from the guidance issued last month when the metric was expected to decline in the band of 1 3  

	Delta expects to return to positive unit revenue growth early next year  Moreover  RASM at JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ      decreased 3 5  in the third quarter  This indicates an improvement from the 8 2  decline in the second quarter 

	Also  fears related to overcapacity have been plaguing airline investors for quite some time  However  the bullish capacity related updates recently provided by several carriers are putting to rest such fears  In September  Southwest Airlines announced that it expects 2017 capacity to expand less than 4  on a year over year basis 

	The projection compares favorably with the view for 2016  wherein capacity is estimated to increase in the range of 5  to 6   Furthermore  while releasing its third quarter results  Delta said that it expects 2017 capacity to expand merely 1   in line with the projection for the fourth quarter 

	Moreover  the current scenario of rising oil prices could turn out to be favorable for airlines  This is because carriers are likely to hike air fares in such a scenario  This will ultimately augment the top line 

	Additionally  the approval granted by the U S  Transportation Department to eight U S  carriers  including the four favored by Buffett  is a positive  Once operational  the top line of the concerned carriers should be boosted significantly as Havana is a favorite tourist spot 

	The improving scenario for the airline industry can be further gauged by fact that the current Zacks Industry Rank of 161  among more than 260 groups  for the Transportation Airline division is much more favorable than the 200  rank carried a month ago 

	Given the recent improvements  the involvement of one of the most revered investors of all times will undoubtedly usher in better days for the sector  While we expect these developments to rekindle the interest of investors in the aviation space  the picture will become clearer only with the passage of time

196172,417688,DAL,Airline Stocks Losing Altitude  Here s Why,opinion,"Airline stocks have hit rough weather with a plethora of issues affecting the sector  These companies are currently exposed to multiple headwinds including a surge in terror attacks  technological problems  Brexit induced uncertainty  capacity woes  rising labor costs and declining airfares to name a few 
As if the aforesaid risks were not enough  the emergence of Hurricane Matthew has added to the woes of the already challenged industry  The storm has caused extensive damage in the affected areas in the U S  As expected  the natural calamity impeded travel with many carriers including Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL   JetBlue Airways Corporation  JBLU  and Alaska Air Group  ALK  having to cancel flights offer refunds owing to safety related concerns  The bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 242  among more than 260 groups  carried by the Transportation Airline division further highlights the hard times the sector has fallen in 
Technological Glitches Raise Concerns
Over the past few months  some of the biggest airlines have been adversely impacted by technological issues  In August  Delta Air Lines had to suspend multiple flights and delay several others due to a power outage in Atlanta  The outage affected the computer systems  which in turn  disrupted the company s operations worldwide  In fact  the outage crippled operations and led to in 2 300 flights being cancelled over a three day time span  causing uncalled for harassments to passengers 
The severity of the power outage at Delta Air Lines can be gauged by the fact that the disruption hurt the top line of the carrier in the third quarter to the tune of  100 million  The airline behemoth s consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  declined 6 8  in the quarter with the outage affecting the metric significantly 
Dallas based Southwest Airlines Co   LUV  experienced a computer failure in July which disrupted operations for three days and resulted in cancellations of around 2000 flights and delays of approximately 7000 flights 
Declining Airfares   PRASM
The continuous decline in airfares is another concern for airline stocks  According to research firm Hopper  airfares  domestic roundtrip  had declined to  216 in September  The firm predicts that domestic airfares will decline to  213 in October and hit a low of  210 in January 
Low fuel costs and capacity overexpansion are believed to be the primary reasons for the decline in airfares  While low air fares are favorable for fliers  it is a drag on the top lines of carriers due to their lesser profits  Declining airfares and the constant fall in unit revenues have collectively spelt doom for the major carriers 
Carriers have been affected by unit revenue issues for quite some time  In spite of efforts to bring about some improvement on that front  these issues are unlikely to diminish anytime soon  Lower fuel surcharges on international flights due to weak oil prices continue to hurt the top line of carriers  This is evidenced by the declining key revenue metric   PRASM  a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier 
We note that passenger unit revenues declined 6 8  year over year at Delta Air Lines in the third quarter  Consolidated PRASM declined 5 8  in the third quarter at United Continental Holdings  UAL   Both these carriers registered a decrease in earnings as well as revenues in the third quarter 
Revenues also declined on a year over year basis at American Airlines Group  AAL  in the third quarter  Southwest Airlines expects revenue per available seat mile  RASM  to decrease in the band 4 5  in the fourth quarter compared with a 4 1  decline in RASM in the third quarter 
Although quite a few carriers managed to beat estimates this earnings season  there has neither been a notable stock price movement nor a revision in Zacks Rank for most of these companies  This clearly indicates that the prevalent headwinds have more than offset the bottom line outperformance of these firms  For example  Southwest Airlines Co  carries a bearish Zacks Rank   5  Strong Sell  in spite of posting better than expected earnings this quarter 
You can see  
Rising Labor Costs
The improved financial health of carriers  courtesy of low oil prices over the last few years  has been noticed by their employees who are also eager to get a share of the pie  This has resulted in frequent pay related labor deals and associated issues across the airline industry  With such talks deals in vogue in the aviation space  labor costs have been on a rise 
Escalating labor costs hurt the bottom line of major carriers in the third quarter  In fact  the total operating expenses of American Airlines rose 5 2  in the third quarter to  9 2 billion  mainly because of the 15 3  increase in salaries and benefits expenses  The recent labor deals inked by the company were the primary factors contributing to the increase in costs  Expenses for salaries  wages and other benefits climbed 8  to  421 million for the low cost carrier  This in turn hurt JetBlue s third quarter results 
Operating expense per available seat mile  CASM    excluding fuel and profit sharing   increased 3 1  for JetBlue to 7 53 cents in the third quarter  Notably  JetBlue s fourth quarter projection indicates that the costs are likely to continue rising  The carrier expects the metric to grow in the band of 4 5  to 6 5   including negative impact to the tune of 0 5  due to Hurricane Mathew   Southwest Airlines expects CASM   excluding special items and profit sharing   to increase in the band of 4 5  in the final quarter of 2016  which is much more than the 2 6  increase witnessed in the third quarter 
Various Disputes
It is a well known fact that carriers regularly come across labor related challenges that often impact their operations   For example  Southwest Airlines has been in the news for labor unrest in recent times with some of its labor groups demanding the removal of certain top executives  
Apart from labor related troubles  airlines constantly face probes from regulatory authorities  American Airlines  along with Delta Air Lines  United Continental Holdings and Southwest Airlines  is being investigated by the Department of Justice on the possibility of unlawful co ordination to limit the availability of seats with the objective of keeping airfares high 
Additionally  according to a report appearing in   the U S  Department of Transportation fined four major U S  carriers  including American Airlines and United Continental  in August for inaccurately informing passengers about compensation  According to the report  American Airlines was fined the maximum amount 
The ongoing dispute between leading U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts is another challenge for the industry  The uncertainty about Alaska Air Group s proposed takeover of Virgin America  VA  is another cause for concern 
Surge in Terror Attacks   Other Challenges
The unfortunate rise in terror attacks across the globe has justly raised concerns regarding security  In such a scenario  the top lines of carriers are likely to be hurt due to reduced demand for travel  Events like the mass shooting in Orlando  the suspected terror attack in Southern France  disappearance of the EgyptAir jet and the Brussels attacks have all severely hurt airline stocks due to waning travel demand  Such apprehensions were also reflected by the International Air Transport Association  IATA  projection of passenger travel growth  6 2   in 2016 to be less than that recorded in 2015  7 4   
Moreover  the vote cast by Britons in June in favor of exiting the European Union has put U S  carriers with exposure to the U K  at risk   For example  American Airlines has significant exposure to the country  6 2  of capacity   According to the IATA  with Brexit materializing  the U K  s air passenger market is expected to shrink in the band of 3 5  by 2020 
As if the above challenges were not enough  the outbreak of diseases like the Zika virus hurt demand for travel  A few months back  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  issued a travel warning following the outbreak of the mosquito borne Zika virus in Miami  The outbreak prompted the CDC to issue an advisory for pregnant women to avoid the Zika affected Miami neighborhood  Naturally  airline stocks were adversely affected due to a substantial decline in air travel 
Moreover  with economies like Venezuela and Nigeria in the doldrums  the airlines operating in the said nations  with dwindling foreign exchange reserves  are facing tough times with regard to repatriation  For example  Venezuela currently owes  3 8 billion to airlines 
Conclusion
The above challenges confronting the industry  unless addressed quickly  have the potential to hamper the growth prospects of stocks in the space  The headwinds can lead to investors  especially the risk averse ones  shying away from investing in the sector

196184,417700,DAL,Airline Industry Outlook   October 2016,opinion,"Airline stocks  which were investor favorites not so long ago  have somewhat lost their appeal  thanks to the number of issues the sector is currently grappling with  The latest challenge has come in the form of Hurricane Matthew  which has disrupted travel plans and caused many carriers to cancel flights offer refunds for the security of passengers 
The Headwinds at a Glance
The surge in terror attacks across the globe has hurt demand for air travel  Moreover  the Brexit vote in June this year has added to the uncertainty  In fact  German carrier Lufthansa  DLAKY  has trimmed its earnings per share outlook for 2016 in view of waning travel demand to Europe due to multiple terrorism related incidents and the uncertainty following the Brexit 
The carrier said that advance bookings  especially on long haul Europe bound routes  have been hurt by the above mentioned headwinds  The German carrier now expects 2016 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to be below the 2015 level  the previous guidance had hinted at the bottom line being slightly above the 2015 figure  
Foreign currency pressures  declining air fares and technological glitches have also hurt airlines recently  Over the past few months  technological problems have adversely affected the operations at airlines majors like Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL   United Continental Holdings  UAL  and Southwest Airlines Co   LUV   The severity of the power outage at Delta Air Lines can be gauged by the fact that the disruption hurt the top line of the carrier in the third quarter to the tune of  100 million 
The ongoing uncertainty regarding Alaska Air Group s  ALK  proposed takeover of Virgin America  VA  adds to the woes of the already beleaguered industry  The emergence and success of low cost carriers like Spirit Airlines  SAVE  and JetBlue Airways  JBLU  have posed significant threats to legacy carriers 
Also  the Zika outbreak in Miami a couple of months ago naturally led to fears and declining travel demand to Florida  hurting carriers  The outbreak prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  to issue an advisory for pregnant women to avoid the Zika affected Miami area  Moreover  disputes like the one involving major U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts pose challenges to stocks in the space 
Modest Q3 Results
Unit revenue issues have been plaguing the airline stocks for quite some time and the third quarter of 2016 was no exception 
We note that passenger unit revenues declined 6 8  year over year at Delta Air Lines in the third quarter  Consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  or unit revenues  declined 5 8  in the third quarter at United Continental  Both these carriers registered a decrease in earnings as well as revenues in the third quarter  Though American Airlines Group  AAL  posted better than expected quarterly results  it recorded a year over year deterioration in the top line 
Declining air fares  which have been a major headwind for airline companies in recent times  was one of the factors hurting results  Increasing labor costs  as many carriers have been inking new labor deals  also hampered bottom line growth  Investors should note that total operating expenses at American Airlines rose 5 2  in the third quarter to  9 2 billion mainly because of the 15 3  increase in salaries and benefits expenses  The recent labor deals inked by the company were one of the primary factors contributing to the increase in costs  JetBlue s third quarter results were also hit by higher labor costs 
Moreover  the absence of any notable stock price appreciation for most companies in spite of their earnings beats can be attributed to prevailing headwinds in the space  The Transportation Airline segment s Zacks Industry rank of 241  out of more than 260 industries  highlights the risks faced by the airline space  With the entire industry struggling as reflected by the disappointing Zacks Industry rank  it is of little surprise that Buy rated stocks are hard to find in the airline space  In fact  Latin American carriers Copa Holdings  CPA  and GOL Linhas  GOL  are the only stocks to sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in the space 
You can see    
According to our latest  report  the transportation sector  of which airlines are a part  is expected to end the third quarter earnings season with a 14 3  year over year decrease in the bottom line  This is worse than the second quarter performance when earnings declined 12 4  
A Silver Lining
Despite the above mentioned headwinds  the sector has had its share of positive developments  The decision of the U S  Department of Transportation s decision    rendered on Aug 31  to allow major U S  based carriers to operate flights to Havana    is a major positive  Once operational  the top line of the concerned carriers will be benefitted immensely by the new route additions as Havana is a favorite tourist spot 
Although oil prices have recovered from the 12 year low of around  26 per barrel it slipped to this February  it is nowhere near the above  100 a barrel mark reached in mid 2014  Furthermore  since oil prices have been week for quite a long time  the benefit of cheap oil is on the wane as it has been priced in  Nonetheless  cheap oil remains a tailwind as evidenced by the fact that the International Air Transport Association s  IATA  bullish forecast with respect to profitability for the airline sector is primarily based on low oil prices 
The organization expects the airline industry to profit by an estimated  39 4 billion in 2016  The comparable 2015 figure was  35 3 billion  In the event of the forecast coming true  the year 2016 would be the fifth successive year of improving profitability for the airline industry  Its fuel bill is projected to fall to  135 billion in 2016  which represents a significant decline from  226 billion recorded only two years ago  The bulk of the global profits   22 9 billion  is expected to come from the North American region 
 Moreover  bullish capacity related forecasts from carriers like Delta and Southwest are encouraging  While releasing its third quarter results  Delta mentioned that capacity is projected to expand merely 1   which is in line with the projection for the fourth quarter  Southwest had stated at the 9th Annual Global Transportation Conference that its 2017 capacity is expected to expand less than 4  year over year 
The projection compares favorably with the view for 2016  wherein capacity is projected to increase in the range of 5  to 6   The carrier further mentioned that most of the 2017 capacity growth  approximately 2 points  would come from domestic markets  while international expansion would account for 1 2 points

196185,417701,DAL,Airline Stocks Still Hold Promise  Here s Why,opinion,"There is no denying the fact that the recently outperforming sector has now fallen on hard times and is no longer a hot favorite amongst investors  The sector is grappling with a number of issues   surges in terror attacks  technological problems  labor strife and many more  However  there exist certain tailwinds that make airline stocks a worthwhile option in spite of the prevalent gloom  Let s explore these tailwinds in detail 
Havana Approval   A Major Positive
On Aug 31  the U S  Transportation Department   DOT   granted final approval to eight U S  based carriers to initiate commercial flights to the capital of Cuba  Following the final nod  carriers will be able to start operations shortly  The verdict confirmed the tentative approval awarded on Jul 7  2016  The carriers that have gained the final approval include the likes of Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL   American Airlines Group  AAL   United Continental Holdings  UAL   JetBlue Airways Corp   JBLU   and Southwest Airlines Co   LUV  
The popularity of Havana as a travel destination can be clearly made out from the fact that U S  carriers had collectively applied for the approval to operate nearly 60 daily flights to the Cuban capital  However  only 20 daily roundtrip flights on the route were approved eventually  The permission for flights on the Havana route is a major positive  and once operational  the top line of the concerned carriers should be boosted significantly as the city is a favorite tourist spot 
The Havana approval came on the very day the first commercial flight to Cuba from the U S  touched ground in more than 50 years  JetBlue had the honor of operating the first flight  387  which landed in Santa Clara  Cuba  from Fort Lauderdale on Aug 31  We note that the DOT had granted approval to six U S  based carriers to operate scheduled flights to nine Cuban cities  excluding Havana  in June this year 
Will Unit Revenue Woes Mitigate 
It is no secret that airline stocks have been hurt by unit revenues issues for quite some time  However  some recent favorable developments indicate that the issues might be mitigating  In its September traffic report  Delta Air Lines stated that its passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a measure of unit revenue  declined only 3  in the month  The reading compared favorably with July and August when PRASM declined 7  and 9 5   respectively  In fact  Delta Air Lines expects to be the first network carrier to return to  positive unit revenue growth  
Moreover  in the third quarter  revenue per available seat mile  RASM  at JetBlue decreased 3 5  This indicates an improvement from the 8 2  decline in the second quarter 
Bullish Capacity Related Forecasts
Fears related to overcapacity have been plaguing airline investors for quite some time  Apprehensions regarding airline capacity growth at a rate higher than the U S  GDP leading to an oversupplied market also made investors jittery  However  airline stocks had a field day on Sep 7  courtesy of bullish capacity related forecasts from the likes of Southwest Airlines at the 9th Annual Global Transportation Conference 
Dallas  TX based Southwest Airlines projects 2017 capacity to expand less than 4  on a year over year basis  The projection compares favorably with the view for 2016  wherein capacity is estimated to increase in the range of 5  to 6   The carrier further mentioned that most of the 2017 capacity growth  approximately 2 points  would come from domestic markets  while international expansion would account for 1 2 points 
While releasing its third quarter results  Delta said that 2017 capacity is projected to expand merely 1   which is in line with the projection for the fourth quarter 
Cheap Oil 
The biggest tailwind for airline stocks in recent times has been cheap oil  Low fuel costs have slashed the operating expenses of carriers significantly  supported huge savings and fortified the balance sheets of carriers  The strong cash balance has resulted in investor friendly activities like more share buybacks and dividend payments  Moreover  employee friendly activities like profit sharing have also been in vogue in the airline space  Carriers like Delta Air Lines are also looking to reduce their debt levels based on their improved financial position 
However  given that oil prices have been weak for an extended time period  since mid 2014  it is natural for the effect of cheap oil to be priced in  Consequently  this factor is not as defining for airline stocks currently as was the case a few months ago  However  oil price weakness continues to be responsible for year over year earnings growth of carriers in spite of its waning impact 
Currently  oil prices are hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  a long way off the above  100 a barrel mark reached two years ago  Despite the recent OPEC action  oil prices are unlikely to touch the highs of mid 2014 anytime soon  This factor will continue to aid these carriers  bottom line  going forward 
In fact  Delta Air Lines had stated in September that even the scenario of rising oil prices could be favorable for airlines as it would provide the scope for increasing air fares  thereby boosting revenues 
IATA s Bullish View Raises Optimism
The International Air Transport Association   IATA   provided a robust outlook for 2016 
At its Annual General Meeting in Dublin  the research firm raised the 2016 global net profit projection for the industry to  39 4 billion from  36 3 billion  Notably  the figure reported in 2015 was  35 3 billion  Global net profit margin is expected to expand to 5 6  in 2016 from 4 9  a year ago 
Interestingly  North American carriers are expected to generate the bulk  58 1   of the profits in 2016  Carriers from other regions like Europe and the Middle East are expected to perform better in 2016 than the last year 
Also  Latin American carriers are anticipated to witness a healthy 2016 after a dismal 2015  These carriers are projected to register a profit of  100 million in 2016 as against a loss of  1 5 billion in 2015  We are also bullish on Latin American carriers as is reflected by the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  sported by Copa Holdings  CPA  and GOL Linhas  GOL   You can see  
Moreover  a report recently published in Reuters indicatesthat the IATA is progressing well as far as recovery of revenues  in air fares  blocked in Nigeria are concerned  According to the report  the currently blocked amount is less than half of what the Nigerian economy owed to foreign carriers in June this year 
String of Earnings Beats in Q3
Despite the multiple tailwinds plaguing the sector  the airlines started the third quarter 2016 earnings season on a strong note with many carriers outperforming on the bottom line front  The carriers to have reported better than expected earnings in third quarter include the likes of Delta Air Lines  United Continental Holdings  American Airlines and Alaska Air Group  ALK  
In fact  carriers like United Continental Holdings  American Airlines and Alaska Air Group have not only topped earnings expectations but have also outperformed in terms of revenues  This clearly suggests that in spite of the multiple issues currently confronting the airline sector  all is not lost for it

1  American Airlines Group posted a decline in traffic in the month of September  Traffic   measured in revenue passenger miles  RPMs    was 17 8 billion  down 1 7  on a year over year basis  Declining traffic in the Atlantic and Latin American regions contributed to the downside  On a year over year basis  consolidated capacity  available seat miles ASMs  too dipped 0 4  to 21 8 billion  Another important metric  load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  decreased to 81 6  from 82 7  in Sep 2015 as traffic reduction outpaced capacity decline 

However  the carrier revealed an improved view with respect to total revenue per available seat mile  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  for the third quarter  detailed results are scheduled to be revealed on Oct 20  American Airlines now expects RASM for the third quarter to decline in the band of approximately 2 3   the earlier guidance had indicated a decline in the band of 3 5   on a year over year basis  The company now expects pre tax margin of 13 15  for the third quarter as against the previous guidance of 12 14  

The carrier was also in the news when it inked a deal for a new joint collective bargaining agreement with its flight instructors  The carrier  which has struck deals with many labor groups of late  expects unit costs for 2016 to increase in the band of 5  to 7   System capacity for 2016 is projected to increase approximately 1 5

6  In a customer friendly move  GOL Linhas inked a new codeshare and frequent flyer program deal with Emirates  The association is expected to be effective by the end of October early November  upon approval from the Brazilian Federal Aviation Agency  A codeshare deal allows sharing of flights  which implies that a passenger has the free will to avail any flight operated by either of the companies under the agreement  irrespective of the flight number 

The contract also provides extended and seamless connectivity between flights of the two carriers  Moreover  passengers of both the carriers will benefit from this deal by means of seamless ticketing  check in  boarding and baggage check experience while flying

Despite relatively disappointing revenue  Delta is moving higher on one key piece of data from its report  according to Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi 
 Delta provided initial guidance for 2017 capacity growth of  1  which is better than most expected  in our view  Now  the question will come down to how that 1  growth is split domestic vs  international   Denardi said  via  
DeNardi blamed the weak pricing environment many airliners are facing on the current supply glut and said that any capacity growth above 1  would be  excessive   The analyst also noted that Passenger Revenue per Available Seat Mile  or PRASM  would be an important figure to track going forward 
 Delta being the 2nd airline to provide constructive 2017 guidance and the 1st of the Big 3 to do so  gives us more confidence that pricing trends will improve and reinforces our view that  all in  the thesis of capacity discipline is largely intact   though it s taken longer than expected to be enforced during this period of PRASM weakness   he concluded

Delta Air Lines is tied to the   and their industry is in the bottom 32   The airline industry has been through a lot of major changes within the late 10 15 years  The biggest change has been many mergers including American Airlines  AAL  who merged with TWA  then Continental Airlines merged with United Airlines  UAL   and Delta merged with Northwest Airlines a few years ago  Furthermore  the airlines  have started to rely on revenue from various fees including baggage to cancellation fees 
The airline industry remains very competitive for Delta  While Delta Air Lines goes against United Airlines and American Airlines in regards to being one of the three largest U S  carriers  but Delta also faces tough competition against Southwest Airlines  LUV   then JetBlue  JBLU  and Virgin America  VA  in specific regions of the country  Internationally Delta Airlines faces tough competition against other global leaders such as Lufthansa and British Airlines who aren t in the Skyteam partnership  however  Delta does benefit being in the same partnership as Air France  KLM  Korean Air  China Airlines  and others which makes it easier for Delta fliers traveling abroad  That aspect can be appealing for international travelers  which can be a benefit for Delta Air Lines

196207,417723,DAL,4 Airline Stocks To Take Off On Likely Q3 Earnings Beat,opinion,"It is a well known fact that the airline sector is going through tough times  thanks to the plethora of headwinds faced by carriers  The issues hurting these companies include declining unit revenues  plunging ticket prices  technological glitches  feuds with worker unions  reduced air travel demand due to the surge in terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainty  The struggles are reflected by the bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 201  among more than 260 groups  carried by the Transportation Airline segment 
The latest challenge for carriers is Hurricane Matthew  The storm is likely to hit Florida soon and has caused severe devastation across Haiti apart from affecting the entire Caribbean region with heavy rainfall and strong winds  The severity of the storm has  resulted in some causalities in the areas  Hurricane Matthew has prompted many carriers including American Airlines Group Inc      JetBlue Airways Corporation    and Alaska Air Group    to cancel flights offer refunds owing to safety related concerns Will Unit Revenue Issues Ease 
Although  unit revenues issues have been plaguing airline stocks for quite some time there have been a few favorable developments which suggest that problems on that front might be easing  In its September traffic report  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL     stated that its passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a measure of unit revenue  declined only 3  in the month  The reading compared favorably to those in July and August where PRASM had declined 7  and 9 5   respectively  In fact  Delta expects to be the first network carrier to return to  positive unit revenue growth  
Moreover  last month JetBlue predicted a decline of only 3 4  for its revenue per available seat mile  RASM  the third quarter of 2016  This indicates an improvement from the 8 2  decline in the second quarter Oil Prices Remain Low
Cheap oil has been the biggest tailwind for carriers in recent times  Low oil prices resulted in huge profits for carriers with their bottom line improving significantly through huge savings  This has strengthened the balance sheet of these carriers  which in turn  enabled them to increase investments to enhance flying experience of passengers  A stronger balance sheet also facilitated dividend hikes and share buybacks along with profit sharing payments 
Although oil prices have been weak for quite some time  since mid 2014  and consequently have been priced in  this major tailwind continues to be the main factor behind the considerable year over year earnings growth of carriers  Currently  oil prices are hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  a long way off the above  100 a barrel mark witnessed two years ago  Despite the recent OPEC action  oil prices are unlikely to touch the highs of mid 2014 anytime soon  This factor will continue to aid these carriers  bottom line  going forward 
The bullish  by the International Air Transport Association for the airlines industry for 2016 is also based on the assumption of oil prices remaining weak Havana Approval  A Positive
We are optimistic about the decision by the U S  Transportation Department  DOT   announced in August this year  to grant final approval to eight U S  based carriers to initiate commercial flights to the Cuban capital of Havana  Once operational  the top line of the carriers should be benefitted immensely as Havana is a favorite tourist spot 
We note that U S  carriers have already started operating commercial flights to other Cuban cities  The first commercial flight to Cuba from the U S  touched ground on Aug 31  2016  after more than 50 years  The flight was operated by JetBlue Q3 Round the corner
The Q3 earnings season will commence in the next few days for the airline industry  Given the turbulent times the sector is passing through  the third quarter performance of carriers is expected to be lackluster in spite of the positives highlighted above 
The bearish projection for the transportation sector according to our latest  report  of which airlines are a part  also highlights the fact that airlines stocks are not likely to fly very high in Q3  The report suggests that the bottom line in the transportation space is likely to contract 21 8  in Q3 How to Pick Likely Q3 Winners 
Despite the overall gloomy scenario  the aforesaid factors clearly suggest that all is not lost for airline stocks  There exist few hidden gems in the space that investors can unearth  The stocks have the potential to generate handsome returns 
However  given the vastness of the airline space and the issues that it is currently  it is by no means an easy task to identify the attractive picks  This is where our proprietary model comes to the rescue  According to our model  stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  are likely to outperform  More often than not  a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to stock price appreciation 
Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their upcoming earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70    Our choices
With the aid of the above methodology  we have zeroed in on four airline stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q3 
Based in Long Island City  NY  JetBlue Airways Corporation    is a low cost passenger airline that operates primarily on point to point routes  It operates an average of 825 daily flights and carries more than 30 million customers a year to 86 cities in the U S   the Caribbean  and Latin America  The carrier has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  1 70   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 has increased by 7 cents over the last three months to 59 cents per share  The carrier is expected to unveil its Q3 results on Oct 25  You can see  
Hawaiian Holdings Inc      a holding company of Hawaiian Airlines  is involved in transporting passengers as well as cargo  The carrier makes it to our list of likely outperformers in Q3 by virtue of its Zacks Rank  3 and Earnings ESP of  2 79   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 has risen by 20 cents over the last three months to  1 79 per share  The carrier is scheduled to unveil its Q3 results on Oct 18 
Our next choice is Alaska Air Group     the parent company of Alaska Airlines  The Seattle  WA based company carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of  0 98   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 has increased by 3 cents over the last month to  2 04 per share  The carrier is expected to unveil its Q3 results on Oct 27 
Las Vegas  NV based Allegiant Travel Company    also features in our current list of favorites owing its Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  3 03   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 rose by 14 cents over the last month to  2 31 per share

196224,417740,DAL,Steer Clear Of Delta And 4 Other Airline Stocks For Now,opinion,"The transportation sector  which includes airlines  truckers  shipping stocks and railroads to name a few  is grappling with a number of challenges  The headwinds have hurt the second quarter 2016 results of this widely diversified space  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  
This can be made out from our latest  report which shows that the transportation sector s second quarter performance was worse than the first quarter of 2016  The report states that the bottom line has declined 12 4  year over year in the second quarter for transportation companies  in the S P 500 space  while the same had expanded 3 3  in the first quarter of the year  The numbers make a sorry reading even with respect to the top line as well  In the second quarter  revenues shrunk 1 3  while the same had declined only 0 9  in the first quarter 
With the broader sector undergoing tough times  how can the airline sub group be spared  The sorry state of affairs is reflected by the bearish Zacks Industry rank of 241  among 260  groups  carried by the Transportation Airline segment 
Stocks in the airline space are facing a number of headwinds ranging from the surge in terror attacks  uncertainty following the Brexit vote  unit revenue issues and technological glitches  to name a few  Moreover  declining airfares have the potential to hurt the top line of airline companies 
The mixed second quarter 2016 performance by airline behemoth Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   throws more light on the plight of the airline stocks  The Atlanta  GA based carrier kicked off the second quarter earnings season for the airline sector on Jul 14  Even though the carrier beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings  it continued to struggle on the revenue front with the top line shrinking 2 4  mainly due to currency woes  Revenues also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate   DELTA AIR LINES Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Unit revenue issues have been plaguing Delta  like its peers for quite some time  This is reflected by the declining metric   passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier   PRASM declined 4 9  in the second quarter of 2016 to 13 59 cents mainly due to currency woes  That the PRASM related issues are not a thing of the past at Delta can be made out from the 7  drop in the metric in July  The sharp drop was due to foreign exchange woes along with the ongoing supply demand imbalance in the Transatlantic and softness pertaining to domestic yield 
Earlier in the month  the carrier suffered yet another setback when a in Atlanta disrupted its operations causing undue harassment to passengers  In view of this gloomy backdrop  it is of little surprise that the 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate declined in excess of 8  over the last 60 days to  5 79 per share  Additionally  the Delta stock lost 26  year to date  The Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  carried by Delta further reinforces the fact that investors should avoid this stock for now 
4 Other Airline Stocks to Avoid
With the airline sector struggling  we pinpoint four other stocks in the space that are underperforming and should be dumped without further ado 
Dallas based low cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   is struggling big time  The stock lost value following the release of its second quarter results on Jul 21 wherein earnings lagged estimates  Moreover  the carrier suffered a technology outage recently  which resulted in cancellation and delays of over 2000 flights 
The setback caused the carrier to slash its third quarter operating revenue per available seat mile  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  guidance earlier this month  RASM is now expected to decline in the range of 3 5  to 4 5  in the third quarter as compared to the earlier projected range of a decline of 3 0  to 4 0  SOUTHWEST AIR Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   In view of this gloomy backdrop  it is of little surprise that the 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined almost 5  over the last 30 days to  3 87 per share  Additionally  the stock lost in excess of 14  year to date  The Zacks Rank  5 carried by Southwest Airlines further reinforces the fact that investors should keep away from this stock at present 
CA based low cost carrier Virgin America   NASDAQ VA   is also best avoided at the moment  The Zacks Rank  5 company reported lackluster second quarter results with both earnings and revenues lagging expectations  The carrier s earnings per share of 93 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 17 and also declined 36 3  year over year  Quarterly revenues of  426 million also missed the consensus mark of  447 million VIRGIN AMERICA Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Also  Santiago  Chile based LATAM Airlines Group S A    NYSE LFL   should be avoided going by the present scenario   The carrier  carrying a Zacks Rank  5  performed disappointingly in the second quarter of 2016 reporting wider than expected loss  Moreover  the quarterly loss of 17 cents per share was wider than the year ago loss of 9 cents  Revenues declined in excess of 14  to  1 967 million in the reported quarter  Due to the below par results on Aug 11  the 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate declined over 34  to 17 cents over the last 7 days LATAM AIRLINES Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Last but not least Germany s Zacks Rank  5 company Lufthansa   OTC DLAKY   should also not make it to your portfolio now  The carrier reported year over year decline in earnings and revenues in the second quarter of 2016  The carrier stated last month that travel demand to Europe has been waning following multiple terror attacks and the uncertainty following the Brexit vote 
The carrier also said that advance bookings  especially on long haul Europe bound routes  have been hurt by the above mentioned headwinds  The company now expects 2016 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to be below 2015 levels  the previous guidance had hinted at the measure being slightly above the 2015 figure   Shares of the carrier have shed over 25  so far this year LUFTHANSA  ADR Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

196225,417741,DAL,Delta Vs  Southwest  Which Airline Can Get Out Of Sell Zone ,opinion,Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV     with their market capitalizations of  28 09 billion and  22 86 billion  respectively   are two well  known players in the US airline industry   However  both these well established stocks are currently under pressure as is displayed by their Zacks Rank   5  Strong Sell  The tough times are not limited to these two carriers only  The entire airline industry is reeling under an array of headwinds which include the surge in terror attacks  uncertainty following the Brexit vote  unit revenue issues and technological glitches  Additionally declining airfares have the potential to hurt the top line of airline companies  affecting profits  The Zacks Industry rank of 241  among 260  groups  carried by the Transportation Airline segment is indicative of the tough times that the stocks in this space are going through Q2 Outperformances Fail to Lift Stock PricesThe second quarter 2016 earnings season did see quite a few airline companies reporting better than expected earnings or revenues or both  But the outperformance has done little to bolster the stock prices in most cases  For example  the Delta  which beat on earnings but missed the top line  has shed over 9  ever since its earnings release on Jul 14  Southwest Airlines  on the other hand  missed on earnings but topped on revenues in second quarter  The Dallas based low cost carrier has also seen its stock price decline since its earnings release on Jul 21 despite outperforming on the revenue front In fact these two well established names have been struggling for quite a few months due to the above mentioned headwinds and second quarter outperformance  bottom line for Delta and top line for Southwest  have failed to entice investors  The toiling of these well established carriers are indicative by the fact that the Delta stock has lost 26 87  year to date while Southwest Airlines has seen a double digit slump in its stock price since the commencement of 2016  Moreover  earnings estimates have also moved south for these carriers further highlighting that these two stocks are not favored by analysts at present In case of Delta  2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate fell in excess of 8  over the last 60 days to  5 79 per share   The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined almost 5  over the last 30 days to  3 87 per share for Southwest Let s take a look at some of the major headwinds plaguing these two well known carriers which have affected their stock price Unit Revenue Delta and Southwest like their peers have been plagued by unit revenue issues for quite some time   Passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  declined at both these carriers in the second quarter  Moreover  PRASM fell 7  in July at Delta impacting the stock  The sharp drop was due to foreign exchange woes along with the ongoing supply demand imbalance in the Transatlantic and softness pertaining to domestic yield Southwest Airlines too was impacted when it gave a bearish guidance with respect to operating revenue per available seat mile  RASM  for the third quarter  RASM is now anticipated to decline in the range of 3 5  to 4 5  as compared to the earlier projected range of 3 0  to 4 0  DisruptionsBoth these stocks were in the news recently owing to disruptions in their operations causing undue harassments to its passengers   On Jul 20  Southwest Airlines had to cancel 400 flights  and delay nearly 2 000 due to a computer glitch  Operations at the Atlanta  GA  based Delta were similarly disrupted due to a power outage in Atlanta on Aug 8 which affected the computer systems resulting in disruption of the company s operations worldwide Delta s Chief Operating Officer issued a statement apologizing for the delay  The company also issued a  200 travel voucher to customers whose flights were delayed by over three hours or had been cancelled altogether Surge in Terror Attacks   BrexitThe increase in terror attacks is a looming threat to airline stocks with Delta and Southwest being no exceptions to this threat  This is because such attacks give rise to the possibility of air travel demand slackening on account of security fears  Furthermore  uncertainty following the Brexit vote in late June has also hurt the stocks due to declining demand for Business travel  With respect to exposure to Britain  Delta is very much at risk as it has a significant stake in British airline  Virgin Atlantic  To counter the threat  the carrier has decided to trim 6 points of the U S    U K  capacity from its winter schedule While it is true that the above mentioned headwinds have caused the two stocks to fall out of favor of late as far as investors are concerned all is not lost for these carriers  As with their impressive fundamentals they will be looking to turnaround things  Let s take a look at the favorable factors Oil still Below  50Fuel costs represent one of the major expenses for airlines  Unsurprisingly  weak oil prices are a boon to airlines  Oil is currently hovering around the  45 a barrel mark  While this represents a strong resurgence from the 12 yeqar low of around  26 a barrel hit in February  the fact remains that the commodity is still trading at levels much lower than those   100  a barrel  witnessed in mid 2014  It is also true that since oil has been cheap for almost 2 years  this major tailwind has already been priced in and is not as big a growth driver now as it was a few quarters back Having said that  it remains a fact that this major input cost for airlines is still low  For example  second quarter earnings at both Delta and Southwest expanded in double digits on a year over year basis on the back of cheap oil  With oil unlikely to touch the mid 2014 highs any time soon  soft oil prices should continue to benefit carriers including Delta and Southwest going forward Dividend  Cheap oil has resulted in huge savings for carriers  improving their financial health  This has caused most carriers including Delta and Southwest to shell out and hike their dividend payouts  In May 2016  Delta hiked its quarterly dividend payout by 50  to over 20 cents a share  Also in May  Southwest hiked its quarterly dividend by 33 33  to 10 cents a share  Both companies  apart from having a good dividend paying history  are also rewarding its shareholders through buybacks It is a no brainer that investors are extremely attracted by high yielding stocks in terms of dividend and here Delta scores over Southwest as its annual dividend yield of 2 2  is much better than Southwest s comparable figure of 1 09  Delta s Record Profit SharingEarlier this year  Delta s employees received the highest payout in the history of corporate profit sharing programs  The total payout of  1 5 billion meant that employees received more than 21  of their 2015 annual earnings  The comparable figure was 16  in 2014  On the other hand  Southwest s profit sharing payment was  620 million which equates to approximately 15 6  of each employee s earnings in 2015  Even though Southwest s payment was also the highest in the low cost carrier s history  it came nowhere close to Delta s payout  We anticipate Delta to trump Southwest with respect to profit sharing in future too owing to its strong balance sheet  Delta s Debt Reduction ImpressesAt the end of the second quarter 2016  Delta had  1 66 billion in cash and cash equivalents and adjusted net debt of  6 78 billion  The company has managed to reduce its net debt  significantly from 2009 levels  Delta generated free cash flow of  1 6 billion and adjusted operating cash flow of  2 6 billion in the second quarter 2016 Other MetricsDespite the woes  Delta s earnings per share in the current year are projected to grow at 25 5  which is much higher than Southwest s projected bottom line growth of 9 8  for 2016  Delta s earnings growth rate  3 5 years  is 11 07  which again compares favorably to Southwest s 9 83  In terms of forward price to earnings ratio  P E  too  Delta wins the contest as it is cheaper than Southwest  The valuation metric for the current year at Delta is 6 41  which is much lower than Southwest s 9 53  Moreover Delta s PEG ratio of 0 59 is lower than Southwest s 0 97  Also in terms of   Delta scores over Southwest  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Delta s VGM score is  A  compared to  B  for Southwest Finally  Delta s larger business size compared to Southwest gives it the gargantuan scale to stand up a bit better to industry headwinds The above parameters suggest that Delta will come out of the present mess faster than Southwest ,2016-08-18,Zacks Investment

Airline Stock Roundup  Q2 Earnings and Zika Fears

The past week saw St  George  Utah based SkyWest  Inc     report impressive numbers for the second quarter of 2016  comfortably beating earnings and revenue estimates  Allegiant Travel Company     also trumped both the estimates but the revenue beat was quite marginal  Meanwhile  low cost carrier Spirit Airlines    revealed mixed results  beating on earnings but missing revenues 

On the non earnings front  Delta Air Lines    and Alaska Air Group     reported traffic data for the month of July  Delta s reported a 7  decline in consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  in July  which has hurt the stock significantly 

Moreover  the travel warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  pertaining to the mosquito borne Zika virus led to a widespread decline in airline stocks

Recap of the Past Week s Most Important Stories

1  Spirit Airlines beat on earnings  aided by low fuel costs  The carrier s second quarter 2016 earnings  on an adjusted basis  came in at  1 11 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 07  Earnings also improved 7 8  on a year over year basis  Spirit Airlines reported operating revenues of  584 1 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  586 million  An increase in non ticket revenues led to a 5 5  year over year increase in the top line  In the reported quarter  operating revenue per available seat mile fell 14 3  year over year while load factor    of seats filled by passengers  increased to 86 4  from 86  in the year ago quarter  The rise in load factor was driven by a 23 8  growth in traffic which outpaced capacity expansion of 23 1   Average economic fuel price per gallon declined 29 3  to  1 47 

2  SkyWest s second quarter earnings of 77 cents per share were well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents  Earnings also improved approximately 26 2  from the year ago figure  Quarterly revenues of  801 million comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  765 million and expanded 1 65  on a year over year basis  Results were aided by lower operating costs due to fewer aircraft in service apart from maintenance cost savings 

3  Allegiant Travel Company s second quarter 2016 earnings per share of  3 68 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents  Quarterly revenues increased 7 1  year over year to  345 million  edging past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  344 million  Air traffic rose 15 5  year over year on an 18 2  rise in capacity  while load factor stood at 83 9  compared with 85 7  recorded in the year ago quarter  Fuel expense declined 34  to  1 36 per gallon in the reported quarter 

For the third quarter of 2016  the company expects cost per available seat mile  CASM   excluding fuel  to grow in the range of 4  to 6  primarily driven by the implementation of the new pilot agreement  The five year deal has taken effect from Aug 1  2016  Total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  in the third quarter is likely to decline in the band of 10 5  to 8 5   In a separate development  the company inked a deal to buy 12 new Airbus A320ceo Aircraft  in line with its objective to maintain an all Airbus fleet by 2019 

4  Alaska Air Group  the parent company of Alaska Airlines  posted a significant rise in air traffic for Jul 2016  Revenue passenger miles  RPMs    a measure of air traffic   improved 7 8  on a 9 6  capacity expansion  Load factor decreased to 86 7  from 88 1  in Jul 2015 as capacity expansion outpaced the increase in traffic 

5  Delta revealed a 1 2  increase in RPMs for the month of July while capacity improved 2 1   Load factor decreased to 87 1  from 87 9  in Jul 2015 as capacity expansion outweighed the increase in traffic  However  Delta witnessed a 7  drop in PRASM in the month  due to foreign exchange woes apart from the ongoing supply demand imbalance in the Transatlantic and softness pertaining to domestic yield 

6  Airline stocks are faced with multiple headwinds at present  The latest blow came from the Zika outbreak in Miami which has led to fears of declining travel demand to Florida  The breakout has prompted the CDC to issue an advisory for pregnant women to avoid the Zika affected Miami neighborhood  Naturally  airline stocks are feeling the pinch as reduced travel is likely to weigh on their top lines

196242,417758,DAL,Why The Jobs Report Is Not Nearly As Strong As You Think,opinion,"Happy days are here again  On Friday  the mainstream media was buzzing with the news that the U S  economy had added 255 000 jobs during the month of July  But as you will see below  the U S  economy did not add 255 000 jobs during the month of July  In fact  without an extremely generous  seasonal adjustment   the number of jobs added during the month of July would not have even kept up with population growth  But the pretend number sounds so much better than the real number  and so the pretend number is what is being promoted for public consumption 
Why doesn t the government ever just tell us the plain facts  Unfortunately  we live at a time when  spin  is everything  and just about everyone in the mainstream media seemed quite pleased with the  good jobs report  on Friday  However    the truth is that the  unadjusted  numbers tell a very different story 

As Mitsubishi UFJ strategist John Herrmann wrote in a note shortly after the report  the  jobs headline overstates  strength of payrolls  He adds that the unadjusted data show a  middling report  that s  nowhere as strong as the headline  and adds that private payrolls unadjusted  85k in July vs seasonally adjusted  217k 
In Herrmann s view  the government applied a  very benign seasonal adjustment factor upon private payrolls to transform a soft private payroll gain into a strong gain  
He did not provide a reason why the government would do that 

Every month  the U S  economy must create at least 150 000 new jobs just to keep up with population growth  According to the unadjusted numbers  we did not hit that threshold  and so the employment situation in this country actually got worse last month 
In America today  there are 7 8 million Americans that are considered to be officially unemployed  and another 94 3 million working age Americans that are considered to be  not in the labor force  
When you add those two numbers together  you get a grand total of 102 million working age Americans that do not have a job right now 
Rather than focusing on the headline  unemployment  figure  we get a much fairer look at the employment crisis in the United States when we examine the employment population ratio  The following chart comes directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  and it shows that the percentage of Americans that are employed has never even come close to getting back to where it was just prior to the last recession 

Over the past couple of years we have seen a slight bump in this number  and that is good  but normally after a recession ends the employment population ratio goes back to at least as high as it was before  Unfortunately  this has not happened after the last two recessions  The following comes from  

The ratio always drops during recessions  but before 2001  it always climbed to higher highs during the recoveries  The 2001 recession and subsequent recovery changed this  For the first time  the ratio never fully recovered  never got even close to fully recovering  That was a new phenomenon  employment growth could no longer keep up with population growth 
When the Great Recession hit  the ratio plunged from its lower starting point at the fastest pace on record  going back to 1948   The Fed s efforts were all focused exclusively on bailing out bondholders  re inflating the stock market  re inflating the housing market  and generally creating what had become the official Fed policy at the time  the Wealth Effect     This has re inflated asset prices   many of them way beyond their prior bubble peaks 
But the Fed s astounding focus on capital accelerated the already changing dynamics of the economy  at the expense of labor 

Even the Wall Street Journal admits that we are in the weakest  economic recovery  since 1949  and now there are lots of signs that we have entered a brand new economic downturn  Here are just a few examples from Chad Shoop 
Ford Motor Company  NYSE F   General Motors  NYSE GM  and Chrysler  NYSE FCAU    three of the U S   largest auto companies   reported sales for July that missed estimates  down 3   1 9  and up 0 3   respectively 
Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL   one of the largest airlines in the world  said revenue fell 7  in July as part of its monthly performance update 
Macy s Inc  NYSE M   the biggest department store company  reported a decline in sales for July  leading to more aggressive markdowns and an industry wide sell off 
And lots of ominous signs continue to pop up on Wall Street as well  For one thing  the Libor rate has surged to the highest level since the last financial crisis  If you are not familiar with Libor  here is a pretty good explanation of it  

The Libor  or London Interbank Offered Rate  measures the interest rate at which banks lend to each other at different durations  and its sharp jump was a harbinger of the financial crisis 

And according to that same article  the Libor rate is now the highest that we have seen since early 2009 

In the past month  the Libor rate has spiked to rates not seen since the first quarter of 2009  the heart of the banking meltdown 
Not to mention  the spread between the Libor and the Overnight Index Swap rate  which tracks the lending rate from the Federal Reserve  has widened  another potentially worrying sign 

But of course I have been quoting facts and figures like this for months  and yet U S  financial markets continue to hold it together 
There are literally dozens of parallels between the global financial crisis of 2008 and what is happening in 2016  but Wall Street continues to defy the laws of economics 
Of course it won t last forever  but it certainly has been a sight to behold 
And I am certainly not alone in my analysis  As I noted the other day  DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach is entirely convinced that stocks  should be down massively  

 The artist Christopher Wool has a word painting   Sell the house  sell the car  sell the kids   That s exactly how I feel   sell everything  Nothing here looks good   Gundlach said in a telephone interview   The stock markets should be down massively but investors seem to have been hypnotized that nothing can go wrong  

For the moment  investors continue to pay extremely irrational prices for stocks  and the mainstream media is just giddy about the state of the economy 
So let us enjoy this very strange period of stability for however much longer it lasts  but let us also protect ourselves from the horrible crash that will inevitably follow ",2016-08-08,Michael T.

196247,417763,DAL,Barrick Gold  Delta Air Lines  Meritage Homes And Best Buy Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   July 21  2016    highlights Barrick Gold    as the Bull of the Day and Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Meritage Homes    and Best Buy    

Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  

  

Have you noticed a trend in many of the bulls of the day lately  Well  several have been in the gold mining space thanks to this segment s incredible run and still strong fundamentals  No wonder this has been such a popular space though  as the segment currently is in the top 3  from an industry look and only six other market segments are ranked higher out of more than 250 overall 

But it isn t just a few companies pulling the rest higher in this market by any stretch  as only two of 34 names in the group have a Zacks Rank  4  sell  or worse  On the flip side  more than a dozen have Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ratings  suggesting there are a number of great choices for investors in this surging corner of the market 

Today s Selection

For this edition though  I am going to take a closer look at Barrick Gold    which is an impressive stock in its own right  This company is also one of the bigger ones in the space  so it could be a better choice for those concerned about recent volatility in this market segment  and for those looking for more of a large cap play 

The company also has impressive fundamentals  thanks to  B  Grades for both Growth and Momentum  These solid grades are based on the company s outperformance from a price momentum perspective  while some of its key growth stats such as projected EPS growth of over 90  and a return on equity better than the industry average are also underpinning its nice scores from these important looks 

Earnings Estimates 

But beyond the fundamental factors  investors should also note that ABX has been seeing rising earnings estimates in recent trading  For next quarter and the current year  we have seen two estimates go higher in the past week compared to zero lower  while the next year time frame has seen similar metrics 

The pace of these increases has also been notable  as the following quarter estimate has increased by nearly 40  in the past month  while we have seen the consensus estimate rise by over 15  for both the current year and following year in the past month too 

And best of all  the most recent estimates for ABX have been the most positive of all  Next quarters most accurate estimate is 22  higher than the current consensus  while the current year most accurate estimate is over 26  higher  In other words  analysts that have done their estimates most recently are the most bullish on ABX s prospects  a great trend for investors seeking more gains in this corner of the market 

But before you start to worry about ABX living up to these lofty expectations  consider how the company has done in recent reports  The company is riding a streak of four straight beats  including an average surprise of over 25  in the time frame 

  

Earnings season can sometimes give you false signals about a company s outlook and likely near term trading potential  A great example of this is Delta Air Lines    and their most recent report 

Yes  DAL beat earnings by about 3 5  and investors saw a modest increase in share prices following this release  The company also reported back that revenue passenger miles were up three percent year over year  while costs were slashed due to lower fuel prices 

While these are all positives  it doesn t tell the whole story for DAL  The company missed sales estimates albeit just barely while available seat miles were up 3 2   helping to push the load factor down by 10 basis points  Thanks in part to this  passenger mile yield and passenger revenue per available seat mile were both down year over year  and these are key metrics for airlines so that is certainly disappointing 

Beyond that  it is also important for investors to note the outlook for DAL stock given to us by management  They expect capacity to increase between 1  and 2   while they project further declines in passenger unit revenue in the   

So while DAL might have had a decent reaction to earnings on the initial session  the outlook certainly isn t as rosy  And if you don t believe me or DAL management for that matter   consider some recent shifts to analyst expectations for the stock as well 

Recent Estimates

In just the past week  we have seen analysts slash estimates for the current quarter  next quarter  current year  and next year time frames  And for both of the full year periods  it has been universal  as no analyst has increased estimates in the past two months  let alone the past seven day time frame 

Even more troubling is the pace of these estimate cuts  as 30 days ago analysts were looking for earnings of  6 31 share for the current year and are now expecting just  5 90 share instead  We see a similar trend for next year s time frame too  as this has gone from  6 57 share to  5 92 share over the past month

196257,417773,DAL,What s In Store For Hawaiian Airlines   HA  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Hawaiian Holdings Inc     NASDAQ HA   the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines  is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 21  after the closing bell 
In the last quarter  the company recorded a positive 6 67  earnings surprise  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play This Quarter
Hawaiian Airlines has recently posted encouraging June traffic figures raising hopes that the airline s expansion efforts will boost top line growth  Focused on growth  the airline announced a new flight between New Kona  Hawaii and Tokyo  Japan to be inaugurated in December 
The company recently issued a revised guidance for the second quarter  per which revenue per available seat mile and cost per seat mile  CASM  are expected to be on the favorable side compared to its previous issued guideline  Operating revenue per ASM is expected to grow by 1  to 2  instead of changing from  1 5  to 1 5   CASM is expected to grow in the range of 3 5  4 5  instead of 3 5  6 5  
However  the company could face increasing competition from major airlines such as American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   and Delta Air Lines Inc    NYSE DAL    The company could also be impacted by low demand due to travelers getting concerned about terror attacks  It remains to be seen how the company performs amid these issues of uncertain demand and competition HAWAIIAN HLDGS Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hawaiian Airlines is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  Since the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at  1 14  the ESP is 0 00  Zacks Rank  Hawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stock to Consider
Here is a stock you may want to consider as our model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

	For the June Producer Price Index  PPI   we see a rise of 0 5   higher than the 0 3  expected  This follows an unrevised 0 4  growth in May  subtracting food   energy prices we also see a read of 0 4   This nearly 1  growth in pricing power from domestic producers over the past 2 months demonstrates real strength  is the highest read since May 2015 and constitutes clear good news 

	Weekly Jobless Claims hit 254K for the second week in a row  last week s 254K is also unched   Continuing claims rose slightly from last week to 2 14  million  This weekly claims read is beneath the 4 week moving average  and thus represents positive labor market news  as well 

	We also see results from some of the biggest companies trading on the S P 500  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   and Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL    Both companies beat earnings expectations  though revenues slipped a bit year over year  JPMorgan topped expectations in its Q2 on a surprise raise in revenues and lower expenses  Delta missed sales numbers slightly for Q2  so its overall report was mixed 

	Looking ahead  both JPMorgan and Delta addressed Brexit concerns for Q3 and beyond  JPMorgan s CFO actually said the bank experienced a small positive trading bump immediately following the Brexit vote  though it was mentioned a Q3 seasonal slowdown might also be expected  Delta has cut back its capacity by 6  on U S  U K  flights for its winter schedule  as a direct reaction to Brexit fallout concerns 

	In a new paper released by esteemed economist Laurence Ball  it was suggested Lehman Brothers need not have collapsed in the fall of 2008  the failure of Lehman ushered in the housing mortgage based collapse that led to the Great Recession of 2008 09   and was allowed to fail for political reasons  Citing GW Bush s Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson  among others  Ball said he could find no evidence government officials looked into ways to rescue the beleaguered investment bank in real time 

	With so much overall positive sentiment feeding the market  it s no surprise to see futures up in today s pre market  The Dow is currently  150  Nasdaq  32 and S P  17  Not too bad  considering the rally that has already taken place much of the week  including crossing all time index highs ",2016-07-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-companies-report-earnings-200141840,200141840

	The Atlanta  GA based carrier s second quarter earnings  excluding special items  of  1 47 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents  Earnings also improved 15 7  on a year over year basis thanks to low fuel costs 








	Operating revenues came in at  10 447 million  marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 488 million  Revenues declined 2 4  from the year ago figure mainly due to currency woes   The top line was hurt to the tune of  65 million by adverse foreign currency movements 

	During the quarter  passenger revenues  cargo revenues and other revenues declined 1 8   20 3  and 3 6   respectively  on a year over year basis  The average fuel price in the second quarter was  1 38 per gallon  down 18 8  year over year

Operating Expenses

Dividend and Share Repurchase

	Delta returned  1 1 billion to its shareholders through dividends   103 million  and buybacks   1 billion  in the quarter under review   We are impressed with the company s efforts to return greater value to its shareholders  In May 2016  the company raised its cash quarterly dividend to over 20 cents per share  81 cents per share annualized   representing an increase of 50  over the previous quarterly payout of 13 5 cents per share  54 cents per share annualized   The carrier intends to complete its existing  5 billion share repurchase by May 2017  well ahead of schedule

Third Quarter Guidance

	In the wake of the uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote last month  the carrier has decided to trim 6 points of the U S    U K  capacity from its winter schedule  For the third quarter of 2016  the carrier expects operating margin in the range of 19  to 21   The estimated fuel price  including taxes and hedges  is expected in the band of  1 52 to  1 57 per gallon for the third quarter  System capacity is expected to rise in the band of 1  to 2  on a year over year basis  Passenger unit revenue in the third quarter is projected to decline in the band of 4  to 6

Key metrics  including PRASM  continue to fall short thanks to choppy domestic pricing and weaker business travel trends

What are you expecting for DAL 
Delta kicks things off for airlines when it reports Q2 earnings this Thursday before the market opens  The airlines are one of the worst performing sectors this year with stocks down over 20  across the industry  Shares of Delta are down 25 3  since the start of the year  largely driven by macroeconomic volatility  rising oil prices  increasing terrorist attacks and generally lower demand  This has been the primary contributor to flat YoY revenues  Given that Delta reports financial and operating performance month to month  it s no secret that that Q2 results will be disappointing 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 58 on  10 54 billion in revenue  10 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  50 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 35  increase in earnings with sales expected to decline by 1   Per share estimates have dropped 15  in the past 3 months and should continue to be cut over the next few days  Fortunately  the stock reacts well to earnings  rising 5  in the month following a report 

Recent events have been contributed to the decline in the airline industry this year  Terrorist acts around the world  especially those at airports  have scared some from traveling  Furthermore  the Brexit vote last month is expected to have lingering effects on the airline industry  A stronger dollar and weaker foreign currency puts a huge damper on overall revenue growth  Rising oil prices haven t helped either  The rebound in the oil market in turn impacts price per gallon and negatively influences margins 
Delta has already reported that key metrics have decline in the past 3 months  PRASM  passenger revenue per available seat mile   one of the most important metric for airlines  declined by 5  over the quarter  Delta and its peers have been struggling with holding onto current price levels as excess seating capacity increases and demand for pricey last minute business tickets decline  Delta recently cut its projected operating margin to 17  for Q2  down from previous forecasts in the range of 21 to 23

196281,417797,DAL,Airline Industry Stock Outlook   July 2016,opinion,"Airlines Impacted by Terror Attacks  Brexit
As had been widely expected  the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world  rattling global financial markets  Airline stocks have been hit hard with fears of travel demand slackening  According to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   with Brexit materializing  the U K  s air passenger market is expected to shrink in the band of 3  to 5  by 2020  In fact  the Brexit decision has worsened matters for U S  carriers with exposure to Britain 
Moreover  prior to Brexit  Britain had been part of the EU s single aviation market  Consequently  carriers of member states could fly freely to within members  Now with Britain exiting the EU  the entire issue has gotten complicated 
Prior to Brexit  airline stocks had been grappling with issues such as the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando  FL and the explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport on June 12  Fears that such attacks could lead to a dip in air travel demand resulted in widespread sell offs in the aviation sector 
To add to the distress  the frequency of such attacks is increasing by the day  The disappearance of an EgyptAir jet in May is also feared to be an act of terrorism  Airline stocks were  even then  Moreover  the Brussels attacks in March dealt a heavy blow to Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL  as its passengers were among the casualties reported in the departure area at Brussels  Zaventem Airport  The Atlanta  GA based carrier s top line was negatively impacted to the tune of  5 million by the attacks 
In fact  on May 31  the U S  State Department issued a global travel alert to U S  citizens citing the possibility of terror attacks similar to those in Brussels and Paris  in Nov 2015   The ongoing European Soccer Championship in France has attracted many tourists  Moreover  the Catholic Church s World Youth Day scheduled to be held in Poland shortly is also likely to be heavily attended 
Citing fears of low travel demand  in May  European low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings  RYAAY  issued a  cautious  outlook for fiscal 2017 on expectations of low airfares  Moreover  travel company Thomas Cook revealed a 5  decline in summer bookings compared to last year 
The twin threats are primarily responsible for the NYSE ARCA Airline index declining more than 5  over the last 30 days 
PRASM Concerns 
As was the case in the past few quarters  issues related to passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a measure of unit revenue  hurt revenues of airline stocks in the first quarter as well  The metric  which is a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier  is expected to dent top line growth in the second quarter as well  For example  American Airlines Group  AAL  forecasts a 6  to 8  drop in the metric for the second quarter  
Lower fuel surcharges on international flights due to weak oil prices have been one of the main reasons behind the persistent decline in PRASM  Furthermore  outbreaks of diseases like the Zika virus and disputes similar to the ongoing one between legacy U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts pose challenges to the stocks in the airline space  The tough times for airlines is exemplified by the fact that the  Trans Airline  sector currently has a Zacks Industry Rank  222   placing it in the bottom 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups 
Estimates Trimmed 
In view of the headwinds mentioned above  earnings per share estimates were lowered by analysts ahead of the first quarter earnings season  thus making it easier for companies to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter gone by  Consequently  the plethora of earnings beats in the space in the first quarter was mainly due to the  lowered bar  and is not anything to be excited about  A major tailwind for airlines in recent times    cheap oil    has in all probability been priced in  as prices have been soft for almost two years now 
Airline players  as in the past few quarters  dished out a below par performance on the top line front  In fact  the picture might well be similar in the second quarter as well  This can be gauged from our latest  which predicts that earnings per share for the S P 500 players in the transportation sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors   of which airlines is a part  will decline 11   Meanwhile  revenues are projected to decline 1 3  
Oil Rebound
Another worrying factor for airlines is that oil prices are currently on their way up and hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  This marks a significant increase from the second half of February  when the commodity had slumped to a 12 year low of  26 21 
Despite oil s massive recovery since February  it s still around  50   about half the level witnessed in mid 2014  Moreover  many believe that the odds are firmly stacked against a sustained rally  Therefore  we believe bottom line expansion for airline players will be evident at least in the remaining quarters of 2016 
Financial Strength
Rally or not  it cannot be denied that soft oil prices have been a huge blessing to carriers by virtue of trimming their operating expenses significantly  thereby causing huge savings  For example  Delta expects to generate savings of around  3 billion in 2016 due to low fuel costs 
Naturally  carriers are in the pink of financial health  courtesy the huge cost savings arising from cheap oil  This has given rise to a surge in shareholder friendly activities such as dividend payments and buybacks in the space  For example  in May  Delta and Southwest Airlines Co   LUV  hiked their respective quarterly dividend payouts 
The massive profits generated by carriers have encouraged them to shell out significant amounts to employees under their profit sharing schemes  Moreover  buoyed by their financial strength  carriers are constantly making additional infrastructural investments to enhance the flying experience of passengers 
Alaska Virgin America Deal
In a bid to expand its operations  particularly on the West Coast  Alaska Air Group  ALK  inked a deal worth approximately  4 billion in Apr 2016  inclusive of debt and capitalized aircraft operating leases to buy low cost carrier Virgin America  VA   The deal  if it materializes  will enable Alaska Air Group to expand significantly and gain greater access to key cities across the U S 
The expansion of Alaska Air Group following the merger will make it the fifth largest among U S  carriers in terms of traffic  displacing JetBlue Airways  JBLU  from the position  We note that airline stocks were in bad shape financially until a few years ago  such as when Delta plunged into bankruptcy in 2005  However  a spate of mergers led to a rebound in the space 
Consequently  mergers have been beneficial for the airline industry going by past records  Currently  there is the added incentive of cheap oil  With oil prices unlikely to touch the highs seen in mid 2014 any time soon  the Alaska Virgin merger  if it happens  should flourish in the favorable backdrop 
Bullish Forecasts 
At its Annual General Meeting in Dublin in June  the IATA increased its projection for 2016 global net profit for the industry to  39 4 billion from the earlier  36 3 billion  The comparable 2015 figure was  35 3 billion  In the event of the forecast coming true  2016 will be the fifth successive year of profit improvement for the airline industry 
Cheap oil  which is projected at  45 per barrel in 2016  is the primary catalyst behind the bright forecast  Fuel bill is projected to fall to  127 billion in 2016  which represents a significant decline from  226 billion recorded only two years ago  Although it is a fact that most carriers hedge at least some of their fuel costs  the majority of them should still continue to benefit considerably from the plunge in oil prices  Notably  carriers use a combination of calls  swaps and collars at varying WTI crude equivalent price levels to hedge fuel costs 
The bulk of the global profits   22 9 billion  is expected to come from the North American region  The rosy picture painted by the IATA for North American carriers  comes shortly after the forecast provided by Airlines for America   A4A    According to the projection  the three month period between June and August will be the busiest one for U S  carriers in terms of air travel 
Cuba Approval Encourage
In what is seen as a major positive for airline stocks  The U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  authorized six U S  based carriers to operate scheduled flights to nine second tier Cuban cities  thereby taking a step toward restoration of diplomatic ties with the island nation after more than 50 years  Following the DOT approval  the carriers can start operating commercial flights to the island this fall itself 
The authorized carriers include airline heavy weights like American Airlines Group  Southwest Airlines Co  and JetBlue Airways Corp  The other airlines that have secured a go ahead for the same are Frontier Airlines  Silver Airways and Sun Country Airlines  With Cuba a re emerging tourist spot  the approval to launch commercial flights to the country should aid the top lines of the carriers significantly 
Moreover  approval is yet to come to fly to the much sought after Havana  The DOT is likely to announce its decision on Havana routes later this summer  Approval to fly on the highly in demand Havana route should augment top lines further by attracting huge traffic ",2016-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/airline-industry-stock-outlook---july-2016-200139507,200139507
196282,417798,DAL,4 Airline Stocks To Buy Despite Terror  Brexit Woes,opinion,"The vote  last week  by Britons in favor of exiting the European Union  Brexit  shocked markets globally  taking indexes into a tail spin  The airline industry hasn t been spared the onslaught  with stocks plummeting on fears of slackening travel demand 
According to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   with Brexit materializing  U K  s air passenger market is expected to shrink in the band of 3  to 5  by 2020  In fact  U S  carriers with exposure to Britain have borne the brunt of the Brexit vote  The Fort Worth  TX based American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   has been a major sufferer with its shares losing over 8  as it has high exposure  6 2  of capacity  to the U K 
Other airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   are also at risk following the disclosure of the results of the U K  referendum which revealed that 51 9  of the votes were cast in favor of Brexit while 48 1  opposed the notion  read more    
Terror Attacks on the Rise
In fact  the Brexit vote is not the only challenge confronting airline stocks  Stocks in the space have been grappling with issues arising from the mass shooting in Orlando on Jun 12  described as the worst in the nation s history  Such attacks hit carriers hard due to the associated fears of declining travel demand on security issues  
Airline stocks had moved south each time there has been an act of terror in the recent past  The attacks in Paris  Nov 2015   Brussels  Mar 2016  and the EgyptAir tragedy  May 2016  had all spelt doom  Apart from Brexit and terror related issues  airline stocks are facing headwinds such as declining unit revenues as well 
Rebound in Sight 
Going by the price movement in the last two trading sessions  airline stocks seem to be bouncing back from the Brexit induced slump  The NYSE ARCA Airline index has gained over 5  over the same time frame 
Stocks in the airline space were not affected by the Jun 28 attacks at the Istanbul airport  This clearly highlights that the impact on carriers of such heinous acts are declining with the increase in frequency  Thus  it is highly probable that the consequences of such attacks are already priced in  However  we can get a more concrete view of this issue with time 
Oil  Chief Benefactor
It is common knowledge that cheap oil has benefited airline stocks immensely  resulting in massive savings as fuel represents one of the major expenses for carriers  Consequently  we have seen a surge in shareholder friendly  dividend and buybacks  and employee friendly  profit sharing  activities in the space 
The improved financial status of carriers has encouraged them to make substantial investments aimed at enhancing the flying experience for passengers 
Crude Resurgence  Not a Concern
Oil prices have been moving up for the last few months  The commodity is currently hovering around  50 a barrel  representing a significant upsurge from the 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb 2016  However  despite oil s significant recovery  the commodity is still trading at about half the level witnessed two years ago 
That oil prices will continue to aid airline stocks  at least for the remainder of the year  was hinted by the IATA projection of crude oil price  Brent  being  45 a barrel in 2016  compared to the 2015 price of  53 9 a barrel  Moreover  fuel expenses are projected to be almost 30  less in 2016 on a year over year basis 
Strong Stocks
The above write up clearly suggests that airlines are poised to fly high in the days ahead  Consequently  adding airline stocks to one s portfolio won t be a bad choice despite the hiccups 
However  picking the right stocks is no mean feat  especially during times as distressing as this  This is where the   which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy  In addition to a compelling Zacks Rank  we have utilized our new   to zero in on four airline stocks with bright prospects

Airlines Impacted by Terror Attacks  Brexit

As had been widely expected  the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world  rattling global financial markets  Airline stocks have been hit hard with fears of travel demand slackening  According to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   with Brexit materializing  the U K  s air passenger market is expected to shrink in the band of 3  to 5  by 2020  In fact  the Brexit decision has worsened matters for U S  carriers with exposure to Britain 

Moreover  prior to Brexit  Britain had been part of the EU s single aviation market  Consequently  carriers of member states could fly freely to within members  Now with Britain exiting the EU  the entire issue has gotten complicated 

Prior to Brexit  airline stocks had been grappling with issues such as the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando  FL and the explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport on June 12  Fears that such attacks could lead to a dip in air travel demand resulted in widespread sell offs in the aviation sector 

To add to the distress  the frequency of such attacks is increasing by the day  The disappearance of an EgyptAir jet in May is also feared to be an act of terrorism  Airline stocks were  even then  Moreover  the Brussels attacks in March dealt a heavy blow to Delta Air Lines     as its passengers were among the casualties reported in the departure area at Brussels  Zaventem Airport  The Atlanta  GA based carrier s top line was negatively impacted to the tune of  5 million by the attacks 

In fact  on May 31  the U S  State Department issued a global travel alert to U S  citizens citing the possibility of terror attacks similar to those in Brussels and Paris  in Nov 2015   The ongoing European Soccer Championship in France has attracted many tourists  Moreover  the Catholic Church s World Youth Day scheduled to be held in Poland shortly is also likely to be heavily attended 

Citing fears of low travel demand  in May  European low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings     issued a  cautious  outlook for fiscal 2017 on expectations of low airfares  Moreover  travel company Thomas Cook revealed a 5  decline in summer bookings compared to last year 

The twin threats are primarily responsible for the NYSE ARCA Airline index declining more than 5  over the last 30 days 

PRASM Concerns

As was the case in the past few quarters  issues related to passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a measure of unit revenue  hurt revenues of airline stocks in the first quarter as well  The metric  which is a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier  is expected to dent top line growth in the second quarter as well  For example  American Airlines Group     forecasts a 6  to 8  drop in the metric for the second quarter 

Lower fuel surcharges on international flights due to weak oil prices have been one of the main reasons behind the persistent decline in PRASM  Furthermore  outbreaks of diseases like the Zika virus and disputes similar to the ongoing one between legacy U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts pose challenges to the stocks in the airline space  The tough times for airlines is exemplified by the fact that the  Trans Airline  sector currently has a Zacks Industry Rank  222   placing it in the bottom 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups 

Estimates Trimmed

In view of the headwinds mentioned above  earnings per share estimates were lowered by analysts ahead of the first quarter earnings season  thus making it easier for companies to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter gone by  Consequently  the plethora of earnings beats in the space in the first quarter was mainly due to the  lowered bar  and is not anything to be excited about  A major tailwind for airlines in recent times    cheap oil    has in all probability been priced in  as prices have been soft for almost two years now 

Airline players  as in the past few quarters  dished out a below par performance on the top line front  In fact  the picture might well be similar in the second quarter as well  This can be gauged from our latest  which predicts that earnings per share for the S P 500 players in the transportation sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors   of which airlines is a part  will decline 11   Meanwhile  revenues are projected to decline 1 3  

Oil Rebound

Another worrying factor for airlines is that oil prices are currently on their way up and hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  This marks a significant increase from the second half of February  when the commodity had slumped to a 12 year low of  26 21 

Despite oil s massive recovery since February  it s still around  50   about half the level witnessed in mid 2014  Moreover  many believe that the odds are firmly stacked against a sustained rally  Therefore  we believe bottom line expansion for airline players will be evident at least in the remaining quarters of 2016 

Financial Strength

Rally or not  it cannot be denied that soft oil prices have been a huge blessing to carriers by virtue of trimming their operating expenses significantly  thereby causing huge savings  For example  Delta expects to generate savings of around  3 billion in 2016 due to low fuel costs 

Naturally  carriers are in the pink of financial health  courtesy the huge cost savings arising from cheap oil  This has given rise to a surge in shareholder friendly activities such as dividend payments and buybacks in the space  For example  in May  Delta and Southwest Airlines Co      hiked their respective quarterly dividend payouts 

The massive profits generated by carriers have encouraged them to shell out significant amounts to employees under their profit sharing schemes  Moreover  buoyed by their financial strength  carriers are constantly making additional infrastructural investments to enhance the flying experience of passengers

196284,417800,DAL,All s Not Well In The Airline Industry  Here s Why,opinion,"Despite the multiple first quarter 2016 earnings beats for airline stocks  the NYSE ARCA Airline index has declined over 12  in the last three months  This clearly hints at some underlying problems plaguing the sector 
Truth Behind the Beats
The first quarter of 2016 has seen airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   Inc   DAL   Southwest Airlines Co   LUV   American Airlines Group Inc   AAL  and Alaska Air Group  ALK  report better than expected earnings  A detailed analysis of the releases reveal a picture quite contrary to the belief that only low oil price has driven the beats 
Oil prices have been weak for almost two years now  In view of the extended slump  it is quite natural that analysts had taken this into consideration while issuing their earnings per share estimates for the airlines  With cheap oil already factored in  it is clear that the reason behind the bottom line outperformance lies elsewhere 
In fact  analysts had slashed their first quarter estimates in the wake of multiple headwinds plaguing the industry  The downward revisions resulted in a highly conservative Zacks Consensus Estimate which made it easier for companies to record a beat  To illustrate our point  let s take a look at Chicago based United Continental Holdings  Inc   UAL   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2016 earnings for this carrier was  1 17  down 54 8  from the comparable figure in the fourth quarter of 2015 
Brexit
On Jun 24  Britons voted in favor of exiting the European Union  As had been widely expected  the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world  rattling the global financial market  Airline stocks too have been hit hard with fears of travel demand slackening  In fact  the Brexit decision has worsened matters for U S  airlines with exposure to Britain  According to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   with Brexit materializing  U K  s air passenger market is expected to shrink in the band of 3  to 5  by 2020 
Rise in Terror Attacks 
The mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando  described as the worst in the history of the U S   and an explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport on Jun 12 have hit airline stocks hard  However  these are not the only instances of terror attacks in recent times  The disappearance of the EgyptAir jet in May is also feared to a victim of terrorism  Such acts of terror impact airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears  For instance  the Brussels attacks in March impacted Delta Air Lines  revenues substantially in the first quarter of 2016 
On May 31  the U S  State Department issued a global travel alert to U S  citizens citing the possibility of more terrorist attacks  Meanwhile  European carrier Ryanair Holdings  RYAAY  recently stated that it expects a widespread cut in airfares as terror attacks usually have a direct impact on travel demand  Moreover  travel company Thomas Cook revealed that summer bookings had declined 5  in May from a year ago  Such fears were also reflected by the IATA projection which expects passenger travel growth  6 2   in 2016 to be less than that recorded in 2015  7 4   
Unit Revenues 
In the past few quarters  key revenue metric PRASM  a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier  impacted revenues for most of the carriers  Lower fuel surcharges on international flights due to reduced oil prices have been one of the main reasons behind the persistent decline in PRASM  Consequently  plunging oil prices have become a double edged sword for airlines 
That PRASM will continue to hurt stocks can be made out from the second quarter projections  United Continental expects consolidated PRASM to decline in the band of 6 5  to 8 5  for the second quarter while American Airlines forecasts a 6  to 8  drop in the metric  Low cost carrier JetBlue Airways  JBLU  now predicts a 7 5  to 8 5  decline in preliminary revenue per available seat mile  RASM  for the second quarter of 2016 as compared to a 7  decline projected earlier  The company has also lowered its capacity guidance for the year  Projected ASM growth has been slashed to a range of 8  9 5  from 8 5  10 5  expected earlier 
Woes related to capacity and pricing have been haunting investors in the airline space for quite some time  Investors fear that capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain weak  Capacity woes are likely to continue to hurt carriers in 2016  as has been predicted by the IATA  which expects capacity growth  6 8   to outpace traffic expansion  6 2   
Repatriation Issues
With economies like Venezuela and Nigeria are in the doldrums  the airlines operating in the belageaured nations  with dwindling foreign exchange reserves  are facing tough times with regard to repatriation  In the wake of such issues  United Continental Holdings announced its decision to terminate flights connecting Houston and Lagos from Jul 1  thereby exiting Africa completely  According to a  report  the Nigerian economy owed approximately  575 million  in airfares  to the airlines  as of Mar 31  2016  The report also revealed FX reserves declining to as low as  26 5 billion leading to dollar repatriation being limited 
The story is no different in Venezuela as carriers like LATAM Airlines Group and Lufthansa  DLAKY  recently decided to suspend operations in the recession hit nation 
Shareholders  Revolt
Problems on the labor front are not unique to airlines  Earlier in the year  United Continental faced opposition from some of its shareholders  Hedge funds PAR Capital Management  Inc  and Altimeter Capital Management  L P  who collectively have a 7 1  stake in the company  were apparently dissatisfied with the company s performance and expressed their lack of faith in the current leadership  The issue has been settled for now with United Continental giving in to the demands  However  occurrence of such events dampens investor confidence in the stock to a large extent 
Other Challenges
Apart from the issues cited above  outbreaks of diseases like the Zika virus  technical glitches and disputes similar to the ongoing one between legacy U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts are a major threat to stocks in the aviation sector  Moreover  continuous probes like the one by the Department of Justice into American Airlines  Delta Air Lines  United Continental Holdings and Southwest Airlines on the possibility of unlawful co ordination to limit the availability of seats with the objective of keeping airfares high also serves as a major challenge for carriers

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

U S  Carriers Sell Off in Wake of Orlando  Shanghai Attacks

Shares of major airlines stocks like Delta Air Lines  Inc      United Continental Holdings     Southwest Airlines     American Airlines Group    and JetBlue Airways Corporation     nosedived following the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando and an explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport on Jun 12  With airline stocks plummeting on the twin acts of terror at different ends of the globe  the NYSE ARCA Airline index declined 2 69  to  84 45 on Jun 13 

Orlando Mass Shooting 

In the early hours of Jun 12  an individual by the name Omar Mateen opened fire at a nightclub in Orlando  FL  The indiscriminate act of terror  described as the worst mass shooting in the history of the U S   claimed at least 50 lives and injured around 53  Those dead included the gunman 

Such acts of terrorism impact airline stocks as there is a possibility of waning travel demand due to security fears  The timing of the attacks could not have been worse as the three month period between June and August has been predicted to be the busiest one for U S  carriers in terms of air travel 

According to the forecast released by the Airlines for America   A4A   last month  approximately 231 1 million passengers will supposed to be transported by various U S  carriers during the above mentioned period  This translates into a daily traffic of 2 51 million  up 4  year over year 



Shanghai Airport Explosion 

Another violent act occurred in China on the same day  dampening the spirits of airlines  Four people were apparently injured at Shanghai s Pudong International Airport when a certain Zhou Xingbai threw an explosive laden bottle at a check in counter  Following the incidence  the attacker tried to kill himself as well 

The above explosion highlights the necessity to tighten security at airports  In the wake of the attack  Chinese carriers lost value on Jun 13 

Terror Attacks Spell Doom for Airlines

There have been quite a few acts of terror across the globe over the past few months  Last November  the Paris attacks resulted in multiple casualties and injured many individuals  Shares of carriers like Air France KLM Group were dealt a heavy blow by the act  The Brussels attacks in Mar 2016 also hit stocks in the sector  Furthermore  the  last month resulted in a downward movement for airline stocks 

Following the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels  the U S  State Department issued a global travel alert on May 31 to U S  citizens citing the possibility of more terrorist attacks  The alert has primary been issued as Europe is likely to attract many tourists during the European Soccer Championship currently being held in France and the Catholic Church s World Youth Day scheduled to be held in Poland next month 

The Bottom Line

Even though airline stocks are benefiting immensely from the oil price slump  acts of terrorism continue to hurt stocks in the space  In fact  even the International Air Transport Association  IATA  has stated that it expects passenger travel growth  6 2   in 2016 to be less than that recorded in 2015  7 4

4 U S  Airline Stocks at Risk as U K  Votes for Brexit

	Putting all speculation to rest  the Britons have voted in favor of exiting the European Union  Results of the U K  referendum revealed that 51 9  of the votes  17 410 742  were cast in favor of Brexit while 48 1   16 141 242  opposed the notion 

	Going into details  53 2   38   51 7  and 44 3  of the participants in England  Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland  respectively  cast their votes in support of leaving the bloc after over four decades  As had been widely expected  the Brexit decision has created ripples throughout the world  rattling the global financial market 

	Following Britain s decision to depart  the pound has taken a beating  slumping to its  point in 30 years  Also  the FTSE 100 tanked over 8  immediately after the commencement of trading  The impact has been so severe that Prime Minister David Cameron announced his decision to resign by October  The effects of Brexit are expected to catastrophic as far as British markets are concerned  at least in the short term 

US Markets to Feel the Tremor

	In such a scenario  the ripple effects are expected to be felt across the Atlantic  With Britain accounting for 10  of revenues for  S P 500 players  things do not seem to be rosy for US stocks  In fact  firms in the U S  with exposure to Britain are likely to hit badly with the tumbling pound reducing U S  earnings on repatriating the income 

Airlines to Face the Brunt  

	The airline sector is already grappling with the effects of the recent terror attacks   the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando and the explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport  Fears of travel demand waning with such attacks on the rise have caused carriers like American Airlines Group    and JetBlue Airways Corp      to trade near at their 52 week lows  Apart from this  airlines are struggling with respect to unit revenues 

	The tough times for airlines is exemplified by the NYSE ARCA Airline index declining over 4  since the Orlando shootings  Moreover  the bearish effect on the industry can be gauged from the from the fact that the  Trans Airline  sector currently has a Zacks Industry Rank  204   placing it in the bottom 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  The Brexit decision has worsened matters for U S  airlines with exposure to Britain 

	In fact  European airlines like British Airways and Ryanair Holdings    might face the brunt with leisure and business travel demand taking a hit  Moreover  Britain  by virtue of its EU membership  has been part of the EU s single aviation market till today  Consequently  carriers of member states could fly freely to within members  Now with Britain exiting EU  the entire issue has become complex 

What s in Store for US Carriers 

	We expect U S  airlines to be hit by the Brexit results too  In fact  carriers with significant exposure are likely to feel the pinch more than others  The 2007 open skies agreement had facilitated the travel of U S  through the EU apart from encouraging tie ups with their European counterparts  Now with Brexit materializing  the future direction to be taken by the EU US Open Skies Agreement is anybody s guess  For now  we have identified 4 U S  carriers that could be at risk following UK s vote to leave the EU 

American Airlines Group Inc   Based in Fort Worth  Texas  the carrier has high exposure to Britain mainly due to its partnership with British Airways  The partnership apart  the carrier apparently has a higher exposure to UK than its peers with respect to capacity with  focused on the nation 

Delta Air Lines  Inc        Based in Atlanta  GA  the carrier operates quite a number of flights to Britain and has a significant stake in British airline  Virgin Atlantic  Last month  Delta strengthened its ties with Virgin Atlantic  The carriers altered their respective schedules for the summer of 2017 to facilitate travel between the U S  and the U K  The introduction of four weekly flights connecting Portland and London from May 26  2017  was the highlight of the program  The Brexit vote has tossed the future of this partnership 

United Continental Holdings       This Chicago based carrier flies extensively to the U K  which could hurt its profits substantially  In fact  the carrier is likely to be affected the most according to an Investors  News Daily report 

Alaska Air Group   This Seattle  WA based owner of Alaska Airlines might also feel the pinch of Britain s departure  The carrier has a partnership with British Airways for some of its key routes  Usually passengers travelling domestically with Alaska book the carry forward trip on one of its partner airlines such as British Airways  With the pound losing value with respect to the U S  dollar  traffic from Britain will is likely to suffer  As a result  Alaska s revenue and volumes would decline on domestic routes which serve as connectors for trans Atlantic destinations

Good Times to Continue for Airlines  IATA Says So

Stocks in the airline space have hit a purple patch in spite of a few adverse factors  The decline in oil prices since mid 2014 has been a major boon for the stocks in this space  Meanwhile  the release of the profit forecast for 2016 by the International Air Transport Association  IATA  unveils a bright picture  again  thanks to cheap oil 

Soft oil prices have resulted in massive savings for carriers  courtesy a sharp reduction in their operating expenses as fuel costs represent a significant chunk of airline costs  Despite the recent rally  oil prices are still hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  a long way off the highs of mid 2014 when the commodity had traded in excess of  100 a barrel  Naturally  this has aided the bottom line of carriers significantly resulting in impressive performances with respect to earnings per share 

Profitability Forecast

At its Annual General Meeting in Dublin  the IATA increased its projection for 2016 global net profit for the industry to  39 4 billion from the earlier  36 3 billion  The comparable 2015 figure was  35 3 billion  In the event of the forecast coming true  2016 would be the fifth successive year of profit improvement for the airline industry 

The bulk of the global profits   22 9 billion  is expected to come from the North American region  The other regions  namely  Asia Pacific  Europe  Latin America  Middle East and Africa are expected to generate post tax net profit of  7 8 billion   7 5 billion   0 1 billion and  1 6 billion  respectively  African carriers are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2016  suffering losses to the tune of  0 5 billion 

Global net profit margin is expected to expand to 5 6  in 2016 from 4 9  a year ago  The top line is however projected to shrink 1 3  to  709 billion with passenger revenues dropping 1 3  to  511 billion and cargo revenues recorded a decline  Cargo demand is expected to grow only 2 1   below the 2015 growth levels 

According to the forecast  2016 is expected to see air travel growth of 6 2  compared with 7 4  growth witnessed last year  Capacity is projected to increase by 6 8  in 2016 as opposed to the 6 7  increase seen in 2015  According to the forecast  load factor    of seats filled by passengers  for 2016 is expected to decline 40 basis points to 80  due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth  Yield is projected to decline 7  and unit costs are expected to reduce by 7 7  

The research firm has also predicted that airline companies will earn  10 42 per passenger in 2016  The firm holds that oil prices will continue to fall in 2016 with the average price in the year hovering around  45 per barrel  down 16 5   Fuel expenses are expected to decline considerably to  127 billion in 2016 

Although it is a fact that most carriers hedge at least some of their fuel costs  the majority of them should still continue to benefit considerably from the plunge in oil prices  Notably  carriers use a combination of calls  swaps and collars at varying WTI crude equivalent price levels to hedge fuel costs 

IATA Forecast Follows Bullish A4A View

The rosy picture painted by the IATA for North American carriers  which include the likes of United Continental Holdings Inc      Delta Air Lines     Southwest Airlines Co      JetBlue Airways Corp     and American Airlines Group     comes close on the heels of the forecast provided by Airlines for America   A4A    According to the projection  the three month period between June and August will be the busiest one for U S  carriers in terms of air travel 

Headwinds Remain

Despite the benefits driven mainly by low oil prices  carriers are not bereft of headwinds  Issues like capacity woes  declining passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM   multiple probes and labor strife continue to hurt stocks in the space  These headwinds resulted in the NYSE ARCA Airline index losing 3 67  so far in 2016 

It is no secret that pricing and capacity worries have plagued airline stocks for quite some time  That capacity woes will continue to hurt carriers in 2016 was revealed by the IATA which expects capacity growth  6 8   to outpace traffic expansion  6 2    According to the report  capacity expansion has outpaced traffic growth for carriers in all regions except Latin America

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

U S  Carriers Sell Off in Wake of EgyptAir Tragedy

Shares of major airlines stocks like United Continental Holdings      Southwest Airlines    and American Airlines Group     lost ground following the disappearance of an EgyptAir jet  With airline stocks plummeting on the news  the NYSE ARCA Airline index declined 1 48  to  83 62 on May 19 

According to various media reports  EgyptAir  MS804   which was flying from Paris to Cairo  dropped off the radar over the Mediterranean sea  Apparently  56 passengers and 10 crew members were on board the Airbus Group SE s    A320  According to latest media report  debris from the plane were found in the Mediterranean Sea 

Will Travel Demand Drop 

According to a Bloomberg report  Egypt s aviation minister Sherif Fathy cited terrorism as a probable cause behind the incident  If the speculations come true  this would mark the second major terror act in the aviation space  We remind investors that in March this year  terror attacks at the Brussels airport and the Maelbeek metro station in central Brussels claimed over 25 lives and injured more than 200 people 

The disappearance of the EgyptAir jet liner and the subsequent fear of another terror attack hit tourism stocks with the effect spreading to the U S  based airline stocks which lost value on apprehensions of a fall in travel demand in Europe  We note that major airline stocks have a strong presence in the European market  For instance  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  had stated during its first quarter conference call that the trans Atlantic market is responsible for 15  to 20  of its revenues  No wonder  the fear of a fall in air travel demand has hit U S  airline stocks hard 

Terror Attacks  A Major Concern

Even though airline stocks are benefiting immensely from the oil price slump  acts of terrorism continue to hurt stocks in the space  In fact  such attacks are becoming alarmingly more frequent  The March Brussels attacks impacted Delta s top line in the first quarter of 2016 while the attacks in Paris last year had impacted Air France KLM SA    

Apart from terror attacks  challenges like outbreaks of diseases like the Zika virus and disputes similar to the ongoing one between legacy U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts are a major threat to aviation stocks 

Although it has not yet been proved conclusively that the flight from Paris to Cairo was a victim to another terror act  we believe that in the event of it being proved so  travel to Europe will take a hit  In case of a drop in demand during the peak summer season  U S  airline stocks would suffer as trans Atlantic flights generate a significant portion of their revenues

Earnings Beats Galore for Airlines  Is All Well Otherwise 

As the first quarter earnings season draws to a close  we take note of the impressive bottom line performances posted by many of the airline stocks  On taking a closer look at the releases  it is clear that cheap oil has notably benefitted the airlines  bottom lines 

It is a well documented fact that cheap oil has helped airline stocks cut operating expenses to a great extent  The substantial savings has thus helped the carriers boost their shareholder friendly  dividends  buybacks  and employee friendly  profit sharing  activities 

Is Cheap Oil to Be Thanked 

The first quarter of 2016 has seen major airline companies like Delta Air Lines  Inc      Southwest Airlines Co     and American Airlines Group Inc       among others  report better than expected earnings  Meanwhile  we can take a look at the factors that might have brought about the earnings beats in this quarter 

Oil prices have been weak for over 18 months  Given the extended period of the slump  it is quite natural analysts had already taken this major tailwind for airlines into consideration while arriving at their earnings per share estimates  With cheap oil already factored in  we believe that the reason behind the earnings beats lies elsewhere 

Despite the obvious benefit from the plummeting oil prices  the airline industry is not free from headwinds ranging from passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  woes  strengthening of the U S  dollar and terror attacks  In view of these headwinds  the earnings per share estimates have been trimmed over the past few months  With the bar  pertaining to earnings estimates  being lowered significantly  courtesy the drastic downward revisions  it is of little surprise that most carriers have managed to beat the  highly conservative  Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter 

It is also to be noted that oil prices have recovered to a great extent over the past few months  Currently  oil is hovering around the  45 a barrel mark  reflecting a significant increase from the 12 year low of  26 21 recorded in February  Thus  it is clear that low oil prices have not been the factor behind the outperformance by the airlines this quarter 

In spite of the impressive earnings performances in the first quarter  there are a number of headwinds prevalent in the airline space  Let s take a look 

Roadblocks

The main headwind threatening stocks in the space is with respect to a key revenue metric PRASM  a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier   As in the past few quarters  this key metric impacted the top line of the carriers in the first quarter too  For instance  sector heavyweights such as Delta  United Continental and JetBlue Airways Corp     reported lower than expected revenues in the quarter hurt by unit revenue woes  Lower fuel surcharges on international flights due to weak oil prices have been one of the main reasons behind the persistent decline in PRASM  Consequently  plunging oil prices have become a double edged sword for carriers 

That PRASM will continue to hurt the stocks going forward too can be made out from the second quarter projections for the metric  For example  United Continental expects consolidated PRASM to decline in the band of 6 5  to 8 5  for the second quarter while American Airlines forecasts a 6  to 8  drop in the metric  Capacity related issues have also been an adverse factor 

Moreover  airline stocks have been hurt by the frequent terror attacks which have affected demand to a great extent  The Brussels attacks  in Mar 2016  impacted Delta s top line in the first quarter while the Paris assault had impacted Air France KLM SA s     revenues last year  Furthermore  outbreaks of diseases like the Zika virus and disputes similar to the ongoing one between legacy U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts pose challenges to the stocks in the airline space 

To Wrap Up

The above write up clearly suggests that despite the series of earnings beats in the first quarter  the airline space is not free from challenges  We note that despite posting an earnings beat in the first quarter on Apr 26  shares of JetBlue Airways were hurt by the 8  decline in PRASM to 11 35 cents and 7  fall in operating revenue per available seat mile to 12 41 cents  Moreover  the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline index has declined above 6  over the past month further substantiates the fact that the series of earnings beats in the airline space have failed to cheer investors

Major Airlines Bump Up Dividends  More Hikes on the Way 

It was not too long ago that stocks in the airline space were struggling on the financial front  many of them even filing for bankruptcy protection  Airlines were struggling to stay afloat in the early part of the century  grappling with issues like high fuel costs  among others  Moreover  the U S  terror attacks in Sep 2001 dealt a severe blow to airlines  To deal with such adverse factors  airlines resorted to cost cutting measures like headcount reduction 

Gloomy Backdrop

Given this gloomy background  it is no surprise that big players in the space like Delta Air Lines    had filed for bankruptcy  The Atlanta  GA based company had slipped into bankruptcy in 2005 and eventually managed to come out of it following its merger with Northwest Airlines  United Airlines had also filed for bankruptcy in 2002  The company in its current form    United Continental Holdings       was formed in 2010 following the merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines 

Meanwhile  American Airlines had filed for bankruptcy in 2011  The subsequent merger of AMR  American Airlines  parent group  and US Airways in 2013  which resulted in the formation of American Airlines Group     proved advantageous 

Oil Price Dip  A Godsend

The outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in 2014 hurt stocks immensely in the airline space  However  Ebola related fears subsided gradually and this coincided with the free fall in oil prices  With costs associated with fuel being one of the most significant expenses for airlines  soft crude prices have resulted in massive savings for carriers  thereby boosting their financial health  Naturally  this caused a massive rebound in the fortunes of airline stocks helping carriers like American Airlines and Delta Air Lines  which had filed for bankruptcy protection not too long ago  rake in huge profits 

The current financial prosperity in the airline space has prompted carriers to pay out dividends apart from engaging in activities like share buybacks and sharing of profits  Earlier this year  employees of Delta Air Lines received the highest payout in the history of corporate profit sharing programs  Low cost carrier  Southwest Airlines    made its highest profit sharing payment   620 million  this year 

American Airlines  which was earlier opposed to profit sharing  reversed its stance and embraced the scheme in Mar 2016  The much improved balance sheets of the airlines have also seen a surge in buybacks 

Uptick in Dividend Payouts

The massive savings due to cheap oil has led to major players in the space paying healthy dividends to its shareholders  a development which did not seem feasible in the days of financial crisis for carriers 

In 2015  Delta Air Lines raised its cash quarterly dividend to 13 5 cents per share  54 cents per share annualized   representing an increase of 50  over the previous payout of 9 cents per share  Last year  Southwest Airlines too raised its quarterly dividend  The payout was increased 25  to 7 5 cents per share  30 cents per share annualized  

Will More Hikes Follow 

With oil unlikely to touch the highs witnessed in mid 2014 any time soon  airlines are expected to maintain the healthy run going ahead  Despite the recent rally  crude prices have been hovering around the  45 a barrel mark  This represents a significant decline from the approximately  105 per barrel in Jul 2014 

The encouraging 2016 profitability forecast issued by the International Air Transport Association  IATA  further justifies our bullish stance on airline stocks  The trade association expects the airline industry to register profits of  36 3 billion in 2016 with a net profit margin of 5 1   That airline companies have witnessed a turn of fortunes as oil began to sink mid 2014 onward can be made out from the fact that IATA s 2016 profit projection is more than double the  17 3 billion achieved in profits in 2014 

Given this encouraging backdrop  we expect dividend hikes to continue in 2016  For example  Delta Air Lines  which made a whopping  5 9 billion in pre tax profit in 2015  is a prime candidate to raise its dividend payout this year  The likes of Southwest Airlines may also follow suit  Whatever be the final outcome we expect investors in the airline space to stay focused on this burning issue

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for EPS of  1 30  1 cent above Wall Street  with revenue expectations of  9 28 billion  right in line with the Street
Key metrics  including PRASM  continue to fall short thanks to choppy domestic pricing and weaker business travel trends
Demand for international flights have been largely subdued after terrorist attacks in Europe and currency headwinds 
Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  is soaring into its first quarter earnings this Thursday with lofty expectations  The Estimize consensus is looking for EPS of  1 30  1 cent above Wall Street  with revenue expectations of  9 28 billion  right in line with the Street  The crowd sourced community is optimistic in regards to Delta s profitability  raising EPS estimates 12  in the past 3 months  Compared to the same period last year  this represents a projected 189  increase on the bottom line  It s not surprising that Delta often tops expectations  beating Estimize in 56  of report quarters  
Delta was one of of the top performing U S  airlines in 2015  despite mixed earnings in the past 2 years  Last quarter  Delta reported better than expected results on the bottom line but missed its sales target  consistent with a year long trend of falling short on the top line  Revenue has clearly been the airline s biggest problem  continually coming in flat or negative on a year over year basis  Choppy domestic pricing on top of weaker business travel trends had a material impact on results in fiscal 2015  Moreover  key metrics including PRASM  passenger revenue per available seat mile  continue to fall short of expectations  This past week Delta announced that PRASM would be on the lower end of its guidance  likely falling 4 5  in the first quarter  
Most international airlines have seen significant demand headwinds due to currency fluctuations and the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels  Still  share price for DAL has remained strong and is up 11 95  in the last 12 months  Throughout this volatility  Delta has maintained a sound balance sheet  reducing its net debt to  6 7 billion from  15 billion at the end of 2015  This has helped drive strong free cash flow and is expected to continue as air travel demand is likely to improve  For the remainder of 2016  revenue is projected to grow 1  on a 2 to 4  capacity increase

What are you expecting for  
As airlines prepare to report fourth quarter earnings next week  the industry is in a position to report record profits  Even in a highly competitive industry  airlines have remained competitive thanks in large part to plunging oil prices  Recently  airlines made headlines when three of the largest U S  airlines announcing they will hike prices for the first time in 6 months  On Tuesday  Delta will be the first airline to report fourth quarter earnings  After impressing shareholders in Q3 2015  Delta is poised for a repeat performance come this Tuesday  With oil prices expected to remain weak for the foreseeable future  Delta should continue to experience strong revenue growth in the short term  The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  1 22 and revenue of  9 589 billion  with EPS estimates 2  higher than the Wall Street consensus  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a 56  increase in EPS and flat revenue growth  The massive savings from fuel costs has been a huge blessing which represents a massive portion of the airline s operating expenses  Consequently  Delta has increased their efforts to return value to shareholders through these promising times  During the third quarter  Delta returned over  500 million to its shareholders through dividends and buybacks  Despite improving travel demand  the airline industry has been plagued with declining passenger unit revenue  PRASM  a measure of unit revenue  and currency headwinds 
The airline industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of declining oil prices and fuel costs  Thanks to a volatile oil market  Delta posted a record Q3 and is expected to continue their upward trend  Besides oil  Delta is taking on new initiatives to boost revenue and differentiate itself in a concentrated market  The airline aims to invest  2 to  3 billion per year to improve customer satisfaction and convenience  This includes enhancing services both in the air and on the ground  including improving fleet structure  amenities  products and on board technology  Even though airline traffic and revenue has improved  Delta has been negatively impacted by currency headwinds and diminishing per unit passenger revenue  This comes as passengers are spending less on baggage fees and on board amenities per mile traveled  That being said  Delta and the airline industry can continue to be viewed favorably until the oil market stabilizes ",2016-01-19,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-delta-soar-in-a-concentrated-airline-industry-380556,380556

Oil Prices
The airlines are no doubt benefiting from weak oil prices  For a large airline company like  Delta  fuel tends to be the second largest operating cost behind labor  The company projects the average price of fuel per gallon to be  1 80 to  1 85  Last year  prices were hovering around  2 90  However  oil prices are making a comeback  having surged 25  in the past month 
The Unit Revenue Conundrum
For Delta and all other major airlines  the PRASM  passenger revenue per available seat mile  metric is critical  This unit revenue measures how much money an airline earns per mile flown by a passenger  According to company guidance  Delta is expecting a loss in this category of 4 5 5 5  for this quarter  Though better than the initial 6  loss prediction  the Atlanta based commercial airliner is positive that numbers will increase every quarter  Be on the lookout for any growth this December

A reminder that High Yield bonds have been a good risk adjusted investment over the long term Looking at that  riskiness  of the high yield asset class in another way  investors need to remember that in a company s capital structure  equities fall below bonds  no matter the bond rating  investment grade or high yield   This means that in any sort of difficult situation  the bonds get paid back first  Further  as the data above shows  high yield bonds have much lower risk as measured by volatility  annualized standard deviation   giving high yield bonds what we see as a significant return risk advantage
The major High Yield ETFs are trying to put in a bottom here  If the asset class can get over this bump in Energy and not get hit by International risks  then I d expect Junk Bonds to be moving up on many smart radar screens  
Maybe even equally important to Junk Bond s risk reward is that the asset class is now rather uncorrelated to Equities and Fixed Income risks

In this case study  we ll take a look at Delta Air Lines Inc   NYSE  DAL  and American Airlines Group Inc   NASDAQ AAL  and the staggering rise in both stocks over the past two months  Now trading at cloud nine price levels  we will address the question of whether turbulence may lie ahead for these household names and sector leaders 

DAL   Delta Air Lines Inc    AAL   American Airlines Group Inc 
As the daily chart above reflects  DAL and AAL have maintained a steadily rising price channel when applying a  of 180 trading sessions in duration 
In defining the time frame as such  we are accounting for roughly nine months of trading activity  thus reflecting the mean price that the underlying security has traded at  middle line  as well as two standard deviations above and below that price level  purple and orange regions  
Since mid October  both DAL and AAL have rallied hard off of their lows and gained a jaw dropping amount in value  In both dollar and percentage terms  AAL is the standout leader  having traded as low as  28 in mid October and just recently breaching the  50 level  a gain of over 80  
For both stocks   DMI remains above  DMI on the daily time frame  so the bulls are still in predominant control   DMI has crept up slightly in recent weeks  so the bears are beginning to take notice of potential exhaustion in the bullish run over the short term 
RSI levels for both stocks remain above 60  so the bias is to the upside until proven otherwise via the price action  In yesterday s trading session  both stocks pulled back to their 10 DMAs  with DAL closing roughly fifty cents above it   46 33 close versus its 10 DMA at  45 74   while AAL managed to close just a few dimes above it   48 31 close versus its 10 DMA at  48 14  
Notice that both stocks are showing signs of stalling out as they push the upper limit of their long term linear regression channel  A retrace to or below the mean line for both stocks may be in play if the bears pick up the pressure over the coming weeks 
Given the significant gains that both DAL and AAL have seen in such short duration  profit taking may be expected before further buying interest is spurred to compel the next leg up  The trend is up so long as the 10 DMA stays above the 21 DMA  a sustained cross of the 10 DMA below the 21 DMA would be a cautionary signal for the bulls ",2014-12-10,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/airline-stocks-flying-on-cloud-nine-235255,235255

It s been a peculiar year in capital markets  and there s definitely an uncertainty in sentiment  especially in the equity market with no real trend for investors to latch onto  It makes me think that equity investors should be proactive now and take a hard look at their portfolios for investment risk 
Speculative fervor has been reduced and while small cap stocks  initial public offerings  IPOs   biotechnology stocks  and super high valued stocks have taken it on the chin  this is not unreasonable for the longer run trend in equities 
The Dow Jones Transportation Average just hit another record high and its long term chart  while impressive  actually looks kind of scary  The capital gains are tremendous since the March 2009 low  which begs the question as to when it s going to reverse 
Historically  most of the average s declines have come in the form of short bursts of downside  peppered by several multiyear periods of non performance 
The stock market is highly unlikely to break down without a commensurate move in transportation stocks  But there is clearly room for downside in these share prices  Delta Air Lines  Inc   NYSE DAL  has doubled in value since just last September 
Caution  Caution  Caution  If you eliminate the bubble capital gains produced by stocks comprising the S P 500 index during the late 1990s and their price recovery during the mid 2000s  the long term chart still reveals an incredible performance  The crash of 1987 now looks like a blip  The 100 year chart of the S P 500 is featured below

Stocks typically are a leading indicator  but considering where they ve come from in terms of share prices  it s time to be highly cautious and make sure your portfolio is heavily weighted to quality  Risk is now more important than potential return as everything s already gone up 
I think corporate earnings were quite a bit better than expected in the first quarter  Late last year  earnings expectations came down significantly but a lot of big corporations came through anyway 
Balance sheets continue to be very good and the cost of capital extremely low  But this is priced into the marketplace 
My worry is that the correction hasn t happened yet  Stocks went flat in the beginning of 2011 for about a year and a half  then resumed their uptrend with fervor 
A full blown stock market correction would actually be a healthy development for the longer run trend  
I view 2013 as having been a breakout year for stocks  as prices were able to convincingly break out of their previous cycle  which was at a recovery period from the 2000 technology bubble 
Within a secular bull market  the U S  economy can experience another recession and the stock market can crash 
There s plenty of  irrational exuberance  in all facets of today s capital markets and investment risk with stocks remains high

196393,417909,DAL,United Continental  Looking At A Hard Landing,opinion,"Almost every airline stock has been rallying higher since late 2012  This is a time when the legacy airlines decided to merge with each other and consolidate the industry group  Now  many investors believe that the airline companies are actually a good investment  Leading airline stocks such as Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  continue to remain in solid up trends at this time on the charts  Unfortunately  UAL appears to be the weakest stock in the sector at this time 
Bearish Indication
The stock price for UAL has been steadily making lower highs on the daily chart  Lower highs on a chart are usually a bearish indication of lower prices ahead  Traders and investors should note that United Continental Holdings was trading lower mid day Thursday by 0 59 cents to  44 13 a share 
If a real decline occurs over the next few weeks  that stock will have solid weekly chart support around  36  And that s an area where United Continental should be supported by the institutional money  a level that should be a solid buying opportunity ",2014-05-29,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-continental:-looking-at-a-hard-landing-214408,214408

196398,417914,DAL,Delta Airlines Got An Oil Refinery  The Math Does Not Work ,opinion,Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM   the world s biggest energy company by market cap  reported its 4Q profit at a five year high boosted by its refining arm from growing supplies of cheap U S  oil  However  Delta Airlines  DAL  can t tell a similar success story with its newly acquired refinery   Delta paid  150 million for a Phillips 66 refinery in Trainer PA last May aiming to save  300 million a year in future fuel costs  At the time  many analysts see this acquisition as a smart fuel hedge move by Delta  However  as I previously discussed  the actual implementation of this potential fuel cost savings could be quite problematic  During a time when most refiners are reporting good earning numbers as price gain of petroleum products have outpaced stagnant WTI crude prices  Delta reported loss of  63 million at the Trainer refinery in 4Q  and expects more losses of up to  100 million in 1Q 2013  Delta chalked it up to Sandy  the super storm  However  as Platts reported that in a Dec  2012 investor call  Delta executives said Trainer plant relies on crudes at about  4 b above Brent  The plant is old and relies on expensive imported crude feedstock mostly from Nigeria    Platts concluded that Delta is most likely selling gasoline and fuel oil  distillate  at a loss based on the current crack spread  to Brent   Gasoline and fuel oil accounts for more than half of Trainer s production   Furthermore  according to Platts   Refining experts who have done computer simulations tell JFI that Trainer economics theoretically only work using a crude slate of distillate rich crudes such as Nigerian Forcados  which typically trade at a large premium to Brent crude    Also  there seems to be another indication of troubles in Delta s vertical integration strategy of purchasing a refinery as a fuel hedge  The ex oil trader turned Delta VP of Fuel  Jon Ruggles  left the company quite abruptly late last year  Ruggles  a key person behind the Trainer refinery deal  was hired away from Merrill Lynch less than a year ago to head Delta s trading operation  Rumor has it that Ruggles  exit from Delta was somehow related to losses at the Trainer plant   The latest from Delta executives is that they now expected Trainer to have  280 million in savings in 2013 and refine 80  of the airline s domestic jet fuel requirement  And there could still be hope for Trainer yet as Delta indicated in a recent SEC filing that the company is considering getting the cheaper Bakken crude by railcar  Given that transporting crude by railcar adds about  22 a barrel to the cost of oil  it is hard to imagine the economics could improve much at Trainer with the current Brent premium over WTI at only around  19 a barrel   To put it another way  if it were as easy as shipping Bakken oil via railcars  wouldn t you think ConocoPhillips  who s only been in the oil business dating back to 1875  would have figured it out long before dumping the Trainer asset   Now thinking the worst is over after extensive restructuring and consolidation in the airline sector  most Wall Street analysts have turned optimistic towards the airline industry  Delta Airlines stock has climbed 25  in the past year outperforming the broader Bloomberg United States Airline Index  which includes Delta Airlines  Investment houses like J P  Morgan already raised Delta s 1Q 2013 profit estimate  citing lower fuel prices and strong travel demand   However  the fact remains that flying is a commodity  and crude oil prices are expected to remain flat at least in the next two years due to subdued economic growth and demand  That means the same major factors that s been negatively impacting the airline sector    weak world GDP  high fuel prices and fierce competition  will still be there  at least in 2013 and 2014  with many down side risks such as the euro zone  and Iran  So in general  any increase in airline profitability would be hard earned from things like efficiency gain and capacity reduction  On top of the tough macroeconomics  Delta has one more down side risk than peers   Trainer Refinery  And  as if that s not bad enough already  Delta management projects nonfuel unit costs will increase 6  to 8  for the March quarter and 4  to 6  for fiscal 2013 due to salary increases and Capex  IATA  which represents about 80  of global carriers  forecast the average global airline industry profit margins will improve but remain thin at 2 9  in 2013  So it is hard for me to share the same optimism as JPM regarding Delta or even the airline sector as a whole  Disclosure  No Positions,2013-02-02,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-airlines-got-an-oil-refinery:-the-math-does-not-work-153438,153438
196403,417919,DAL,Goldman s Sell Rating On DAL Follows My Short Call,opinion,Friday  Goldman Sach s designated Delta Airlines  DAL  with a Sell Rating  This stock call comes two months after my note to clients recommending shorting DAL    While Goldman s call follows mine  it runs counter to S P s  confounding  decision to raise its outlook on DAL s debt  which led me to think S P has not done its diligence on DAL    Goldman s transportation analyst Tom Kim points to the flagging economic environment and high cost structure of the older carriers as key reasons behind his opinion    I agree with him and think DAL faces additional pressure from its staggering  22 3 billion in mainly off balance sheet liabilities  which include  14 1 billion in underfunded pensions and  8 2 in operating leases    Pressure on DAL s optimistic earnings outlook is building from within  pensions  and without  economy   Investors should beware    Not only is Delta underfunding its pensions  it is understating  in my opinion  the cost of its pensions in earnings  Delta s 2011 earnings would have been lat least  0 09 per share lwoer that if DAL had not chosen to use an abnormally high assumption for the expected return on the assets in its pension plan    Here s the scoop  DAL boosted its 2011 earnings by increasing its expected return on plan assets   EROPA   assumption for its pensions to 8 93   up from 8 82  in 2010   has the details    For readers who wonder whether 8 93  is abnormally high  the answer is yes  Out of the 1 021 companies with pensions that I cover  98  of them have a lower EROPA  Only 96 of the 1 021 raised their EROPAs in 2012 while 525 lowered and 400 made no changes  In other words  DAL s EROPA assumption is not only among the highest but it is also rising when the majority is falling    Raising its EROPA in 2012 looks worse when compared to my estimates of the company s actual return on plan assets  I estimate 2011 s actual return on plan assets was  0 6   I estimate the average return since the company emerged from bankruptcy is between 1 5  and 3 8   These estimates are based on dividing the  Actual  loss  gain on plan assets  by the  Fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the period   I get that data from the company s annual reports as detailed in  used to calculate the actual return on plan assets  which is based on data from the      and  10 Ks    I think S P should be considering a downgrade not an upgrade  More details are in Bail Out of DAL Before the Stock Crashes    Disclosure  I am short DAL ,2012-07-15,David Trainer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goldman’s-sell-rating-on-dal-follows-my-short-call-129619,129619
