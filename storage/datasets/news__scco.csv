In an interview with local broadcaster RPP  Energy and Mines Minister Francisco Ismodes said all five members of a government commission had voted to suspend the license during a review that is under way ",2019-08-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/peru-suspends-permit-for-southern-coppers-14-billion-tia-maria-project-1951749,1951749
114414,335929,SCCO,Here s Why Shares of Southern Copper Climbed 12  in December,news,"What happened
Extending the 20  rise they d been on from the beginning of September through the end of November  shares of Southern Copper  NYSE SCCO  an industry leader in copper production  climbed 12  last month  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence 
Besides the ongoing reaction to a late October news report regarding a long delayed project  investors responded to the prices of commodities as well as the ebbing of tension in the trade dispute between the U S  and China 

So what
Investors last month continued to be motivated by Southern Copper s announcement from the end of October announcing the Peruvian government s granting of a construction permit for the Tia Maria project  Estimated to have a development budge of  1 4 billion  Tia Maria has potential annual copper production of 120 000 tons  according to Southern Copper s management  The government s decision is notable  considering the development of the controversial project had been delayed in 2011 and 2015 over opposition from locals concerned about the adverse environmental impact of the mine 
The greater catalyst  however  for the stock s movement was simply the rise in the price of copper  Since there s a high correlation between the price of commodities and mining companies that deal in them  the increased buying of Southern Copper s stock is unsurprising  since the average price of copper in December was  2 77    its highest level since April  when its monthly average was  2 92 
Besides copper  the 6 9  rise in the price of silver through the month also figured prominently in shareholders  thoughts as they remembered management s 2019 forecast from the Q3 conference call  Estimating silver production of 19 7 million ounces  Southern Copper believes it will achieve a 14  increase in silver production compared with 2018  so the rise in the price of the metal is certainly of interest to shareholders 
Lastly  the seeming cooling of tensions regarding the trade dispute between the U S  and China excited shareholders    especially since many analysts project that a resolution to the dispute will result in higher copper prices  Between the mid December announcement that there was agreement regarding phase one of the trade deal and the apparent confidence that progress was being made toward phase two  investors felt inspired to pick up shares of Southern Copper 
Now what
While there seems to be some momentum growing toward the construction of Tia Maria  the project is likely to face continued opposition from local communities  possibly portending further delays in its development  Therefore  investors shouldn t interpret the Peruvian government s decision as a guarantee that the mine s development will proceed smoothly  In regard to the rise in copper and silver prices  savvy investors recognize the cyclical nature of commodity prices  and they know that this  in and of itself  is a poor foundation to base an investment 
Nonetheless  investors with a long term perspective    our favorite type of investors    would be well served to consider Southern Copper  as it represents one of the more compelling options among copper stocks ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdeer,2052334

from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Top Stock Reports for Johnson   Johnson  Chevron and AdobeThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  Chevron and Adobe  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see all of today s research reports here    Johnson   Johnson s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry so far this year   4 1  vs   0 1    The Zacks analyst thinks J J is likely to witness significant generic biosimilar headwinds in the Pharma unit in 2019  However  J J s sales and earnings growth is expected to accelerate in 2020  supported by contribution from new drugs like Tremfya and successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and immunology drug  Stelara  J J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions  It has already gained FDA approval for two new drugs in 2019  Balversa and Spravato  Meanwhile  share buybacks and restructuring initiatives should provide bottom line support  Headwinds like biosimilar generic competition and pricing pressure remain  Allegations that its talc products contain asbestos  which causes users to develop ovarian cancer  continue to be an overhang on the stock Shares of Chevron have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry in the past six months   1 8  vs   1 9    The Zacks analyst thinks Chevron s financial results have greatly improved over the past few quarters  primarily aided by surging production and free cash flow turnaround  In fact  Chevron s free cash flow and upstream production for 2018 hit a record  The company s existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  targeting a CAGR of 3 4  through 2023 thanks to the planned expansion in the Permian Basin  Moreover  growing free cash flow should enable Chevron to deliver stable and rising dividends in the foreseeable future  However  there are worries of a drop in its downstream earnings  Meanwhile  Chevron s decision to walk away from the Anadarko transaction meant that the company lost the chance to significantly augment its substantial Permian holdings  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point Adobe s shares have gained  10 3  over the past year  underperforming the Zacks Software industry which has increased  20 5  over the same period  However  the Zacks analyst thinks Adobe is riding high on benefits gained from the Magento and Marketo acquisitions  Further  increasing demand for its creative products is driving top line growth  The company has been making great efforts toward establishing its presence in cloud related areas such as documents and marketing  Adobe s market position  compelling product lines  continued innovation  solid adoption of Creative Cloud and Adobe marketing cloud provides cause for optimism  Estimates have been stable ahead of the company s Q2 earnings release  The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters  However  lower end market demand and exposure to Europe remain overhangs  Further  high acquisition expenses do not bode well for margin expansion Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Las Vegas Sands and

before the opening bell Which Way are the Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter revenues suggests growth of 13 2  to  1 45 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 56 cents for the quarter  suggesting a 60  jump from the year ago quarter Q4 PerformanceIn the last reported quarter  the company s earnings beat the Zacks

are currently pegged at 66 cents per share and 56 cents per share  respectively Zacks Rank  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3  Key Factors to ConsiderIncreased spending on construction activity in the United States and favorable markets in Poland are likely to have contributed to the company s first quarter fiscal performance The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Americas Recycling segment s revenues is pegged at  238 million for the to be reported quarter  suggesting a decline of 21 2  from the year ago quarter  However  the segment is expected to report an operating loss of  0 98 million  as against the operating profit of  15 4 million recorded in the year ago quarter For the Americas Mills segment revenues  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at  763 million  projecting 26 7  year on year growth from the prior year quarter s  602 million  The segment s operating profit is projected at  135 million  indicating an improvement of 18 4  from the  114 million reported in the prior year quarter  Benefits from the acquisition of certain U S  rebar steel mill and fabrication assets from Gerdau S A  production of spooled material at the Arizona micro mill  expansion of finished goods production capacity at the Polish facility and strong rebar demand at the micro mill in Durant  OK  will likely have aided the company s performance in the to be reported quarter The Americas Fabrication segment is anticipated to report revenues of  591 million in the fiscal first quarter  indicating a 35 2  jump from the  437 million recorded in the year ago quarter  The segment is expected to report an operating profit of 75 cents per share as against the prior year quarter s operating loss of 37 cents The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the International Mill segment s revenues is currently pegged at  172 million for the fiscal first quarter  suggesting a decline of 24 2  from the prior year quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s operating income is  8 43 million for the quarter  indicating a slump of 74 3  from the year ago reported figure Nevertheless  inflationary pressures on manufacturing costs due to a tight labor market  and consumable raw material prices are expected to have dented the company s margins in the quarter  Furthermore  its debt to equity ratio has gone up to fund the acquisition of certain U S  rebar steel mill and fabrication assets from Gerdau S A  Consequently  the company s margins in the quarter under review are expected to reflect the negative impact of higher interest expense Stocks Worth a

114454,335969,SCCO,Expansion Projects To Drive Southern Copper  Debt Rises,opinion,On Jan 21  we issued an updated research report on Southern  NYSE SO  Copper Corporation   NYSE SCCO    The company continues to witness the benefits of cost reduction programs and expansion actions  Backed by its constant commitment to increasing low cost production and growth investments  Southern Copper is well positioned to continue delivering enhanced performance  However  high debt and lower copper production for fiscal 2018 at its Buenavista SX EW plant remain concerns  Expansion Projects to Drive Growth In 2019  the company anticipates reaching full capacity at its new Toquepala concentrator and recover production at the San Martin mine  In order to restart operations at the San Martin mine  the company has undertaken a major renovation initiative with an estimated capital budget of  77 million  Once in operation  it will have an annual production capacity of 20 000 tons of zinc  2 8 million ounces of silver  8 000 tons of copper and 1 000 tons of lead  Consequently  the company anticipates an increase of 13  in production of copper  38  in zinc  31  in silver and 21  in molybdenum in 2019 compared with the 2017 levels  At the average prices of the third quarter  these production enhancements would represent sales accretion of more than  800 million  In Mexico  the company has a planned investment of  413 million in the Buenavista Zinc Sonora project which includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80 000 tons of zinc and 20 000 tons of additional copper annually  Once completed  this new zinc concentrator is likely to double the company s zinc production capacity  An investment of  159 million is estimated for Pilares Sonora project in Mexico which consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35 000 tons of copper in concentrates  It will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade  In Peru  a new state of the art concentrator for  1 3 billion at the Toquepala project will increase annual production by 100 000 tons to reach 258 000 tons in 2019  reflecting an increase of 74   In addition to these  the company has number of other projects that it may develop in the future  Notably  the company expects to reach 1 5 million tons of copper production by 2025  Peru  A Key Catalyst In June 2018  Southern Copper completed the acquisition of Michiquillay project in Cajamarca  Peru  which boasts mineral resources of 1 150 million tons and a copper grade of 0 63   It will produce 225 000 tons of copper annually and by products such as molybdenum  gold and silver  at a very competitive cash cost  Michiquillay offers immense growth opportunities for the company and fits into its portfolio of mining projects in the Americas  especially in Peru  It is likely to become one of the largest copper mines in Peru  The new administration in Peru is expected to provide stability  economic growth and social progress along with a favorable environment for the company to develop its projects of Tia Maria  Los Chancas and Michiquillay  with a combined investment of  6 7 billion  Once operational  these projects will increase the Peruvian copper production by about 500 000 tons  Peru is currently the second largest producer of copper and its national output is expected to hit 4 8 million ton per year by 2021   double the output of 2017  Increase in Long Term Metal Prices to Boost Revenues Copper production has recently been affected by persistent decline in investments  Notably  this issue has been plaguing several companies in recent years  On top of this  labor unrest  excess government taxation and technical difficulties are impacting production further  All these factors will restrict supply growth while demand is on the rise for the metal given its demand across a gamut of industries  This demand supply imbalance will eventually drive copper prices  Molybdenum prices are set to increase on the back of healthy demand from the oil and gas industry  and decline in supply growth  Long term fundamentals for zinc remain strong due to its significant industrial consumption and expected mine production shutdowns  Further  silver prices are likely to gain driven by its industrial use and impending demand supply imbalance  Lower production at Buenavista SX EW plant to Impact Results In the first nine month period of 2018  copper production decreased 0 3  year over year dragged down by a lower production at the Buenavista SX EW plant  This can be attributed to the lower solubility index in the new leach pads and the characteristics of the ore that is being deposited in such pads  The company has developed a 12 month corrective program to overcome this temporary reduction in production  Though the company expects a sequential increase of 18  in copper production for the facility in the to be reported fourth quarter  it has led to lower production for the full year  The company has cut down copper production guidance for fiscal 2018 to 885 000 tons from the prior 901 000 tons  Further  copper prices have been subdued due to the trade tussle between the United States and China  This is likely to weigh on Southern Copper s near term results  Further  the company s debt to equity ratio is currently at 90   which is a cause of concern   Shares of Southern Copper have dipped 35 5  in the last year  compared with the  s decline of 37 8   Southern Copper currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A few better ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Ingevity Corporation   NYSE NGVT    Cameco Corporation   NYSE CCJ   and Israel Chemicals Ltd    NYSE ICL    All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You

114456,335971,SCCO,Southern Copper Rides On Expansion Projects  Debt Rises,opinion,On Mar 6  we issued an updated research report on Southern  NYSE SO  Copper Corporation   NYSE SCCO    Backed by its constant commitment to increasing low cost production and growth investments  the company is well positioned to continue delivering enhanced performance  However  current weakness in copper prices and high debt levels will affect its near term results  Lowest Cost  Largest Copper Reserves  A Competitive Edge The company continues to witness benefits of cost reduction programs and it obtained cash cost reduction of 5 3  to 87 cents per pound in 2018  despite an increase of 16 5  in fuel cost and other materials  Considering last year s average prices for its main products  Southern Copper expects cash cost to average 80 cents per copper pound in 2019  an additional reduction of 8   fortifying its leadership as a low cost producer  Further  Southern Copper boasts of the largest copper reserves in the industry  and operates high quality and world class assets in investment grade countries  such as Mexico and Peru  As of Dec 31  2018  its copper ore reserves  calculated at a copper price of  2 90 per pound  totaled 69 7 million tons of contained copper  Backed by a positive market outlook  constant commitment to increasing low cost production and growth investments  the company is well poised to continue delivering enhanced performance  Expansion Projects to Drive Growth Southern Copper completed the construction of the Toquepala concentrator expansion during the fourth quarter of 2018 for  1 3 billion  At the end of 2018  it was producing at about 60  of capacity  It is expected to reach full capacity by the beginning of the second quarter of 2019  This expansion project will increase Toquepala s annual copper production to 258 000 tons in 2019  a 52  production increase for this operation compared with last year  For 2019  the company projects total copper production of 986 700 tons  higher than the 883 689 tons produced in 2018  In Mexico  the company has a planned investment of  413 million in the Buenavista Zinc Sonora project which includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80 000 tons of zinc and 20 000 tons of additional copper annually  Once completed  this new zinc concentrator is likely to double the company s zinc production capacity  An investment of  159 million is estimated for Pilares Sonora project in Mexico which consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35 000 tons of copper in concentrates  It will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade  In addition to these  the company has number of other projects that it may develop in the future  Notably  the company expects to reach 1 5 million tons of copper production by 2025  Peru  A Key Catalyst In June 2018  Southern Copper completed the acquisition of Michiquillay project in Cajamarca  Peru  which boasts mineral resources of 1 150 million tons and a copper grade of 0 63   It will produce 225 000 tons of copper annually and by products such as molybdenum  gold and silver  at a very competitive cash cost  Michiquillay offers immense growth opportunities for the company and fits into its portfolio of mining projects in the Americas  especially in Peru  It is likely to become one of the largest copper mines in Peru  Southern Copper s board approved projects in Peru with a total capital budget of  2 9 billion of which  1 8 billion have already been invested  Taking the Michiquillay   2 5 billion  and Los Chancas   2 8 billion  projects into consideration  the company s total investment program in Peru amounts to  8 2 billion  Peru is currently the second largest producer of copper and its national output is expected to hit 4 8 million ton per year by 2021   double the output of 2017  Low Copper Prices  High Debt  Near term Concerns During fourth quarter 2018  the LME per pound copper price decreased 9 3  to  2 80  from average of  3 09 in the prior year quarter  This fall in prices reflected the market uncertainty with regard to a possible escalation of trade protectionism between the United States and China  The company s debt to equity ratio is currently at 90   which is also a cause of concern  Metal Prices to Pick Up in the Long Term Notwithstanding the current low copper prices  the impending demand supply imbalance will eventually drive copper prices  Copper production has recently been affected by persistent decline in investments  Notably  this issue has been plaguing several companies in recent years  On top of this  labor unrest  excess government taxation and technical difficulties are impacting production further  All these factors will restrict supply growth while demand is on the rise for the metal given its requirement across a gamut of industries   Molybdenum prices are set to increase on the back of healthy demand from the oil and gas industry  and decline in supply growth  Long term fundamentals for zinc remain strong due to its significant industrial consumption and expected mine production shutdowns  Further  silver prices are likely to gain driven by its industrial use and impending demand supply imbalance   Shares of Southern Copper have plunged 34 1  in the last year  compared with the  s decline of 31 5   Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Southern Copper currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Ingevity Corporation

114489,336004,SCCO,Chart Of The Day  Copper s Uptrend Continues,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Don t Be Scared By Today s Commodity Fall
The first rule of trading is  buy low  sell high   Simple enough  isn t it  It s obvious  Well  if it were indeed so simple  why do so few traders make money  Turns out  it isn t so simple 
An asset is low because it has fallen from a higher price  Not many investors are willing to put their hand out and catch a falling commodity  This type of trading takes guts 
Today s commodity slide is just such a scare  China s data suggests that growth has calmed down over the past month  That s still well within the range of a healthy economy  Which continues to bode well for the red metal  a key base metal for any economic expansion  Here are the salient facts for copper at this time 

It s set for a 26 percent annual gain  its largest since 2010 
Open interest on the red metal  or the number of open contracts  is the highest in 18 months  The herd mentality and a high level of gains are most likely the result of this year s rally  which means that more open contracts are betting prices will rise 
Ignoring the volatility of monthly changes  profits of China s industrial companies in October actually rose 25 1 percent on a YoY basis 
Unionized workers at the largest mine in the world  BHP Billiton s  NYSE BHP  Escondida copper mine in Chile threatened a second strike over the company s planned layoffs  and workers for the two largest unions at Southern Copper Corporation  NYSE SCCO  in Peru threatened an indefinite strike on Wednesday if they don t get a fair share of mining profits 


In addition to being in a long term uptrend since January 2016  the commodity is also in an uptrend in the midterm  trading within a rising channel  Even ignoring the long term trend and focusing on the price from September alone  you can see that today s decline is meaningless  Traders who ignore the crowds are actually hopeful for a continued decline for another couple of days  to reach the expected support of the uptrend line where demand comes in to hit the price back toward the channel top 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders should wait for the price to fully return to the uptrend line and wait for confirmation of its support  with an up day that would cover the preceding down day  Should the current rate of decline remain steady  it would probably reach the uptrend line in 2 or 3 days  at around  6 800 
Moderate traders would be happy with a return to the uptrend line and not necessarily wait for a confirmation more than just a close above the uptrend line 
Aggressive traders may wait for a partial return to the uptrend line to gain a better entry  with a reduced chance of whipsaw  as well as a better risk reward ratio to the former  October 16   7 176 25 peak  We might expect resistance at this level by sellers who remember the 6 4 percent decline from  7 176 25 to  6 713 50  on November 15  a day shy of a month later  A long entry at the current rate of  6 937 would provide a 1 2 risk reward ratio between the testing of the October 16 peak and the uptrend line 
Very aggressive traders may enter a long right now  aiming past the October peak  counting on a resumption of the uptrend  The October peak rallied 2 85 percent past its former  September   6 968 50 peak  while even a one percent higher rally would allow the classic 1 3 risk reward ratio ",2017-11-27,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day-200268324,200268324

114523,336038,SCCO,Finally  Good News For Mining In Peru,opinion,"Ricardo Carri n and Alberto Arispe of Peru based Kallpa Securities have a boots on the ground view of the politics  legal battles and investment climate for precious metals mining in the Andes  In this interview with The Mining Report  Arispe and Carri n detail the new  positive developments afoot in this region and explain why investors should get involved now  before the rest of the world catches on 
The Mining Report  What percentage of Peru s known precious metal base resource reserve is under active development 
Ricardo Carri n  There are many large projects currently in development in Peru by companies such as Southern Peru Copper Corp   NYSE SCCO   Anglo American Plc  LONDON AAL   Chinalco  Aluminum Corporation of China Limited   NYSE ACH   Minmetals Resources Ltd    1208 HKSE   Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  and Compa ia de Minas Buenaventura  NYSE BVN   There are also projects on hold for the moment because of social issues  The bottom line is that about 60  of the precious metals resource base is active  and there are a substantial number of projects waiting in the pipeline 
TMR  At the governmental level in Peru  what policy and economic changes are positively affecting mining operations 
Alberto Arispe  A year or so ago  the administration of Peru President  Ollanta Humala  began accelerating the process of permitting mining operations  What makes this interesting is that Humala won the 2011 national elections on a very anti mining platform  The market was quite scared of what might happen in Peru  The Humala administration changed the tax regime for mining companies  it slightly increased royalties and taxes  This was viewed positively by the market  which had feared a much higher increase  Then there was a period during which the government was neutral on the mining industry 
But toward mid 2012  the administration in Lima began to implement a series of reforms that make the permitting process much more efficient  This was in response to the huge Conga project being paralyzed by protests from the locals  The government is now much more active in mediating the conflicts surging between the mining companies and the local communities  For example  the government is investing a lot of money and roundtables to change anti mining politics  A clear and good example is the intervention of the government to support the Ca ariaco projects  currently in hands of Candente Copper Corp   TO DNT   A result of this negotiation is the establishment of an S  140 million  S  140M  around  50M  fund to develop the economy in the project area 
Another junior player that benefitted from this new approach is Southern Legacy Minerals Inc   TO LCY   The government will not only provide funding for the development of the communities around the mine but also will take charge of most of the environmental liabilities created by informal miners and previous operators 
TMR  Are those volatile local issues environmental issues or wage labor issues 
AA  Some of the local leaders are environmentalists  but in my opinion  the problems are mainly political  The local leaders gain popularity and votes by saying that they are defending the local community and the environment against the abusive mining companies  They say that there is environmental contamination  But the people of Cajamarca  which is where the Conga project is  are becoming increasingly distressed that Cajamarca is one of the few regions in Peru that is not growing economically  It is one of the two poorest regions in Peru  in fact  Because of the mining industry  other regions have been able to reduce their poverty rates  The elections for regional governors at the end of this year are very important for the mining industry  A lot of pro mining leaders are running against a lot of anti mining leaders 
TMR  What are the different directions that the year end elections could go 
RC  Mining is always the first item on the agenda of candidates running for president of a regional government  As you know  controversial items always are given more weight during campaigns and mining is one of them  In 2011  there was a face off between a leftist candidate and a candidate from the right  The candidate from the left won and there was a lot of political and market volatility  The worst is over  All of the candidates  or at least most of them  now understand the economic importance of mining 
TMR  Given that there is still opportunity for political volatility  why are you so bullish 
AA  There just was a Peruvian high court ruling in a dispute involving Bear Creek Mining Corp   TO BCM   which is a Canadian junior company with assets in southern Peru in Puno  In 2011  there was a revolt in Puno over Bear Creek s Santa Ana project and the local communities blocked the project  The police killed protestors  It was a disaster  President Alan Garc a took the license for the project away from Bear Creek 
Bear Creek s stock dropped more than 50   But the company stayed alive because during this time  Bear Creek was able to keep working its Corani project  which is bigger than Santa Ana  Now the courts have ordered the government to restore Bear Creek s mining license 
In Peru  mining investments represent nearly 12  of GDP  Mining represents 30  of governmental revenues and 60  of exports  The government needs this money from the mining industry to continue with its social programs  That is why it has turned more friendly to the industry  All of us want the government to be more proactive and accelerate permitting to get the mining industry moving faster 
TMR  We have talked in the past about Trevali Mining Corp  s  TO TV  Peruvian operations  Its stock price has responded well of late to a new financial arrangement that reduces its debt load  How does that affect the outlook for Trevali s Santander mine in Peru 
RC  The focus of Trevali s management is currently on developing its Canadian properties  specifically the Caribou project in New Brunswick  Trevali just released the preliminary economic assessment  PEA  for the Caribou mine  and the market has responded nicely  Trevali is one of the few companies with real exposure to zinc  Most of the analysts in the market are very bullish on zinc today because low supply is projected for the next five years  which will boost the price  of course 
We feel that Trevali s stock remains undervalued  however  because of the strength of the Santander mine in Peru  It is expected to produce around 10 million tons of material 7  zinc  It is positioned to go from 2 000 tons per day to 4 000 tons per day during the next two years  And Trevali is exploring additional properties in Peru 
TMR  Does Trevali have competitors in Peru 
RC  Peru lists a lot of polymetallic companies  Trevali  however  enjoys a dual listing in Canada  as well as in Peru  And Trevali s Peruvian liquidity is excellent  It does have zinc competitors in Peru  but these are only locally listed companies  The only comparable company is Sierra Metals Inc   TO SMT   Sierra has the benefit of having a well known polymetallic asset that has been in operation for decades  the Yauricocha mine  which is owned through the subsidiary and locally listed company  Mincor  In Mexico Sierra operates the Cusi and Bolivar mines  Those mines have a great history in terms of silver production  We also overweight the benefit of having a geographical diversification Peru and Mexico 
Sierra has put a lot of effort and funds to improve these operations  In the case of Yauricocha  it is developing a 5 5 kilometer tunnel that will benefit the current production  The completion of this work will occur sometime this year  One aspect to take into account is that the subsidiary is valued at a higher level than the parent company  Mincor currently has a market cap of  260M and Sierra s is  246M  In the case of Bolivar  the only pending item is to connect the mine to the national grid  This event can boost the production from 2 000 tpd to 2 500 tpd  Regarding Cusi  we see significant potential  mainly because Sierra will allocate this year US 8 5M in exploration and mine development  the largest investment scheduled by Sierra in 2014  As a matter of fact  we witnessed good results early this year with the discovery of a high grade zone named Azucarera  This demonstrates the aggressive strategy that the company is following  We were satisfied after the site visit to these mines  and it s important to remember the great potential on the exploration side  Here we have an excellent example of a company with production plus exploration catalysts for the market in the near term 
TMR  I see that Candente Copper Corp  TO DNT   which you follow  has acquired Cobriza Metals  which resulted in a share dilution  How are Candente s prospects in Peru shaping up 
RC  The acquisition was a good move for Candente Copper in Peru because Cobriza has  7M cash to deploy  Candente Copper has several well advanced projects  and it needs additional funding to complete a feasibility study for its Ca ariaco project  which is a very large copper project 
The problems with the local community that Candente faced in Peru last year are almost over  Regional elections will be held during the last quarter of this year  Investors are waiting to assess the mood of the new regional government where Ca ariaco will operate  It is a big operation with 9 billion pounds of copper in the ground that can be exploited during the next three decades  As I mentioned before  the national government is supporting Candente by spending S  140M for the improvement of the local economy  The government is also trying to mediate conflicting interests between the firm and the local people through roundtables  The next months will be key for Candente considering that it is almost done with the studies  The next milestone will be the application for the environmental impact assessment 
TMR  Trevali and Candente have recently undergone stock dilutions  Is there a trend for stock dilution in firms focused in Peruvian properties 
RC  A dilution that increases cash flow speeds up the development process  which is fine  A properly executed dilution can be healthy  Sometimes when investors hear the word dilution  they panic  But once they grasp the reasoning behind the dilution  the share price stabilizes 
TMR  What other companies do you like in Peru s junior environment 
RC  There are many well developed  largely derisked assets that are undervalued in Peru because of the 2013 crisis  For example  Minera IRL Ltd   TO IRL  is in the final stage of financing the construction of its Ollachea project a 2 million ounce gold project that will generate 100 000 ounces of gold per year for the next 10 years  And Minera s market cap is only  50M  Once the financing is out on the table  Minera will be an excellent pick for investors 
TMR  Is Minera financing the project by selling shares or taking on debt or a combination 
RC  Minera s financing structure includes equity and debt financing  That is a typical strategy at this stage of development 
TMR  What other companies do you like in Peru 
RC   Sulliden Gold Corp   TO SUE  has the Shahuindo project in the north of Peru  It has been quietly advancing the permitting for construction  The market was expecting a disclosure soon on how Sulliden plans to finance the project via its credit line from Credit Suisse  OTC CSGKF  and Barclays  NYSE BCS   but we all were surprised with the recent deal with Rio Alto Mining Ltd   TO RIO   Now we will see one single operation  combining Shahuindo with Rio Alto s oxide project  that can potentially achieve 300 000 ounces of gold per year in the next two or three years 
The deal occurred one day after two other junior companies announced their merger process  Southern Legacy  TO LCY  and Regulus Resources Inc   TO REG  
TMR  Is a portion of Sulliden s funding coming from within Peru 
RC  In the construction stage  companies typically go to international banks  Canadian banks  South African banks  European banks  Australian banks  There is a reason behind that  In Peru  there is just not much of a banking culture for supporting the last phase of a mining project  which is the project finance stage  Banks in Peru tend to be more conservative than in other parts of the world  The Canadian market is much more sophisticated than the Peruvian market  That is why Peru is a good niche for Canadian financial institutions interested in resource development  In this particular case  the funding can now find an interesting structure considering that Rio Alto has a nice balance sheet and cash flow 
TMR  Do you have other companies that you like in the junior space 
RC   Panoro Minerals Ltd   TO PML  has 13 properties in Peru and it is a top pick when it comes to a pure junior copper play operating in a mining friendly zone of Peru  Panoro will release the PEA midyear for Cotabambas and also for its Antilla project  The company s market cap is below  60M  despite holding some very decent size projects  That valuation does not make sense when you see a resource of 7 billion pounds of copper equivalent  Also remember that the largest transaction ever held in Peru  the selling of Las Bambas  occurred in the neighborhood of Cotabambas 
TMR  Any other gold miners for us to watch in South America 
RC  Rio Alto Mining has producing gold assets and it has a new copper project in the works  It will release a bankable feasibility study on that project early next year  When gold prices go up  it will thrive 
TMR  Rio Alto has extended the life of its main mine in Peru  although the grade has been reduced  Is there a future for mines that are coming to the end of their high grade life 
RC  Grade reduction is a general trend in the market  Grades are simply not as high now as they were 10 years ago  There are still mines that have high grade and low cash costs  but only a few  The new trend is to produce at lower grade and to manage the costs  Rio Alto lowered its cash cost and kept a good margin intact  even though it is slightly lower 
TMR  Any other companies 
RC   Luna Gold Corp   OTC LGCUF  has a Brazilian property that is in the process of increasing production by the end of this year  The founders of Luna Gold are mainly Peruvian groups  so the company is also listed in Peru  Luna has recently changed managers  The new CEO is more focused on accelerating the  short term  ramp up  It is a good play for gold investors who want geographical diversification  Although the exploration potential in Luna is tremendous  for the company  growth is supported more by financial decisions than by an increase in the resources  I think few companies in the world are in this position  If gold price recovers  then Luna can easily grow
