 Kevin  and good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter and year end 2019 earnings call  Before I ll offer a few additional comments on the year and the quarter  I want to take a moment to congratulate Kevin Blair  who was recently named President of Synovus  adding to his responsibilities as COO that he took on just a year ago I also want to thank our entire leadership team for the work they have done and will continue to do in the year ahead as we carve new paths for growth and efficiency  work that will be both rewarding and challenging for our team In that regard  we have recently partnered with a third party to assist us in identifying new revenue and efficiency opportunities designed to improve ongoing performance as well as the customer experience  I ve asked Kevin to serve as Executive Sponsor of this initiative and he ll provide more comments on this important work later in the presentation Before I turn the call over to Jamie  I ll briefly walk us through the highlights of the fourth quarter noted on Slide 3  Diluted earnings per share were  0 97  or  0 94 adjusted  Adjusted EPS was down 3  sequentially and up 3 1  year over year  Period end loan growth was  745 million or 8 1  annualized resulting from total funded loan production of  3 6 billion Period end deposit growth was  972 million or 10 3  annualized  Core transaction deposits increased  373 million and total deposit cost declined 13 basis points from the prior quarter  Net interest margin was 3 65   a decline of 4 basis points from the prior quarter Excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments  the net interest margin was 3 40   down 2 basis points from the prior quarter  Non interest income was  98 million in the fourth quarter  an increase of  9 2 million from the prior quarter and  30 million from the prior year quarter  led by capital markets and fiduciary activities And credit quality metrics remain solid with the non performing loan ratio and the non performing asset ratio declining by 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 0 27  and 0 37  respectively  The net charge off ratio was 0 10  We repurchased  36 5 million in common stock or 1 1 million shares during the quarter which completed our 2019 share repurchase authorization of  725 million  Outstanding shares were reduced 11  from the beginning of the year  Our 2020 share repurchase authorization should allow us to continue operating with the CET1 ratio around 9  I m also pleased to report that our Board approved a 10  increase in the quarterly dividend to  0 33 per share of common stock effective with the April 1 dividend I ll now turn the call over to Jamie for a more detailed look at 2019 Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Kessel  Let s begin on Slide 4 with loans  We had another strong quarter of loan growth with a net increase of nearly  750 million on production of  3 6 billion  The growth was broad based with CRE growing in seven of ten asset class  Direct C I lending increasing across the footprint and the consumer book experiencing growth in all product types The credit profile of this growth was consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in the quality of our loan book  We have a robust loan pipeline across industries and the footprint    and we re starting to benefit more directly from changes in the competitive marketplace following recent M A activity and industry consolidation On Slide 5  deposit highlights include a continued increase in core transaction deposits  This is a direct reflection of our team member s performance growing quality relationships across our footprint  In the fourth quarter  we continued our efforts to remix the deposit book by allowing higher cost deposits to run off We offset that run off with growth in non interest bearing deposits  money markets and the seasonal inflows for more reasonable priced public fund deposits  This strategic focus support continued reductions in the total cost of deposits  which fell 18 basis points from the peak in July and 13 basis points from the previous quarter As you can see on Slide 6  the core net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 3 4   Excluding purchase accounting accretion  lower interest rates resulted in an 18 basis point reduction in loan yield and a 13 basis point reduction in the cost of deposits  As a reminder  GAAP margin at 3 65  benefited from purchase accounting accretion which was  26 million in the fourth quarter The benefit to NII from purchase accounting will decline substantially in 2020 to a full year total of approximately  8 million  Strong balance sheet pipelines and the timing of loan growth  which was weighted toward the end of the quarter  provide tailwinds going into 2020 On Slide 7  you will see we have had continued success in fee revenue growth  which increased to  98 million or  92 million adjusted  Included in our GAAP non interest income is an  8 million increase in the fair value of certain equity investments In the fourth quarter  fee revenue growth was led by capital markets and fiduciary activities of  2 million and  1 million respectively  which more than offset reductions in areas such as mortgage banking income  Non interest income as a percentage of average assets continues to improve as we successfully execute on this key strategic objective  An example of this success includes a 29  year over year increase and implementations by Treasury   Payment Solutions Slide 8 shows adjusted expenses of  265 million which is an increase of  6 million from the previous quarter  Significant increases noted on this slide reflect a  3 million increase in FDIC expense associated with the reclassification of certain loan categories over the past four years Expenses also increased with opportunistic revenue producing hires and additional non interest income  There was also a  2 million increase in servicing expense that was more than offset with higher revenue resulted from a renegotiation of a third party consumer lending partnerships As we execute strategies from our new operating model  we continue to recalibrate our expense base to emphasize the importance of customer facing talent and technology  These investments have short term paybacks that will serve the company well by improving efficiency and profitability long term Key credit quality metrics on Slide 9 remains favorable  including NPL and NPA ratio that each declined by 5 basis points  These reductions were achieved with a net charge off ratio of 10 basis points for the quarter  The net charge off rate was 16 basis points for the year Provision expense of  24 5 million included the costs associated with a  466 million increase in net loan growth from the prior period  Provision expense remains elevated compared to net charge offs due to the impact of purchase accounting  Under our acquired loan accounting selection  the credit mark flows through NII rather than provision as loans pay off or renew  As we think about the overall allowance  our coverage ratios remained favorable as credit quality continues to look healthy Onto Slide 10  we remain confident in our overall capital position and are pleased to report that we completed the  725 million share repurchase authorization in 2019  This included fourth quarter repurchase activity of  37 million  which reflected a reduction of an additional 1 1 million shares  Total shares were reduced 11  from the beginning of the year Ongoing analysis continues to provide support for operating at our current capital and liquidity ratios And now  Kevin will discuss our outlook Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Jamie  Before I talk about what we expect in 2020  let me take a minute to reflect on 2019  I am very pleased with our progress and success achieved during the year  As we rolled out a new operating model in the beginning of the year our objectives were to better align our organization to further enhance the customer experience as well as expand and diversify our sources of growth In 2019  we added 58 net new revenue producing team members across our foot print  in many of the fastest growing markets in which we serve  Various business units contributed to our growth  including mortgage  brokerage  trust  private wealth management  wholesale banking and Treasury   Payment Solutions  The attraction of this talent helped move the needle in 2019 and will have an even bigger impact on 2020 We also experienced strong growth in banker productivity during the year with funded loan production of  11 1 billion  up  3 billion or 37  from 2018  Moreover  the increase in production led to a 5 5  pro forma outstandings growth in total loans with C I  CRE and consumer asset classes all increasing In 2019  we also delivered 10 6  fee income growth versus 2018 on a pro forma Synovus FCB basis  Strong growth was delivered across multiple businesses including mortgage  capital markets  card and our fiduciary and asset management businesses which saw assets under management grow 21   as we continue to expand our capabilities and presence across the footprint  As a result of the growth in these categories  we saw the percentage of our revenue derived from fee income increase throughout the year  now totaling 19  in the fourth quarter As we previously discussed  we completed the integration of the Florida Community Bank during the year and we re pleased with the contributions of our newest team members  The legacy FCB wholesale team continued on a path of growth with loans increasing  350 million during the year  Deposit accounts growing by 8  and record levels of capital market income of  18 million  up 38  year over year Credit in the acquired FCB book also performed as we expected during the year with credit metrics and internal reviews supporting the overall quality of the portfolio  The legacy FCB branch network also saw performance gains in 2019 with branch unit sales per month of 51  slightly higher than the legacy Synovus branches  We also invested a new technology and new business units to generate growth  We released MySynovus  our consumer digital portal in 2019 and are preparing for the release of our commercial digital platform in 2020 In the middle of 2019  the Synovus structured lending division was formed and in a very short period of time has already generated a  150 million in loan commitments  We also spent the year building out and piloting a much stronger value proposition for the mass affluent customer segment and we ll release this program and the associated solutions across our franchise this quarter So as we enter 2020  our roadmap will follow a similar course  It calls for opportunistic expansion and growth  simplification and process enhancements that will make us even easier to do business with and additional efficiency efforts that will fund new investments while helping to mitigate the headwinds from the margin In building the strategic roadmap  we engaged a third party back in September of 2019  The work over the last four months has informed our 2020 guidance  but more importantly  our long term goals  We have reviewed over 20 initiatives that provide opportunities for incremental growth from the revenue side as well as additional efficiencies  We are in the final stages of prioritizing the eight to ten initiatives that will be delivered during 2020  But generally the revenue opportunities have a longer term horizon while efficiency opportunities will begin to be realized in 2020 Our efficiency opportunities will center around the categories that have been constructive for us in the past  third party spend  real estate and staffing rationalization  As we move forward with this engagement  we will continue to provide updates and greater transparency around the opportunities as well as the progress Now  moving to our 2020 guidance and long term targets  these are based on a lower for longer rate environment and modest economic growth  We believe that the economic tailwinds that have resulted in above average economic growth in the Southeast will continue  Our clients maintain a favorable outlook on the business environment and we are focused on supporting their growth We are pleased with the positive momentum in the balance sheet growth which has been driven by new talent  the enhancement of capabilities and sales tools  as well as stronger growth in our larger Tier 1 markets  Our approach and the momentum is expected to continue to support asset growth of 4  to 7  in 2020 Funded loan production increased throughout 2019 and ended the year with a robust pipeline funded by a remix deposit base  For 2020  we expect loan growth to exceed market economic growth as we further deepen existing relationships  grow new relationships  and continue hiring of frontline bankers We expect this to result in broad based loan growth across markets and industries  We will fund this growth with a continued focus on growing core transaction deposits  Our efforts to reduce high cost deposits will continue in 2020 as we selectively reduce higher cost  single service deposits One of the most significant headwinds to the 2020 income statement is purchase accounting adjustments  which are expected to reduce revenues by approximately  90 million from 2019  Excluding PAA  adjusted net interest income should increase 0  to 3  as we continue to actively manage our balance sheet to optimize the margin as well as returns We do expect the net interest margin to be down slightly  assuming flat interest rates and similar balance sheet mix  Adjusted non interest income is expected to increase 3  to 6  with broad based growth  The continued growth in fee income is a function of hiring efforts and higher opportunity markets  product areas such as Treasury   Payment Solutions  as well as an expansion of the share of wallet with existing relationships Adjusted non interest expense is expected to increase 3  to 5   The primary drivers include continued investments in people  processes and technology that will have relative short term paybacks  These investments will be partially offset by savings realized during the execution of our strategic efficiency initiatives The 2019 tax rate of 26  was negatively impacted by significant non deductible  merger related expenses that are not expected in 2020 as well as certain discrete items that were also negative Elimination of these aforementioned expenses as well as additional strategic tax initiatives and the realignment of certain subsidiaries will reduce the future effective tax rate substantially  We expect the net charge off ratio of 15 basis points to 25 basis points as the credit cycle matures and recovery subside  There are no indications of any widespread credit deterioration  however  net charge offs will be impacted by changes resulting from purchase accounting of the acquired portfolio as the credit mark is unwound at CECL adoption As we look forward to 2020  the largest change to financial statements involve CCEL implementation  Provision expense will be elevated going forward as we provide for life of loan losses and will be highly dependent on the projected economic environment  the credit profile and tenure of loans  the impact of unfunded reserves as well as expectations about net loan growth and a continuation of the current elevated levels of payoffs Given our current profile of loan growth and expectations for the economy  we anticipate adding up to 10 basis point to the allowance for credit losses ratio throughout 2020 to account for the change in provisioning to the life of loans  Our estimated day one CECL impact  which remains unchanged from the previous quarter  can be found in the appendix  This incremental forecasted provision expense is not related to any changes in the underlying credit fundamentals of our loan book Moving on to capital  in 2019  we completed subordinated debt and preferred stock issuances and purchased 20 million shares  which effectively optimized the capital stack  given the current balance sheet size and risk profile  We reiterated our comfort with a CET1 ratio of 9  under the current conditions and are committed to first funding organic growth  second  maintaining a competitive dividend  and third  effective capital deployment As such  we will be increasing the common dividend by 10  in 2020 targeting a payout ratio of 35  to 40   Moreover  we will monitor capital consumption through organic loan growth and tailor our share repurchases accordingly  as we continuously manage our capital and liquidity positions Our long term goals reflect the successful execution of our strategic roadmap  We are committed to aggressively identify and implement new avenues for growth and efficiencies throughout our organization  I am confident in our path forward  in the passion and the commitment of our entire team and in the clarity of our vision to be the bank we ve always been  but better We ve moved    we re moving forward fully aligned with a keen eye on delivering on our goals of positive operating leverage  diversified balance sheet growth and top quartile profitability metrics Kessel  I ll turn it back over to you for closing remarks Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Kevin  And before we move to Q A  I  again  want to thank our Synovus team for their contributions to another successful year for our Company  Our results reflect continued momentum across our footprint with greater organic growth and an improving ability to execute well as a fully unified team  I m always so proud of the way our team supports each other  serves our customers and gives back to our communities Operator  we are now available for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  And the first question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Securities Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI guess  just first question  wanted to    looking at the expense guidance of 3  to 5   how should we think about expense growth for the year  Is the lower end kind of tied to    if revenue asset growth is at the lower end we should expect expenses to be at the lower end and is that the right way to think about where expenses could shake out or is it more incumbent on just investment decisions that you re making Would love to get your thoughts in terms of just how we think about operating leverage for the year  And also in terms of  do we expect to get an update on the efficiency plan by the first quarter earnings or do you expect an update sooner than that Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo  Ebrahim  hi  this is Jamie  Thanks for the question  We expect  as we say  3  to 5  expense growth for 2020 and a lot of that has to do with things that happened in 2019  So we have about 1  expense growth associated with the third party servicing and so that s just growth in the book  That s a renegotiation that also negatively impacted expenses this quarter Other thing  another impact are hires we made in the second half of  19 and so we ve been really growing our first line out there in the field and that s going to be a negative impact to expenses as we head into 2020  You re right  the growth would definitely impact that  You saw that in the second half of  19 when    with the commission expense being higher  just because of the strong performance in the fee revenue businesses And so you re right  it is somewhat dependent on that  but we are excited about the opportunity to improve this and we have many initiatives in play  Phonetic  as Kevin mentioned on the script  talking about our opportunities for 2020 with our transformation efforts Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd Ebrahim  this is Kevin  I ll add through to the question as it relates to additional transparency around the initiatives  Yeah  I think in the first quarter earnings call  we ll provide a little more clarity as to the initiatives themselves  Obviously when we are giving guidance on the full year  we want to understand what the third party spend will be in order to generate the savings But as Jamie mentioned  I think what you ll see with our quarterly expenses is that we ll hit a high watermark in first quarter and then expenses will trail off as the year continues and so we ll be able to generate positive operating leverage as we get toward the second half of the year and most certainly as we look at 2021 Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThat s helpful  And just moving quickly to capital CET1 at 8 95   relative to the 9  target and you obviously raised the dividend this morning  Is it safe to assume that we should    we may not see any buybacks at least early part of the year as you sort of gauge asset growth given you guidance and let capital build  Like  what s the right way to think about buybacks from here on Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Ebrahim  we expect to maintain CET1 around the 9  level where we are currently and we feel confident in that level  And so you re right  we ll be looking at how we grow our balance sheet and how that plays into capital ratios  But I wouldn t assume that that means there will be holding off on share repurchases Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystSo we could    or we should expect a share repurchase in the first quarter Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWe are not giving guidance to the timing of share repurchases  but we re going to stay at the 9  level  As you look at that  I would say with our forecast of loan growth and the guidance we re giving  we may repurchase 2 million to 3 million shares in 2020 and that will probably be over the course of the year Ebrahim Poonawala    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Thanks for taking my questions Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Ebrahim OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Tyler Stafford with Stephens Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystHey  good morning guys Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerHey Tyler Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Tyler Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystHey  I guess Jamie  I m trying to just triangulate on expenses here  there is a comment from last quarter s call about looking at opportunities not just in the fourth quarter but in the 2021    2020 and 2021 to take out significant adjustments to the expense run rate relative to the fourth quarter expenses that we saw that stepped up fairly meaningfully  and then I think the guide of 3  to 5  that was above expectations  Just I guess simply what happened to the outlook that    I thought you guys were talking about  on the third quarter call  relative to what happened in the fourth quarter and the outlook here of 3  to 5  expense growth Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  Tyler  Well  I d say a few things  First  we did have a lot of strong growth in the fourth quarter  You saw the balance sheet growth  Your saw the fee revenue growth and so that contributed to our target expenses  We also had the renegotiation of the third party relationship that added  2 million to fourth quarter expenses  It will add  as I mentioned a minute ago to Ebrahim  it will add another  10 million or so to 2020 expenses as well But just as a reminder  that s offset by a bigger impact in NII  And so it s accretive to the shareholder  Also in the fourth quarter  we had FDIC expense and that was related to the reclassification of certain loan categories over the past four years and when we went in and looked at that  we also engaged a third party to identify opportunities to reduce the assessment rate going forward  And so that will actually be a net positive to 2020 But then  we also had higher compensation expense  There were some ebbs and flows in compensation expense  but we did have  2 million higher due to certain legacy defined benefit plans that hit us in the fourth quarter  We do feel confident about the efforts we re making to reduce efficiency rate going forward You know  as Kevin mentioned  we expect the first quarter to actually be a little higher due to seasonal impact of personnel expense  that probably is  5 million to  6 million  but we re excited about the work streams we have in play to help us improve our run rate going forward and help get back to positive operating leverage and we re targeting returning to year on year positive operating leverage in late 2020 Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  But to be clear  the efficiency opportunities that you re speaking to that is already reflected in the 3  to 5  expense growth outlook  Is that right Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo the 3  to 5  outlook  there are a couple of things with that  One  that doesn t include any expenses associated with the transformation effort  So I ll be clear on that  But the benefit to calendar year 2020 is not nearly as much as the benefit to run rate at the end of the year  We expect to complete many of these initiatives that will improve both revenue and expense going forward  but the impact to 2020 is not significant Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  So the exit expense base being I think what you re implying at the low point for the year  that lower expense exit base should continue into 2021 providing greater efficiencies really in 2021 and a lower expense growth rate Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThat s right  And Tyler  this is Kessel  Let me just kind of maybe summarize what both Jamie and Kevin said to the question of what happened because one of you on the call have already seen that question and emailed this morning early  Nothing really happened  what in fact has happened is that the investments we made in 2019 throughout the year  but a lot in the middle and back half of the year have really paid off  but those salaries and those investments didn t go away as we entered 2020 But in the midst of all that we ve been very thoughtful and quite frankly aggressive in taking out cost in the back half  either in the fourth quarter with some reductions in staff throughout our Company  So I don t want to leave you with the impression that we ve forgotten about our commitment to expense control It s just on this call today and I think you know this about us or me  I don t like to guide to things that I don t see  And so we are working very aggressively with a third party so that we can give you more color as to the amount of revenue opportunity and the amount of expense run rate short term and long term  And so I just want to make sure that you understand the commitment to executing on that is as strong as ever Tyler Stafford    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  thank you  Kessel Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks Tyler OperatorAnd the next question comes from Brady Gailey with KBW Brady Gailey    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods  Inc     AnalystHey  thanks  good morning  guys Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerHey Brady Brady Gailey    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods  Inc     AnalystWell  I think I heard something earlier in the call about the loan loss reserve ratio being built 10 basis points  I wasn t sure  does that    is that somehow related to CCEL or are you referring to after CCEL you expect to build the reserve by 10 basis points throughout the rest of 2020 Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerHey Brady  this is Jamie  That we are referring to CCEL and we re referring to the day two impact on the allowance for credit losses  As we look at 2020 and to give guidance there  CCEL was impacted by multiple factors  right  like there is the impact of loan growth  there is an impact of the credit components of loan mix  there is an impact of prepayments If you have accelerated prepayments  the average duration of your book extends and it negatively impacts your provision expense due to CCEL  There is the impact of unfunded commitments as well as the big impact of the general economic environment  Your assumptions that you put in there And so  when we look forward on the day two impact of CCEL  we expect our allowance for credit losses to marginally increase as we go through the year  Clearly there s a lot of uncertainty  We re not forecasting any deterioration in the economy  we think that using a flat kind of economic assumptions that we still may see a slight increase in the allowance percentage or the percent of loans just due to the fact that the average duration of the book extends a little bit There is no change in the credit performance we    the forward looking credit indicators are all looking very good and strong right now  It s really just an impact of just forecasting slightly longer duration within the different portfolios Brady Gailey    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods  Inc     AnalystAlright  that s helpful  And then Kessel  it s been a year since you closed FCB  Your currency has come back a little bit  at least relative to where it was at some points back in 2019  Any update on how you re thinking about M A in the next year or two Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWell year or two might be two different things  Brady  I mean currency has come back some  but not enough to I think position us to participate in the transactions right now  As I think you probably know  there is a lot of chatter out there  there are a lot of smaller banks looking for exit partners I think we would all agree there are lot more sellers than there are buyers right now  But we re very  very  very focused on our internal operations on organic growth  on improving our returns  on controlling the expense growth that Tyler and Ebrahim both just spoke to So I think short term  the answer is hedge down internal focus  keep building on the reputation that I think we ve established  keep proving the investment thesis all in FCB as that team has really become fully integrated into our team and performing well throughout the entire State of Florida So late this year 2021  I would just say that regardless of currency  we will be very disciplined  and again  the thought being that if they were the right opportunity where we had the right currency  I think we would have to certainly look at something  but I wouldn t anticipate that being a 2020 event and would see 2021  I believe there will be plenty of sellers in 2021 as well Brady Gailey    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods  Inc     AnalystGot it  Thanks guys Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Jennifer Demba    SunTrust Robinson Humphreys  Inc     AnalystThank you  Good morning Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jennifer Jennifer Demba    SunTrust Robinson Humphreys  Inc     AnalystBack to the expenses topic  Jamie  I think you said that you expect the expense rationalization efforts to take    to be more weighted toward the back end of the year  Does that bias your guidance for expenses    core expenses of 3  to 5   3  to 5  growth  does that bias it toward the low end of that guidance Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerJennifer  I think that our guidance is    I mean there are scenarios that can get within    get you to the low end or the high end  But you know  we think that that s the right range  We think our base cases is right in the middle of the range  But there are definitely opportunities to be at the low end And as Kessel mentioned earlier  we re going to be looking at a lot of things that can move the lever faster  We ve    as Kevin mentioned on the call  we ve looked at over 20 initiatives  There are things that are teed up to go and in process right now  And so I guess that guidance is the best I can give you right now  but we feel good about it Jennifer Demba    SunTrust Robinson Humphreys  Inc     AnalystOkay  And question on hires or how offensive will you be in 2020 on hiring off this 58  base last year Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerWell  Jennifer  I think that really covers that expense number as well because we have not backed off on the hiring front  And again I believe selfishly  we ve got a pretty attractive platform to hire too  I mean we continue to add depth throughout our footprint  And really all of our higher growth markets  it will continue to be  I actually spoke earlier this morning to Allen Barker  who is our Atlanta market President about the number of people that he and some of our other leaders here continue to talk to  And as he said to me  we have the opportunity to be very selective on who we hire because of the number of people who are interested in joining our team So I think we ll continue to be aggressive  That puts pressure on that revenue number  but while there is some disruption  while there are good bankers in the market  we certainly want to make sure that we are front and center in that decision  I ve visited with Kevin Howard in Atlanta just a couple of weeks ago and we spoke with a couple of people he s recruiting  And again  just seeing what attracts them to our company made me feel really good So we ll be aggressive  but again  disciplined  I mean hiring comes with a cost because especially in the middle market space it takes for    take a while to generate revenue to cover that  So we ll make sure we balance the hiring in terms of what can give us shorter term payback versus longer term payback But I would say  again the    if you d look at the last quarter growth in loans and the push in fee revenue  it really does reflect a success of our hiring decisions throughout 2019 Jennifer Demba    SunTrust Robinson Humphreys  Inc     AnalystOkay  thank you Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jennifer OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons with D A  Davidson Kevin Fitzsimmons    D A  Davidson    AnalystHey  good morning everyone Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Kevin Kevin Fitzsimmons    D A  Davidson    AnalystJust taking a step back a bit on the    you said you engaged a third party back in September  I m just curious what the thought process was  Was it that you knew you had all these investments being made and you needed a way or wanted a way  wanted to look at a way to offset that or was it more about looking versus peers where you stood on certain ratios  I m just curious the thought process before stepping in with that Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we ll all take some of that  Kevin  But I just think a fresh look is always good  You know us as well as anybody on this call  And in the past  we ve engaged a third party for major initiatives  I remember like yesterday 2011 when it was a  100 million then we did a 35 or 25  And as we have grown  as we have integrated another organization as we have made major investments And I don t want to not give credit to our team who have been very diligent in looking at ways we can take cost out  We thought it was a good    it s been a while since we had a really third party fresh look at everything we doing  How we re pricing our products  What products we are offering  procurement    I mean Jamie and Kevin have been to the work stream  So it was a combination of just time and a fresh look  It gives you ideas that maybe you didn t recognize or at least raises the opportunity of that and we ve been very pleased so far  We just got a little more work to do Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerAnd Kevin  let me add to that  to Kessel s point  We were not looking at our current efficiency ratio  which if you look at for 2019 at 52  and felt that we were an outlier  Quite frankly  I think we still show very well relative to our peers as it relates to efficiency ratio  But to Kessel s point  we re on offence and we re trying to grow the bank and we knew that if we needed to find capacity to continue to invest in new talent and technology that we had to be more efficient But in addition to the efficiency initiatives  we have a lot of revenue initiatives we re talking about and most importantly  we re also looking at process reengineering and automation  that s going to not only make our team member s lives better but also make us easier to do business with  with our customers So for us  it s not parochially focused on just efficiency  We re looking at growth  we re looking at generating revenue and we re looking at becoming a better institution as we serve our customers  And as Kessel mentioned earlier  we re a great platform for teammates or for team members to come to today and we want to continue to get better there as well Kevin Fitzsimmons    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  great  And one quick follow up  just on the margin  on core excluding purchase accounting over the course of the year  I know you mentioned what it would be roughly but over    when we re looking in a forward quarters  would you expect it to see some more compression  but then stabilization at some point mid year  How should we expect it to flow Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Kevin  you nailed it  That s exactly what we would expect  I d just say the fourth quarter  looking at the core margin at 3 40   we feel really good about that and it benefited from a couple of things  one is the investment portfolio repositioning and so that will continue to benefit us  And second is our third party relationships as well as the renegotiation of those that will also benefit us as we head into 2020 So we have that tailwind that got us to the 3 40   But as we look at 2020 I would say that I would expect we guide for the full year slightly down  I would just say  expect most of that in the first quarter  There are three things driving that  One is we had just such strong loan growth in the fourth quarter The second thing is that the first quarter has strong loan growth already quarter to date  And the third thing is just that the Fed move was at the end of October  and so we didn t get a full quarter of that rate reduction  And so I would say  slightly down for the year  biased toward the first quarter Kevin Fitzsimmons    D A  Davidson    AnalystGreat  Thanks guys Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank youKessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks Kevin OperatorThank you  And next we have John Pancari with Evercore ISI John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerGood morning  John Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  John John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOn the expense topic again  just given the initiatives and the longer term expected benefits and everything  where do you see the impact being to your efficiency ratio longer term  What do you think is the appropriate long term level for your efficiency ratio once you dial these efforts in  Thanks Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerJohn  that s a great question  We are striving for an efficiency ratio in the low  50s  I mean we ve talked before about that at the 50 area  but we re really shooting for low 50s  given the change in the underlying interest rate environment  But look  we think we can improve  We think with our business mix  we have opportunities to be better and be more efficient on how we go to market  As Kevin mentioned  we think that s going to improve the experience for our associates and our customers  And so we re excited about that and we believe that these initiatives will help us get there John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Got it  Thanks  And then separately  on your guidance on the 4  to 7  asset growth  how does that break down by the components in terms of loan growth securities  And then maybe give us some color on the other side on deposits Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we    as we look at 2020  we re not really forecasting any material change in the investment portfolio  You mentioned security  so if you look at our loan to deposit ratio  we re comfortable where we are with our liquidity profile  And so I wouldn t expect that to change  And just  I mean  so I would expect to see balanced growth from us on both loans and deposits John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Got it  Got it  Thanks  And then lastly  on the credit side  the    your delinquencies  looked like they jumped about 40  linked quarter  can you give us some color on what drove that  And then separately  do you have criticized and classified assets for the quarter and how that changed Robert Warren Derrick    Executive Vice President   Chief Credit OfficerYeah  hey John  this is Bob  I ll try to provide you with a little color on that  We did have one large C I credit that carried to quarter end  It s in our normal collection process  So given the fact that those past due levels are so low  when you have one  it can move the needle up from a percentage standpoint if you call it out From an ongoing basis  we still see risk grade inflow excuse me    risk grade new and renewed origination to being at or better than our current levels  We still got inflows that are minimal  relatively speaking and our past dues  while there will be some fluctuation obviously quarter to quarter when you get to these low levels  they re still showing no real signs of overall credit deterioration Your comment about the rated book John is  you re going to have some credits move within substandard or special mention here and there throughout the quarter  But again  there is no real new names coming onto that list  So it s just normal course of business there Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd John  this is Kevin  I ll just add to Bob s comments  As Kessel mentioned  we had roughly  3 6 billion in production during the fourth quarter  That was up 20  over the third quarter  And you heard Bob mention the average risk weighting  When we look at not only the book and you look at the low levels of NPAs and delinquencies that we have in our portfolio  we have a keen eye on making sure that the new production that s coming on is consistent with that prudent growth strategy and to see that each quarter we have an improving risk profile as it relates to that weighted average risk rating  gives us great confidence that we expect to see similar credit quality into the coming quarters And as Bob mentioned  you re going to have some episodic ebbs and flows in those numbers just because they re so small  But there is nothing that concerns us either from a portfolio or from what we re seeing on the production side John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Got it  And then    and sorry  did you imply that the    would you state that the criticized or classified assets were stable in the quarter Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  got it  Alright  thank you OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James Michael Rose    Raymond James   Associates  Inc     AnalystHey  guys  So it sounds like mid    hey  how are you  Sounds like mid single digit loan growth is kind of what you guys are targeting  You guys had really strong C I loan growth this quarter  especially relative to the industry  Can you talk about just some of the growth drivers as we think about growth into 2020 is it    are you guys moving upstream at all are the new hires that you ve made  which I think are more weighted toward wealth management in 2019  but is it some of the new hires  is it market share takeaway  Just give us some color as to how we should think about growth next year  Thanks Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerNo  Michael  it s great question  Yeah  fourth quarter was a strong C I quarter but I look at the year and I look at almost  800 million worth of C I growth  And ironically  it was not in the owner occupied real estate category  We see a tremendous amount of competition from some of our competitors that are offering long term fixed rate owner occupied mortgages  And quite frankly  based on our profitability requirements  we ve let some of that leave us So where we re seeing growth on the C I front is really in our wholesale bank and we have added individuals there  We re up 10 revenue producers in the wholesale bank this year  The growth is coming from across our footprint in Florida and Alabama and Georgia and South Carolina  I think as you recall we moved Kevin Howard to lead that Group and it s been a change that has continued to build momentum as the year has progressed and they put on a really strong fourth quarter And it s not in any one industry  it s across many different industries  We re seeing it both on the line of credit side and unfunded commitments that was still growing at a commensurate rate  But also on the funded debt that s coming on  So we re optimistic that that will continue not just from taking share from competitors  but from the continued growth that we have from the bankers that Kessel mentioned we brought on in the second half of the year And we ve also brought on the structured lending division  which is a new business for us that saw growth in the third and fourth quarter  And we re very optimistic that that will continue into 2020 and into 2021  The good news is when you look at what we re doing  we re getting a tremendous amount of growth  not only on the loan side  but the really nice data point is that we re getting treasury and operating accounts with a lot of those customers and we ve talked a lot about our upgrade in Treasury   Payments Solutions But when you look at the number of implementations that we had in 2019 versus 2018  we re up 30   So that means we re putting 30  more solutions in the hands of our customers  So we re very optimistic to see that growth continue but we re most excited about the new relationships that we re able to garner Michael Rose    Raymond James   Associates  Inc     AnalystOkay  So that kind of dovetails with the comments around kind of balance deposit growth as well  It seems like you ll be getting some traction on the DDA side  which you got this quarter  but seems like that will continue into next year  Correct Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So average DDA was up for the quarter  When you look at the number of accounts  we grew on the consumer checking account front as well  So that was exciting to see and we re starting to get greater traction as it relates to operating accounts for some of these commercial relationships and that s going to be a big area of focus for us in 2020 to make sure that we get commercial deposit growth Obviously  that s a very sticky deposit and it s one that comes on the lower end of the call spectrum as well  So that will be something that we re very focused on and we re adding new treasury resources every day to make sure that we cover that market Michael Rose    Raymond James   Associates  Inc     AnalystAlright  very helpful  Maybe just one follow up question  I m going to go back to expenses  Can you just give a little bit more color on the third party that you ve engaged  maybe who it is  And then you know that line item has been around  20 million  Should we expect that to kind of grow as we move into next year as you kind of work through some of these efforts  Thanks Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  this is Jamie  We have been working with Boston Consulting Group and they have been diving into many of our businesses and our products  And you re right  we will see expenses associated with those as we go through 2020 and we will be clear about the impact of those to NIE as we go forward Michael Rose    Raymond James   Associates  Inc     AnalystAlright  thanks for taking my questions OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thanks  I ll try not ask another question about expenses  I figure you ve given enough brief about that for the rest of the day Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThank you Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystBut let s talk about the payback  I guess  from those expenses  So like    when you think about    like  I get that you hired a bunch of people and I see why you re growing assets this quarter or sorry in 2020  the 4  to 7  and you got 3  to 6  fee growth  My question is like once those people and all these initiatives are done and up and running  does that imply that asset growth should be higher than the 4  to 7  and fee growth should be higher than the 3  to 6  like not this year  but into 2021 Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerI ll take that  Ken  So it s obviously each position that we hire  we have a calculated ROI  NPV and payback period  So as Kessel mentioned earlier  we know that our middle market bankers typically are less than eight months in terms of a payback  And when you go to some of the wealth positions  it takes a year or so for those earn backs But yes  we look at those trailing revenue benefits and over time    you ll pick up some of the operating leverage for these new positions because the expense will stay flat and the revenue continues to grow  So all else held constant on those positions  yes  the revenue increases while the expenses stay flat When you think about the 2020 guidance for next year and what we did this year  we were up 10 6  in fee income this year  That was aided by our new hires  If you look at some of those businesses that we added resources this year  you ll see another 10  growth next year in those same businesses We just have some anchors as it relates to fee income on a year over year basis  That s why you see a mid single digit number for businesses like mortgage where seasonally it will be a little lower based on where we see interest rates  Capital markets where this year we had a record year  So it s hard to continue to grow that at 10   But those businesses that we ve invested in will continue to grow at a double digit pace and over time will become more efficient Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Okay  That helps  And then  I guess the other question  just in terms of provision expense  I completely understand that CECL is going to drive greater volatility in your provision expense  But you did mention it was going to be elevated  Is it right to think about if you are adding  say 10 basis points or about 15  to your reserve ratio  your allowance that your provision expense should also be  call it  roughly 15  higher  all things equal  of course  So instead of the 24  you did this quarter  it would be something like 28  I mean is that the right logic to think about going forward Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerI think the right way to think about it going forward would be  just to put an expansion of the allowance for credit losses to the year ending loan balance and see what the provision build would be required to get there and the allowance build  Yeah  it s a little bit different answer than what you re saying Ken Zerbe    Morgan Stanley    AnalystIt is  Oh OK  I guess I ll have to think about that a little bit more  But OK  I m good  Thank you very much Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks Ken OperatorThank you  And now online we have Brad Milsaps with Piper Sandler Brad Milsaps    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystHey  good morning Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Brad Brad Milsaps    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystJust wanted to follow up on Ken s CECL questions  If my math is right  Looks like you might be targeting a reserve around 120  Phonetic  by the end of the    by the end of the year  If that s in fact correct  did that also account for any payoffs you get on the acquired book  you know some of that discount accreting back through the provision  does that also take into account for that or is that pretty much where you think you end up  no matter what Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWe still feel confident that day one impact of the 40  to 60  and then we expect some slight expansion in the allowance over the course of the year  As you re well aware  the purchase accounting impact gets wrapped up into CCEL in 2020 Brad Milsaps    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystOkay  And then secondly  just sticking with accretion income  On the deposit side  I think you had the  11 million mark come through again this quarter  My understanding is that obviously goes away this year  How quickly do you think you can sort of earn that back  so to speak  through reductions in funding costs  You had a nice reduction this quarter in interest bearing deposit costs of around 15 basis points or so  Do you think it takes you a couple of quarters to sort of recapture that 11 million  so to speak  or is it longer than that Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Ken  Phonetic  you re right  The benefit of PAA on the policy goes away at year end and we expect some opportunity in deposit repricing in the first quarter  And so we expect to see some decline there  But the benefit of remixing is largely complete for us Brad Milsaps    Piper Sandler   Co     AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystHey  good morning everybody Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Steve Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystI want to first go back to your response to Ebrahim s question  do you plan to manage full year expenses to the revenue outcome and deliver positive operating leverage in 2020 on a full year basis Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNo  we have revenue    so revenue headwinds include the PAA impact that Kevin mentioned   90 million  So we expect NII just to be marginally up on the year  we had 0  to 3  and then we have strong growth in fee revenue and you see our guidance  And so that does not lead to positive operating leverage for the full year Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  that s clear  Thank you  And then on the loan growth  so when I look at Florida Community  they were routinely doing  400 million to  500 million per quarter of growth before the sale  And I think you said you did  350 million loan growth in total from them in 2019  Why did their loan growth fall by so much Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerIt s a great question Steven  So it was less about production when you go back and look at what they would have produced in 2018 and you compare it to their funded production in 2019  it was only off by a couple of hundred million dollars  So what we were pleased to see is that the level of production continued  What changed was the level of pay offs and pay downs and it had very little to do with customer attrition  It had to do with the maturation of the portfolio and the fact that they actually are seeing the type of churn that you would see in a portfolio as it matures As you recall  they were producing somewhere around  400 million to  500 million worth of funded growth every quarter and they were growing  350 million to  400 million  So there wasn t a lot of pay offs and pay downs as the maturity of their book has continued to increase  they re starting to see some of that churn  So that s really the difference Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  So you re saying the originations have remained consistent Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerVery consistent and very strong  And if you look at what they did in the fourth quarter  it was a very high watermark for them  It was a very  very strong quarter for the legacy FCB team Steven Alexopoulos    JP Morgan    AnalystGot you  Okay  thanks for all the color OperatorThank you  And next is Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerHi Jared Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerHey Jared Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHi  thank you  Just circling back on the provision  I guess  can you give a little color on what drove the    I m sorry  the allowance    the allowance build this quarter given the sort of backdrop of stable credit quality Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We have spoken about this a little bit before  but it s really    it has to do with two things  First is just about loan growth in aggregate  And second is the high level of paydowns  Kevin mentioned the strong production in the fourth quarter  but we also still see elevated pay downs and when we have pay downs in the book    in the FCB book  we don t get the benefit of a provision or a release And so even though we had loan growth of  800 million  If you were to say  what was the net loan growth of loans that we have provision against  It d be much higher where we did not have provisioning and so that s what leads to that increase  So basically we have normal loan growth and then we have the growth or the pay offs of ones where we did not have a provision against them and then they re offsetting our renewed and new loans Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Thanks  And then just looking at the NII  I heard    obviously hear your comments on the margin  But when you look at NII and the strong momentum you said going into first quarter as well as the incremental benefit from that third party servicing renegotiation  should we expect actually quarterly to see NII may be stronger in the first quarter and then trickling down or I guess how should we be looking at NII through the year Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  You know let me just speak to it in rate terms  You know  we expect in the first quarter to see more of the impact of the negative    more of a negative impact on loan yields  And so we ll see    we re expecting a decline in 2020 of somewhere between 10 basis points and 15 basis points in loan yield for the year  but most of that will happen in the first quarter or a decent percentage will happen in the first quarter  And again  it s that same impact that I talked about  about both the recent loan growth as well as the October rate move and the full quarter impact of that Jared Shaw    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorThank you  And the next question comes from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystHey  thanks  Just a quick one on the fee income guidance for the year  what does it take to get to the upper end of the range and are there scenarios that that could actually be greater Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerSo for us it s some of it will do    will have to do with the external market in terms of interest rates and what happens with the equity markets  Those are the variables that we look at  We ve obviously had a lot of resources on the fiduciary and brokerage side  So as the market flows  we ll be able to ebb and flow within that range Also with mortgage  if you look at most of our business as I d mentioned  we expect to see strong growth in service charges year over year based on our investments in treasury  We expect to see double digit growth in our fiduciary business again The two businesses that represent a bit of a headwind for us  as I mentioned were mortgage and capital markets  for different reasons  Mortgage because of interest rates and capital markets just because of the elevated levels that we had this year So  our success in moving to the high end of the range  we ll have some of those external factors  But quite frankly  it will deal with our productivity internally and how we can continue to generate higher levels of production within those businesses Christopher Marinac    Janney Montgomery Scott    AnalystGot it  Thanks very much  Kevin  and thanks for all the discussion on the expenses this morning  I appreciate it Kevin Blair    President and Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Chris Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Chris OperatorThank you  And next on line is Garrett Holland with Baird Garrett Holland    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystThanks and good morning  Just had a quick follow up for you  I heard you on the efficiency ratio targeting low 50s  but could you provide some more detail on the updated top quartile profitability metrics you re targeting in this type of interest rate environment and what s a realistic timeframe for getting there Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  we are    we look at ROA  ROATCE and efficiency ratio as we think about how do we perform versus peers and you know we believe in our strategies  We believe in the work we re doing this year on these transformation efforts to get to    to get back to the top quartile  And so we think that we have a lot of momentum and a lot of opportunity here to improve that performance  We re not ready to give guidance on you really our forecast longer term where we shake out on that  but we will have more on that in the future Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerBut Garrett  just    in terms of timeframe  we look at long term targets of two to three years  I think you go out past that it s harder to forecast and to Jaime s point  the variable there that has made the industry change their expectations is just what interest rates are going to do and it s hard to forecast that out two to three years  But our commitment is just to be in the high    in the top quartile among our peer set Garrett Holland    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystThat s helpful  I appreciate the detail OperatorThank you  And next we have Steven Duong with RBC Capital Steven Duong    RBC Capital    AnalystHey  good morning guys Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Steven Steven Duong    RBC Capital    AnalystJust on    you mentioned the competition in the owner occupied portfolio  Was that the same tale on the multifamily side  And what other segments are you seeing a high level of competition Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWell  look  there is not a single asset class that we serve that doesn t have competition  Steven  So  it s across the board  Now the owner occupied  there are a lot of smaller banks doing rate promotions where they are offering longer tenure  lower fixed rate loans  And again  within our business model  we re not going to chase business that doesn t make sense for us financially  So we re going to let some of that business leave us if it doesn t have the minimum profitability hurdle  So I think that s what you re seeing in some of the owner occupied side On the multifamily  I think that s much more of just the stabilization of properties that are moving off balance sheet  There is a higher level of construction there  And so as those reach maturity and move to the permanent market  they re leaving our balance sheet  But we re still producing on multifamily and like all the other asset classes  we re winning our fair share  It s just    it s going to ebb and flow based on some of the maturation that are in our book Steven Duong    RBC Capital    AnalystGot it  Appreciate the color on that  And then just last one  can you just remind us how much in your CD book you re expecting to have reprice for the quarter and what s the rate on that Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr     Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo right now  we would look at the maturities in the first quarter of the year  somewhere around  800 million in CDs  The current portfolio was a little over 2   If you go back and look at this quarter all of the maturities were at 2 06  and we repriced at 1 98   So I think based on a flat rate environment  you would see a similar movement in the first quarter with the maturities being a little over 2  and where we re renewing and where we re booking them in the high 1 90 s Steven Duong    RBC Capital    AnalystGot it  Appreciate it  Thank you OperatorThank you  And that does conclude the question and answer session  So I would like to return the floor to Kessel Stelling for any closing remarks Kessel D  Stelling Jr     Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerAlright  Well  thank you  operator  and first thank you to all of you who participated on

129649,351164,SNV,Fee Income  Loan Growth To Aid Popular s  BPOP  Q1 Earnings,opinion,"Popular   NASDAQ BPOP   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 18  before the opening bell  Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year 
In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results reflected higher expenses  partially offset by improvement in net interest income and lower provisions 
Notably  Popular surpassed the consensus estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 9 5  
Popular  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   However  its activities in the first quarter were inadequate to encourage analysts  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  1 45 remained unchanged over the past 30 days  Nevertheless  it reflects a year over year improvement of 62 9   Also  the consensus estimate for sales of  603 7 million indicates an increase of 19 2   
Now  before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts  let s discuss the factors that are likely to impact the company s first quarter results 
Factors at Play
Net Interest Income  NII  to Improve  Improvement in commercial and consumer loans scenario  and benefits from December 2018 interest rate hike  are likely to boost NII 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  465 million for NII projects 18 3  year over year rise 
Fee Income Likely to Increase  Consumer spending remained decent during the quarter  which is likely to result in higher debit credit transactions  Thus  Popular is expected to report higher related fees  Also  service charges on deposits are expected to increase  given the continued momentum in customer activity  Furthermore  with strong equity markets  trust fees might improve 
However  mortgage banking revenues are likely to be weak as mortgage refinancing activities and fresh originations might have remained muted in the first quarter due to higher interest rates 
Given the expectations of rise in most components  the consensus estimate for non interest income is  139 million  indicating 21 9  growth on a year over year basis 
Expenses to Trend Higher  Popular s cost base is expected to remain elevated on account of investments in technology along with higher regulatory and personnel costs  Also  the acquisition of Reliable is likely to add to the expense base 
Now  let s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts 
According to our quantitative model  we cannot conclusively predict whether Popular will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter  This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better to increase the odds of an earnings beat

129651,351166,SNV,Is Synovus Financial  SNV  Stock A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Synovus Financial Corp    NYSE SNV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Synovus Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 10  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 58  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Synovus Financial s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 53  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Synovus Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 50  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Synovus Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Synovus Financial has a P S ratio of about 3 05  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  SNV is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Synovus Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Synovus Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Synovus Financial is 1 06  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 28  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 88  which is far better than the industry average of 11 30  Clearly  SNV is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Synovus Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives SNV a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  The current quarter has seen nine estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Synovus Financial Corp  Price and Consensus    Even though Synovus Financial has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSynovus Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 39   should boost investor confidence However over the past two year  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Synovus Financial Will you retire a

As of Dec 31  2018  total loans were  17 11 billion  up 6 7  from the year ago quarter  As of the same date  total deposits grew 4 3  from the prior year quarter end to  17 94 billion 
Furthermore  the company had total assets of  22 39 billion compared to  21 28 billion in the prior year quarter and shareholders  equity was  3 77 billion compared to  3 45 billion in the year ago quarter 
Credit Quality Worsens
In the third quarter  Bank OZK incurred combined net charge offs  NCOs  of  45 5 million on two Real Estate Specialties Group credits  which had been in its portfolio over more than a decade  Notably  these were previously classified as substandard  This was the primary reason for deterioration of the company s asset quality during 2018 
The ratio of non performing loans  as a percentage of total loans  expanded 13 bps year over year to 0 23  as of Dec 31  2018  Additionally  annualized NCO ratio to average total loans rose 2 bps year over year to 0 07  
In addition  provision for loan and lease losses jumped significantly from the year earlier quarter to  7 27 million 
Profitability Ratios Deteriorate
At the end of the reported quarter  return on average assets was 2 04   down from 2 81  in the year earlier quarter  Moreover  return on average common equity declined to 12 36  from 17 23  a year ago     
Our Take
Bank OZK remains well poised for organic growth on the back of continued improvement in loans and deposit balances  However  persistently rising expenses might keep curbing bottom line growth  The company s declining net interest margin remains another concern Bank OZK Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    
Bank OZK currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

129752,351267,SNV,Popular Sees  161 2M Gain In Q2 On Early SLA Termination,opinion,"Recently  Popular   NASDAQ BPOP   announced an early termination of its loss share agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   FDIC   and the Tax Closing Agreement it had entered with the Puerto Rico Department of the Treasury  On a combined basis  Popular expects a contribution of  161 2 million to its net income from both the terminations 
The loss share agreement was related to Popular s acquisition of selected assets and liabilities of Westernbank Puerto Rico  The company had entered into the agreement in 2010 through its subsidiary  Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 
Highlighting the benefits derived from the early termination  president and CEO of Popular  Ignacio Alvarez said   We are now focused on realizing the expected benefits of this transaction  which include lower operating expenses  greater flexibility to manage these assets and simpler financial reporting  
Benefit of Early Termination for Popular
Per the terms of the shared loss agreement  Popular paid  23 7 million to the FDIC as consideration for the early termination  Also  henceforth  covered loans amounting to  514 6 million  along with covered real estate owned assets of about  15 3 million  both as of Mar 31  2018  will be treated as non covered 
Based on the difference between the termination consideration and the estimated net obligation due to the FDIC  Popular is expected to record a pre tax gain of nearly  95 0 million  Net of income tax expense of  45 2 million  the transaction will contribute  49 8 million to net income 
The Tax Closing Agreement was entered in order to determine the tax calculation on loans acquired in the FDIC Transaction  Per the agreement  the principal amount  which Popular has collected in excess of the amount it paid for the loans acquired  will be taxed as a capital gain  The company s tax liability  upon termination of the shared loss agreement  will be calculated based on the deemed sale of the underlying loans 
Popular expects to recognize an income tax benefit of about  111 4 million  from the closure of this agreement 
Premature termination of agreements is indicative of Popular s sound financial health  Though the company s performance was adversely impacted by the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico in late 2017  Popular remains well poised to grow on the back of its strong margins and capital position 
Shares of Popular have gained 26 1  in the past year  outperforming the  s rally of 21 3

56 3 million recorded in the prior year quarter Revenues Escalate  Cost Pressure PersistsTotal revenues came in at  343 3 million in the quarter  up 3 5  year over year  However  the top line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate Net interest income was up nearly 10 4  year over year to  234 1 million  The rise was mainly attributable to increased interest income on loans and leases  partially mitigated by decreased interest income on loans held for sale and rise in total interest expense NIM of 4 61  expanded 27 basis points  bps  year over year due to higher average yields on the variable and adjustable rate loans due to rise in interest rate  partly mitigated by elevated average rates on certificates of deposit Non interest income came in at  109 2 million  down 8 7  on a year over year basis  Absence of net gains on sales of auto loans and reduced net gains on sales of consumer real estate loans  along with lower fees and other revenues  mainly led to the fall TCF Financial reported non interest expenses of  235 million  up 2 7  from the prior year quarter  The rise mainly reflected significant increases in net other credit costs and operating lease

Mixed BagCredit quality for TCF Financial reflected mixed credit metrics  Net charge offs  as a percentage of average loans and leases  contracted 8 bps year over year to 0 18   The decline was chiefly attributable to an improved credit quality in the consumer real estate portfolio  partially offset by increase in net charge offs in the auto finance portfolio Additionally  non accrual loans and leases  and other real estate owned plunged 34 7  year over year to  146 million However  provisions for credit losses were  14 5 million  up 4 7  year over year  primarily due to higher reserve

ViewpointTCF Financial delivered a decent performance in the third quarter  Consistent top line improvement reflects the company s sturdy standing in the market  At the same time  a strengthening capital position and improving credit quality in consumer real estate portfolio are expected to favor the company s future growth  In addition to this  we believe the company s efforts to reduce balance sheet risk and diversify the loan portfolio will augur well for its earnings in the subsequent quarters  Also  steady improvement in the economy will support the future performance of the

129815,351330,SNV,Should Value Investors Pick Synovus Financial  SNV  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Synovus Financial Corp    NYSE SNV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Synovus Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Synovus Financial s current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past three years However  the stock s PE compares slightly unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 0  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Nonetheless  we should point out that Synovus Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 19 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Synovus Financial stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Synovus Financial has a P S ratio of about 4 0  However  this is a bit higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is just slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years SNV is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Synovus Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Synovus Financial a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Synovus Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A  This gives SNV a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and two downward revisions in the same time period Meanwhile  the current quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Synovus Financial Corp  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSynovus Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 25   and a Zacks Rank of 3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2017-12-17,Zacks Investment

129861,351376,SNV,Here s Why Cabela s  CAB  Stock Keeps Climbing ,opinion,"Cabela s Incorporated s   NYSE CAB   stock price continues to climb Tuesday  up over 7   after its once questioned buyout by fellow outdoor retail giant Bass Pro Shops cleared a pivotal hurdle 
 on Monday that Bass Pro Shops will acquire the hunting mega store company for  5 billion  or approximately  61 50 per share in cash  which marks a  500 million price cut from the initial October buyout terms  The new deal comes after regulatory red tape held up the purchase of Cabela s banking assets 
The Sidney  Nebraska based company owns its own bank  The World s Foremost Bank  in order to issue Cabela s branded credit cards  Cabela s bank still runs on a relatively antiquated system of financing customer s purchases by issuing CDs 
According to the new statement  Synovus Financial Corp    NYSE SNV   will now purchase Cabela s banking assets  Synovus  the bank s  1 2 billion in deposits  and then Capital One Financial Corp    NYSE COF   will buy Cabela s credit card portfolio  Capital One originally planned to buy both of Cabela s financial assets  but regulatory issues held up the deal until Synovus stepped in 
Privately owned Bass Pro Shops owns over 90 giant retail locations in North America that focus on fishing  boating  and camping  while Cabela s runs roughly 85 stores in the US and Canada in a similar space  but with a primary focus on hunting  Bass Pro Shops does not currently plan to change much about how Cabela s does business 
Bass Pro Shops and Cabela s hope the deal better positions both outdoor retail brands for the future  as online behemoths such as Amazon com Inc   NASDAQ AMZN  invade more and more retail sectors  even niche markets like fishing and hunting 
 We re excited to announce this agreement  which allows us to look ahead with greater certainty toward the completion of our merger with Bass Pro Shops and offers a positive step forward for all parties   Cabela s CEO Tommy Millner said in a press release   We look forward to completing these transactions for the benefit of our shareholders  Outfitters and outdoor enthusiasts  
Cabela s stock price was up 7 28  to  57 60 per share in early afternoon trading on Tuesday 
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter  However  according to Cabela s statement  it still needs approval from the company s shareholders  and it will need a few more regulatory approvals as well 
 to release its first quarter financial results on May 4  but the company will not hold a call with investors or analysts until the acquisition is fully complete
