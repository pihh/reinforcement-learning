1732,223247,DMRC,U S  investors see more automation  not jobs  under Trump administration,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    When U S  President elect Donald Trump criticized United Technologies Corp s  N UTX  Carrier unit in November for its plan to move some 800 jobs to Mexico  the parent company made a swift decision to keep the factory in Indiana   Yet  the move did not translate into saving jobs  Instead  the company decided it would move toward automation as a way to cut costs    We re going to make up  the   16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate  to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive   chief executive Greg Hayes said on CNBC last month   What that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs    Swapping robots and software for human labor has underpinned much of the productivity gains in the United States over the last 25 years  Now  with a greater political push to keep factories at home  investors are betting that automation will gain speed in industries ranging from auto manufacturing to chicken processing to craft beer breweries   The big winners so far include Rockwell Automation Inc  N ROK    General Electric  Co  N GE  and  Cognex Corp   O CGNX   which have seen jumps in fund ownership of 80 percent or more in the current quarter compared with the previous quarter  according to a Reuters analysis of Morningstar data  The ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF is up 7 5 percent since Election Day  or about 15 percent more than the S P 500 index  after underperforming the broad market for the majority of last year  Its largest holdings include cleaning products maker  iRobot Corp   O IRBT   Japanese factory automation company Fanuc Corp  T 6954   and drone aircraft company  AeroVironment  Inc  O AVAV    But the push toward automation could also cut into the number of jobs saved or created in the United States  undercutting Trump s boast in a news conference last Wednesday that he would be  the greatest jobs producer that God ever created    CUTTING LABOR COSTS  Declining costs of technology are expected to accelerate the growth of robotic manufacturing  Some 80 percent of companies that plan to cut jobs in the next year expect to partially replace workers with automation  according to a survey of chief executives by PwC released Monday   At the same time  developments in fields ranging from barcodes to digital measurement tools are allowing companies to hire fewer workers and reduce the time it takes to bring their products to the market   Brian Smoluch  a fund manager at the Portland  Oregon based Hood River Small Cap Growth fund   has been buying shares of  Digimarc Corp   O DMRC  because of its so called invisible barcodes that speed up scanning of packages    If it takes a nanosecond to scan something  it allows a retailer to have fewer people at a checkout counter and makes self checkout an easier proposition   he said  That said  the  300 million market cap company is a  high risk  high reward stock  because its success depends on companies adopting its technology over rivals  Eric Marshall  a fund manager at Dallas based Hodges Capital  has been buying shares of digital measurement company  FARO Technologies  Inc  O FARO  and kitchen equipment maker Middleby Corp  O MIDD    Faro  for instance  creates three dimensional measuring tools used in aerospace and automotive manufacturing  Shares of the company are up 18 8 percent since Election Day  triple the 6 3 percent gain in the broad S P 500 index   Middleby  meanwhile  recently introduced robots which can prepare French fries as quickly as a human line cook  saving labor costs and improving reliability  Shares are up 12 8 percent since Election Day    As labor costs go up you re going to see more automated kitchens within fast casual restaurants  and Middleby is one of the key innovators in that industry   Marshall said   MADE IN THE USA Republicans are likely to push tax policies that provide incentives to manufacture goods in the United States  regardless how the work is done  analysts say  The result could be that there are more goods made at home  without a significant reduction in the unemployment rate  which is currently at 4 7 percent as of December    There could be a manufacturing renaissance in this country  but most of the work will be done by automation  with current workers retained to do value added functions   said Nicholas Heymann  analyst at William Blair who covers General Electric and expects it to be a boon to the company s automation business

1740,223255,DMRC,High Digital Marks For Digimarc,opinion,Digimarc  DMRC  has seen tremendous stock price volatility in recent quarters  which is generally par for the course for most small cap companies  Currently  the stock trades almost 60  below its 1 5 year high  potentially offering value investors an opportunity  Despite cash and marketable securities of about  43 million  and no debt  along with free cash flow generation of  9 million per year  the company trades for just  128 million  For a company in a declining industry  perhaps this seems reasonable  But Digimarc may hold a moat in what appears to be a growing industry  Digimarc provides technology for digitally  watermarking  various media  including images  audio and video  Media content itself is encoded with digital information in such a way that it is imperceptible to the eye  and yet can be decoded digitally  This allows the watermarked product to survive compression  format conversion and other changes that can otherwise strip out the information that is meant to be preserved   Applications for this technology include combating piracy  verifying authenticity and enhancing search capability  Digimarc s licenses are protected via a combination of copyrights  patents and trade secrets  giving the company a potential competitive advantage in an in demand industry  One thing worth noting  however  is that the company s free cash flow is deceptively high relative to its earnings  This is because Digimarc appears to be rather generous with its stock options  as a result  while the company has spent some  25 million on share repurchases over the last three years  the share count has barely budged  There remain a great deal of options outstanding  so be sure to take these into account in your valuation  Finally  it s also worth pointing out that only five customers represent 94  of the company s revenue  Included in these figures  however  are revenues from partners that license Digimarc s technology for the sole purpose of re licensing it to other customers as part of a more complete solution  As such  the customer concentration figure is likely significantly overstated  If no competing solutions are identified for marking protecting digital assets  it s hard to imagine a scenario where Digimarc s stock does not generate strong returns from its current price  At the same time  however  there are a number of competitors  including Digimarc s own partners  working on trying to circumvent Digimarc s patents or render them obsolete  At the current price  it appears Mr  Market is betting on the latter   Disclosure  No position ,2012-11-29,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/high-digital-marks-for-digimarc-145518,145518
1741,223256,DMRC,4 Stocks To Watch Today  DMRC  ORBC  SGI,opinion,"It was an interesting day on Wall Street on Tuesday  There was movement all over the place  but a nice rally at the end of the day caused some gains on the session  Look  we had this set up for a rally because of the negative tick that came down about 216 230 on Tuesday  Let s take a look at the charts that did well on Tuesday 
Digimarc Corporation  O DMRC  is doing great  The inverse head and shoulders was broken with a breakaway gap and thrust to close at the high end of the range on Tuesday  up 6 84 to 41 78  or 20   on 257 100 shares traded  It was a nice day trade for us  With 15 32 days to cover  it could easily test the July high at 49 25  Look for a follow through to get it to 46 47 first 
ORBCOMM Inc  O ORBC   a swing trade of ours  is acting well  up 19 cents to 7 50  or 2 6   on 749 000 shares traded on Tuesday  The key to this stock is  looking at the long term consolidation  two years in the making  it s acting like it wants to blow through it  It already made it through the June high  It still has the Feb Mar highs from 2014  which  if taken out  would be a test of the 8 00 8 10 range  which is the short term target  Long term it may have a chance at 9 00 
Silicon Graphics International  O SGI had a big pop on Tuesday  up 1 50 to 6 24  or 31 5   on 2 9 million shares  It was a good day trade for our group  particularly at the end of the day when it made a nice move  It broke out of a coil  ran up  pulled back and closed up on the day  The next directive would be to take out 6 65  which could happen as early as Wednesday  Ultimately  this is a stock that can get to 8 00  A thrust like this  with 8 74 days to cover  and 2 9 million shares  it may follow through
