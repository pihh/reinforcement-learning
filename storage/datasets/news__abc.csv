within the hour With that  I will turn the call over to Steve Steven H  Collis    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you and good morning to everyone on today s call  Today I am pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen s strong fiscal 2020 first quarter results  We delivered solid performance across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services   Animal Health groups  each delivering year over year growth in the first quarter  Revenues were up 5  to  48 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was  1 76 for the first quarter  an increase of 10  compared to the previous fiscal year period Before we provide more details on our first quarter results  I want to take a few moments to discuss the ongoing opioid litigation and the decision to exit the PharMEDium business  AmerisourceBergen and other parties continued the complex process of working toward a global resolution of the opioid litigation  while also continuing to prepare for upcoming trials  We are hopeful that the necessary parties understand and see the merits of the global framework as a practical path for global resolution  As we engage in discussions related to the global framework and continue to litigate  we are unable to comment deeply on these matters at this time  AmerisourceBergen remains committed to transparency and providing shareholders with updates as we are able Moving on to PharMEDium  At this point last year  we detailed how we had begun a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium and engaged new cGMP expert consulting firm to work with the business s new seasoned  Phonetic  leadership team  As we stated at that time  we entered this review phase with a focus on pursuing a thoughtful and decisive course of action that was best for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders  while respecting both the needs of our customers and other stakeholders Over the past year  we worked internally to optimize the business  continued discussions with regulators  and reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree for PharMEDium with the FDA focused on remediating the business  Despite this progress  we still face considerable challenges in order to successfully move the business forward  including  ongoing regulatory challenges  continued operational issues  inability to make sufficient progress on remediation  and the continued financial burden of running the business  Given these factors  we made the difficult decision to shut down and exit the PharMEDium business  The decision is a difficult one and we are mindful of the impact this has on our associates and customers  We want to thank all PharMEDium associates for their dedication  and we are appreciative of their efforts As part of the shutdown process  we will provide impacted associates with the support and services they need  We are also disappointed that PharMEDium will no longer be able to serve its customers but believe exiting the business is appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders  Jim will provide financial details  including the decision s impact on fiscal 2020 guidance  later in the call Turning now to our first quarter results  AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our unique pharmaceutical centered strategy that positions us well within the US market  Additionally  the company s core strengths and capabilities regarding our unrivaled talent  Phonetic   expertise  and ability to provide comprehensive solutions continues to differentiate us from our peers  I want to thank our associates for their dedication  executional excellence  and focus on consistently creating and delivering value for all of our stakeholders  I am proud to work alongside our teams who remain relentless in their pursuit of opportunities to unlock value for pharmaceutical manufacturers  healthcare providers  and the patients they serve Within Pharmaceutical Distribution Services  the segment s success reflects its continued focus on customer experience  in addition to our ongoing strength in specialty distribution and overall growth in customer volumes  AmerisourceBergen is the leader in specialty distribution and our strong growth continues to be fueled by our deep expertise and key customer relationships  on organically growing market with favorable demographics  and increased pharmaceutical utilization resulting from innovation within specialty  particularly in the areas of oncology  ophthalmology  and rheumatology In these and other therapeutic categories AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver value and provide differentiated services and solutions to key customer segments such as our community physician practice partners  A key differentiator for our specialty business  our ION GPO remains a competitive advantage in our suite of offerings to oncology physician practices  As a market leading GPO for community oncologists  ION provides physicians with the contracting  analytics  and business practice solutions they need to run their practices more efficiently and profitably  At the same time  we continue to see positive early signs for biosimilar utilization  We believe that the right conditions exist in the US for increasing biosimilar commercialization success We continue to see signs that legislators and commercial plans are recognizing the potential of biosimilars to create better access and affordability for patients  AmerisourceBergen s market leading position in specialty strongly positions us to benefit from biosimilars  We have aligned ourselves with key customers and biosimilar manufacturers understand the value of contracting with ION as they seek to increase utilization of their products  These elements  combined with our scale  efficiency  state of the art distribution network  and competitive sourcing capabilities  position AmerisourceBergen to capitalize on market opportunities AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to seize market opportunities in animal health and pharmaceutical manufacturer services through our Global Commercialization Services   Animal Health group  businesses that comprise approximately 20  of AmerisourceBergen s operating income  Our largest business in the segment  MWI  is a market leader in animal health solutions with the right strategic partnerships and capabilities should enhance operational efficiencies and deliver strong customer experience  while our portfolio of global commercialization services strengthens health outcomes  while supporting pharmaceutical innovation with data driven solution that advance and support patient access and adherence to therapy For example  Xcenda s health economics consulting and FieldTech  Phonetic  team reimbursement support services are helping manufacturers maximize market access for products  while the Lash Group s technology enabled patient access and adherence solutions are helping to reduce barriers for patients to start and stay on therapy Essential to pharmaceutical manufacturers ability to commercialize and improve access to innovative therapies is ability to transport trial products and unique patient treatments like cell and gene therapies on time and at the right temperature  World Courier  the global market leader in specialty and clinical trial logistics  is a trusted solutions part that services these complex needs for manufacturers around the world  Operating over 30 countries  this highly differentiated and innovative business continues to grow and expand  This business delivers unparalleled service offerings for its pharmaceutical partners in clinical trial logistics and commercial services For example  World Courier s Cocoon offering is the industry s most dependable and cost effective refrigerated container solution providing unprecedented reliability and driving strong momentum for the business this year  In addition  World Courier s Nova technology platform further improves operational excellence  scaling to meet the demand and complex requirements of our global customers  Looking ahead  World Courier will continue to design and deploy patient centric and forward thinking transport services in new areas like in home clinical trials making treatments in patients  home possible in virtually every therapeutic area I am proud of AmerisourceBergen s role as the global healthcare solutions leader and purpose driven organization  We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and recognize that there is always a patient connected to every product  Pharmaceutical care is still the most efficient form of healthcare and medication adherence provides positive health benefits for patients  while saving lives and the healthcare systems hundreds of billions of dollars annually  Adherence should be the goal for which all healthcare stakeholders are striving  As an enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies  AmerisourceBergen will continue to engage in constructive dialog around benefit design and rising out of pocket cost for patients and the sustainability and efficiency of the healthcare system As a leader in the healthcare supply chain  AmerisourceBergen remains well positioned to create sustained long term value  Execution of our four key strategic pillars  strong customer base  leadership in specialty distribution and services  innovative services and solutions  and proven corporate stewardship positions us well to benefit from market trends within evolving market landscape As we move further into fiscal 2020  we will continue to advance our talent and culture and execute on our unique and differentiated business strategy  More than ever  we remain confident in our growth strategy  focused on execution and dedicated to delivering long term value for our associates  shareholders  partners  customers  and the patients they serve Thank you again for your interest in AmerisourceBergen  I will now turn the call over to Jim for a more in depth review of our first quarter fiscal 2020 results  Jim James F  Cleary    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Steve  and good morning  everyone  My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non GAAP financial results  Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter  unless otherwise noted  For a discussion of our GAAP results  please refer to our earnings release As Steve mentioned  we had a strong quarter with solid execution in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and continued growth in our Global Commercialization Services   Animal Health  Before I discuss our results in greater detail this morning  I want to take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we took for PharMEDium as of December 31st and the January strategic decision to exit the business First  the GAAP asset impairment for PharMEDium  We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium s long lived assets as of December 31 and made the determination that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the assets should have a lower carrying value  As a result  we calculated the fair value of PharMEDium s long lived assets using undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31st and determined the asset impairment amount to be  138 million Second  I ll cover the decision to exit the PharMEDium business  As Steve said  the company has decided to exit the compounding business  and as a result  we ll cease all commercial and administrative operations related to the business  The decision to exit the PharMEDium business was not easy  but it is undoubtedly the right path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders  As Steve noted  the decision was based on a number of factors  notably continuing regulatory and operational challenges  including PharMEDium s decision earlier this month to suspend production at its New Jersey facility  In addition to the December quarter impairment charge  as a result of the decision in January to exit the business  the company expects to impair the majority of the remaining  55 million of tangible PharMEDium assets and all of the remaining  185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the March quarter Finally  as a result of the exit  we expect to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimate that we will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022 totaling approximately  500 million to  600 million  This will benefit our GAAP P L and GAAP tax rate but will not impact our adjusted tax rate  However  it will have a positive impact on cash flows in the years in which the benefit is realized  As it pertains to the adjusted non GAAP results for the remainder of the year  our decision to exit PharMEDium will have a positive impact on our outlook for fiscal 2020  which I will provide greater detail on in a few minutes Turning now to our first quarter results  I ll provide commentary in two main areas this morning  First  I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance  Second  I will cover our increased fiscal 2020 guidance  reflecting the continued strength of AmerisourceBergen s businesses  a lower share count  and the removal of PharMEDium for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2020 We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of  1 76  an increase of 10   primarily due to higher operating income and a lower share count  Lower net interest expense was offset by an increase in income taxes  Also  our December quarter of last year had unfavorable bad debt expense  which benefits the current year over year comparison by a couple pennies Our consolidated revenue was  47 9 billion  up 5   driven by strong revenue growth in both segments  Gross profit increased 3   or  40 million  to  1 24 billion  Consolidated operating expenses increased 2  to  748 million  This quarter is an easier comparison on the balance of fiscal 2020 due to a few reasons that we have called out previously  First  we had not yet lapped the healthcare benefit design change that was implemented for calendar 2019  Second  much of the operational synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of H D  Smith were captured after the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Additionally  we executed on delivering better than expected expense management across the business in the quarter  most notably within the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment Consolidated operating income was  495 million  up 5  with our operating margin down one basis point  As I mentioned earlier  there were some favorable items related to bad debt expense comparison  healthcare  and the timing of H D  Smith synergy capture  Our businesses  with the exception of PharMEDium  are executing well and the strength of our business continues to show through in our financial results as we posted another solid quarter of growth in operating income As it pertains to PharMEDium  since the decision to exit the business was made in January  PharMEDium s adjusted operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will remain in our full year fiscal 2020 results  The adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in the first quarter was  20 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of  14 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 Moving below the operating income line  Net interest expense decreased 26  to  31 million  As a reminder  the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 has a favorable impact on the interest expense line as certain build to suit leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases are being accounted for as operating leases  resulting in an offsetting unfavorable impact on operating expenses and therefore operating income  In addition to the lower interest expense  we continue to benefit from interest income related to our higher average invested cash balance Moving now to income taxes  our adjusted income tax rate was 21   up from 19 9  in the prior year quarter  which benefited from a discrete state income tax item  Our diluted share count decreased 3  to 207 5 million shares  In the December quarter  we used opportunistic share repurchases to return  135 million of capital to our shareholders  While on the topic of returning capital to shareholders  this morning we also announced that the company s Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5   AmerisourceBergen has a balanced approach to capital deployment  and as evidenced by share repurchases and dividend increase  we have exhibited our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders Regarding free cash flow and cash balance  in the December quarter we had free cash flow of  76 million as we experienced normal seasonality in the business and remain on track for hitting our adjusted free cash flow guidance  Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was  134 million  As a reminder  the company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  excluding significant unpredictable or non recurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements minus capital expenditures  We ended the quarter with  3 2 billion in cash  of which  1 1 billion was held offshore and the majority was US denominated cash This completes the review of our consolidated results  Now I will turn to our segment results  beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services  Segment revenue was  46 billion  up 5   as the segment continues to benefit from continued strength in the specialty distribution of specialty products in multiple channels and the growth of our customers overall  Our segment operating income increased 5  to  392 million  We continue to be encouraged by our team s ability to execute and deliver value for our partners  both upstream and down  particularly in our specialty physician services group As I mentioned earlier  the segment did benefit from favorable bad debt expense compared to the previous year quarter as well as the year over year comparison of no longer operating the H D  Smith distribution centers that we began transitioning to our existing distribution network in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 I will now turn to the other segment  businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services   Animal Health  including World Courier  AmerisourceBergen Consulting  and MWI  In the quarter  revenue was  1 8 billion  up 10   driven by 8  growth for MWI and double digit growth in Global Commercialization Services  From an operating income standpoint  this group had operating income of  104 million  up 6   driven by growth in Consulting and World Courier The group is off to a solid start  and we are encouraged by the growth expectations for the business this year  The Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health group is a positive differentiator for AmerisourceBergen  As we look out into the future  we are focused on being leaders in providing key manufacturer services to support pharmaceutical innovation  and we are investing to fortify our strength and overall value proposition through projects like Fusion at Lash and Nova at World Courier  Additionally  MWI has continued to strengthen its customer relationships and commercial partnerships and is focused on execution to further enhance efficiency This completes the review of our segment results  Let me now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance  As we said in this morning s press release  we are raising our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance from a range of  7 30 to  7 60 to an updated range of  7 55 to  7 80  which implies EPS growth of 6  to 10  and reflects the company s continued strong performance  opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter  and our exit of the PharMEDium business which represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase Regarding operating income  we now expect to grow consolidated operating income in the mid single digit percent range to reflect the continued strength of our overall business and the year over year favorability of not having PharMEDium losses in our adjusted operating income results for the balance of the year  We now expect the operating income in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the mid single digit percent range  As a result of exiting the PharMEDium business  our fiscal second  third  and fourth quarters will have a favorable comparison to the respective fiscal 2019 quarters in which we recorded adjusted PharMEDium operating losses of  14 million   9 million  and  18 million  respectively  In total  the fiscal 2020 adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium is solely what we recorded in Q1   20 million  The total adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019 was  55 million  Therefore  the exit of PharMEDium results in a fiscal 2020 operating income tailwind of  35 million versus the prior year Since we will not be revising our previously reported adjusted non GAAP operating results  we are providing this additional level of detail as part of our focus on being as transparent as possible on the financial impact of the PharMEDium exit and providing key information for your modeling purposes Regarding share repurchases  given the level of share repurchases in the December quarter  we now expect to finish the year around 208 million weighted average shares outstanding  Lastly  while we do not have specific guidance metrics  broadly speaking  both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations  while we do not provide quarterly guidance  I will note that our second quarter EPS growth is likely to be at the low end of the 6  to 10  EPS guidance growth range for the year as we expect an increase in our operating expense growth in the quarter  On our second quarter call last year  I noted that there were some positive general and administrative expense items that benefited that quarter  We do not expect those items to repeat in 2020 In closing regarding PharMEDium  our review has been both thoughtful and decisive  but there comes a point in time where you have to make a decision that the path you ve been on is no longer appropriate and our decision to exit the business is the right path forward from here Despite this strategic change  the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen remain unchanged  We have strong customer relationships in each customer segment  our businesses are focused on execution and bringing innovative services and solutions to our partners  We have leadership in key specialty markets  notably specialty distribution and commercialization services  And finally  AmerisourceBergen is purpose driven and focused on creating shareholder value through thoughtful corporate stewardship with a balanced and strategic approach to capital allocation and a clear emphasis on advancing our talent and culture  AmerisourceBergen is executing very well across the business  Our value proposition through our partners is undeniable  and we are well positioned to create long term value for all of our stakeholders Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen  Now I will turn the call back to the operator to start our Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  The first question will come from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs   Co  LLC    AnalystI guess just to focus on the pharma segment guidance change and PharMEDium  I guess  Steve  first  maybe could you talk a little bit about whether or not there was a sale process around PharMEDium  any discussions maybe with the FDA about the ramifications or potential ramifications from exiting this business just on thinking about the largest compounding pharmacy business out there  And then you gave a lot of detail  Jim  around the change in the pharma segment guidance as far as the impact in the quarter and the balance of the year from PharMEDium  I guess maybe just to take a step back  did any of your other assumptions change outside of the PharMEDium math you provided as far as thinking about 2Q through 4Q Steven H  Collis    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Bob  I ll start with the PharMEDium question  Obviously a disappointing day for ABC  But I think that Jim s script was excellent  And by the way  I apologize to everyone  I think the quality of the sound was not quite what we would hope and we ll really endeavor to better next time  But I think Jim s comments were excellent  You can see from the financial disclosures  we ve displayed a lot of perseverance with this business  And it s just  I think the 503B changes have made it very difficult to scale the business and get to the sort of consistent quality that we  AmerisourceBergen  would like to deliver to our customers And we continue to experience ongoing regulatory challenges and challenges with the remediation program we put in place  We announced on this call that our New Jersey facility recently had to close  And so we really went into this year with an attitude of wanting to protect our profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders  And we had a lot of  I think  perseverance with this business  And I think that we reached this decision and we think that given where the business is  it would be very difficult to enter into a sales process We have certainly been in close communication with the FDA throughout the consent decree negotiation and the consent decree implementation  We think that we ve approached this as a good stakeholder  We certainly regard regulators as a stakeholder  and we will work collaboratively and transparently with them and professionally with them through the closure Jim  you want to answer the second part of the question James F  Cleary    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  sure  Bob  the second part of the question  my understanding had to do with guidance impact and other than PharMEDium  which I really went into a lot of detail on in the call  what were the other things that impacted guidance  particularly as it relates to our Pharmaceutical Distribution business  And as I said during my prepared remarks  if you look at our increase in guidance  the exit of the PharMEDium business represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase  And so if you look at the  0 20 increase in guidance at the top end of the range  the exit of PharMEDium represents slightly less than half the guidance increase  the benefit of excluding those losses in Q2 through Q4 And so that means that the rest of the business is performing quite well  and we are seeing really good performance in the core pharma distribution business  As we talked about  we re seeing a lot of strength in specialty distribution  in particular  our specialty physician services business  We re seeing good volume growth in the Pharma Distribution business  We re seeing 5  volume growth  That s due to  of course  our balanced portfolio of customers  And so we really feel good about our Q1 performance and the impact that that s having on our full year guidance  And of course  it relates to our Pharma Distribution business you asked about  but also good volumes and good performance in our Global Commercialization Services   Animal Health business  which had 10  revenue growth in the quarter  and so that positively impacts our fiscal year guidance also  Bob OperatorThe next question will come from Eric Percher of Nephron Research Eric Percher    Nephron Research LLC    AnalystContinuing with PharMEDium  I know over the last two years it s been pretty clear that hospitals don t particularly want to be in this business  and at one point  this was an effort to extend the hospital relationship  As you shutter it  do you see any impact on the other business that you have focused on the hospital and particularly with respect to the specialty business  How do you help ensure that those relationships don t sour and impact specialty Steven H  Collis    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerObviously  of course  we thought about associates and our customers  and unfortunately since the closure of members  we ve never really been able to deliver the consistent customer experience that an AmerisourceBergen company would like to have  And there is a lot of reasons for it  And in the six years since of passage of the 503B legislation  I think there was a really strong expectation to move to a very high cGMP standard immediately  And as you pointed out correctly  we were by far the largest  So I think having that leadership position  there were very high expectations that put on us  And I think we really  along with some talented associates  dedicated associates  and some new leadership team  some new outside experts  we really did a tremendous effort to meet the high bar  But there is a lot of    we do  Indecipherable  lot of powder products in the marketplace  It s hard to reach scale  and there s tremendous consequences if something doesn t go    if something goes badly  like at least as far as the FDA expectations So for ABC  which we have our purpose  we have our stakeholder value set  we just made a decision that this is not a business that really fits into our portfolio  Our customers have been understanding  I think  somewhat disappointed  but I think it reflects the reality of where we are with regulators  where we are with the powder products in this market  where we are with the economics in the overall health system  And again  we don t want to be in a business where we can t provide a very reliable exceptional efficient service  So I think that s about all we can say there OperatorThe next question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan Lisa Gill    JP Morgan Securities LLC    AnalystSteve  how are you thinking about IPI pricing  Clearly  specialty is a sweet spot for ABC  But there is a lot of talk about changes around reimbursement  And I m just curious how you re thinking about that  Do you think anything will change here in your fiscal 2020  What are your conversations with the actual providers in the marketplace  that community based physician  Just any color you can help us understand how you re thinking about this would be helpful Steven H  Collis    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI d say this is our number two concern is specialty  Our number one concern is physician reimbursement and making sure that that those community staff  Phonetic  can continue to serve patients in the community setting  Manufacturers are obviously another key stakeholder  but they re large  they re sophisticated  and I think that there ll be some very legitimate conversations  And in fact  often when these conversations start  actions change in the marketplace in anticipation of those changes  and I think you see some changes  You ve seen very moderate inflation  In fact  on the Part B products  there s always been moderate inflation because of the ASP reimbursement So if there is International Reference Pricing  as we discussed in January  Lisa  I hope that it will be a thoughtful transition that it will give manufacturers time to adjust  I think that a lot of noise is not actually factual  The price differentials are not quite as high as one would have you believe and sometimes people tend to take steeper prices and there are a lot of things that are behind the wholesale acquisition cost and ASP with commercial payers that aren t always recognized And one thing as well  with government and single payer systems  the price gets negotiated upfront and then there is no changes  So that s one of the nuances that are different in the US system  So complex topic  You can  Indecipherable  even at the CEO level  I m very engaged and very passionate about it  I saw the head of our government affairs officers today  We re talking about it  Barry Fortner  who heads up our physician services businesses  is in Washington constantly  Our business ION  as you can imagine  is very involved with practice management  So we are going to be a part of the discussion  and we look forward to participating in any changes and hope that are sensible and logical in the context of Part B reimbursement Lisa Gill    JP Morgan Securities LLC    AnalystIs it still anticipated that it will be under some kind of competitive acquisition program  And so if that s the case  do you see maybe potential incremental opportunity for ABC  So I understand what you re saying around the pricing dynamic is already starting to change  And so maybe we don t see a huge impact of pricing  but is there the potential for you to either gain or potentially lose some amount of market share around a competitive acquisition program Steven H  Collis    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI feel like we re going back to the  90s with the Medicare Modernization Act  At the time  I think there was great anticipation that ABC with our suite of our businesses  we would participate  And actually it was the 2000s  of course  the Bush administration  And there was no economically feasible way for us to participate  And I ll tell you  we brought in people especially to evaluate CAP provider mainly to ensure that our customers would be able to carry on participating and it was just    it was impossible to make the numbers work We don t believe it s very efficient  We ve seen so called white bagging and brown bagging programs tried to be implemented by different payers  more on the commercial side  and they just haven t worked  And the original CAP program didn t work  So there is potential wastage which with these programs  We believe that the current system works very well with oncologist having the financial responsibility for the preparation of the infusions And we will carry on assisting with that  If there were to be a new type of reimbursement and there was differentiated reimbursement or some sort of encouragement to more toward the CAP program  we would look to work with what are some very large  much more aggregate community oncologists  We would look to work with them to provide solutions to payers and regulators OperatorThe next question will come from Glen Santangelo of Guggenheim Glen Santangelo    Guggenheim Securities LLC    AnalystJim  I just want to follow up on the guidance question  I appreciate all the detail  You seem to suggest that over the next three quarters  there will be about a  35 million tailwind from eliminating the losses from PharMEDium  which I understand the EPS impact  But if we could just look at it from an operating income perspective  that  35 million seems to be about a 2  tailwind  which seems like it would fully explain the change in your guidance from low  to mid single up to mid single  I m just trying to understand is there    has anything changed with respect to your assumptions around the core distribution business because I just want to try to reconcile that versus the much stronger than expected first quarter  which seemed to incorporate a bigger than expected loss from PharMEDium  So if you could just sort of reconcile those that d be great James F  Cleary    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And so I will cover that  And you re right  we indicated that PharMEDium is a  35 million tailwind year over year versus last year  And so that s kind of the benefit that we ll see year over year compared to last year  And as we look at guidance  as I said before  taking PharMEDium out of the last three quarters  it s about half the increase to guidance And we are seeing strength throughout the businesses  Of course  guidance is a range  So going from the low  to mid single digits  PharMEDium was a big part of that  but we re also seeing strength throughout the businesses that s impacting our guidance increase also  and it s pretty broad based  We talked about specialty physician services  but we re seeing strength throughout the business One thing that I ll mention  as you talked about the first quarter  During the first quarter  one thing we benefited from is low growth in operating expenses  Our operating expenses grew 2  during the first quarter and that included some year over year benefits  which we don t expect to continue through the rest of the year  And so that was a favorable experience on bad debt expense  favorable experience on our internal healthcare costs  There is a benefit design change in calendar year 2019 that we were still benefiting from year over year  And then also the operational synergies related to consolidating the H D  Smith distribution centers And so that s kind of one thing which benefited the first quarter  which doesn t continue for the rest of the year  And then as we said  the second quarter    we re expecting the growth in the second quarter  the EPS growth  to be at the lower end of our 6  to 10  EPS growth range  because last year we had particularly favorable operating expense experience in the second quarter  which we are expecting to repeat in the second quarter of this year  And so I think that gives you some additional color there  Glen Glen Santangelo    Guggenheim Securities LLC    AnalystYeah  That s all really helpful  Thanks  Jim  And Steve  I just wanted to follow up with you with one quick question on the balance sheet  As of this quarter  you have about  900 million in net debt  and based on your free cash flow assumptions  you re going to be cash    have positive cash on the balance sheet here in the next two to three quarters  And so I m just kind of wondering with PharMEDium now in the rearview mirror  has any    have your thoughts changed at all with respect to the balance sheet or capital deployment priorities and how should we think about that going forward Steven H  Collis    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  we ve had a very consistent capital deployment strategy  I think last year we returned    in fiscal year 2019  we returned  1 billion to shareholders of which was approximately 30  dividend  70  share buybacks and that s approximate numbers  And we like to have financial flexibility  So our first option is to invest in the business  and we re bullish about projects like Fusion  for example  and we talked about the strong growth of World Courier  which in part is because of the Nova and the Cocoon investments So those are good investments  And a couple years ago we were making tremendous investments with ABC order and the distribution networks  Those are very good examples of core business investments  We remain interested in that  We are of course    our replenishment center in Ohio is a good example of another core investment that we re doing  So that s the first priority We then look    we d look at the right sort of acquisitions  Unfortunately  it s been really a seller s market  and the quality of I think if we found really the right asset and the management team was convinced that we had in our company with a leadership position  with the right sort of a fit for our customers  and the patients and physicians that we support  I think we could be talking to paying significantly more than our multiple because we understand that that s probably it s what s required in this market  But we really haven t seen the sort of asset and that motivates us It s about two years ago since we acquired H D  Smith with close to  1 billion  That s worked out really  really well  There s not really opportunities on the regional side  So  we just haven t seen great opportunities  I think where we re interested is in the commercialization services  expansion of the MWI business  That could be something we re very interested in  We ve made a couple more investments in our Brazil and Canadian businesses where we have a solid presence  management team that we can invest behind  So those all things And then  of course  we ll continue to be very thoughtful where we re increasing our dividend we announced this morning  So you ll continue to see us be very thoughtful about returns to shareholders  I hope that makes sense OperatorThe next question will come from Charles Rhyee of Cowen Charles Rhyee    Cowen and Company LLC    AnalystSteve  I think earlier on you talked about biosimilars and sort of the growth there  If you look at the data    if we look at the data last year  we did see a big    starting to really see a big uptick in sort of adoption particularly when you look at something like Neulasta or Epogen  How much are you monitoring here  sort of the shift particularly with the biosimilar insulin  Is that an opportunity for you guys because that looks like will be deemed interchangeable  And then if you have any thoughts on when you expect other biologics to become interchangeable  And would that create a market for biosimilars that mimic more of the traditional generics market and perhaps bring more purchasing power back toward the supply chain side Steven H  Collis    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerJust in general  the biosimilar numbers are encouraging  I think we talked about at the end of fiscal  19 just how the growth in our expectations  And I wouldn t say that trend continues  The numbers are still small  but ABC has we think an important place to play in adoption of biosimilars with the market presence we have particularly in oncology and other specialty markets  Diabetes is a very important market for our Good Neighbor Pharmacy customers because that was sort of complex  chronic conditions are exactly what we think community pharmacy is very well set up to play a role in  So definitely we d be interested I think one of the ways and I m really proud ABC has developed is on our sourcing side  We have I d say over the last decade or so since I moved up here  we ve really invested lot of resources there  We have very proficient people on the manufacturing side that really are working I think very competently and positioning us well for the long term to be the key player in biosimilar adoption  particularly on the injectable and infusible side So we like what we see  and it s something that we monitor very  very closely and are staying close to  as you would expect  We regard it as one of the key opportunities that ABC has for the next couple of years  so thanks OperatorThe next question will come from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley   Co  LLC    AnalystSo one guidance question and one just follow up on PharMEDium  So on the PharMEDium side  if we think about PharMEDium from a pro forma basis and we just kind of like exclude the losses that you incurred from them last year  what would be the pro forma EBIT growth for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment  So that s on them And then secondly  if we think about kind of like your guidance for the remainder of the year  it seems that the top line guidance seems to be skewed toward an acceleration 2Q to 4Q  if you think about the midpoint from what you reported in the first quarter  So where are you seeing that incremental growth coming from  Is it additional volume coming from existing customers  I know that last quarter we talked about the potential of gaining more business from Cigna or anything else that you re seeing in the marketplace  maybe on the specialty side  that you can provide color on that drives the acceleration for the rest of the year James F  Cleary    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And so we re seeing broad based growth across the business  seeing particularly strong growth in specialty distribution  but really broad based growth in many parts of the business  We have called out the Cigna volume being added to Express Scripts  which is    we indicated that that is approximately one quarter of our revenue growth  And while it s inherently lower margin business  it is positive for growing revenue and operating income dollars  But we re seeing growth in several businesses  And as you noted  we re seeing particularly good growth in our Global Commercialization Services   Animal Health business And then you asked about growth if we exclude PharMEDium  And I think we provided  Ricky  really good detail on that in our prepared remarks that the impact on PharMEDium if we re looking year over year  is a  55 million adjusted operating loss last year and this year in our adjusted results will be  20 million adjusted operating loss  And so if we look year over year  it is a  35 million tailwind to the business  but we are seeing excluding that good growth throughout our various businesses  in particular  our specialty distribution business  but throughout the business OperatorThe next question will come from Steven Valiquette of Barclays Steven Valiquette    Barclays Capital  Inc     AnalystSo just a question on the financial hurdle on the sale versus shutdown decision for PharMEDium  And I guess to my mind I feel like any asset that was arguably worth  2 6 billion in the marketplace only four years ago would still have some value today  either in the hands of private equity or another strategic buyer  I m guessing that the private transaction value of PharMEDium today is probably not zero dollars  What I wanted to just sort of dig into quickly here is  generally speaking  should we conclude that the cash tax benefits of  500 million to  600 million that ABC is receiving from shutting it down that outweigh the benefits of any after tax proceeds you might have received in the sale transaction  or would you have gotten or received those cash tax benefits even in a low price sale transaction  I m just trying to better understand what was the financial hurdle on the sale versus shut decision that was probably something well above zero dollars  but I just wanted to understand that a little bit better James F  Cleary    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  We felt that the business was not saleable due to the ongoing regulatory challenges  continued operational issues  continued challenges to achieving the remediation timetable which was extending  and the continued financial burden of running the business  And so due to that we made the decision to shut the business down as the most appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders  As you noted  we do have that cash tax benefit of  500 million to  600 million that we ll recognize between fiscal year  20 and fiscal year  22  That will benefit our GAAP P L  It will not benefit our adjusted P L  But there will be a benefit to cash flow over that    over that time period OperatorThe next question will come from George Hill of Deutsche Bank George Hill    Deutsche Bank AG    AnalystI ve got a quick follow up kind of on the balance sheet outlook  And Steve or Jim  I guess  can you talk about whether or not you guys feel the need to kind of war chest cash in anticipation of an opioid settlement  Or do you guys feel like you have continued flexibility to put money to work in the opioid settlement that we    I guess people expect to occur at some point is kind of own bucket  Phonetic   so to speak Steven H  Collis    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  as I said  our priorities for capital deployment are    I detailed them  We don t feel the need to war chest at all  because if you look at the framework that was announced  it was an 18 year settlement  So I think that s in anticipation of this sort of long term characteristics of the industry for not only us but our peers  our competitors as well So again that s the proposed framework  but that s a sort of framework that we d be interested in  So it s a sort of    it really plays  Indecipherable  long term  which also has the benefit of providing consistent support for the patient services that we think will be needed to transition population health management for this crisis  so in a way  if you want to call it that So no  it s not    we don t feel the need at all  It is a lot of cash in absolute terms  In relative terms  it s relative to a couple of hundred million dollars a day  Phonetic  in sales  It s not that much  And some of it is out the country  And there is tremendous seasonality in our business as well  So we like being in a strong cash position  but again we are mindful of fair returns to our shareholders and the internal and external opportunities that may be in the marketplace So with that  I think we are going to close this first quarter call  and we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen  I must say that this is probably the most difficult decision that we have made since I became CEO almost nine years ago  And the management team has really tried to persevere with this business  but it s    and it s been a very difficult decision  And we are  of course  especially conscious of the impact on our customers and our associates who we are committed to treating with utmost respect and transparency and dignity But I think it s incumbent on us to talk about the key strengths and the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen  which remain unchanged  as I think Jim commented on so well in his remarks  So as we stand here today  commercially  we have extremely strong customer relationships  partnerships  and leadership in key markets and services  Culturally  we are a purpose driven organization that feels united in  Phonetic  our responsibility to create healthier futures and AmerisourceBergen  I can assure you  is focused on creating long term growth and value for all its stakeholders  And again  we thank you for your time and attention this morning  Have a good day  Bye Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  59 minutesCall participants Bennett S  Murphy    Senior Vice President

performing impressively over the last few quarters in spite of certain quarterly volatilities  In fact  the ongoing US China trade war is likely to have impacted the fourth quarter performance of the industry participants  Nonetheless  favorable growth in the emerging markets and benefits obtained from innovation are likely to get reflected in the industry players  performance this earnings season Over the past few months  the medical device space has witnessed exceptional progress with regards to innovation   R D to be precise  Boston Scientific s   NYSE BSX   heart failure predictor

has been going from strength to strength Strong demand in the emerging markets is likely to have driven the performance of the industry participants in this reporting cycle  According to a  report  as stated by Moody s in 2019   the medical device makers are likely to exhibit mid single digit revenue growth fueled by product innovation across most of the companies and categories throughout 2019  Additionally  sales in emerging markets are expected to display a double digit percentage rise this year  Consequently  this trend is likely to get reflected in the performance of the industry players in this reporting cycle In the fourth quarter  the government came up with its funding bills where it suspended Medical Device tax of 2 3   This tax was originally enacted in 2013 as part of the Affordable Care Act  ACA   The burden of this 2 3  tax used to fall on the device manufacturer or importer  The suspension has come as a relief for medical device manufacturers  enabling them to channelize their funds into R D  This is expected to have impacted fourth quarter performance of the industry players However  the U S  China trade war triggered a short term downtrend in the Medical Instruments sector  Despite a series of recent exemptions by the U S  Trade Representative  USTR  and the introduction of the phase one trade deal  the industry is apprehensive about the impact that the trade war may have had on the fourth quarter  Going by a Forbes report   medical device makers say there is impact to the industry and the threat of more tariffs to come in an ongoing trade war with China is troubling  hitting various parts of the medtech industry  What Our Model SaysPer our proven model  the combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold

102643,324158,ABC,All You Need To Know About AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for AmerisourceBergen is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For AmerisourceBergen  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AmerisourceBergen
For the fiscal year ending September 2020  this prescription drug distributor is expected to earn  7 60 per share  which is a change of 7 2  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AmerisourceBergen  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of AmerisourceBergen to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-you-need-to-know-about-amerisourcebergen-abc-rating-upgrade-to-buy-200503998,200503998
102675,324190,ABC,Teva s proposed opioid settlement could cost drugmaker pennies on the dollar,news,"By Michael Erman and Nate Raymond NEW YORK BOSTON  Reuters    Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  Ltd s proposed  23 billion drug giveaway to settle thousands of U S  opioid lawsuits will likely cost the company a fraction of that figure due to how it has valued those medicines  according to a Reuters review of pricing data and industry analysts  When Teva  TA TEVA  announced the value of the donated medicine   a generic version of opioid addiction treatment Suboxone   it based the figure on the drug s list price  which does not account for significant discounts routinely provided by the drugmaker  If based on the estimated cost to manufacture the drugs  the value could be as low as  1 5 billion  drug pricing consultants and industry analysts say  A Teva spokeswoman declined to comment on the cost analysis for generic Suboxone  a combination of buprenorphine and the opioid reversal agent naloxone  In interviews with Reuters  lawyers representing local governments in the opioid litigation said the figure proposed by Teva inflates the real value of the drugs  They said the proposal will not be enough to address a nationwide addiction crisis that has claimed some 400 000 lives over the last two decades   The deal is  overvalued to make the settlement look better   said Hunter Shkolnik  a lawyer on the plaintiffs executive committee that is managing more than 2 300 federal lawsuits consolidated in the U S  District Court in Cleveland    I don t believe a no cash payment from Teva  one of the largest generic manufacturers in the world  is appropriate   he told Reuters  Israel based Teva is looking to reach a nationwide settlement over its role in selling opioid painkillers  together with drugmaker Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  and the three largest U S  drug distributors  AmerisourceBergen Corp  N ABC    Cardinal Health  Inc  N CAH  and McKesson Corp  N MCK   Negotiations between these companies and four state attorneys general leading the talks on behalf of their counterparts have focused on a total settlement value worth about  48 billion  including cash and free medicines   On Monday  Teva signaled progress in talks over its contribution aimed at directly helping addiction victims of this major public health crisis  Attorneys general of the four states had agreed on a proposed settlement under which Teva would provide  23 billion worth of generic Suboxone and pay  250 million in cash over 10 years  the company said   Teva said the donated drugs should meet most of the currently estimated U S  patient need for the next decade  The free drugs in lieu of cash would also help Teva avoid adding new debt to its balance sheet at a time that it is struggling to return to growth  Teva shares rose 8  after it disclosed details of the proposed settlement  The company denies any wrongdoing in its sale of opioids  saying it did not actively promote its generic versions of the painkillers with doctors  Many of the current lawsuits accuse drugmakers of aggressively marketing the medicines in a way that downplayed their potential addiction risk  INFLATED LIST PRICES Scrutiny of Teva s proposed settlement followed the company s disclosure on Monday that it would use a benchmark called  wholesale acquisition cost   WAC  to determine the value of the drugs provided for free   WAC   frequently referred to as the list price of a drug   does not include discounts or rebates and is often several times higher than what patients actually pay at the pharmacy    WAC cannot be trusted as a pricing benchmark for generic drugs   said Eric Pachman  founder of pharmaceutical consultancy 3 Axis Advisors   According to 3 Axis data  Teva s list price for its generic Suboxone ranged from 3 to 5 times what retail pharmacies paid  on average  for it in August  And that price represents a premium over the company s manufacturing costs   Jefferies analyst David Steinberg estimated that the cost of the donated drugs would be around  1 5 billion  while Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal suggested they could cost about  2 3 billion to produce  JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott s estimate of manufacturing costs for generic Suboxone was higher  ranging from  5 75 billion to  9 2 billion  still a long way from the company s projected  23 billion value  Avoiding significant cash costs is important for Teva  which is working to pay down nearly  27 billion in net debt  a legacy of its ill timed 2016 purchase of Allergan Plc s  N AGN  generic drugs business  Actavis  generics  The profit margin for generic drugs has fallen sharply since   Ori Hershkovitz  an independent consultant to pharmaceutical companies  previously held a mostly short position in Teva while at Nexthera Capital  a New York based healthcare focused investment firm   Teva s proposed settlement  if accepted  should help allay investor concerns over

102681,324196,ABC,Canadian drug distributors say no to Trump import plan,news,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO  Reuters    Many of Canada s drug suppliers cannot  or will not  agree to ship cheaper prescription medicines into the United States  a new challenge to the Trump administration s push to reduce drug prices  companies and industry officials told Reuters 
The administration on Wednesday proposed new regulations that would allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada  They would require a state such as Florida to partner with a wholesaler licensed by Health Canada  which regulates drugs 
Florida and other states have said they are eager to start importation programs  and the proposal took the federal government one step closer to approving that plan  But there are practical barriers to actually bringing in drugs 
Two drug distributors and two Canadian industry groups that between them represent all of the potential suppliers named in a proposal published by Florida in August said they are not interested in participating 
 We have not been contacted and we are not planning to participate   said  Loblaw Companies Ltd   TO L   which owns Canada s largest pharmacy chain Shoppers Drug Mart   Canadian patients currently face product and drug shortages and we are concerned this initiative may exacerbate what is already a critical issue  
Daniel Chiasson  president of the Canadian Association for Pharmacy Distribution Management  CAPDM   said none of its members would participate because their first priority was ensuring a safe and stable supply of medication for Canadians 
 It surprised everyone when their names appeared on that list   said Chiasson 
Mary Mayhew  secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration  said she was  excited and enthusiastic  about Wednesday s announcement 
 We are optimistic that Canadian suppliers will be interested  as the rule is understood  as there is more dialogue around this new and historic federal action   she said 
Chiasson said agreements between manufacturers and distributors prevent the export of products made for the Canadian market  creating a commercial risk and deterrent to exporting 
 These are issues we continue to consider and are committed to exploring how we might overcome any challenges and issues as we advance the proposed rule   U S  Food and Drug Administration spokesman Michael Felberbaum said in a statement 
Some of Canada s major distributors are subsidiaries of U S  companies  who are unlikely to participate in a program to lower prices  since their revenue reflects a cut of the value of the drugs they provide to pharmacies in the much larger U S  market 
McKesson Canada  a subsidiary of McKesson Corp  N MCK  referred questions to Chiasson  The organization is also a listed member of the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies Canada  a lobby group that opposes drug exports to the United States 
AmerisourceBergen  N ABC  said that protecting bottom lines was not the issue  because importation implied that distributors could buy low cost drugs and sell them in high cost markets 
 The reality is that legal and contractual barriers  as well as significant threat to the integrity of the supply chain  all stand in the way of importation being a viable solution   it said in a statement 
Kohl   Frisch  a large closely held distributor  did not respond to requests for comment   Metro Inc   TO MRU  which owns major pharmacy chain Jean Coutu  declined to comment 
One company on Florida s list is not a distributor in any traditional sense  but makes self serve pharmacy kiosks that resemble vending machines  They confirmed they would have no role in any import plan 
The remaining companies are members of the Association qu b coise des distributeurs en pharmacie  which takes the same position as CAPDM 
 Our members have no intention to sell drugs across the border  particularly in light of the rapidly increasing drug shortages in the Qu bec marketplace   said Director General Hugues Mousseau in a statement ",2019-12-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/canadian-drug-distributors-say-no-to-trump-import-plan-2046377,2046377

When looking at the last two reports  this prescription drug distributor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 4 94   on average  in the last two quarters

Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for AmerisourceBergen lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AmerisourceBergen has an Earnings ESP of  0 60  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 30  2020 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-amerisourcebergen-abc-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200498023,200498023

please check out our weekly Trends report     Johnson   Johnson s shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year   14 1  vs   14 8    likely reflecting a combination of litigation overhang and generic biosimilar headwinds in the Pharma unit However  the unit is performing above market levels  supported by contribution from new drugs like Tremfya and successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and immunology drug  Stelara  J J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline line extensions  However  headwinds like biosimilar generic competition and pricing pressure remain  Moreover  J J faces numerous lawsuits  which allege personal injuries to patients caused by the use of its products  These are

copper grades  lower by product credits and higher deferred stripping costs at Escondida With iron ore supply from Australia expected to hit record highs  iron ore prices will be under pressure  However  metal prices will recover eventually driven by demand supply imbalance Thus  BHP Group is poised to gain from its investment plans in petroleum  copper  iron ore and potash  Further  the company s efforts to make operations efficient by adopting smarter technology across its value chain will also drive results  Strong cash flow and lower debt also bode well  You can  Moody s shares have gained  25 8  over the past six months against the Zacks Financial Services industry s decline of  4 6   The Zacks analyst believes that the company remains well positioned on the back of its dominant position in the credit rating industry Also  the company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  Moreover  the earnings estimates have been going up ahead of its fourth quarter 2019 results Also  its diverse revenue base  strategic inorganic initiatives and strong balance sheet position bode well

102697,324212,ABC,Can Value Investors Choose AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AmerisourceBergen Inc    NYSE ABC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AmerisourceBergen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 78  If we focus on the long term PE trend  AmerisourceBergen s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 14 39 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 51  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AmerisourceBergen has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 12  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AmerisourceBergen stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  AmerisourceBergen has a P S ratio of about 0 11  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 59x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AmerisourceBergen currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AmerisourceBergen a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the PEG ratio for AmerisourceBergen is just 1 63  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 05  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  ABC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though AmerisourceBergen might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives ABC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best  The current quarter has seen none estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen none up and two down in the same time period  This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 0 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat sluggish trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineAmerisourceBergen is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 46  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for

102735,324250,ABC,Opioids settlement could be near  lawyer for local governments says,news,"By Kathy Gray
CLEVELAND  Reuters    Executives from several large healthcare companies and state attorneys general were progressing toward what is expected to be a multibillion dollar deal to resolve the sprawling litigation over the U S  opioid epidemic  a plaintiffs  lawyer said on Friday 
 I think we can get a long way   said Peter Weinberger  a lawyer for local governments that have sued the companies  when asked by a reporter if a deal was possible on Friday 
U S  District Court Judge Dan Polster summoned to his court executives from the largest U S  drug distributors  McKesson Corp  N MCK    Cardinal Health  Inc  N CAH  and AmerisourceBergen Corp  N ABC   and Israel based drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  Industries Ltd  TA TEVA  to try to hammer out a deal before a landmark federal trial starts on Monday 
Weinberger said Polster was shuttling between healthcare executives and state attorneys general and other plaintiffs  lawyers who were huddled privately in separate rooms in the Cleveland federal courthouse 
Polster is overseeing thousands of lawsuits by local governments that allege the companies fueled a public health crisis responsible for roughly 400 000 U S  deaths from 1999 to 2017  according government statistics 
Earlier this week  the companies proposed a deal that could be worth  50 billion to settle the litigation  two sources told Reuters 
Weinberger said smaller distributor  Henry Schein  Inc  O HSIC  was also participating in the talks  and the general counsel from pharmacy chain Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc  O WBA  was at the courthouse but not in the negotiations 
Those two companies round out the defendants in the trial that is scheduled to start on Monday 
If the parties make progress at Friday s talks  Polster has the option of postponing Monday s trial to give them more time to negotiate 
The complex litigation pits thousands of towns  cities  counties and tribal governments against numerous companies across the healthcare industry involved in the manufacture and distribution of opioids 
The governments are seeking to recover some of the billions of dollars spent on emergency services  treatment and policing as a result of increased addiction rates 
Attorneys general are separately suing in their own state courts  and while Polster does not have jurisdiction over those cases he invited them to join the talks to try to reach a deal 
The distributors have been accused of failing to flag and halt suspicious orders for opioids  while drugmakers are accused of promoting benefits of the drugs while playing down their risks 
The distributors have insisted that they were shipping FDA approved medicines prescribed by doctors  The drugmakers have also denied any wrongdoing 
Shares of the companies have risen this week in anticipation of a possible deal that could end the litigation  despite the possibility that each company could be on the hook for billions of dollars 
A settlement would remove uncertainty and allow the companies to distance themselves from a politically charged crisis  said a research note from Morningstar on Wednesday 
Monday s scheduled proceeding is a so called bellwether or test trial with two Ohio counties  Cuyahoga and Summit  serving as plaintiffs  A bellwether trial gives the parties a chance to assess a jury s reaction to the allegations  which could then shape a settlement of all the litigation 
Other defendants in lawsuits overseen by Polster include Johnson   Johnson    Mallinckrodt  Plc  N MNK   Endo International Plc  O ENDP   Walmart Inc  N WMT  and Allergan Plc  N AGN   among others 
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma  viewed as one of the main culprits in fueling the opioid crisis  is also no longer part of the Ohio trial after declaring bankruptcy ",2019-10-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/opioids-settlement-could-be-near-lawyer-for-local-governments-says-1999387,1999387
102736,324251,ABC,Drug companies reach  260 million opioid settlement with Ohio counties  averting landmark trial,news,"By Kathy Gray CLEVELAND  Reuters    Four large drug companies reached a last minute  260 million legal settlement on Monday over their role in the U S  opioid addiction epidemic  striking a deal with two Ohio counties to avert the first federal trial over the crisis  However  drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp  N ABC    Cardinal Health  Inc  N CAH  and McKesson Corp  N MCK  and drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  TEVA  fell short of a wider deal worth tens of billions of dollars to end all opioid litigation against them  The distributors  which handle around 90  of U S  prescription drugs  will pay a combined  215 million immediately  Israel based drugmaker Teva is paying  20 million in cash and will contribute  25 million worth of Suboxone  an opioid addiction treatment  according to Hunter Shkolnik  an attorney for the counties   Teva  the world s largest generic drugmaker  will makes its contribution over 18 months  according to Shkolnik  The deal settles claims brought by Ohio s Cuyahoga and Summit counties  which had accused the companies of fueling a nationwide opioid crisis  Some 400 000 U S  overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017 were linked to opioids  according to government data   While the companies strongly dispute the allegations made by the two counties  they believe settling the bellwether trial is an important stepping stone to achieving a global resolution and delivering meaningful relief   the distributors said a joint statement  Teva declined to comment  The so called bellwether or test trial was meant to help shape a broader settlement of some 2 600 lawsuits pending over the toll opioids have taken on local communities and the nation  Late on Friday  talks collapsed that were aimed at reaching a  48 billion global settlement of all opioid litigation against the same defendants  Shares in the companies had risen last week in anticipation of a broader deal  On Monday  shares of the big three drug distributors were down from more than 2  to 4   having trimmed some earlier losses   We are not surprised to see distributor shares giving back some of last week s gains as uncertainty persists in this extremely complex litigation   Baird analyst Eric Coldwell wrote in a note   STILL AT THE TABLE  The settlement  if extrapolated to nationwide deal resolving all litigation for the four defendants  suggests a settlement value of around  48 billion  based on a court approved allocation formula    We re still at the table   said Joe Rice  an attorney for the local governments  who indicated the timing of payments was a sticking point   This should be a global settlement  but it s got to be fair and it s got to be now    The judge overseeing the case  Dan Polster  said he would work out a new trial date for the remaining defendant  pharmacy chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  O WBA   Lawyers representing the local governments said in a statement on Monday that the litigation had revealed the country s pharmacy system  has played a greater role in the opioid epidemic than previously realized   Walgreens said in a statement on Monday that it only sold opioids to fill a valid prescription written by a licensed physician  It said it was diligent to prevent the diversion of controlled substances  A sixth defendant  the smaller distributor  Henry Schein  Inc  O HSIC   said on Monday it had been dismissed as a defendant from the trial after agreeing to a deal worth around  1 25 million  The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of overstating the benefits of opioids while downplaying the risks  Distributors allegedly failed to flag and halt a rising tide of suspicious orders  shipping vast amounts of the pills across the country  Drugmakers have denied wrongdoing  arguing their products carried U S  Food and Drug Administration approved labels that warned of the addictive risks of opioids  They say they did not cause the toll the epidemic has had on states and localities  Distributors had argued that they made up only  one component of the pharmaceutical supply chain  and their role was to make sure medicines prescribed by licensed doctors were available for patients  Monday s settlements add to deals worth  66 4 million that the two Ohio counties earlier struck with drug companies  Mallinckrodt  Plc  N MNK   Endo International Plc  O ENDP   Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  and Allergan Plc  N AGN   Armond Budish  county executive of Cuyahoga  said Friday s proposed global settlement  which had the support of state attorneys general  would have distributed funds over 18 years  not immediately   People are dying now   he said  Cuyahoga County has said it will use the funds to expand residential treatment beds  increase emergency care follow up and to create alternatives to jailing low level drug offenders  among other

The companies argued in a court filing that U S  District Judge Dan Polster  who is hearing the case in a federal court in Cleveland  Ohio  had made statements in court indicating that he was not impartial in the case and improperly pushed the companies to settle without going to trial 
The companies said that Judge Polster had also made improper public comments about the case  including to reporters 
Opioids were involved in 400 000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017  according to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
In the filing  the companies noted that plaintiffs had sought  8 billion  Defendants in the case include McKesson Corp  N MCK   AmerisourceBergen Corp  N ABC    Walgreen Co   NASDAQ WBA  and Walmart Inc  N WMT  
 Defendants do not bring this motion lightly  Taken as a whole and viewed objectively  the record clearly demonstrates that recusal is necessary   the companies said in a court filing on Saturday 
In particular  the companies said that on Jan  9  2018  in the first hearing  Polster said that the country was in the grips of an  opioid crisis   adding  150 Americans are going to die today  just today  while we re meeting  
  E veryone shares some of the responsibility  and no one has done enough to abate it   he said  including  the manufacturers  the distributors  the pharmacies  the doctors  the federal government and state government  local governments  and  hospitals 
 My objective is to do something meaningful to abate this crisis   he said at the hearing  according to the filing 
The request for recusal comes days after Judge Polster approved the substance of a proposal by lawyers representing cities and counties suing drug companies over the U S  opioid epidemic that would bring every state and municipality in the country into their settlement talks 
The proposal  part of litigation consolidating about 2 000 lawsuits against opioid manufacturers  retailers and others seeking damages for the epidemic  calls for creating a class of up to 3 000 counties and 30 000 cities  towns and villages that could vote on whether to accept any settlement the plaintiffs reach with the defendants

In Monday s brief  lawyers for the plaintiffs said the defendants had waived their ability to seek Polster s recusal  noting they were relying on statements he made more than a year ago to belatedly seek his disqualification 
 If these Defendants really thought recusal was necessary  they were required to raise the issue sooner   much sooner   the plaintiffs  lawyers wrote 
More than 2 500 lawsuits by state and local governments are pending nationally  accusing drug manufacturers of deceptively marketing opioids in ways that downplayed their risks  and drug distributors of failing to detect and halt suspicious orders 
The companies deny wrongdoing  Nearly 2 100 of the lawsuits are before Polster  while others are in state courts 
The companies had argued in Saturday s motion that Polster  who has long pushed for a settlement that could  do something meaningful to abate this crisis   had made a series of public statements since 2018 that could cause a reasonable person to question his impartiality 
They said those statements  made in court hearings and media interviews  raised the prospect that he had improperly prejudged their liability ahead of the first trial on Oct  21 involving two Ohio counties seeking  8 billion 
In Monday s brief  the plaintiffs  lawyers said the companies did not take action when Polster made those comments and actively participated in court overseen settlement talks without objection 
Polster  has at no time expressed improper or biased views about the liability of any defendant  much less views based on extra judicial sources   the lawyers wrote 
The companies who joined Saturday s motion also include CVS Health Corp  N CVS  and Walmart Inc  N WMT   The defendants did not respond to requests for comment

102785,324300,ABC,U S  judge overseeing opioid litigation won t disqualify himself,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    The U S  judge overseeing nationwide litigation over the opioid epidemic on Thursday refused to disqualify himself  after major pharmacies and drug distributors said he was biased against them and pressing too hard for a costly settlement 
Calling the opioid epidemic  one of the greatest tragedies of our time   U S  District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland admitted he had been  very active  in encouraging a settlement but said he was  confident that no reasonable person can legitimately question my impartiality  
He also said addressing the epidemic should be the job of the government s executive and legislative branches but  these are not ordinary times   and that not settling could overwhelm the courts and drive  most  of the defendants into bankruptcy 
 It is important for our citizens to know what I am doing and to have confidence that the judicial branch is up to the task   Polster wrote   The moving defendants complain that I have had a  personal mission  from the start of the case  That is true  but it does not suggest any bias or partiality  
Polster oversees more than 2 000 lawsuits by state and local municipalities over opioids  including a bellwether trial by Ohio s Cuyahoga and Summit counties scheduled for October 21 
The companies that sought Polster s disqualification included the retailers CVS Health Corp  N CVS    Rite Aid Corp   N RAD   Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  O WBA  and Walmart Inc  N WMT   and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp  N ABC    Cardinal Health  Inc  N CAH    Henry Schein  Inc  O HSIC  and McKesson Corp  N MCK  
Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Lawyers representing the counties had no immediate comment 
The request for Polster s disqualification followed a series of rulings by him in the counties  favor  including that they could try to show that various corporate defendants created a public nuisance 
Opioid addiction claimed roughly 400 000 lives in the United States form 1999 to 2017  according to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
The companies had argued that Polster tipped his hand beginning as early as January 2018 when the litigation that they would have to foot the bill for the epidemic 
They have also said the potential costs could be enormous  saying the plaintiffs in the Ohio case were seeking  8 billion in cash to cover fallout 
Polster  however  said the main point of his public comments was to show that the judiciary was  up to the task  of addressing the crisis  whether through fairly negotiated settlements or fairly fought litigation 
 The burden to sustain a motion to disqualify a judge is exceedingly high   he added   and the moving defendants have not met it

102803,324318,ABC,AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 58 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9  
Revenues are expected to be  45 33 billion  up 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AmerisourceBergen 
For AmerisourceBergen  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that AmerisourceBergen will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AmerisourceBergen would post earnings of  1 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 76  delivering a surprise of  7 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AmerisourceBergen appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amerisourcebergen-abc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200480897,200480897

102844,324359,ABC,Purdue Pharma in discussion on  10 billion  12 billion offer to settle opioid lawsuits  sources,news,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
 Reuters    OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its owners  the Sackler family  are in discussion to settle more than 2 000 opioid lawsuits against the company for  10 billion to  12 billion  two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday 
Purdue is among several drugmakers and distributors that have been sued for fueling an opioid addiction crisis in the United States  which claimed 400 000 lives from 1999 to 2017  according to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
The lawsuits have accused the Stamford  Connecticut based Purdue Pharma of aggressively marketing prescription opioids while misleading prescribers and consumers about risks from their prolonged use  Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations 
Purdue said it was actively working with state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to reach a resolution  without specifying a settlement amount 
There is currently no agreement and the settlement discussions could collapse  the sources said 
Representatives for Purdue and the Sackler family held discussions with cities  counties and states on the contours of the potential multibillion dollar settlement last week in Cleveland  said a person familiar with the matter 
During the meeting  Purdue outlined a plan to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a mechanism for implementing the settlement  which the company hopes will address the lawsuits  the person said 
The Sacklers would cede control of Purdue under the settlement terms discussed last week  the person said 
All the parties face a Friday deadline to update a federal judge on the status of the negotiations  the person said 
The company has said the U S  Food and Drug Administration approved labels for OxyContin that warned about risk and abuse associated with treating pain  The Sacklers have argued they were passive board members who approved routine management requests rather than micromanaging the marketing of OxyContin 
RESTRUCTURING
The settlement offer was first reported by NBC  Paul Hanly  a lead attorney for the plaintiffs  in an email  replied only  Made up  Ridiculous   when asked to confirm NBC s report  Asked to clarify after Reuters confirmed the report  he did not respond 
Representatives for the Sackler family declined to comment and a representative for the state attorneys general did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The plan under discussion envisions Purdue restructuring into a for profit  public benefit trust  that would last for at least a decade  one of the people familiar with the matter said 
Purdue would contribute between  7 billion and  8 billion to the trust  with some of the money coming from the sales of its drugs  including those that combat opioid overdoses  the person said  Additional payments would come from the company s cash and insurance policies  the person said  Three experts would be approved by a bankruptcy judge as trustees who would select board members to run the trust  this person said 
The Sackler family  which has amassed an estimated  13 billion fortune over the years  is also weighing a possible sale of another pharmaceutical firm it owns called Mundipharma  with some of the proceeds potentially going toward the settlement under discussion  the person said  The settlement terms contemplate the Sacklers initially contributing  3 billion 
David Sackler  one of a handful of family members who previously sat on Purdue s board  has taken on a significant role in the recent discussions  which included at least 10 state attorneys general  the person said 
Purdue is set on Oct  21  along with several other drug manufacturers and distributors  to face the first trial to result from federal court proceedings that have consolidated around 2 000 lawsuits brought largely by local governments accusing the companies of fueling the epidemic 
Other companies set to face trial include drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  Ltd and Johnson   Johnson and drug distributors McKesson Corp  NYSE MCK    Cardinal Health  Inc  NYSE CAH  and AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  Corp 
U S  District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland  Ohio  who oversees the lawsuits  has been pushing for settlements that could  do something meaningful to abate this crisis  
Purdue  the Sacklers and the communities involved face high stakes negotiations and Purdue has been preparing for filing for bankruptcy protection in case it cannot reach an agreement 
Going into Chapter 11 would give Purdue the exclusive right for several months to propose a reorganization plan  which if approved by a U S  bankruptcy judge could be forced on any local governments that decide to hold out 
Some state attorneys general have said they will resist any attempt by Purdue to use bankruptcy 
New York Attorney General Letitia James subpoenaed Wall Street banks  Purdue corporate entities and family offices in mid August for records related to the Sackler family s finances  according to court records 
In a letter to a judge and an earlier lawsuit  her office characterized payouts to the Sacklers from Purdue as fraudulent conveyances  a legal designation for clawing back money during bankruptcy proceedings 
 The opioid epidemic has ravaged American communities for over a decade  while a single family has made billions profiting from death and destruction   James said in a statement   We won t let up until we have delivered justice

102845,324360,ABC,U S  judge says opioid litigation can proceed toward trial,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    A U S  judge on Tuesday rejected efforts by drugmakers  distributors and pharmacies to dismiss claims that they caused the nation s opioid crisis  clearing the way for a scheduled landmark trial even as he pushes for a nationwide settlement 
U S  District Judge Dan Polster  who oversees roughly 2 000 opioid lawsuits by state and local governments  said the plaintiffs could try to prove that drugmakers  deceptive marketing of the painkillers caused a harmful  massive increase in supply that distributors and pharmacies did not do enough to stop 
 A factfinder could reasonably infer that these failures were a substantial factor in producing the alleged harm suffered by plaintiffs   the Cleveland based judge wrote 
The ruling was among seven decisions and orders totaling 80 pages issued by Polster ahead of a scheduled Oct  21 trial by two Ohio counties against Purdue Pharma  the OxyContin maker accused of fueling the epidemic  and several other defendants 
Polster also refused to dismiss civil conspiracy claims against the drugmakers  distributors and pharmacies  and said federal law did not preempt a variety of the plaintiffs  claims 
Opioid addiction claimed roughly 400 000 lives in the United States from 1999 to 2017  according to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Critics of the industry said opioid makers hid the addiction and abuse risks of prolonged use from consumers 
Defendants in the litigation also include the drugmaker Endo International Plc  pharmacy operators CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS   Rite Aid Corp  Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  Inc and Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  and major distributors AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  Corp   Cardinal Health  Inc  NYSE CAH  and McKesson Corp  NYSE MCK   among others 
Polster also rejected separate dismissal requests by the generic drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  Ltd and Allergan  NYSE AGN  Plc 
Lawyers for the respective defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment or declined to comment 
Paul Hanly  a lawyer for the counties  said the plaintiffs were pleased that Polster  almost uniformly  agreed with their positions on the dismissal motions and whether various testimony should be admitted

102895,324410,ABC,AG nominee Barr to back off previous attack on antifraud law  source,news,By Alison Frankel  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump s attorney general nominee William Barr is expected to back away from prior criticism of an anti fraud law that allows private individuals to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government  a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday  Barr will clarify his current thinking on the U S  False Claims Act  which he has previously called an unconstitutional  abomination   when he goes before the U S  Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing in coming months  the source said  Barr did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his law firm email account  The law allows whistleblowers who expose fraud against the U S  government to bring private lawsuits and keep a percentage of any damages awarded  In October  for example  the Justice Department agreed to a  93 million bounty for three whistleblowers after drug wholesaler AmerisouceBergen Corp  N ABC  paid  625 million to resolve their allegations of Medicaid fraud  Business groups  including the U S  Chamber of Commerce  have criticized the False Claims Act  FCA  as primarily benefiting plaintiffs  lawyers and their clients instead of taxpayers   But the Justice Department has raked in nearly  60 billion in FCA settlements and judgments since the law was overhauled in 1986  including nearly  3 billion last year   The law also still enjoys the strong support of Iowa Republican and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley  who was an architect of 1986 amendments that increased the FCA s potency  In 1991  during Barr s previous confirmation hearing to serve as attorney general under President George H W  Bush  Grassley explicitly asked Barr to pledge support to the FCA s whistleblower provisions  As a high ranking Justice Department official in the Bush administration  Barr had authored a 1989 memorandum that concluded the law s whistleblower provisions violated the separation of powers doctrine and other constitutional requirements  Barr later said in a 2001 interview for an oral history of the Bush presidency that he wanted the Justice Department to attack the constitutionality of the law but was opposed by then Solicitor General Kenneth Starr  The U S  Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2000 that private whistleblowers can sue on behalf of the U S  government  Barr has recently told others that his prior comments are outdated  according to the source  Barr believes DOJ s current handling of FCA cases protects federal interests and no longer thinks a constitutional challenge is warranted  the source said  Grassley is expected to cede chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee to Lindsey Graham  a Republican from South Carolina  before Barr s confirmation hearing  He hailed President Trump s nomination of Barr in a statement last month  Grassley s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment ,2019-01-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/ag-nominee-barr-to-back-off-previous-attack-on-antifraud-law-source-1735605,1735605
102896,324411,ABC,Top Picks 2019  Cardinal Health CAH,news,"Cardinal Health   NYSE CAH  is one of 3 large pharmaceutical distributors in the United States that together account for more than 90  of the pharmaceutical distribution market share  explains Ben Reynolds  income expert and editor of Sure Dividend 
What makes Cardinal Health stand apart from its competitors AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  and McKesson  MCK  is its extraordinary dividend history  Cardinal Health is a Dividend Aristocrat   an S P 500 stock with 25  years of rising dividends   thanks to its 32 consecutive years of dividend increases 
While Cardinal Health has a long history of growth as shown by its excellent dividend history  the company has struggled in recent years along with the entire pharmaceutical distribution industry  Cardinal Health generated earnings per share of  5 24 in fiscal 2016  versus  5 00 in fiscal 2018  The company expects earnings per share to barely grow in fiscal 2019 
Weakness in the pharmaceutical industry is a result largely of declining margins   Margins are declining due to several reasons 
  Pricing pressure from competitors
  Social and political pressure from distributor s role in the opioid epidemic
  Hints that Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  could enter the industry
All of these factors have weighed on margins and the stock prices of pharmaceutical distributors  But with pessimism comes low valuations   and opportunity 
Cardinal Health appears deeply undervalued  The company s stock price reached a high of over  90 back in 2015   It traded under  50 in December of 2018  while earnings per share are 14  higher in fiscal 2018 versus fiscal 2015   
Cardinal Health s management has taken advantage of low share prices by engaging in significant share repurchases  The company reduced its share count by 2 5  in fiscal 2018   And the rate of share repurchases has increased since 
We don t expect Cardinal Health to return to the double digit earnings per share growth rates that it has generated in the past  But we do expect earnings per share growth to stabilize after fiscal 2019 and return to growth of around 5  annually driven by a combination of share repurchases and organic growth 
This growth combined with the company s high dividend yield of around 4  gives investors expected total returns of approximately 9  annually at Cardinal Health before valuation multiple gains 
With Cardinal Health being deeply undervalued  we expect significantly higher returns for shareholders when the current negative environment for pharmaceutical distributors improves   In the meantime  investors will benefit from Cardinal Health s high dividend and share repurchases

102909,324424,ABC,ABC Vs  WST  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks are likely familiar with AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  and West Pharmaceutical Services  WST   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  both AmerisourceBergen and West Pharmaceutical Services are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
ABC currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 08  while WST has a forward P E of 48 22  We also note that ABC has a PEG ratio of 1 53  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  WST currently has a PEG ratio of 4 21 
Another notable valuation metric for ABC is its P B ratio of 5 76  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  WST has a P B of 7 55 
Based on these metrics and many more  ABC holds a Value grade of A  while WST has a Value grade of C 
Both ABC and WST are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that ABC is the superior value option right now ",2019-09-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abc-vs-wst-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200461976,200461976

Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough analysis  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds  and others while the independent ones

best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to rake in maximum returns from their portfolio Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Winning PointerSince the action of brokers is guided by sound logic  the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  For example  an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  a stock may fall out of analysts  favor due to adverse events like pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Trimming of earnings estimates by brokers often leads to stock price depreciation  Naturally  investors look to dump such stocks on the basis of broker advice One of the well accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions  For instance  in the face of extremely low oil prices  analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates   Naturally  adding such stocks to one s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy Making the Most of Broker OpinionsThe above write up clearly

102913,324428,ABC,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For AmerisourceBergen  ABC ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This prescription drug distributor has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7 81  
For the last reported quarter  AmerisourceBergen came out with earnings of  1 76 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 63 per share  representing a surprise of 7 98   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 96 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 11 per share  delivering a surprise of 7 65  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for AmerisourceBergen lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AmerisourceBergen has an Earnings ESP of  0 63  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 7  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-amerisourcebergen-abc-200471539,200471539

closing bell  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14 04   Further  it has an average four quarter positive surprise of 4 13  Which Way Are Estimates Treading Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is pegged at  1 06 billion  suggesting growth of 14 9  from the year ago reported number  The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at  2 96 per share  indicating an improvement of 4 6  from the year ago reported figure Instruments   Accessories  A Key CatalystThe Instruments   Accessories segment is anticipated to see a solid third quarter  Notably  the segment  contributing 52 6  to total revenues  performed impressively in the last reported quarter as well  registering 21 5  growth year over year  Anticipated increase in da Vince procedure volumes and customer buying patterns are likely to get reflected in the segment s revenues in the to be reported quarter Further  the flagship   da Vinci surgical system   continues to be a revenue driver for the segment  In fact  we anticipate the company s da Vinci SP surgical system to benefit the company s performance in the soon to be reported quarter Reflective of these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Instruments   Accessories  third quarter revenues is pegged at  574 million  suggesting growth of 18 1  from the year ago quarter s reported figure Intuitive Surgical  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Other Factors at PlayRevenues from other two segments   Systems and Services   are expected to have positively impacted the third

reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services stands at  179 million  indicating an improvement 11 9  from the year earlier quarter s reported figure  The same for Systems is pegged at  309 million  suggesting growth of 12 4  from the year ago quarter s reported number The company is likely to have witnessed growth in da Vinci procedures in the to be reported quarter on the back of probable procedure growth in the United States and outside of U S  markets  Moreover  general surgery in the United States and urology worldwide might contribute to the anticipated growth  In fact  Intuitive Surgical now forecasts 2019 procedure growth in the range of 16  to 17   compared with the previous 15  to 17  Moreover  the company s acquisition of Sch lly Fiberoptic s robotic endoscope business in July is likely to have improved da Vinci Surgical system through the addition of important aspects of da Vinci s visualization system  Notably  the buyout is anticipated to have strengthened Intuitive Surgical s supply chain and enhanced manufacturing capacity for imaging products  Thereby  the positive impacts of the acquisition are likely to reflect in the company s third quarter results However  cutthroat competition in the MedTech space continued to remain a headwind and might have weighed on its margins  which have been contracting over the last couple of quarters

102942,324457,ABC, AmerisourceBergen  Merck to Expand Blockchain Test Project for Tracking Drugs ,news,"US healthcare sector giants AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  and Merck  NYSE MRK    Co intend to expand a blockchain pilot that was concluded in 2017  the Wall Street Journal   During the test  the companies tracked the ownership of medicines along the supply chain route  The upcoming trial is expected to include more drugs and healthcare devices and carry out more elaborate transactions  according to AmerisourceBergen CIO Dale Danilewitz

Danilewitz said the test would focus on the verification process for drugs that a hospital or retailer returns to the company  If the history of the drugs is clean  they could be resold 

 We re making sure of the provenance of the product  guaranteeing it hasn t been tampered with all the way through the chain to the patient  Blockchain is such a natural fit for that kind of capability   he added 

Danilewitz revealed that Amerisource resells about 16 million product units each year  which is the equivalent of  3 billion in revenue  But if blockchain were to be implemented  that figure would go much higher  It is currently insignificant when measured against the company s total revenue  which was  153 1 billion last year 
Blockchain seems to be highly relevant given that the healthcare industry is facing new regulations  They will come into force in 2019 and aim to detect and remove fake  stolen  or contaminated drugs  Under the current Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013  companies have to adopt an electronic system to trace specific prescription medications from manufacturers to healthcare providers  distributors  retailers  and patients 
AmerisourceBergen s pilots are part of a broader initiative called MediLedger  on which we  last year  Due to regulatory pressures  the company teamed up with  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  and McKesson  NYSE MCK   among others  to explore the use of blockchain for tracking drugs

The blockchain and cryptocurrency conference is held at New York Hilton Midtown hotel from May 14 to May 16  The organizers had been expecting over 4 000 attendees this year  up from about 2 700 at the 2017 event  However  Moas reports that more than 8 000 people are attending  while Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert estimates the number at minimum 8 500 
Moas was apparently disappointed with the large number of participants  saying in a tweet it felt like New York s Grand Central Station during rush hour  A sports arena may have been a better location than a convention center  he concluded 


 It is a bit chaotic in here  I think they sold too many tickets   he  CNBC

 I ve never seen anything like this for registration  I ve been on line for an hour  

However  these inconveniences did not stop people from flocking to the event  With the average ticket price being  2 000  the organizers have generated at least  17 million from ticket sales 
CoinDesk  which was responsible for organizing the event  declined to comment on the revenue figures  However  the company s director of marketing Jacob Donnelly came up with an apology for the inconveniences 

 Whilst we apologize for any delays  Consensus 2018 has received overwhelming interest and is the largest blockchain focused event ever held in the United States  We are working to reduce the wait time

103058,324573,ABC,AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 8  
Revenues are expected to be  45 19 billion  up 4 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 1  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AmerisourceBergen 
For AmerisourceBergen  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 82  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that AmerisourceBergen will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AmerisourceBergen would post earnings of  1 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 11  delivering a surprise of  7 65  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AmerisourceBergen appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amerisourcebergen-abc-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200445011,200445011

103139,324654,ABC,Wal Mart  Walgreens  CVS turn up the heat on generic drugmaker deals,news,"By Deena Beasley  Reuters    The largest U S  retail pharmacies  including Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT  and Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  Inc  are wielding more leverage when buying generic drugs  accelerating a decline in prices likely to affect drug companies for some time  industry experts said on Thursday  That pressure is exacerbated by efforts from U S  health regulators to speed approval of copycat drugs  industry sources said  The extent of the shift became clearer this week  when wholesale drug distributors  Cardinal Health  Inc  NYSE CAH  and AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  Corp  as well as top global generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  Ltd  warned of generic price declines of as much as 9 percent through the end of the year   The news prompted a sell off in shares of generic manufacturers and distributors  On Thursday  Teva fell 24 percent  while rival Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV dropped 6 percent and AmerisourceBergen fell 10 percent  Drugmakers  Perrigo Co   NYSE PRGO  Plc and Endo International Plc fell 5 percent and 6 percent  respectively  Since Thursday  Cardinal Health has dropped 10 percent  Walgreens formed a drug buying partnership with AmerisourceBergen in 2013  and earlier this year partnered with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holdings Co  Retailer CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  has tied up with Cardinal Health and  more recently  Wal Mart has joined with McKesson Corp  NYSE MCK  to source generic drugs  Industry analysts said the alliances took some time to become effective  but their power over negotiations is becoming clear   There s no question those guys are getting much better pricing and really squeezing the manufacturers on margins   said Gabelli   Co portfolio manager Jeff Jonas   It s going to be a tough space for some time     they are just going to keep playing the manufacturers off against each other   Express Scripts  in an emailed statement  said its partnership with Walgreens  helps enhance our ability to further drive down the cost of generics     Scale matters and when you can negotiate on behalf of 83 million people   The alliances appear to benefit the retail pharmacies more than their partner wholesalers  whose revenue depends on a cut of the prices of the generic drugs they distribute   Those distributors operate on a maybe 2 percent profit margin  so when your revenue drops  your 2 percent margin becomes a smaller dollar amount   Jonas said   I think that maybe they underestimated how big of an impact that would be when they joined these groups   Teva said it is awaiting the result of bids for a supply contract with Wal Mart and McKesson  and that it now expects prices to fall by a rate in the high single digits through the remainder of the year  In May  Teva said its outlook for price erosion had worsened to 7 percent from 5 percent  AmerisourceBergen sees generic drug price erosion at the high end of the 7 percent to 9 percent range it had previously forecast    It is not at all clear whether the pricing environment will materially improve next year either   Jefferies analyst David Steinberg said in a note to clients  Generic drugmakers have also come under greater scrutiny from U S  consumers  lawmakers and regulators after a series of steep price hikes for drugs long on the market in recent years  The U S  Food and Drug Administration began in 2015 to clear a backlog of applications to bring additional competing generic drugs to market and lower prices  a mission endorsed by its new Commissioner Scott Gottlieb

Stocks in this week s article are Oracle Corp    NYSE ORCL    AngloGold Ashanti Ltd    NYSE AU    AmerisourceBergen Corp    NYSE ABC    Ford Motor Co    NYSE F   and CACI International Inc    NYSE CACI   5 Discounted PEG Stocks Suitable for Value InvestorsWhile searching for a suitable investment option  value investors with varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider price earnings to growth  PEG  ratio among a number of other popular metrics like price earnings  P E   price sales  P S  or price book value  P B  This is because they often find this ratio complicated  considering the limitations in calculating the future earnings growth potential of a stock  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B are most commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount However  these ratios  while not taking into account the future growth potential of a stock  may end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show  This may often lead to  value traps    a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once pulled down the share price  turn out to be persistent In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more  And here comes the importance of this not so popular but crucial value investing metric  the PEG ratio The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate  followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have

103183,324698,ABC,Walgreens deal offers no lasting relief to Rite Aid,news,"By Siddharth Cavale  Reuters    A slimmed down  Rite Aid Corp   N RAD  could lose much of its bargaining heft with insurers and makers of branded drugs at a time when it is trying to turn around its flagging pharmacy business  analysts said  Rite Aid said on Thursday it would sell nearly half its U S  stores to larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  O WBA  after the drugstore operators agreed to scrap a whole sale merger  Wall Street showed its displeasure at the new deal  pushing Rite Aid s shares down 30 percent to a near four year low after the announcement  The stock added to its losses  falling 7 percent on Friday  Rite Aid has been struggling with eroding profits in its pharmacy business  which sells prescription drugs  as increases in branded drug prices have slowed while reimbursement pressure for generics has intensified   I think Rite Aid is going to struggle to remain relevant in the pharmacy industry   said Adam Fein  president at Pembroke Consulting  which tracks the drug distribution industry   The pharmacy industry has become hyper competitive and it favors either large teams or nimble independents  and Rite Aid is buck in the middle and doesn t have geographic scale anywhere  except in the North East and the West Coast   But it s not all bad news for the company  Under the new deal  Rite Aid will gain access to Walgreen s centralized sourcing system  allowing it to procure generic drugs at low costs for 10 years and giving its pharmacy margins a much needed boost  Walgreens  the No  1 drugstore chain in the country  has a sourcing contract with AmerisourceBergen Corp  N ABC   the second largest U S  drug distributor  giving the alliance bargaining clout against drugmakers   We estimate more favorable generic procuring costs could provide 3 5 percent of saving on RAD s total generic spend   Cowen   Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a research note  LEANER AND MEANER  Still  being left with only half its stores will be punishing on economies of scale for Rite Aid  which is already struggling to turn a profit  said Neil Saunders  managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail  Rite Aid on Thursday posted a much bigger quarterly loss  mainly because of a drop in same store sales due to low reimbursement rates  This was the company s third loss in the past five quarters  EBITDA margins for the company fell to an average of 3 4 percent in fiscal 2017 ended March 31  from 4 8 percent in 2013  In contrast  Walgreens  EBITDA margins have averaged 7 3 percent on average for first three quarters of fiscal 2017  which ends in August  from 6 9 percent for the whole of 2013  Rite Aid  however  said the deal would make it a smaller but stronger company  helping it address pharmacy margin challenges and significantly cut its debt   over  7 billion at the end of fiscal 2017  Selling roughly half its stores will leave Rite Aid more reliant on its pharmacy benefit management business  which maintains formularies  or preferred drugs lists  negotiates rebates with drugmakers  and processes prescription drug claims   We think this will benefit RAD from a valuation perspective as we estimate that PBMs trade at a premium to drug retailers  by about a couple of turns in our view   Cowen   Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a research note  
The smaller company could also be an attractive buyout target for a private equity firm or a rival such as Fred s Inc  O FRED   which was to buy some assets that would have been divested under the previously planned Walgreens Rite Aid merger  analysts said ",2017-06-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/walgreens-deal-offers-no-lasting-relief-to-rite-aid-501048,501048

103188,324703,ABC,ABC Or ALGN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks are likely familiar with AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  and Align Technology  ALGN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  AmerisourceBergen has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that ABC s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ABC currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 88  while ALGN has a forward P E of 50 13  We also note that ABC has a PEG ratio of 1 70  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 14 
Another notable valuation metric for ABC is its P B ratio of 6 10  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ALGN has a P B of 17 55 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ABC s Value grade of A and ALGN s Value grade of D 
ABC sticks out from ALGN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that ABC is the better option right now ",2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abc-or-algn-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200438498,200438498

103191,324706,ABC,Can AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry 
This prescription drug distributor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 16  
For the last reported quarter  AmerisourceBergen came out with earnings of  2 11 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 96 per share  representing a surprise of 7 65   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 50 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 60 per share  delivering a surprise of 6 67  
Price and EPS Surprise

For AmerisourceBergen  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AmerisourceBergen currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 92   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on August 1  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-amerisourcebergen-abc-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200439832,200439832

103224,324739,ABC,AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for AmerisourceBergen is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for AmerisourceBergen imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AmerisourceBergen
For the fiscal year ending September 2019  this prescription drug distributor is expected to earn  6 81 per share  which is a change of 4 9  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AmerisourceBergen  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

103225,324740,ABC,AmerisourceBergen High Quality Dividend With Compelling Valuation ,opinion,"Introduction
This is the first in a continuing series where I identify and present dividend growth stocks for an above average long term total return objective  Throughout this series  I will be illustrating that there are several prudent sources of long term return and there is also luck or chance  Personally  I suggest that investors strive to build their portfolios based on prudent fundamental realities and not simply invest with the hope that your stocks will rise 
The primary prudent sources of total return that I am alluding to are first and foremost sound fundamental valuation   although attractive undervaluation is even more desirable  The second primary source would be growth defined as the potential long term rate of change of earnings and or cash flow growth and dividend growth  When you invest at sound valuation  you position yourself to participate in the growth that the business generates on your behalf 
If you can identify attractive undervaluation  you can expect a secondary source and a potential kicker to total return that I like to call natural leverage  Simply stated  in addition to the operating growth and dividend growth that the company achieves  you are also positioned to get P E ratio expansion  To clarify  you initially invest in a smaller level of earnings at a lower P E ratio where the company over time delivers a higher level of future earnings that the market capitalizes at a higher P E ratio  I metaphorically refer to this as a double double  In the future  you get double the earnings that are valued at double the P E ratio  Of course  the math does not always work out so perfectly  but I hope you get the point 
Furthermore  I will be presenting stocks that I believe offer the potential for significantly above average total return  Stated more clearly  I will be looking for dividend growth stocks that I believe can provide double digit total returns including a growing dividend income stream  But perhaps most importantly  because of the focus on attractive valuation  I believe these future returns can be generated at greatly mitigated  lower  levels of long term risk 
Moreover  it s important to distinguish between long term results versus short term results  Intelligent value investors understand that investing in unpopular securities is where value is most often found  This is especially true when you are in a bull market like we have been in for the last several years 
Consequently  there are typically reasons why a stock s valuation is low  The trick is in determining whether those reasons are valid  permanent or temporary  Nevertheless  the intelligent value investor understands that unpopular stocks can remain unpopular for some time  and therefore provide below average short term results  On the other hand  unpopular stocks that are erroneously valued can provide exceptional long term returns based on the sources of long term return described above 
AmerisourceBergen ABC   Prudent Investment Interesting Speculation
AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  could well be the epitome of a near perfect dividend growth stock  It has a long history of consistent above average earnings growth  and it has increased its dividend for 14 consecutive years at an average rate exceeding 30  per annum  Therefore  even though its current dividend yield is slightly below the market average  its growth yield  yield on cost  potential is significantly above average 
Additionally  the company has a solid investment grade A  credit rating and modest debt to capital of 57   Although the company is not expected to grow at its historical double digit rates  it is expected to continue growing at the above average rate of 7 to 9   Nevertheless  trading at a blended P E ratio below 12 makes this medical distributor a compelling long term investment based on significant undervaluation alone  Consequently  AmerisourceBergen looks like an attractive dividend growth stock especially for those seeking an above average long term total return 
On the other hand  in addition to the company s apparent long term attractiveness  it also appears to be a compelling short term speculation  Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  already owns a 27  stake in this premier drug wholesaler and medical distributor  Moreover  according to Raymond James analyst John Ransom  it might also be a potential acquisition target  This seems plausible considering that competitor CVS has recently merged  acquired  with Aetna  NYSE AET  and the fact that Walgreens Boots Alliance has not engaged in any significant deals recently  Therefore  Walgreens Boots Alliance may have some incentive or need to catch up 
AmerisourceBergen Corp  Compelling Valuation
The following long term earnings and price correlated FAST Graph on AmerisourceBergen clearly illustrates that the company has not been available at such a compelling valuation since the throes of the Great Recession  This is somewhat understandable considering that healthcare  in general  is a current political football  However  I believe that investors should also consider that the current political risk is also already priced in  In other words  the current low valuations on healthcare stocks  in general  appear too attractive to ignore despite the political risks 

As I have stated many times in the past  I never consider investing in a stock before calculating a specific rate of return expectation  I call this running the numbers out to their logical conclusion  In the case of AmerisourceBergen  if the company did grow earnings at the consensus rate of 7 9  and its P E ratio expanded from the current 12 to a more rational P E ratio of 15  its total annualized rate of return out to fiscal year end 2021 would be slightly over 20   In other words  the current political risk is already baked into the valuation  price  

As the Wall Street Journal suggested in an article by Charley Grant on May 20 titled   Everyone Hates Health Care stocks  Buy Them Anyway   The article s byline stated   relatively attractive valuation and defensive properties could make this sector shine   I consider this sound advice especially when you understand that these healthcare stocks do not really need to grow very much to generate strong future returns  The point is that even a no growth business is worth a reasonable multiple of earnings and cash flows  typically in the neighborhood of 14 to 16 times earnings  Consequently  today s low valuations have already priced in the risk and suggest that high quality healthcare stocks are attractive 
To illustrate how an undervalued stock doesn t have to grow in order to be a good investment  I present the following  Custom  forecasting calculator where I have overridden the consensus estimates  The following Custom forecast calculator illustrates the return potential on AmerisourceBergen assuming the company only grows at 1   significantly below consensus  and trades at a rational 15 P E ratio  Even under that draconian scenario  AmerisourceBergen could still potentially generate double digit returns over the next couple of years  As I often say  valuation matters  and it matters a lot  But perhaps more importantly  low valuation can mitigate a great deal of risk 

How Reliable are Consensus Estimates on AmerisourceBergen 
As I often state  as investors we can only invest in the future and not the past  However  it also logically follows that it is implicit upon us to base our decisions on a prudent and reliable forecast of what the future might bring  Consequently  I believe it makes sense to start by reviewing the consensus estimates of the leading analysts following the company  However  it is also important to realize that consensus analyst estimates are quite often derived and aligned with company guidance  The following slide from AmerisourceBergen s recent earnings report provides their fiscal 2019  ending in September  guidance for adjusted diluted earnings of  6 70 to  6 90  The reader should note that this guidance is consistent with the consensus estimates of 18 analysts presented in the forecasting calculator above 

Furthermore  the following Analyst Scorecard illustrates that leading analysts have an excellent track record of forecasting AmerisourceBergen s earnings in advance  As seen in the following screenshots  analysts have been extremely accurate with their forecasts when they have been made exactly one year or two years in advance of the actual financial reports  Consequently  this provides me some confidence that consensus estimates are a reliable starting point towards providing a reasonable future earnings expectation on this blue chip dividend growth stock  Therefore  I am enthusiastically motivated to continue conducting a comprehensive research and due diligence process on AmerisourceBergen because I believe the potential is worth my while 


Amerisourcebergen  Thesis for Growth And Success
According to MorningStar   Business Strategy and Outlook by Soo Romanoff  Updated Apr 08  2019 
AmerisourceBergen has developed a pharmaceutical platform addressing the comprehensive sourcing and distribution needs of manufacturers and providers  With 20 000 employees and an electronic inventory platform  the company is equipped to ship more than 3 million products a day worldwide  The global scale and sheer pharmaceutical volumes enable the company to negotiate competitive prices  and it can efficiently provide access to a vast portfolio of drugs  The core business  roughly 96  of revenue  is focused on pharmaceutical distribution  and the balance of revenue is attributable to acquired businesses  AmerisourceBergen handles roughly a third of the drugs sold in the United States and has created an extensive footprint into physician administered products  with key anchor customers within communities  Further  the company operates efficiently in a highly regulated environment  which provides some insulation  
Furthermore  I believe that regardless of whatever happens to healthcare delivery politically in the future  that AmerisourceBergen will still be positioned as a viable long term business 
AmerisourceBergen s confidence in their future growth was presented in their most recent earnings report as follows

In the following analyze out loud video I m going to run AmerisourceBergen by the numbers looking at numerous cash flow and earnings metrics  In addition to looking at valuation  I will also be looking at dividend coverage and safety  There is more than one way to skin a cat  and certainly more than one way to value a business  However  no matter how you evaluate AmerisourceBergen  I believe the conclusion is the same  This is an extremely high quality dividend growth stock that is currently available at a very attractive valuation 


Summary and Conclusions 
I believe that AmerisourceBergen is an extremely high quality dividend growth stock that is currently an attractive total return investment based on low valuation and above average potential growth of earnings and dividends  Consequently  I also believe that the political risk associated with medical companies in general and AmerisourceBergen specifically is already priced in 
Furthermore  the possibility that Walgreens Boots Alliance may make a play for the remaining shares in the company they do not already own  provides an interesting and reasonable short term speculation  AmerisourceBergen is certainly cheap enough at current levels for Walgreens to make an offer above current valuation and still purchase the shares at a sensible valuation  However  I don t believe the acquisition needs to occur in order to make AmerisourceBergen an attractive long term dividend growth investment 
Finally  and as always  I suggest that investors conduct their own comprehensive research and due diligence  Caveat emptor

This is a follow up to my first article in a continuing series where I will be identifying and presenting dividend growth stocks for an above average long term total return objective  My first article in this series covered AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC   a leading medical distributor that I presented as significantly undervalued  However  I offer this follow up to illustrate that the entire sector and subsector is currently out of favor and undervalued  Consequently  this represents a case that is more sector related than company specific 
Most importantly  the primary issues causing concern throughout this sector are politically related  There are also concerns about lawsuits related to the opium epidemic  However  these issues are based on fears about things that might happen but have not yet happened  Consequently  the future fundamentals for each of these companies are currently expected to remain positive going forward  As a result  and based on those fundamental future expectations  the stocks would be considered extremely cheap offering above average upside  Therefore  as long as earnings do in fact continue to manifest  that would be a true statement 
On the other hand  if the future does bring significant health care reform to include limits and restrictions on pharmaceutical prices  the future earnings and cash flows of these companies could change negatively  Therefore  prospective investors should be aware of these risks but at the same time recognize that these risks may already be priced in  Nevertheless  it s up to each individual investor to decide for themselves whether they are willing to take that risk or not 
Sources of Long Term Return
Throughout this series  I will be illustrating that there are several prudent sources of long term return and there is also luck or chance  Personally  I suggest that investors strive to build their portfolios based on prudent fundamental realities and not simply invest with the hope that your stocks will rise 
The primary prudent sources of total return that I am alluding to are  first and foremost  sound fundamental valuation   although attractive undervaluation is even more desirable  The second primary source would be growth defined as the potential long term rate of change of earnings and or cash flow growth and dividend growth  When you invest at sound valuation  you position yourself to participate in the growth that the business generates on your behalf

Summary and Conclusions
My primary purpose for presenting this follow up article to my AmerisourceBergen article is to illustrate that the undervaluation found in these subsectors are industry related  In other words  the concerns relate to issues affecting the entire sector and not specifically related to each of the individual research candidates 
However  and I consider this critically important  the rate of return forecasts presented on the screenshots and in the video are rational and highly likely as long as the earnings  the orange line on the graphs  manifest within reason according to the estimates  The orange line on each of the graphs represents a fair value 15 P E ratio  Clearly  the long term evidence supports the reality that whenever the price deviates from that valuation it inevitably reverts to the mean  and typically very quickly  Consequently  these research candidates do provide extremely attractive long term rates of return for the prudent value investor  However  continuous monitoring of the political and legal climate threatening these companies is imperative  Caveat emptor

Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  both AmerisourceBergen and Align Technology are sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
ABC currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 38  while ALGN has a forward P E of 56 22  We also note that ABC has a PEG ratio of 1 64  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 40 
Another notable valuation metric for ABC is its P B ratio of 5 86  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ALGN has a P B of 19 68 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ABC s Value grade of A and ALGN s Value grade of D 
Both ABC and ALGN are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that ABC is the superior value option right now ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abc-vs-algn-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200430987,200430987
103230,324745,ABC,6 Discounted PEG Stocks That Value Investors Love,opinion,Going by the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha s success story  value investment is one of the most tempting strategies to bet on even amid uncertain market conditions  Per data provided by a Forbes article  shares of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   owned by Warren Buffett  increased 20  in 2016  boosting the Oracle of Omaha s personal fortune by  12 3 billion  more than any other billionaire in the U S   to  74 2 billion While searching for a suitable value investment option  investors are unlikely to consider price earnings to growth  PEG  ratio among a number of other popular value metrics like price earnings  P E   price sales  P S  or price book value  P B   This is because they often find this ratio complicated  considering the limitations in calculating the future earnings growth potential of a stock However  at a time when volatility strikes every second day  it is pointless to ponder on methods  which do not consider a stock s future growth rate while calculating its intrinsic merit  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B are most commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount However  these ratios  while not taking into account the future growth potential of a stock  may end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show  This may often lead to  value traps    a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once drove the share price down  turn out to be persistent In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more  And here comes the importance of this not so popular but crucial value investing metric  the PEG ratio The PEG ratio is defined as  Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  for

When looking at the last two reports  this prescription drug distributor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 3 68   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  AmerisourceBergen came out with earnings of  1 60 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 50 per share  representing a surprise of 6 67   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 44 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 45 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 69  
Price and EPS Surprise

For AmerisourceBergen  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AmerisourceBergen has an Earnings ESP of  1 16  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on May 2  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-amerisourcebergen-abc-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200405594,200405594

103259,324774,ABC,AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 97 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 6  
Revenues are expected to be  43 68 billion  up 6 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AmerisourceBergen 
For AmerisourceBergen  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AmerisourceBergen will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AmerisourceBergen would post earnings of  1 50 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 60  delivering a surprise of  6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AmerisourceBergen doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amerisourcebergen-abc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200411051,200411051

One company to watch right now is AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC   ABC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A  The stock holds a P E ratio of 10 91  while its industry has an average P E of 16 38  Over the past 52 weeks  ABC s Forward P E has been as high as 14 32 and as low as 10 10  with a median of 12 08 
Investors should also note that ABC holds a PEG ratio of 1 44  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  ABC s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 1 73  Over the past 52 weeks  ABC s PEG has been as high as 1 55 and as low as 1 10  with a median of 1 27 
Finally  we should also recognize that ABC has a P CF ratio of 10 73  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  This company s current P CF looks solid when compared to its industry s average P CF of 15 16  Over the past year  ABC s P CF has been as high as 15 48 and as low as 6 91  with a median of 10 29 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that AmerisourceBergen is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  ABC sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2019-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-amerisourcebergen-abc-a-great-value-stock-right-now-200419509,200419509
103265,324780,ABC,ABC Vs  WST  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks are likely familiar with AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  and West Pharmaceutical Services  WST   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  AmerisourceBergen is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while West Pharmaceutical Services has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ABC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than WST has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
ABC currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 56  while WST has a forward P E of 41 99  We also note that ABC has a PEG ratio of 1 53  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  WST currently has a PEG ratio of 3 67 
Another notable valuation metric for ABC is its P B ratio of 5 47  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  WST has a P B of 6 39 
These metrics  and several others  help ABC earn a Value grade of A  while WST has been given a Value grade of D 
ABC has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than WST  so it seems like value investors will conclude that ABC is the superior option right now ",2019-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abc-vs-wst-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200419475,200419475
103289,324804,ABC,Earnings Preview  AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 2  
Revenues are expected to be  43 52 billion  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 69  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AmerisourceBergen 
For AmerisourceBergen  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AmerisourceBergen will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AmerisourceBergen would post earnings of  1 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 45  delivering a surprise of  0 69  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AmerisourceBergen doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-amerisourcebergen-abc-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200378961,200378961

AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and Consensus
   So  here we take a quick look at the major factors that have been plaguing AmerisourceBergen  and also the brighter prospects that indicates of a near term recovery 
Factors Plaguing AmerisourceBergen
AmerisourceBergen has recently received a grand jury subpoena from the U S  Attorney s Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about the testing of a certain type of syringe made at its PharMEDium lab in Memphis  Memphis is the company s largest highly automated production facility 
Consequently  AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all products from there that had yet to expire  Recently  the FDA also visited this facility for the same reason  Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company s specialty distribution segment over the long haul 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018  the segment s results were negatively impacted by PharMEDium  with the company witnessing lower than expected revenues and profit contribution  Per management  contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in fiscal 2018 will be lower than anticipated due to the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures  
Why Should You Hold 
Despite adversities in PharMEDium  AmerisourceBergen s World Courier unit is likely to be the key driver of revenues  The unit is a global leader in specialty logistics that designs and executes world class logistics processes 
Per management  World Courier s position as the leader in global specialty logistics services propelled volume growth and overall performance for the company in the last couple of quarters as well 
Recently  the company announced the designation of its flagship World Courier unit as the first logistics company to obtain global Good Distribution Practices  GDP  certification against three major standards 
The business posted impressive results in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  At the end of the quarter  World Courier s company owned offices were spread across more than 50 countries  with 14 investigational drug depots located in emerging markets worldwide  Solid volume growth and expanding operating margins have favored World Courier unit in the quarter 
Price Performance
AmerisourceBergen outperformed its  in a month s time  The company s shares have gained 10 3  compared with the industry s rise of 5 1   The current level is also higher than the S P 500 index s return of 1 7

103358,324873,ABC,What s In Store For AmerisourceBergen  ABC  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation s   NYSE ABC   second quarter fiscal 2018 results  scheduled for release on May 2  are expected to show steady growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment  a significant contributor to revenues In the last reported quarter  the company posted adjusted earnings of  1 55 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 35 and improving 14  year over year  The upside was attributed to strong growth in the company s Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment and World Courier business  Revenues improved almost 6  to  40 47 billion in the previous quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  40 37 billion For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  40 49 billion  reflecting a rise of 9  year over year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  1 83  indicating an increase of 3 4  year over year Let s dig deeper to analyze how things are shaping up before the earnings announcements Pharmaceutical Distribution to Boost Q2 ResultsPharmaceutical Distribution accounted for 96 2  of total revenues in the last quarter  Revenues in the segment were  38 94 billion  up 5 8  on a year over year basis  Operating income was  388 2 million  up 2 4  year over year For the upcoming quarterly results  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pharmaceutical Distribution segment is pegged at  38 88 billion  The figure reflects an increase of 9 5  from the year ago figure Strong organic growth rates in the U S  pharmaceutical market  improving patient access to medical care  improved economic conditions and population demographics  introduction of new innovative drugs like hepatitis C drugs along with a consistent good brand pricing environment should drive growth for AmerisourceBergen in the quarter to be reported AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and EPS Surprise 
   Moreover  the company s focus on specialty drugs bodes well  Per the IMS  pharmaceutical sales are estimated to grow approximately 7 1  annually over a five year period through 2020  courtesy of strong demand  favorable pricing and new product introductions The deals signed by AmerisourceBergen look encouraging  which are likely to boost the top line  The company entered into a strategic agreement with Walgreen Boots Alliance  The deal includes a 10 year pharmaceutical distribution contract  under which the company will distribute branded and generic pharmaceutical products to Walgreens However  the segment is likely to be affected by lower than expected production at PharMEDium s Memphis 503B outsourcing facility  Notably  operations in the facility were voluntarily suspended by the company in the last quarter following a few inspections by the FDA Other Factors to ConsiderGenerics   Product Launches to Drive Growth  We believe that AmerisourceBergen will benefit from generics growth in the long run  In the last quarter  AmerisourceBergen marked its 16th consecutive quarter with 10  or greater revenue growth in the business  Management confirmed that its strategic and focused effort is driving generic product volume growth to offset historic deflation rates However  it s important to highlight that AmerisourceBergen will have about a 25  increase in quarterly interest expense beginning from the second quarter Operational Efficiencies  The recent U S  tax legislation has enhanced AmerisourceBergen s ability to invest in business  innovate and deliver value to its shareholders  Over the long term  this enables AmerisourceBergen to boost its U S  business Recently  the company made strategic investments in IT systems to realize greater operational efficiency and increase operating leverage  This is likely to boost the company s results in the second quarter In fact  AmerisourceBergen also announced its plans to roll out eight new IT systems and a new e commerce platform at MWI  These should enhance the company s results in the quarter to be reported Guidance  Based upon the expectations from the recently legislated U S  tax reform  AmerisourceBergen raised guidance for fiscal 2018  Notably  AmerisourceBergen s strong guidance for fiscal 2018 indicates that the company expects to deliver solid results from the second quarter itself The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  6 45  6 65  up from the previously range of  5 90  6 15  Revenue growth for fiscal 2018 is expected in the range of 8 11   up from the previous band of 7 9  PharMEDium Slows Down  Recently  AmerisourceBergen received a grand jury subpoena from the U S  Attorney s Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about its lab testing of a certain type of syringe made at its PharMEDium lab in Memphis  which is the company s largest highly automated production facility  As a result of the subpoena  AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all of the products that had yet to expire  In fact  the FDA also visited this facility for the same reason  Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company s specialty distribution segment in the quarter to be reported In the last reported quarter  the segment s results were negatively impacted by PharMEDium  wherein the company had lower than expected revenues and profit contribution Per management  because of the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures  PharMEDium s contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in the second quarter will be lower than anticipated Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for AmerisourceBergen in the second quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  AmerisourceBergen has an Earnings

103395,324910,ABC,5 Best PEG Stocks Value Investors Love,opinion,With externalities impacting stock markets every second day  investors with varied risk appetite prefer to go for value investing  In the event of a market crash   investors often end up to selling their holdings in a panic  But Warren Buffett advises investors to grab the opportunity and buy bargain stocks at cheap prices  However  this apparently simple to  understand investing discipline has historically shown dangerous outcomes owing to people s oversight of the basics Warren Buffett believes that proper understanding of the  intrinsic value  of a stock will make the task easier  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  the ratio of price to earnings or to book value are the most common forms of intrinsic value calculation  which can easily single out the stocks that the market is currently undervaluing  However  these ratios fail to consider the future potential of a stock  And here comes the importance of a not so popular value investing metric  the PEG ratio  This ratio with earnings growth component in it may help to determine the prospects of a stock The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median P E

103491,325006,ABC,Generic Drug Stocks Take A Hit  Here s Why,opinion,"It s been a tough week for generic drugmakers which saw their shares tumbling following the release of disappointing second quarter results from Israel based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited   NYSE TEVA    Teva not only missed on earnings and revenue expectations  the company also slashed its 2017 outlook and announced a 75  cut in its dividend Teva s shares plunged 34 1  in the two trading sessions following the release of second quarter results reflecting concerns about the company s business and debt burden which triggered a few analyst downgrades  Year to date  YTD   Teva has lost 43 2  of its value versus the 12  decline of its 

Challenging Generic Pricing EnvironmentA key reason for Teva s dismal performance was generic pricing erosion  The sharp decline in generic drug prices  while a blessing for patients  is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors On its second quarter conference call  Teva said that the ongoing consolidation of customers has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume  The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs  Moreover  the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition  increasing price cuts and decreasing volume  Generic drugs are basically cheaper versions of branded drugs which have gone off patent Teva said that price erosion was around 6  in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high single digits over the remainder of the year And it s not just Teva that was affected by the tough generic pricing environment in the U S  AmerisourceBergen Corporation   NYSE ABC    which reported a mixed quarter  saw its shares decline 11 4  over the two trading sessions following the release of third quarter fiscal 2017 results  The company mentioned that generic deflation remains a headwind and is yet to ease from the high single digits  where it s been for about three quarters  Generic deflation is expected to remain a headwind for the remainder of fiscal 2017 in the range of  7  to  9   The situation may continue in fiscal 2018 as well Cardinal Health  Inc    NYSE CAH   too mentioned that generic drugs pricing was a material headwind for the company s Pharma Distribution business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  The company expects generic deflation in mid single digits in fiscal 2018 Stocks in FocusFollowing the release of Teva s second quarter results  companies with a presence in the generics market saw their shares declining on concerns that these companies too will be affected by the generic drug pricing environment  Companies like Mylan NV   NASDAQ MYL    down 10 8    Lannett Company  Inc    NYSE LCI    10 9  down   Perrigo Company plc   NYSE PRGO    down 6 5   and Impax Laboratories  Inc    NASDAQ IPXL    down 10 7   were down over the last two trading sessions  This week  investors will be focused on Mylan s second quarter results including the company s take on the generic pricing situation  Impax and Perrigo will also be reporting results this week  While Mylan  Perrigo and Impax are all Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  Lannett is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  You can see   Medical   Generic Drugs Industry 5YR   ReturnIn our view  generic price erosion will remain a headwind for the remainder of the year and affect the margins of generic players  With the FDA focusing on speeding up the generic drug approval process  the market will continue to witness additional competition and escalating generic price erosion

103492,325007,ABC,Is AmerisourceBergen  ABC  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AmerisourceBergen Corporation   NYSE ABC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AmerisourceBergen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts AmerisourceBergen s current PE ratio considerably below its midpoint  which is 18 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AmerisourceBergen has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AmerisourceBergen s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AmerisourceBergen has a P S ratio of about 0 1  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AmerisourceBergen currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ABC a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for AmerisourceBergen is just 1 5  a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 2 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 9  which is considerably better than the industry average of 12 8  Clearly  ABC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though AmerisourceBergen might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D  This gives ABC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 2 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AmerisourceBergen Corporation  Holding Co  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerisourceBergen is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 32  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably

Let s take a closer look at why the market was so disappointed with Cardinal Health s business update and if the stock could be an attractive investment opportunity for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio 
How does Cardinal Health make money 
Founded in 1971  Cardinal Health is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world  The business primarily makes money by distributing a wide range of pharmaceutical products and medical supplies  2 8 billion healthcare products are manufactured or sourced by Cardinal Health each year  
Over 70  of U S  hospitals use Cardinal Health s resources  and the company serves more than 25 000 pharmacies 
Cardinal Health splits its business into two segments  The Pharmaceutical segment accounts for 90  of sales and 85  of profits  This unit distributes a wide range of branded and generic drugs  specialty pharmaceuticals  and over the counter products 
The company s Medical segment accounts for 10  of sales and 15  of profit  It distributes medical  surgical  and laboratory products to hospitals and other healthcare providers 
Cardinal Health is essentially a middleman in the healthcare sector  making purchases from drug manufacturers and selling its acquired inventory for a small profit to pharmacies and hospitals 
The company s operating margin typically sits between 1  and 2   reflecting the small sliver of profit Cardinal Health makes on each sale  The firm therefore depends on generating a high volume of sales to turn a meaningful profit 
The most attractive distributors are able to offer a wide range of products with competitive prices and dependable delivery standards 
They tend to benefit from having substantial distribution networks  long standing customer contracts  and economies of scale 
Why did Cardinal Health s stock drop 
Cardinal Health announced that its fiscal 2017 non GAAP earnings per share will be at the bottom of its previous guidance range 
The largest factor dragging down results is generic drug price deflation  which management now expects to be in the low double digits for the full fiscal year 
Investors were perhaps even more concerned with the company s guidance for fiscal 2018  which calls for non GAAP earnings to be flat to down mid single digits compared to 2017 
Cardinal Health s fiscal 2018 earnings guidance essentially missed analysts  expectations by around 10  and was nowhere close to management s long term goal of 10 15  annual non GAAP earnings per share growth 
In addition to slashing its guidance due to greater than expected generic drug price deflation  Cardinal Health announced it is acquiring Medtronic s Patient Care  Deep Vein Thrombosis  and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses for  6 1 billion 
Here s a look at some of the key medical products Cardinal Health is acquiring 

Management hopes this business will provide economies of scale in medical products manufacturing and sourcing  helping profitability  while increasing the company s product breadth 
Is Cardinal Health s stock price decline news or noise 
If the drop in Cardinal Health s stock price was driven by short term factors that have no bearing on the company s long term earnings outlook  and the stock s valuation now looks reasonable   this week s events could be a buying opportunity for long term dividend investors 
However  I think the issues weighing on Cardinal Health could structurally impact the company s future profitability and growth opportunities 
Let s start with the main issue   declining profitability in Cardinal Health s Pharmaceutical segment  which generates 85  of profits 
Cardinal Health benefited from the boom in generic drugs over the past five years  Tens of billions of dollars worth of brand name drugs lost patent protection in 2012  for example  resulting in a boom in generic competition over the following years 
Generic drugs carry higher margins for Cardinal Health compared to branded drugs  As generic drug pricing increased  the company enjoyed a boost to its gross profits 
However  the tide is now going back out  Most of the entire pharmaceutical value chain is under pressure to cut costs and make healthcare more affordable 
Many pharma businesses are moderating price increases on their drugs in response to increased political pressure  Generic drug prices have also been hit by because of faster approvals by the Food and Drug Administration  resulting in more generic drug supply  and a price fixing investigation  according to The Wall Street Journal 
The Wall Street Journal went on to note that  drug distributors had feasted for years on stable or rising drug prices  which allow them to more easily mark up prices while profiting by arbitraging annual price increases  Now  the more rapidly prices fall  the more difficult it becomes for distributors like Cardinal to resell drugs from manufacturers to pharmacies at a profit  
Equally important  pharmacies have meaningfully consolidated in recent years as they faced increased margin pressure from lower reimbursement rates 
As a result  they have been able to exert more pressure on the prices they pay Cardinal Health for the drugs it resells to them  In fact  Cardinal Health s CEO noted on the company s earnings call that pricing pressures are on the  sell side downstream to the customers  It s still a little bit more than what we modeled  
I think the economics of the drug distribution business are structurally changing  A company like Cardinal Health will always play a role  but the middlemen seem increasingly likely to bear the brunt of healthcare reform and sell side consolidation 
DrugChannels net provided an excellent review of the margin pressures that wholesale distributors face 
Assuming sell side price pressure remains high  there is increased risk that competition will only increase between the three companies that control almost all of the drug distribution business  McKesson  NYSE MCK  and AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  are the other two  
Since distribution is largely a scale game  these rivals might battle even harder with each other for market share  and the stakes are high 
For example  CVS Health  NYSE CVS  accounted for 25  of Cardinal Health s sales last year  and two group purchasing organizations  GPOs  combined for another 17  of revenue  Losing major customers or having to further concede on pricing to retain them could really impact the company s bottom line  especially if Cardinal Health is unable to negotiate better terms with its drug manufacturers 
Management s decision to take on substantial debt to acquire some of Medtronic s medical products is another signal that Cardinal Health s core pharma distribution business might not have the favorable long term outlook that the company once thought  thus there was increased pressure to diversify  
I am not a medical products expert  but this seems to be a price sensitive business that can be challenging to compete in  I m not sure that Cardinal Health will have much of a durable competitive advantage here either 
Closing Thoughts on Cardinal Health
The healthcare sector is undergoing a number of structural changes  many of which seem likely to continue causing disruption for drug distributors such as Cardinal Health 
The issues that caused the drop in Cardinal Health s stock price seem more like news than noise to me  and the increasing complexities of the drug distribution chain only further serve to keep me out of the stock 
I would rather own businesses with greater pricing power and more controllable competitive advantages  Drug distributors seem to be largely commodity type businesses  and their margins could be further squeezed as both drug buyers and manufacturers look to preserve their margins in an increasingly cost conscious healthcare world 
I expect Cardinal Health to retain its favorable Dividend Safety Score  indicating that its payout remains very secure  but I have my doubts about the company s long term growth profile 
While the stock s forward P E multiple of about 14 looks tempting  I think Cardinal Health is cheap for a reason ",2017-04-23,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-aristocrat-cardinal-health-(cah)-drops-12-–-buying-opportunity-200184465,200184465

103517,325032,ABC,Is AmerisourceBergen  ABC  Stock A Good Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AmerisourceBergen Corporation   NYSE ABC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AmerisourceBergen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 49  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  AmerisourceBergen s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Medical   Dental Supplies industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 85  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AmerisourceBergen has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 90  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AmerisourceBergen stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AmerisourceBergen has a P S ratio of about 0 14  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years As we can see  the stock is trading around its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AmerisourceBergen currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AmerisourceBergen a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for AmerisourceBergen is just 1 64  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 11  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 82  which is far better than the industry average of 13 92  Clearly  ABC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though AmerisourceBergen might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives ABC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen three upward and two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2 1  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AmerisourceBergen Corporation  Holding Co  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerisourceBergen is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 29  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past three years  the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run

103555,325070,ABC,3 Stock Picks For Aug 23  ABC  STX And VFC,opinion,"AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  As a holding company  the AmerisourceBergen Corporation markets pharmaceutical products and health systems on the American market  Since the AmerisourceBergen Corporation does not produce any medicinal products itself  its main tasks consist in the storage and nation wide distribution of these products  In April of last year  this stock met an early high at approx   120  After the break of the last point three at  93 60  this stock transitioned into a valid downtrend  The current course low is located at  73 31  the correction zone runs between  80 50 and  92 48  In the last few days  the price came very close to the upper edge of the red box  where it is now forming our DowHow signals  This could definitely be a sign for a renewed trend continuation 
Seagate  STX  Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  LLC is one of the leading manufacturers of hard drives  The company offers internal and external storage solutions for notebooks as well as desktop computers  The focal point of the group lies in the development and distribution of storage media for companies  which aims to be applicable irrespective of the branch  The chart of the technology company has also been in a stable downward trend for quite some time  however  this trend is now quickly reaching maturity  We are currently in the 7th correction  and the DowHow signals are displaying an 8th movement  As long as the price does not leave the red zone by means of the closing price  this trend can absolutely continue on once more 
Consumer Goods  VFC  VF Corporation  NYSE VFC  is one of the leading global retail companies in the clothing industry  It regularly has its own designers develop new products  which it then manufactures and markets via department stores and specialised trend stores  Among the branded goods produced are  for example  jeans  Wrangler  Lee   lingerie  children s clothing  sporting goods  outdoor clothing  Timberland  Napapijri  The North Face  etc   as well as products for the lines 7 for all Mankind  Ella Moss or splendid  Although the chart for this company was not quite able to withdraw from the current correction  it fared better than several other companies  The price is currently in its last valid correction zone  where it has been forming new DowHow signals over the past couple of days  This makes a trend continuation very probable  However  the price also still has a little more potential for recovery  since the end of the correction box is only at about  70 35  Patience may well pay off here

103594,325109,ABC,May Trade Deficit Up,opinion,"The big data short week narrative continues this morning  two days ahead of the big June Jobs Report that investors and economists will be watching very closely  Until that time  we have plenty to chew on 

Today ahead of the bell we see a May Trade Deficit in the U S  of  41 1 billion  up from April s read of  37 4 billion  No alarm bells sounded in he immediate aftermath  the Dow  Nasdaq and S P 500 were  101   29 and  12 points  respectively  ahead of the release  and are  108   31 and  13 since 

We will spend more time considering the results of ISM Services  Non Manufacturing  data at 9am CT today  These numbers have been trading downward as of late  and analysts are looking for a figure somewhere around 53  over 50 indicates expansion   The ISM Manufacturing survey last Friday surprised to the upside  but the U S  economy is far more Services than Manufacturing driven these days  so today s report is the more consequential 

Later today   1pm Central  to be exact   the latest minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  will be released  giving some insight into why the Fed resisted raising interest rates another quarter percent  This most recent meeting last month followed the heavily disappointing May Jobs Report  which showed the U S  only gaining 38K jobs  more than 100K off estimates  Many observers maintain that this poor employment showing helped seal the fate to keep interest rates unchanged in June  and perhaps all summer  maybe beyond   but today s minutes will tell us for sure 

Normally in the first full week of a new month  Wednesday awaits the ADP    private sector jobs report  but this Independence Day shortened week is pushing this read back until tomorrow  Part of the big jobs miss last month was due to the May ADP read which saw 173K private sector jobs in the month  We look to either see a big adjustment either when ADP reports these June numbers before the bell or on Friday s BLS non farm payroll report  Over time  these two reports tend to move in line 

We are still a week away from the big first week of Q2 earnings  but we get a taste this morning with Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA     posting sales improvements year over year  but lower than consensus expectations  Earnings were down year over year  but Walgreens is operating with lots of moving parts these days  it has ended its alliance with maligned pharma company Theranos  as well as the  9 4 billion acquisition of Rite Aid  expected to close sometime in 2H 2016  and Walgreens attempt to buy a significant stake in AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC     ",2016-07-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/may-trade-deficit-up-200140287,200140287

5 Stocks Set to Gain from Recent Broker Rating Upgrades

Sometimes in life  one ends up taking incorrect decisions in the absence of proper guidance  The same is often true in the investing world  With stocks flooding the investing space  it is very hard if not impossible for investors to add the right bunch to their portfolio for handsome returns without proper pointers 

After all  no one wants to see his hard earned money go down the drain  which is usually the result if one invests in stocks arbitrarily  To avoid such a fiasco  one should pay heed to what analysts are saying about a stock before investing in it 

Of the three types of analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors  So  an analyst  irrespective of the type  does extensive research on the company s  followed 

Broker Ratings Hold the Key to Buy Sell Decisions

Given the time crunch that we all face  it is impossible for investors to follow each stock minutely  So  it is best to follow expert advice  Brokers  by virtue of their detailed study  are armed with information on various aspects of the companies they follow  They have a lot more information on a company and its prospects than normal people as they not only scrutinize publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations 

Since brokers arrive at their recommendation  buy  sell or hold  on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty gritties associated with the company  it is natural that if investors them improving their recommendation on a particular stock  they are inclined to believe that there is a solid reason logic behind it  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade 

For example  in the event of oil prices plummeting  analysts are likely to become bullish on an airline stock which might lead them to raise their earnings estimates and improve their target price  The bullish stance adopted by analysts on the stock serves as an important guide for investors on whether they should spend their hard earned money on it  On the other hand  in the event of estimates moving south  which can happen due to lower than expected earnings modest sales or pipeline failure  for a biotech company   investors tend to offload the stock from their portfolio

103600,325115,ABC,S P 500  9 Healthcare Dividend Growth Stocks  Part 1,opinion,"Introduction
Most everyone would agree that the stock market as measured by the S P 500 is not cheap today  However  there might be a great deal of disagreement regarding precisely how overvalued the S P 500 currently is  Nevertheless  I would agree that in the general sense  stocks are not exactly bargains today  This might especially be true regarding best of breed blue chip dividend growth stocks  Low interest rates have enhanced the attraction for high quality dividend paying stocks 
On the other hand  suggesting that the S P 500 is fully valued or even overvalued  is not the same as saying that all stocks in the S P 500 are overvalued  As I ve often stated  I believe it is a market of stocks and not a stock market  Additionally  I would also confidently state that it is also a market of various sectors as well  In this regard  there will be times when certain sectors are in favor while others are out of favor  Consequently  even in an overheated market  it is not unusual to find companies in specific sectors that are out of favor at the same time  Furthermore  this would also apply to certain companies in various subsectors within the larger sector 
The bottom line for me is that I never make individual common stock investment decisions based on where I think the level of the overall market is  Instead  I believe in looking for value when and wherever I can find it  Since I believe in building a stock portfolio one company at a time  it logically follows that I also believe in analyzing stocks one company at a time  Simply stated  I invest based on my determination and evaluation of the fundamental value I would be receiving from investing in the individual company I am scrutinizing 
The Commonsense Benefits of Sound Valuation
Long running bull markets  like the one we have been experiencing over the past 7 or 8 years  has a tendency to elicit overconfidence and even complacency  The longer stocks go up  the more confident people tend to become  This concept has recently hit home with me by reading startling comments by dividend growth investors that I highly respect  For example  several comments have promoted and supported the notion that the strong just keep getting stronger  They use this refrain to justify a willingness to pay high valuations for best of breed dividend growth stocks  I believe this is a serious mistake for reasons I will next present 
The concept of only being willing to invest in even the greatest of companies at or below sound valuation is mathematically supported  For starters  with any given amount of money  you will purchase more shares of a great company at a lower valuation than you will at a higher valuation  Owning more shares over the long run will lead to more dividend income and greater capital appreciation 
Moreover  when you invest at lower valuations  each share that you purchase will have a higher current dividend yield than had you purchased it at a higher valuation  So not only do you get more shares at lower valuations  each share also provides you a higher current yield  In the long run  this pays off handsomely  in addition to simple math  it is also common sense  On the other hand  in matters of investing  common sense is often not all that common 
But most importantly  the willingness to overpay for even the best company either ignores or denies the inevitable reality that a company s stock price will eventually move into alignment with fundamental value  In other words  when a stock is undervalued based on fundamentals  it will inevitably move up to fundamental value   and vice versa  Consequently  to me at least  it seems prudent and intelligent to only invest in any company  no matter its quality  at times when its valuation is sound and attractive 
The reader should note the use of the plural  times   In other words  I am not suggesting perfect timing because I consider that virtually impossible  Instead  there will be a period or periods of time when a stock is valued at sound levels  However  over those periods of time there will still be volatility  Therefore  there will be short periods of time when valuation might get a little better or a little worse  In other words  a soundly valued stock could drop in price temporarily over the short run  or immediately rise a little in price  Nevertheless  the important point is that you initially purchased it at a sound valuation regardless of what happens over the short term  In the long run  this will work for your benefit as long as fundamentals remain intact 
9 Attractive S P 500 Healthcare Dividend Growth Stocks
There are over 50 healthcare stocks in the S P 500  However  there are numerous subsectors within the larger broader healthcare sector  Consequently  a little more than approximately 10  of the names in the S P 500 are healthcare companies  However  that does not follow that 10  of the S P 500 is comprised of healthcare  S P 500 index is a weighted index 
Moreover  of the 50  healthcare stocks in the S P 500  they also come in many different flavors  Some are pure growth stocks  some are dividend growth stocks  Additionally  some offer higher yields and lower growth  while others offer lower yield and higher growth  My point being  that choices should be made according to the individual investor s own goals and objectives 
With this article I will be sharing my preliminary research on 9 reasonably valued dividend paying S P 500 stocks in the healthcare sector  However  I do want to point out that some of these names are attractive for their current yield  while others more for total return  Nevertheless  I leave it up to the reader to decide if any of these companies are worthy of conducting further research  The following portfolio review lists these 9 research candidates in order of highest dividend yield to lowest   and lists additional fundamental metrics and attributes on each 

F A S T  Graphs and Fundamentals Underlying Numbers Review
The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs and FUN Graphs on each of these 9 research candidates illustrate why I was attracted to learning more about these companies  First of all  I was interested in finding investable attractively valued dividend growth stocks in the healthcare sector  Whenever I am conducting preliminary research prior to a more comprehensive effort  there are certain fundamentals that I personally like to evaluate 
Of course  the relationship of stock price to earnings is my first check  If the stock appears reasonably valued on that basis  I am motivated and willing to dig deeper  Therefore  I offer an earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs on each candidate 
When looking for dividend paying stocks specifically  I like to examine cash flow and free cash flow per share relative to dividends paid  This gives me a quick overview of how well the dividends are covered  Consequently  my second graph on each candidate provides a FUN Graph on each of these important metrics over the past five years 
Since I understand that I can learn from the past  but only invest in the future  I also find it useful to review consensus analyst estimates over the next few years and over the longer 3 to 5 year time frame  Therefore  utilizing the  Custom  forecasting calculator I present a quick look at analyst expectations on each company 
Finally  since future profitability is what I m most concerned with  I also like to examine gross and net profit margins and return on equity  Therefore  the final graph on each research candidate reviews those important metrics over the past 5 years  Although I will not do it for all of the following research candidates  I will interject appropriate commentary where I think it s necessary

103625,325140,ABC,WBA  An Iconic Dividend Aristocrat In Healthcare,opinion,"Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  has steadily grown its dividend for 40 straight years and has an operating history that dates back more than 100 years 
Few businesses have demonstrated such durability  and the ones that have are always worth a look for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  After all  it takes meaningful competitive advantages for a company to survive for such a long period of time 
Walgreens scores extremely well for Dividend Safety  97  and Dividend Growth  88   but there is a lot more to this drugstore s business drivers than many dividend growth investors perhaps realize Business OverviewWalgreens is a global leader in the retail pharmacy market with more than 13 100 stores in 11 countries  Walgreens Boots Alliance s drugstores sell a range of prescription and non prescription drugs in addition to a number of consumer products in categories such as beauty  personal care  and grocery 
Walgreens  roots can be traced back to humble beginnings in Chicago in 1901  but the business has since expanded organically and through major acquisitions to become a leading international player 
Walgreens Boots Alliance operates in three segments  Retail Pharmacy USA is its largest segment and accounted for 69  of sales and 72  of segment income in its first quarter of fiscal 2016  This division consists of Walgreens and Duane Reade branded drugstores in the U S 
Retail Pharmacy International represented approximately 12  of sales and 18  of segment profits and consists of Alliance Boots  one of the largest drugstores in Europe that Walgreens fully acquired in 2014 
The company also has a Pharmaceutical Wholesale business that generated 20  of sales and about 10  of segment income  This segment operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand and supplies medicines and a variety of healthcare products to over 200 000 pharmacies and other healthcare institutions from more than 350 distribution centers Business AnalysisRetail pharmacy is a highly competitive and relatively mature industry  There are few noticeable differences inside of a Walgreens or CVS store  which causes companies in the industry to compete largely on price  brand recognition  and convenience of store locations 
The two major drugstores that dominate the market are Walgreens and CVS  Each player has done its part in consolidating the market 
Walgreens acquired U S  drugstore chain Duane Reade for  1 1 billion in 2010 and bought a 45  interest in Alliance Boots  a major pharmacy player in Europe  for  6 7 billion in 2012 
The company purchased the rest of Alliance Boots in 2014 to give it a presence in faster growing international markets and further expand its scale  With Alliance Boots  Walgreens became the biggest buyer of generic drugs in the world and expects to generate at least  1 billion in cost savings 
Most recently  Walgreens announced a deal to acquire Rite Aid  NYSE RAD  for  17 2 billion in 2015  This acquisition is expected to close in late 2016 and will provide better national coverage for Walgreens  customers 
Why is the industry consolidating  Essentially  there is a building amount of pressure to take costs out of the healthcare system  Falling government reimbursement rates for prescriptions and consolidation throughout other parts of the healthcare chain are putting pressure on players like Walgreens to take costs out of their businesses 
By acquiring other drugstores  Walgreens gains significant cost synergies from procurement savings on the purchase of drugs and merchandise  With more than 720 million prescriptions filled last fiscal year  Walgreens is one of the biggest purchasers of prescription drugs and healthcare products 
As such  the company can offer customers lower costs compared to its smaller rivals  Its 2013 supply deal with distributor AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  is one example of the favorable contracts a company of Walgreens  size can attain  Smaller retail pharmacy companies will become increasingly uncompetitive as their scale becomes even smaller compared to Walgreens 
In addition to economies of scale  Walgreens benefits from owning some of the best real estate in the country  According to the company s annual report  approximately 76  of the U S  population lives within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy 
Once its acquisition of Rite Aid closes later this year  that number will increase even further as the company s national coverage further expands 
Convenient store locations have helped Walgreens generate one of the top 100 most powerful brands in the world and make it an obvious shopping choice for many consumers  It also benefits from lengthy operating histories dating back to the early 1900s for Walgreens and 1849 for Boots Alliance 
In addition to its strong brand recognition and convenient store locations  Walgreens Boots Alliance s websites receive about 68 million visits per month  providing a convenient platform for customers to refill their prescriptions 
By making it easy to refill orders  Walgreens gets more traffic through its doors  While prescriptions account for over 65  of revenue in the company s U S  stores  sales of retail merchandise carry higher margins 
As long as Walgreens makes it easy and affordable for customers to fill prescriptions with the company  it enjoys a steady base of sales 
Finally  it s worth mentioning that Walgreens Boots Alliance should benefit as the elderly population continues to grow in size and healthcare reform results in more insured Americans  driving more demand for prescriptions 
While healthcare reform is resulting in several benefits for the company  it also poses several risks Walgreens  Key RisksChange is often the biggest risk that companies face  and the U S  healthcare sector is undergoing a major evolution as a result of the Affordable Care Act and a need to reduce costs 
In the U S   96 8  of Walgreens  prescription sales last fiscal year were third party sales  where reimbursement is primarily received from managed care organizations  The government is doing all it can to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates  The way drugs are priced is also rapidly changing 
Changes in Medicare and Medicaid funding and continued consolidation throughout the entire healthcare chain could pose unexpected challenges to Walgreens  pharmacy operations  Margins could be compressed  or competition from low cost retailers such as Walmart  NYSE WMT  could increase and take away some store traffic 
The market s growth can also be impacted by changes in the number and price of generic drugs  The generic drug wave has largely played out  and future trends are uncertain  Walgreens does best when new generics hit the market 
Walgreens Boots Alliance also faces risk from its acquisition binge  Big acquisitions often fail to create shareholder value  and Walgreens has made its biggest bets ever in recent years  If management fails to generate expected synergies or encounters unexpected integration challenges  the company will be challenged Dividend Analysis  Walgreens Boots AllianceWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Walgreens Boots Alliance has one of the safest dividend payments in the market with a Dividend Safety Score of 97  The company s strong safety rating starts with its payout ratio  which sits near 30  today  While Walgreens  earnings payout ratio has nearly doubled over the last decade  it remains at a very healthy level Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The drugstore industry is also resistant to recessions  Consumers still need their prescriptions regardless of how the economy is doing  which helped Walgreens grow its sales during the recession  This is one reason why we consider healthcare to be one of the best stock sectors for dividend income Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Walgreens  business model also generates plenty of stable and growing free cash flow  which is needed to fund the dividend  The company s mature store base and economies of scale throw off a lot of cash Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While Walgreens  operations have a low operating margin near 5   the company turns over its inventory rapidly to earn a strong return on invested capital  As seen below  Walgreens has created economic value by generating a double digit return for most of the last decade  which is often the sign of a moat Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Turning to the balance sheet  Walgreens has about  2 6 billion in cash on hand compared to  13 2 billion in debt  After the deal for Rite Aid closes  the balance sheet will become a bit overleveraged  Moody s has placed Walgreens  credit ratings on review for a downgrade 
While the company s large acquisitions have increased risk  the company s consistent cash flow generation reduces some of our concern and easily protects the dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  Walgreens  dividend is very safe for several reasons  The company sells recession resistant products  maintains low payout ratios  and generates predictable free cash flow  Its iconic brand and convenient store locations will continue to serve it well for many years to come Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Walgreens  Dividend Growth Score of 88 indicates that the company has very strong dividend growth potential  Walgreens has increased its dividend for 40 consecutive years and is a member of the dividend aristocrats list  Perhaps even more impressively  Walgreens has paid uninterrupted dividends for 83 straight years 
As seen below  Walgreens has recorded impressive dividend growth  The company s dividend has increased by 20  per year over its last 10 fiscal years  although growth has slowed to a high single digit pace more recently Source  Simply Safe Dividends
With the company working on integrating several major acquisitions and restoring its balance sheet  dividend growth will likely remain at a mid  to high single digit pace for the time being 
Walgreens Boots Alliance also targets a long term dividend payout ratio of 30 35   which is where the company is at today  In other words  dividend growth will more closely align with earnings growth going forward ValuationWBA s stock trades at 18 2x forward earnings estimates and has a dividend yield of 1 8   which is below its five year average dividend yield of 2 2  
Investors are betting on Walgreens achieving substantial synergies from its recent acquisitions  which could help drive its earnings growth rate into the high single digits or low double digits 
Given the number of moving parts to Walgreens  story  we think the stock appears to be at least fairly valued today ConclusionThe healthcare landscape is rapidly evolving  While more Americans are now insured  driving prescription volumes higher  there is immense pressure to make the healthcare system more efficient and take out costs 
Government funded reimbursement models are changing and putting pressure on lucrative rates enjoyed in many pharmaceuticals markets  These changes  amongst others  are causing the entire distribution chain that delivers drugs from manufacturers to patients to consolidate 
While Walgreens is much better positioned than its smaller rivals  its large acquisitions of Alliance Boots and Rite Aid come with integration risks and are a signal of the need for further consolidation to protect profits

103630,325145,ABC,Bull Of The Day  PharMerica  PMC ,opinion,"PharMerica Corporation  PMC  is an  800 million pharmacy services provider for institutional customers and patients in long term care settings 

The stock became a Zacks  1 Rank recently after another solid earnings report where they once again beat analyst EPS estimates by 20  for the fourth consecutive quarter 

On May 6 the company reported total revenue of  524 5 million  up 2 5  from last year s first quarter  and beating the analyst consensus by 3   The top line beat was driven by a higher than expected number of prescriptions dispensed  which totaled 8 6 million  Revenue per prescription dispensed in the quarter came in at  60 66 

Analysts Prescribe Better Outlook

In response to the company s outlook and reaffirmed 2016 guidance of revenue in the range of  2 125 billion to  2 150 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of  1 95 to  2 05  analysts scrambled to raise estimates 

In the past 30 days  the 2016 consensus went from  1 74 to  2 02 and full year 2017 projections rose 15  from  1 96 to  2 26 

Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets described the quarter as offering solid evidence of PharMerica s value proposition  Specifically they noted  The company remains on track toward creating value by expanding its mix of faster growing specialty diversified pharmacy services and using its cash flow to fold in small LTC and home infusion pharmacy acquisitions   The analysts reiterated their Overweight rating and raised their price target from  33 to  34 

Under the Hood of a Key Pharmacy Player

PharMerica offers a broad range of pharmacy services across multiple settings of care ranging from hospitals to nursing facilities and even in home pharmacy services required after a hospital stay  The specialize in senior long term care and specialty oncology services that traditional community pharmacies don t address 

PharMerica was formed as a public company in 2007 through the combination of the institutional pharmacy business of national healthcare services company Kindred Healthcare  Inc  and pharmaceutical services company AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  Corporation 

According to Wikipedia   In August 2011  pharmacy services provider Omnicare made a bid of  457 million for all outstanding shares of PharMerica  The Federal Trade Commission sued Omnicare to block the deal on the basis that the FTC believed the acquisition would lead to higher drug prices  In February 2012  Omnicare allowed its offer to the shareholders of PharMerica to expire   

I m sure that PMC shareholders since 2012 are quite satisfied with this result as the shares have advanced from the low teens  And I think that the recently tested multi year support tested in March at  20 gives a good risk reward reference for the stock 

Bottom Line  PMC Delivers

PharMerica ranks as an industry leading U S  provider of institutional pharmacy services in terms of annual revenues  

And those strong revenues create a compelling value case with a remarkable Price to Sales ratio of 0 40 

This is why PMC has one of the top Zacks composite style scores of  A  for all three metrics of Value  Growth  and Momentum  

And it s why you should consider PMC one of your top plays in the pharmacy industry

AbbVie    was big in the news this week after Federal regulators agreed to review a key patent for the anti inflammatory drug Humira  knocking the stock down 3 5  on over three times the average volume of 9 million shares 

According to a story from Dow Jones on Tuesday by Anne Steele  the US Patent and Trademark Office s Patent Trial and Appeal Board took up a petition by hopeful rival Coherus BioSciences to look at AbbVie s patent on a Humira dosing regimen to treat rheumatoid arthritis 

But ABBV shares were already pushed into the cellar of the Zacks Rank before this news because of a slide in earnings estimates over the past 30 days  Full year 2106 profit projections fell from  5 00 to  4 77 and the 2017 consensus EPS estimate dropped from  5 99 to  5 73 

And that loss of earnings momentum is what makes ABBV today s Bear of the Day by virtue of its Zacks  5 Rank  Strong Sell   This simply means that relative to over 4 000 other stocks across all sectors  ABBV has poor prospects for a price advance because of the magnitude and agreement of negative EPS revisions from analysts 

The Coherus Challenge

Part of this action by analysts in the past month may have been in anticipation of the move by Federal patent authorities  Coherus management revealed at an investor conference in January that the company planned to file an application this year to market a biosimilar  generic  version of Humira 

On Tuesday  Coherus Chief Executive Denny Lanfear said they are  confident that this will lead to a final decision nullifying  the patent 

Shares Coherus shot up nearly 16  to  18 83 on very strong volume of 1 6 million shares  over five times their daily average 

AbbVie responded  we are confident in the validity of our patents and will vigorously defend them  

 Humira is protected by many patents covering all aspects of its manufacture  formulation and indications  and the patents are the result of AbbVie s investment in biologic innovation and the unique attributes of Humira   a spokesperson said 

According to the Dow Jones article by Anne Steele  Humira was the second best selling drug in the U S  in 2015 and is AbbVie s largest source of revenue 

AbbVie has also been preparing for this competitive battle by taking out about 70 patents for Humira  one of the largest patent portfolios ever assembled for a single drug 

Again from Steele   The drug s primary U S  patent is due to expire in December  but AbbVie says the additional patents should keep copycat versions of Humira off the U S  market until at least 2022  and possibly longer  

Bottom Line for ABBV  Watch the Zacks Rank

While this patent battle could actually become a multi year war  after today s big news the analysts may continue to revise ABBV estimates downward  And that could keep it in the basement of the Zacks Rank for a while

Zooming in on the daily timeframe also looks good  The RSI and MACD are rising in this timeframe as well but the 100 day SMA seems to be providing some short term resistance  A move over that would confirm more upside with resistance at 69 15 and 71 50 

I am hitting the road now  but will be monitoring this and may enter tomorrow

103663,325178,ABC,5 Stocks To Trade This Week  ABC  ANTM  COL  GNRC  IBKR,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC 
AmerisourceBergen   ABC   has been a monster of a stock since moving higher in late October  The last two weeks it has been consolidating again  but with an expanding range to the downside  This is as the RSI has worked off an overbought condition and the MACD is crossing down  It is noticeably extended from the SMA s  Watch for a range break top the downside 
Anthem   NYSE ANTM 


Anthem  has been trending higher for over a year  In stocks like this a consolidation period  like what is happening now  is a possible opportunity to get a good entry  The RSI remains strong and bullish while the MACD has crossed down  it too is extended from the longer SMA s  but the 20 day SMA close by has acted as support  Watch this for a break either way 
Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL 

Rockwell Collins  rose off of the double bottom at 71 50 and consolidated for a while around 85 before moving up again  Now hitting resistance after a slight pullback it has support for an upside breakout from a rising and bullish RSI and a MACD about to cross up 
Generac   NYSE GNRC 

Generac  moved up out of a rounded bottom to end 2014  but pulled back early in 2015  Now having retraced the pullback and advanced it is consolidating in a tight range  As it churns the RSI is working lower  but remains bullish while the MACD has crossed down  This is normal for a consolidation and you could see this break the range in either direction  Be prepared 
Interactive Brokers   NASDAQ IBKR 

Interactive Brokers  has been in a long trend higher  Recently it is consolidating in a narrow range with the Bollinger Bands  squeezing  This is often a precursor to a move  The RSI is falling but in the bullish zone while the MACD is falling  This could break the range either way and the strong rising SMA s suggest that any pullback be watched as a possible buying opportunity 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  Heading into next week sees the equity markets looking vulnerable 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil churns in a consolidation zone  The US dollar Index looks to continue higher while US Treasuries continue lower  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue its broad consolidation with a short term downside bias and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s  ARCA SPY    ARCA IWM  and  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts look better to the downside though with the SPY the weakest and the IWM and QQQ a bit stronger on the longer timeframe  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

slowed greater than expected in 2Q Gold and silver markets have been extremely subdued of late with Bloomberg terminals abandoned in favour of the marvellous spectacle that was the London Olympics  Many traders  decision makers and institutional participants were off on holidays and or enjoying watching the Olympics The precious metals have been strangely becalmed despite significant volatility being seen in stock markets  Economic data has been poor and largely gold positive and this could result in a bout of buying with the return of important market participants The distracting spectacle of the Olympics may have led to market complacency and the cocktail of macro risks and geopolitical risks such as the eurozone debt crisis and events in Syria and Iran could lead to the Olympic calm giving way to a volatile and stormy Fall It is important to note that markets were also unusually calm during the two weeks of the Chinese Olympics in 2008  The 2008 Summer Olympic Games took place slightly later in August than the London Olympics   starting August 8 and ending August 24 Only days after the ending of the Chinese Olympics came massive market volatility in September and then seven

euro and sterling terms  Another brief bout of dollar strength saw gold bottom in November 2008 in dollar terms  Besides the eurozone crisis  and the significant risk of the German Constitutional Court deciding on September 12th to reject the recently cobbled together alphabet soup response to the crisis  ESM etc etc  and significant instability in the Middle East  there is also the not inconsequential risk from the US Presidential campaign and the upcoming  fiscal cliff  These factors should see gold well supported again in the coming months NEWSWIRE Bloomberg     Syria Government

103696,325211,ABC,Precious Metals And Miners Making Waves  And New Trends ,opinion,The precious metals sector has been dormant since both gold and silver topped in 2011  But the long term bull market remains intact  As long as we do not have the price of gold close below the lower yellow box on the monthly chart then technically speaking  precious metals should continue much higher Large consolidation periods  yellow boxes  provide investors with great insight for investments looking forward 6 18 months upon a breakout in either direction  up or down   The issue with investing during these times is the passage of time  One can hold a position for months and sometimes years having their investments fluctuate adding extra stress to their life when they really do not need to Once a breakout takes place a powerful rally or decline will start putting an investors  money to work within days of committing to that particular investment compared to money invested waiting months for the breakout and new capital gains to occur Gold Price Chart   MonthlyGold Price Chart   DailyThe chart of gold continues to form a large bull flag pattern with a potential 3 or 5 wave correction  If price reverses this week and breaks above the upper resistance trend line then it will be a 3  ABC  wave correction which is very bullish  But there is potential for a full 5 wave correction which is still bullish  but it just means we have another month or two before metals bottom Gold Miner Stocks   GDX ETF Chart   DailyThe Gold miners do not have the sexiest looking chart  It has formed a strong looking bull flag but continues to correct and is not nearing a key support level  This level could act as a triple bottom  bullish  or if price breaks below  then it would be breaking the neckline of a massive head and shoulders pattern which points to a 50  decline  I remain bullish with the longer term gold trend until proven wrong Silver Price Chart   DailySilver remains in a long term bull market much like the monthly chart of gold shown earlier in this report  Silver continues to work its way through a large bull flag pattern with a positive outlook at this time Silver Miner Stocks   SIL ETF   Daily ChartReviewing the precious metals sector  it seems that silver miners have the sexiest looking chart  All price patterns are showing strength and are in proportion to one other  If this chart plays out to what technical analysis is pointing to then we could see the precious metals sector put in a bottom and rally within the next week or two  And if this is the case then silver miner stocks should provide the most opportunity going forward Precious Metals Trading Conclusion In short  what you need to focus on is the yellow consolidation box on the monthly gold chart  A break in either direction will trigger a massive move that should last 6 18 months  Until then  long term investors can simply sit back and watch the sector while they put their money to work in other active sectors From a short term traders point of view  I am looking for signs of a bottom on the daily chart to get my money working earlier  and to play the bounce rally that takes place and to actively manage the position until a breakout occurs  The charts overall are not that clear as to when a breakout will take place  Metals could start to rally next week or in a few months and all we can do is wait for a reversal to the upside before we get active Knowing the big picture trends and patterns at play along with major support and resistance levels  breakout levels  is crucial for success and peace of mind ,2013-01-28,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/precious-metals-and-miners-making-waves-(and-new-trends)-152622,152622
