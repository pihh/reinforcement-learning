The S P 500 was off 0 31   closing below 3 000 for the first time in four days 
The Dow industrials were off 0 53   and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0 28  
The market pullback came after the major indexes had just enjoyed three straight weeks of gains in a rally set off on hopes that the U S  China trade war could ease  Instead  tension in the Middle East reasserted itself as a concern because Saudi Arabia produces roughly 10  of the world s crude oil  
The Trump Administration blamed the attack on Iran  The Iranians denied the charge  Combatants in Yemen  engaged in a war with the Saudis  claimed responsibility 
Meanwhile  voters in Israel head to the polls Tuesday in an election called by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  who had been unable to form a government after an earlier election cost him his majority in the Knesset 
The S P 500 saw large losses for stocks vulnerable to energy price swings  such as American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   United Airlines  NASDAQ UAL  and cruise line operator Carnival  NYSE CCL  
But the losses were offset by big gains for Apache  NYSE APA     Cimarex Energy    NYSE XEC  and Helmerich and Payne NYSE HP   In fact  energy shares were by far the S P 500 s best performers 
At the same time  General Motors  NYSE GM   hit by a labor strike  and News Corp  NASDAQ NWSA  were lower 
The market s fall came as West Texas Intermediate crude hit nearly  63 a barrel and Brent futures crude settled above  69 
Gold Futures also moved higher as many investors sought shelter from geopolitical risk  Bond yields fell as well  reflecting the flight to safety  The 10 Year Treasury yield fell to 1 849  from Friday s 1 899  
The Federal Reserve starts a two day meeting on Tuesday and is expected to cut its key federal funds rate a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday

 NEW YORK  June 1  Reuters    U S  stocks skidded on
Wednesday as more weak economic data cemented fears the U S 
recovery was running out of steam and prompted Wall Street
firms to slash forecasts ahead of the closely watched payrolls
report on Friday 
 Goldman Sachs and several other big financial institutions
cut estimates for non farm payrolls growth in May after ADP
Employer Services reported much lower than expected growth in
private payrolls last month

anything like the ADP on Friday  then we are going to struggle
over the next couple of months   said Jim Paulsen  chief

 The fall of about 1 percent for the major indexes came
after four days of gains as stocks crept back toward recent
highs at the start of May  That had some investors pointing to
resilience in the market  but Wednesday s fall for the S P 500
back below its down trend line from its May highs is likely to
reignite concerns about market weakness

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 30 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 42  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sealed Air 
For Sealed Air  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 23  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sealed Air will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sealed Air would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 64  delivering a surprise of  1 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  1 30 billion  indicating an improvement of 3  from the year ago reported figure  The same for earnings stands at 74 cents  suggesting a decline of 1 3  from the prior year quarter  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days A Peek at Q3Sealed Air s third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of 64 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents and improved 5  year over year  Total revenues increased 1  year over year to  1 161 million  However  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 167 million Surprise HistoryThe global leader in food safety and security  and product protection has an impressive surprise history  Sealed Air s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by 10 51   on average 
Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Key Factors to ConsiderThe slowdown in the global industrial market is likely to have impacted demand in the fourth quarter  Nevertheless  demand from fresh food market and the e commerce sector is likely to have mitigated some of the impact and contributed to the  fourth quarter performance  Further  the company s recent acquisitions  notably of Automated Packaging Systems and AFP  are likely to have benefited the top line in the quarter to be reported In December 2018  Sealed Air announced a reformation plan   Reinvent SEE Strategy   along with a fresh restructuring program to drive growth and earnings  The strategy is focused on innovations  SG A productivity  product cost efficiency  channel optimization and customer service enhancements  Savings from these initiatives are likely to have contributed to the operating margin and  in turn  are expected to have driven the fourth quarter performance However  currency headwinds  input cost inflation and higher freight charges are likely to have impacted margins in the quarter under review  Moreover  as Sealed Air continued to invest in R D  and sales and marketing to drive future growth  the bottom line is expected to reflect the impact of higher R D expenses in the to be reported quarter How Will the Segments Fare The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Food Care segment s fourth quarter net sales is pegged at  771 million  indicating a year over year decline of 0 1   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  is pegged at  172 million  suggesting growth of 6  from the prior year quarter  Unfavorable currency movement is likely to have impacted Food Care results in the to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Product Care segment s net sales is pegged at  532 million for the fourth quarter  indicating year over year improvement of 9   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s EBITDA is  92 million  suggesting growth of 8  from  85 million reported in the prior year quarter  Currency headwind and lower volume growth due to decelerating global industrial market  and the trade dispute between the United States and China might have weighed on the segment s results in the fourth quarter The company s traditional packaging solutions  which include Bubble Wrap  standardized mailers  shrink film and void fill  generate around one third of the Product Care segment s sales  This part of the segment is bearing the brunt of the market s shift to automation and the global industrial manufacturing slowdown  Moreover  specialty industrial applications  which include the Instapak platform and integrated fabrication solutions that account for another one third of Product Care sales  also remains weak owing to lower global industrial demand and the U S  China trade war

Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number

124143,345658,SEE,Will Sealed Air  SEE  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Sealed Air  SEE   which belongs to the Zacks Containers   Paper and Packaging industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This packaging company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14 25  
For the last reported quarter  Sealed Air came out with earnings of  0 80 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 64 per share  representing a surprise of 25   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 57 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 59 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 51  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Sealed Air  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Sealed Air has an Earnings ESP of  2 40  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 6  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-sealed-air-see-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200472776,200472776

124175,345690,SEE,Containers   Paper   Packaging Industry Outlook Bright,opinion,The Zacks   industry comprises companies that manufacture paper and plastic based packaging products utilized in consumer and industrial end markets  The industry players  products range from containerboard and corrugated packaging to flexible and rigid plastic packaging The industry participants serve a wide array of markets including food  beverage  foodservice and other consumer products like beauty  personal care and home care  The industry also serves the chemical  agribusiness  medical  pharmaceutical  electronics and industrial markets Let us take a look at the three major themes currently governing the industry  The industry s wide exposure  more than 60   to steady consumer oriented end markets  such as food and beverages  and healthcare keeps demand fairly stable across economic cycles  Moreover  rapid urbanization and rising purchasing power in Asia  particularly China  India  and Southeast Asia  will sustain demand for packaging in the days ahead  Demand for sophisticated packaging is on the rise and the industry is constantly striving to meet this by adopting new technology and innovative products  It is also likely to gain from capitalizing on growing global demand for eco friendly biodegradable packaging materials spurred by environmental concerns  The evolution of e commerce has significantly impacted demand in the industry  Packaging has gained utmost importance as it has to maintain the integrity of the product and has to be durable enough to withstand the complex automated and manual supply chains involved in delivering the product  According to   global retail e commerce sales are anticipated to improve to  6 54 trillion in 2022 from  2 3 trillion in 2017  In developed markets  e commerce has become second nature for consumers  while developing countries are catching up  India is one of the fastest growing e commerce markets and is  to reach  120 billion by 2020 from  39 million in 2017  Notable companies in the space like Sealed Air Corporation  NYSE SEE   SEE   Packaging Corporation of America  PKG  and Amcor are focusing on ecommerce ready packaging to capitalize on this growing demand  Apart from high raw material costs  the industry has been bearing the brunt of rising transportation costs  chemical costs and fuel costs  Consequently  the companies have to pass on as much of the raw material price inflation as possible to customers  However  it might not always be feasible to pass on the price increase to customers  Consequently  the companies are now focusing on reducing costs  improving productivity and in turn increasing profitability Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which

124198,345713,SEE,Is Sealed Air  SEE  A Great Stock For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Sealed Air Corporation   NYSE SEE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Sealed Air has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 44  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 35  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Sealed Air s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 90  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Sealed Air has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 28  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Sealed Air stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Sealed Air has a P S ratio of about 1 31  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 23 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  SEE is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Sealed Air currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Sealed Air a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Sealed Air might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C  This gives SEE a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 8 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Sealed Air Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSealed Air is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 30   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from

124218,345733,SEE,Why Sealed Air  SEE  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Sealed Air  SEE   which belongs to the Zacks Containers   Paper and Packaging industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This packaging company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 72  
For the last reported quarter  Sealed Air came out with earnings of  0 59 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 57 per share  representing a surprise of 3 51   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 67 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 75 per share  delivering a surprise of 11 94  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Sealed Air  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Sealed Air currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 34   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on August 2  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-sealed-air-see-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200445784,200445784
124219,345734,SEE,Sealed Air  SEE  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Sealed Air  SEE  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  1 17 billion  up 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sealed Air 
For Sealed Air  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 34  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Sealed Air will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sealed Air would post earnings of  0 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  3 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

124277,345792,SEE,Sealed Air  SEE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Sealed Air  SEE  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 57 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 13 billion  down 0  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 57  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sealed Air 
For Sealed Air  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 15  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sealed Air will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sealed Air would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 75  delivering a surprise of  11 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

124337,345852,SEE,Sealed Air  SEE  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Sealed Air  SEE  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 11 billion  down 9 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 88  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sealed Air 
For Sealed Air  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sealed Air will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sealed Air would post earnings of  0 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering a surprise of  1 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sealed Air doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sealed-air-see-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200382076,200382076
124356,345871,SEE,Worry Starts To Grow Amid Geopolitical Rumblings  Earnings Misses ,opinion," Thursday Market Close  Geopolitics stormed back into the picture in a big way Thursday  helping to wipe out much of the market s recent comeback and raising new concern about whether the recent softness might end up getting more prolonged  There s a little more worry creeping into the market than there was a week ago 
Today s losses seem a little more foundational than last week  when a lot of the sell off likely reflected profit taking  This time  bad news from all over the world and even from U S  earnings reports ganged up to send major indices down 1 2  to 2   back to levels not far from last week s lows  NASDAQ Composite got the worst of it  falling more than 2   while the other major indices fell more than 1  but finished off their mid session lows 
Some Context
In the face of these losses  it s important to keep things in perspective  From a percentage basis  the losses over the last week aren t incredibly huge  Sometimes people see the big losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average   DJI  and blow them out of proportion  The moves aren t that outrageous  but the raw numbers are big compared with 10 or 15 years ago  Also  some technical support does appear to be holding for now  with the S P 500 Index finishing right at its 200 day moving average of 2768  The 200 day has been a key support level most of the year 
International events played a big role Thursday  with three in particular seeming to cause the most concern  First  European Central Bank  ECB  President Mario Draghi said European Union budget rules have to be respected by all  Reuters reported  Though Draghi didn t specifically mention Italy  many analysts saw his remarks as a sign that the ECB is calling out Italy for trying to get around EU budget rules  This raised new concern about the situation in Italy and how it might affect the rest of the European economy  and the dollar gained on the euro  The rising dollar might have helped smack commodity markets Thursday 
Before that  China s market fell sharply overnight  and a survey showed consumer confidence dropping dramatically in that major economy  Rising fuel prices  a weak stock market  and the trade war between the U S  and China all played into falling confidence  media reports said 
Closer to home  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted that he wouldn t participate in a Saudi economic conference as tensions grew over the apparent killing of a Saudi journalist  Though crude prices fell back toward one month lows below  69 a barrel  any uptick in tension between the U S  and Saudi Arabia is probably worth monitoring  considering they re major trading partners 
Any one of these events might have taken some steam out of the market on a given day  To have all three hit pretty much at once really didn t give stocks much of a chance  All this comes after the Fed s September minutes released late Wednesday struck a hawkish tone  helping boost the benchmark 10 year Treasury note yield back above 3 2  early Thursday  The yield did retreat to 3 18  by end of day as bonds found some buyers amid the stock market washout 
Earnings Triggering Some Doubt
One positive earlier this week that might have helped play into Tuesday s massive rally seemed to be earnings  most of which were beating analyst estimates before today  However  IBM  NYSE IBM  and some other closely watched firms have started to change the tenor of earnings with concerns about the economy  something we didn t see as much of the last two quarters  For instance  shares of equipment rental company United Rentals  URI  tumbled nearly 15  Thursday despite the company beating estimates  Some investors seemed to see URI s guidance as disappointing 
In addition  shares of Sealed Air Corp   NYSE SEE  fell sharply after the company s earnings came in shy of Wall Street analysts  estimates and it said in a press release that it had been  adversely affected by currency headwinds and higher than expected raw material and freight costs  
These kind of market losses are arguably 100  earnings related  The last two earning seasons didn t see many of these kind of events  except perhaps in biotech where it s hard to predict results  There have been some big misses so far  and when earnings are more predictable you don t tend to see these kind of reactions 
All of this sets the market  and investors  up for what looks like a potentially interesting Friday  The question is whether things settle down and start to set a level with the end of the week upon us  or if there s some kind of final blow out as major info tech earnings loom next week

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with one trading day left in the year sees equity markets putting in a strong case for a reversal this week  They are still a long way from confirming a bottom though and not just a bear flag build 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil may possibly pause in the downtrend  The U S  Dollar Index continues to consolidate sideways while U S  Treasuries pause in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets continue to show an easier path to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  Their charts showed a strong bounce during the week but not enough to do anything to alter the current downtrends  Very short term uptrends are beginning  but it is too soon to declare a bottom  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trade them well

American Innovation to Thank
Simply put  technological advances such as hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  have made the oil extraction process much more efficient than anything we ve seen before  Amazingly  output continues to climb even as the number of rigs in operation has dropped for the fifteenth week   Productivity is up 50 percent over the last five years   Brian says   There s already been some slowdown  but we re still seeing the strong momentum from last year   That momentum could be enough to propel us toward 10 million barrels a day  something we haven t seen in this country since 1970  This incredible rise in efficiency has led some analysts to foresee a possible  storage crisis  in North America  It s possible though  again  unlikely that we ll eventually reach a point when there just isn t any more commercial storage space   Crisis  is certainly a loaded word  but such an event could serve as the catalyst that forces companies to make meaningful production cuts  which would help oil prices recover  In the meantime  energy storage and transportation companies such as Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI  and Tsakos Energy Navigation  NYSE TNP  are profiting in a world of abundant oil  Tsakos recently saw strong trading after it announced a dividend  and last week Morgan Stanley  gave the company a  buy  rating  Another area that s benefited in this climate is the plastic packaging and container industry  Since oil prices began to go off the cliff last summer  returns for Graphic Packaging have climbed more than 20 percent  Sealed Air  NYSE SEE   39 percent  and Berry Plastics  42 percent  
Demand Not Dissipating
At the same time that fracking has pushed daily U S  oil output to 32 year highs  improvements to our vehicles  internal combustion engines have increased the number of miles we can drive on a tank of gas to all time highs  Requiring less fuel to get farther doesn t mean demand is slipping  Quite the opposite  actually  Car and truck sales are expected to climb for the sixth straight year in 2015  a winning streak we haven t seen in over 50 years  Automobile pricing and information website TrueCar predicts that 17 million light weight vehicles will be driven off car lots by the end of 2015  a 10 year high  Since 2009 when sales plummeted to roughly 10 million units  their most depressed state since 1982 year over year sales growth has surged as the U S  has pulled itself out of the recession  In each of the past 12 months  200 000 or more new jobs were made available to Americans  the most since 1977  Americans are not only buying more vehicles some as new additions  others to replace aging clunkers but they re also taking them on the road more  especially now that national average fuel prices have fallen more than 31 percent from a year ago  In fact  Americans drove a record 3 05 trillion miles on U S  highways in January for the 12 month period  breaking the previous record set in November 2007  And with the busy summer travel season ahead of us  we should expect to see this number rise even more  Three trillion miles  by the way  is equivalent to taking more than 200 round trips to Pluto  That s a lot of fuel being consumed even if our vehicles are more fuel efficient  According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   gas consumption in 2015 will rise 1 percent over the previous year to reach 9 million barrels a day a little under the number of barrels of oil the U S  now produces daily  Add to that the fuel consumption coming from U S  airlines  which are also working on improving fuel efficiency  As I pointed out earlier this month  the number of miles flown on both domestic and international carriers is flying higher  along with the number of seats per flight  Disclosure and Disclaimer  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in specific industries  the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries  Fund portfolios are actively managed  and holdings may change daily  Holdings are reported as of the most recent quarter end  Holdings in the Global Resources Fund as a percentage of net assets as of 12 31 2014  Kinder Morgan  Inc  0 00   Tsakos Energy Navigation Ltd 0 00   Graphic Packaging Holding Co  0 00   Sealed Air Corp  0 0   Berry Plastics Group  Inc  0 0   There is no guarantee that the issuers of any securities will declare dividends in the future or that  if declared  will remain at current levels or increase over time  All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor  By clicking the link s  above  you will be directed to a third party website s   U S  Global Investors does not endorse all information supplied by this these website s  and is not responsible for its their content ",2015-03-30,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/innovation-and-efficiency-drive-u.s.-oil-supply-and-demand-246758,246758

Consensus Estimate of 67 cents as well as within the company s guidance range of 65 and 70 cents per share  The company s shares dipped 2 62  in pre market trading following the release Including restructuring costs  Caterpillar s earnings of 46 cents per share was significantly lower than the prior year quarter figure of  2 03 per share RevenuesRevenues plummeted 26  year over year to  9 461 billion in the quarter  and failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 499 billion due to unfavorable currency impact  negative price realization and lower volumes  Sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts Caterpillar witnessed a revenue decline across all regions  Latin America was the worst  registering a 43  drop in sales  mainly due to lower end user demand as a result of widespread economic weakness  In North America  Caterpillar witnessed a 26  decline in sales due to lower end user demand for Energy   Transportation applications and unfavorable changes in dealer inventories  mostly in Construction Industries  Sales in Europe  Africa and Middle East  EAME  tanked 24  due to the weak oil and other commodity price environment  Sales in the Asia Pacific region tumbled 23  due to lower demand for Energy   Transportation applications and mining products Costs   Operating ProfitIn the quarter  cost of sales declined 22  year over year to  6 8 billion  Gross profit plunged 33  to  2 6 billion  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses decreased 13  to  1 09 billion  while research and development  R D  expenses fell 3  to  508 million Adjusted operating profit was  1 04 billion  down 52  year over year  Lower sales volumes  including an unfavorable mix of products  stemming from continually weak commodity prices worldwide and economic weakness in developing countries  along with unfavorable price realization led to the decline  However  favorable period costs and variable manufacturing costs were a minor offset Segment ResultsMachinery and Energy   Transportation  ME T  sales decreased 27  year over year to  8 78 billion  Sales of Energy   Transportation plunged 33  due to lower sales volume  Sales at Resource Industries dropped 26  owing to lower end user demand across all regions  Construction Industries sales tanked 19  due to lower volumes  unfavorable price realization and unfavorable currency impact The ME T segment reported an operating profit of  390 million  marking a 75  plunge from  1 5 billion reported in the year ago quarter  Operating profit tumbled 41  at Construction Industries owing to lower volume and unfavorable price realization  At the Energy   Transportation segment  too  operating profit plunged 60  as a result of lower sales volume  partially offset by lower costs related to restructuring and favorable material costs  The worst performance was witnessed at Resource Industries  with the segment incurring a loss of  96 million in the quarter as against profit of  96 million a year ago due to lower sales volume and negative price realization  partially offset by improved manufacturing costs and a decrease in SG A expenses Financial Products  revenues dropped 7  to  743 million due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates  Financial Products  profit was  168 million in the quarter  compared with  227 million in the prior year quarter Financial PositionCaterpillar ended the first quarter with cash and short term investments of  5 9 billion  down from  6 5 billion at 2015 end  Total debt to capital ratio was 71  at first quarter end

Total cash flow from operating activities in 2015 was  489 billion  compared with  1 27 billion in the prior year period  Operating cash flow at ME T declined to  218 million in the quarter from  1 042 billion in the prior year quarter mainly due to lower profit BacklogAt the end of the quarter  Caterpillar s backlog remained unchanged at  13 1 billion  On a year over year basis  order backlog declined by about  3 5 billion  having recorded decreases in all segments A Sneak Peek into 2016Due to continually challenging business conditions in 2016  Caterpillar now expects revenues in the range of  40  42 billion  with the midpoint being  41 billion  as against the previous outlook of  40  44 billion  which had a midpoint of  42 billion  The trimmed guidance reflects expectations of lower transportation sales  rail  marine and the ending of production of on highway vocational trucks   lower mining sales and weaker price realization Also  Caterpillar now expects earnings per share  excluding restructuring costs  of  3 70  down from the earlier projection of  4 00 due to the decline in revenues To stay profitable despite weak demand  Caterpillar has stepped up its restructuring actions which should lead to cost savings  The company also continues to investing substantially in R D  However  the slump in oil prices  weak mining  Chinese economy woes  declining backlog  and
