127609,349124,MCK,Should Value Investors Buy McKesson  MCK  Stock ,opinion,"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks  Nevertheless  we know that our readers all have their own perspectives  so we are always looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong picks 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is McKesson  MCK   MCK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with P E ratio of 9 53 right now  For comparison  its industry sports an average P E of 19 33  Over the past 52 weeks  MCK s Forward P E has been as high as 10 22 and as low as 7 94  with a median of 9 31 
MCK is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 35  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  MCK s industry currently sports an average PEG of 2  Over the last 12 months  MCK s PEG has been as high as 1 48 and as low as 1 13  with a median of 1 33 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is MCK s P B ratio of 3 96  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks solid versus its industry s average P B of 4 43  Over the past 12 months  MCK s P B has been as high as 4 21 and as low as 2 29  with a median of 3 21 
Finally  investors should note that MCK has a P CF ratio of 15 11  This data point considers a firm s operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 37 65  Over the past 52 weeks  MCK s P CF has been as high as 16 05 and as low as 7 02  with a median of 8 81 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that McKesson is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  MCK sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2020-02-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-mckesson-mck-stock-200504004,200504004
127610,349125,MCK,McKesson  MCK  Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"McKesson  MCK  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 81 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 54 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 40 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 63   A quarter ago  it was expected that this prescription drug distributor would post earnings of  3 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 60  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
McKesson  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  posted revenues of  59 17 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 42   This compares to year ago revenues of  56 21 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
McKesson shares have added about 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for McKesson 
While McKesson has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for McKesson was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  4 18 on  55 61 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 68 on  228 58 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

of Investor RelationsThank you  Jack  Good morning  and welcome everyone to McKesson s Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call  Today  I m joined by Brian Tyler  our Chief Executive Officer  and Britt

forecasts about McKesson s operations and future results  Please refer to the cautionary statements in today s press release and our Slide presentation and to the Risk Factors section of our periodic SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those in our forward looking statements During this call  we will discuss non GAAP financial measures  Additional information about our non GAAP financial measures including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP results is included in today s press release and presentation slides  which are available on our website at investor mckesson com With that  let me turn it over the Brian Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Holly  and good morning  and thank you everyone for joining us on our call this morning  Before I get into our third quarter results  I wanted to take a few minutes to provide a brief update on opioid litigation  As you know we ve been engaged in complex discussions with the State Attorneys General and others about a settlement framework with the goal of achieving a broad resolution of opioid related claims  Those discussions continue to narrow what s left to address to achieve resolution on all the items that remain However  to the extent our efforts to reach a broad resolution settlement framework are unsuccessful  McKesson continues to be prepared to litigate and vigorously defend the miss characterization that our company drove the demand for opioids in this country  McKesson remains firmly committed to being part of the broader solution to this crisis  given however  the discussions and litigation are ongoing  I ll be somewhat limited in what I can say  I do appreciate your understanding Now let s get to our business results  Today  we reported third quarter total company revenues of  59 2 billion  Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was  3 81  and I m pleased with our third quarter and year to date execution across the majority of our businesses in our fiscal 2020 Also today  we reaffirmed our fiscal 2020 full year outlook of  14 60 to  14 80 of adjusted earnings per diluted share  which we first provided on January 13th  This reflected    this update reflects our outlook for growth in our US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment  primarily driven by specialty  strength in our Medical Surgical segment  lower than anticipated corporate expenses  and the benefit from share repurchase activity in the third quarter  Our US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment performed well in the quarter reflecting stable macro fundamentals and good execution  and was aided by the continued strong growth across our specialty businesses Let me walk you through the recent trends from an industry fundamental standpoint  For the third quarter  we saw branded price increases tracking in line with our expectations  and we continue to assume mid single digit branded price increases year over year for fiscal  20  For Generics  we remain disciplined in our approach to the market we are sourcing effectively through our scaled sourcing venture and the sell side remains competitive  but stable I d like to take a moment to acknowledge how pleased we are that the VA announced in December  it had again selected McKesson to be the prime pharmaceutical vendor beginning in August 2020  We have been the VA s prime pharmaceutical vendor for veteran hospitals and the department s mail order pharmacies for more than 15 years  This is a great point of pride for McKesson  and we re dedicated to hiring veterans and helping them build their careers after their service At McKesson  we have many employee resource groups celebrating and leveraging the diversity of our workforce and McKesson Military Resource Group or MMRG  as we refer to it internally provides opportunities for all employees to recognize and welcome veterans and their families to McKesson  MMRG offers networking opportunities  facilitates personal and professional development  supports McKesson s recruitment  hiring and retention of veterans and sponsors events within our communities for active duty military and veterans  I want to thank McKesson s veterans and every veteran really for their service  We re very proud to serve the VA  and we look forward to continuing our long standing partnership Moving to specialty  As you ve heard me discuss at several recent event we have a differentiated portfolio of assets and capabilities that we ve built over time with targeted internal and external investments  first  we distribute specialty pharmaceuticals via the traditional wholesale model to retail and hospital pharmacies  and although these products are margin rate dilutive we benefit from this growth at the topline and in our gross profit dollars  Next  we distribute specialty products that are primarily infused in the community based settings and typically require special handling including temperature control  We also provide other services like group purchase organization activities  data and technology services in oncology and other multi specialty practices And then we have our leading practice management business  specifically  the US Oncology Network  which now includes more than 1 200 oncology physicians providing 12  to 13  of all community based oncology care  we handle all aspects of managing the practice  so that the physician can focus on treating the patient  In addition  we re active in clinical trials  research and formulary development  The practice management business combined with the wholesale distribution and specialty product distribution and services business  are the scaled channels we leverage to provide services and solutions to our many biopharma partners  including commercialization  hub and patient assistance services We help manufacturers find patients that are appropriate and relevant for care  help them get started on that therapy sooner and work to keep them adherent to that therapy for the course of their treatment  This results in a patient getting the best possible outcome from their treatment  These services  not only support better outcomes for patients  but they also provide tremendous value to our manufacturer partners  We re really pleased with the growth we re seeing across these businesses  and we remain focused on specialty as a key tenet of our strategic direction  We are also pleased that we are returning to growth in the US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment in fiscal 2020  while continuing to invest in our future Now let me turn to Europe  In mid December McKesson and Walgreens announced a joint venture agreement that we expect will bring together our respective wholesale operations in Germany  After a review of our business in Germany  we believe this is the right course of action as the combined business will have large reach and scale  driving increased efficiency and performance in a market where scale is vitally important  The transaction is subject to merger clearance and approval and that process is expected to take at least six months from the time of the announcement  As such  this transaction will not have any impact on adjusted earnings in our current fiscal year In the UK  we continue to monitor the retail pharmacy funding dynamics  As we detailed earlier in the fiscal year  the retail pharmacy industry experienced underfunding by the NHS in our first quarter  While there was a modest improvement in our fiscal second quarter further upward revisions have not yet been implemented  We continue to monitor the situation in the UK closely and engage in active dialog with NHS related to industry funding and the role pharmacy can play in managing NHS  overall cost  quality and access challenges  Outside of the UK  we re continuing to see performance in line with our expectations for the other countries in this segment Next our Medical Surgical business again this quarter  we had good growth across multiple markets  such as our home care delivery business and product categories  including pharmaceutical sales into the primary care space  Customers are repeatedly choosing McKesson  because of our relentless focus on providing what they need to take care of their patients  we differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through innovation and a focus on operational excellence  breadth of product and service offerings along with one of the largest and most tenured sales forces in the industry  We also saw an early start to the influenza season in the third quarter  which we are continuing to monitor for severity and duration  In addition  our results continue to reflect the integration of the MSD acquisition  which we lapped during our first quarter and our focus is now on driving synergies  This acquisition continues to perform in line with its business case Turning to other  which primarily consist of Canada  McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions sometimes referred to as MRXTS and our investment in Change Healthcare  In Canada  we re now capturing the benefits of previous actions we ve taken including our investments in people and in reconfigured pharmacy formats as community pharmacy plays an important role in Canadian healthcare and market fundamentals are stable  which helped to drive growth in our wholesale operations year over year  In addition  McKesson Canada also has broad specialty assets and capabilities and we are well positioned to participate in the growth of specialty in the Canadian market Moving on to MRXTS  which is a key area of investment  We re making investments to ensure we have the right product and personnel resources in place to support the growth trajectory of these businesses and we re looking to launch new products that leverage our existing technologies and build upon them  As we look at how MRXTS is performing year to date  we re pleased with the growth in the business  which is net of several investments we are making to drive and support our future growth Let s move on to Change Healthcare  As we ve discussed previously  we continue to take the customary steps toward an exit of our investment in Change Healthcare  as part of the exit process registration statements were filed today with the SEC  The previously discussed timing  expectations are unchanged and this is simply a necessary step as we move through the process of exiting our investment in Change Healthcare Recently  you ve heard me talk about aligning McKesson under one vision to improve care in every setting one product  one partner  one patient at a time  We ve been transforming and energizing the culture of McKesson  We ve got a great collaborative workspace at our new headquarters in the Dallas area  we ve rolled out new enterprise behaviors  building on the already strong foundation of our ICARE and ILEAD values  and getting everyone aligned around our strategy and how we want to work together to execute it  We re looking to become a simpler  more focused and nimbler organization  we centralize some of our functions and are looking at ways to work more efficiently and to utilize technology for day to day tasks that can be automated  freeing up time to focused on strategy  work that drives value for the organization and better leverages our teams We re seeing great execution across the enterprise  including cost savings as we track toward our target of  400 million to  500 million in gross pre tax savings by the end of our fiscal 2021  Our organization has rallied around these efforts and it s showing in the culture and the results  but could not be prouder of the McKesson team  And with one quarter to go in fiscal  20  I m confident in our reaffirmed adjusted earnings outlook of  14 60 to  14 80 per diluted share  As we look forward  we re in the initial stages of planning for our fiscal 2021 Let me walk through some of the things we re thinking about  The timing and impact of the exit of our investment in Change Healthcare as exit activities are currently under way  For customer renewals  the VA contract goes into effect in August 2020  As a reminder  we ve stated that this new contract will not be a material headwind to our fiscal 2021 outlook  We are continuing to progress against our cost savings target with a portion of those savings falling to the bottom line and a portion being reinvested for growth And finally  from a capital allocation perspective  we would anticipate benefits from share repurchases completed in fiscal 2020  As you think about the market and the macro perspective in the US we re entering an election year  and we ll make assumptions related to any potential impact we might expect based on our analysis  including related to drug pricing trends McKesson will continue to engage with policymakers and industry partners to ensure that any reforms support solutions to improve cost  quality and access  The policy landscape remains a dynamic environment and we remain confident in McKesson s path forward As it relates to the UK  we re continuing to monitor the market environment in NHS funding  as well as Brexit activities  We will review our businesses and expectations  including the impact of external factors and we ll provide our fiscal 2021 outlook in May  when we report fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020 earnings Before I turn the call over to Britt  I want to take just a moment to thank Kathy McElligott  who just retired from McKesson and her role as Chief Information   Technology Officer  she helped McKesson increase its focus on data and analytics and accelerate our technology modernization  Kathy  thank you for your contributions to McKesson And on the flip side  I d like to also welcome Nancy Flores  who is succeeding Kathy as CIO and CTO  Nancy has a long track record of success in Healthcare IT  and we look forward to utilizing her experience as we remain focused on our mission to improve Healthcare in every setting by leveraging technology solutions for our company  our customers and our business partners And with that let me turn the call over to Britt to go through the financials Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  Thank you  Brian  and good morning everyone  I m pleased to be here this morning to talk about a solid third quarter for McKesson s  I ll focus on our third quarter results and full year fiscal 2020 guidance  including changes you need to consider as you update your models Brian walk you through high level of puts and takes as we think about our fiscal  21 guidance and will provide detailed assumptions for fiscal  21 when we report fourth quarter and full year results in May  We re pleased with our adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per diluted share results in the third quarter  which were ahead of our expectations and represent solid execution  We continue to see momentum across the business  as we execute against our strategic initiatives As a result of this momentum and based on the confidence in our fourth quarter outlook on January 13th we raised and narrowed our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of  14 60 to  14 80 per diluted share from the previous range of  14 to  14 60 per diluted share  and today we re reaffirming that adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance  Updated guidance assumptions can be found in our third quarter earnings slide presentation  which is posted on our Investor Section of our website Before I provide more details on our third quarter adjusted results  I want to address one item that impacted our GAAP only results in the quarter  During the third quarter  we recorded a pre and post tax charge of  282 million for the remeasurement to fair value of the net assets and the majority of McKesson s German wholesale business  in relation to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance Moving now to the adjusted earnings results for the quarter  Our third quarter adjusted EPS was  3 81  an increase of 12  compared to the prior year  which was primarily driven by organic growth in US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment  the Medical Surgical segment and the European segment  To better understand our third quarter results  let me remind you of two discrete events in our prior year s third quarter  both within our US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment  first  the  60 million pre tax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko and second a pre tax benefit of approximately  17 million related to the reversal of accrued New York State Opioid Stewardship Act charges  If you normalize for these two items  Q3 s fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 7  Moving to the details of our consolidated results on Slide 4  Consolidated revenues for the third quarter increased 5  versus the prior period  primarily driven by growth in our US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment  driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher retail national account volumes  We continue to anticipate mid to high single digit percent consolidated revenue growth for the full year Third quarter adjusted gross profit increased 4  year over year  principally due to organic growth in our Medical Surgical and US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment  Third quarter adjusted operating expenses increased 3  year over year  driven by higher corporate expenses  which include planned technology investments  Adjusted income from operations was  958 million for the quarter  which was up 4  year over year or 5  on an FX adjusted basis  As a result of this solid performance and our updated outlook  we are guiding full year adjusted income from operations to increase to low single digit percent Interest expense of  64 million in the quarter declined 4   compared to the prior year and our adjusted tax rate was 17 1  for the quarter  which included discrete tax benefits of approximately  36 million  For the full year  our adjusted tax rate assumption remains approximately 18  to 19   Wrapping up our consolidated results  our third quarter diluted weighted average shares were  180 million  a decrease of 8  year over year  During the quarter we completed approximately  500 million of share repurchases  bringing our year to date total share repurchases to  1 9 billion  As a result we now expect diluted weighted average shares of approximately  183 million for the year Next  I ll review our segment results  which can be found on Slides 5 through 8  Before I start with my review of the segments  including updated full year guidance  I want to reiterate that we provide full year guidance and do not provide quarterly guidance  As a reminder  there are a number of items  particularly in our largest segment  US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions that can cause fluctuations on a quarter to quarter basis  While  this can make comparing year over year results on a quarterly basis difficult  these items do tend to balance out over the course of the year  These items include customer volumes  customer and product mix  brand price increases and the timing of discrete tax items  We anticipate that there could be additional fluctuation in our fourth quarter results Let me now start with US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions  Revenues were  46 9 billion for the quarter  up 6  driven by branded pharmaceutical price increases and continued growth by our largest retail national customers  partially offset by branded to generic conversions  Third quarter adjusted operating profit increased 11  to  658 million  primarily driven by the execution and growth in our differentiated portfolio of specialty businesses As I mentioned earlier  there were two discrete items included in our prior year third quarter results  a  60 million pre tax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko and a pre tax benefit of approximately  70 million related to the reversal of accrued New York State Opioid Stewardship Act charges  If you adjust for these two prior year items  the segment adjusted operating profit was up 3 5  year over year in the quarter Also as a reminder  this is the final quarter in which we are lapping the effects of the loss Shopko earnings  which was approximately  8 million per quarter in terms of operating profit  The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 140 basis points  an increase of 6 basis points  On a year to date basis  the segment adjusted operating profit is up 7   If you adjust for the prior year impact of the  60 million pre tax charge related to the bankruptcy of Shopko  and the prior year earnings contribution of approximately  24 million from three quarters of Shopko results  Segment adjusted operating profit increased 5  year to date For the third quarter  brand priced activity trended in line with our expectations  Additionally  based on manufacturer price actions taken in January  we are maintaining our full year fiscal 2020 assumptions of brand price increases to be in the mid single digit percent range  I would remind you that our branded pharmaceutical contracts are primarily fixed fee for service rate in nature  And as a result  our compensation with branded manufacturers is less impacted by price increases  when compared to several years ago  To wrap up the segment given the underlying strength in the quarter and the year to date performance  we have confidence that segment adjusted operating profit growth will be on the high end of the previously provided range of 3  to 5  growth for fiscal 2020 Next European Pharmaceutical Solutions  revenues were  6 9 billion for the quarter  which was flat year over year  On an FX adjusted basis  revenues increased 3   driven primarily by market growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business  Segment adjusted operating profit was up 16  to  80 million  driven in part by lower operating expenses as a result of actions previously taken to rationalize store footprint and streamline back office functions  The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 116 basis points on a constant currency basis  an increase of 16 points Moving now to Medical Surgical Solutions  revenues were  2 1 billion for the quarter  which was up 6   driven by organic growth led by the primary care business including higher pharmaceutical volumes and in earlier start to the influenza season  Segment adjusted operating profit for the quarter was  up 8  to  184 million  driven by organic growth  The segment adjusted operating margin rate was 859 basis points  an increase of 14 basis points Year to date  the segment adjusted operating profit growth is 18  as a result of the organic growth in this segment year to date  we now anticipate that the segment adjusted operating profit for fiscal 2020 will increase by a low double digit percent year over year  In finishing our business review with other  revenues were  3 2 billion for the quarter  which was up 6   driven primarily by organic growth in the Canadian wholesale business  Other adjusted operating profit was down 4  to  214 million in part driven by higher strategic product investment in our Prescription Technology Solutions business or MRXTS  partially offset by growth in our Canadian wholesale business Closing our segment review with Change Healthcare  Adjusted equity income from Change Healthcare was  51 million for the quarter  As a reminder  our equity investment ownership in Change Healthcare was approximately 58 5  in our fiscal third quarter 2020  as compared to 70  in the prior year  As Brian mentioned earlier registration statements were filed this morning with the SEC disclosing our intention to exit our investment in Change Healthcare via an exchange offer  This is the next step in the process to exit our investment in a tax efficient manner  I direct you to today s filing for additional information Next McKesson recorded a  178 million in adjusted corporate expenses  which was an increase of 29  year over year  driven primarily by planned technology investment  which included investments in data and analytic capabilities  For the third quarter  we reported net opioid related adjusted operating expenses of  36 billion and year to date  108 million  For fiscal 2020  we continue to anticipate that opioid related costs will approximately be  150 million We continue to make solid progress against our cost savings programs  which include a focus on our core operating expenses by leveraging the scale of our enterprise and the continued transformation of back office functions  We remain on track with our previously announced annual pre tax savings of  400 to  500 million  which is anticipated to be substantially delivered by the end of fiscal 2021 As we ve discussed a portion of these savings will be reinvested back into the business in line with our growth initiatives and the remaining will flow to the bottom line  As a result of our performance year to date  we now anticipate adjusted corporate expenses to be in the range of  660 million to  700 million Now that I ve wrapped up our results  let me discuss our updated fiscal 2020 outlook  We feel really good about our steady execution throughout fiscal 2020  The recent narrowing an increase to our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of  14 60 to  14 80 reflects the following  solid core performance in our US Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment  driven by continued strength across our differentiated portfolio of Specialty businesses  organic growth in our Medical Surgical segment  improved second half performance in our European segment  as compared to the prior year  lower corporate expenses and originally anticipated and a lower share count as a result of share repurchase activity year to date This solid performance was partially mitigated by continued planned investments and strategic initiatives  including incremental second half investment in our differentiated oncology in manufacturer services businesses  investment in our technology products and investment in technology infrastructure  including data and analytics  We remain confident that we are well positioned to execute in our fourth quarter Turning now to cash  which can be found on Slide 10  We ended the quarter with a cash balance of  2 1 billion  in the quarter McKesson used  121 million of cash flow from operations  after deducting  154 million in internal capital investments the customer had negative free cash flow of  275 million  I would remind you that our working capital metrics and resulting cash flow may be impacted by timing  including the day of the week that marks the close to the given quarter  it is not uncommon to experience net cash    net use of cash during our fiscal third quarter  primarily driven by the build in inventory for the holiday season In our fiscal fourth quarter  we typically generate more than two thirds of our annual operating cash flow  During the quarter  we repurchased approximately  500 million of common stock  We ve now repurchased approximately  1 9 billion in common stock for the first nine months of the fiscal year  The repurchase of our common stock underpins our belief that McKesson shares are undervalued combined with the confidence in our execution and our outlook  we view this as a prudent use of capital For the first nine months of the fiscal year  McKesson paid  97 million for acquisition and  222 million in dividends  We now expect internal capital investments to be in the range of  500 million to  600 million  we continue to anticipate free cash flow in the range of  2 8 billion to  3 billion In closing  we are pleased with the solid operational results of our fiscal third quarter and our performance year to date  we will build on our third quarter performance and we remain confident in our business as we focus on a strong finish to the year  which is reflected in our expected adjusted earnings per diluted share range of  14 60 to  14 80 for fiscal 2020  As I look at our performance over the past several quarters and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal  20  it clearly demonstrates focus and execution against our strategy  as well as continued steady improvement in our financial results With that  I ll turn the call over to the operator for your questions  In the interest of time I ask you to limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow up to allow others an opportunity to participate  Operator Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen  Your line is open Charles Rhyee    Cowen   Company    AnalystYes  Thanks for taking the question  Maybe Brian I can start with the    just on opioids real quickly  What are the remaining points that are being negotiated  You kind of said that the negotiates are going well or it seems to be progressing and some of the points are being resolved  Maybe you can give a sense of what are some of the remaining kind of sticking points  perhaps  And if I understand correctly  the framework is being discussed among    was being led by four state attorney general  During these kind of discussions are we    other constituents let s say the other states or some of the bigger municipalities that are in this lawsuit or part of this of multidistrict litigation  Are they able to sort of see the progress  as well and understand what is being negotiated  so that when we get to maybe a final framework  the process for them to review and to accept is kind of in tandem or is that    or is this kind of being done close    kind of  a close session and then opened up later Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerThank you for the question  Charles  And I think the way you framed the question  naming the number of parties or counterparties or folks involved in this discussion helps to frame why it s moving at the cadence that it s moving  We do continue to be in constructive dialog with the AGs  The AGs have broadened their group and they continue to talk among themselves The good news from my perspective is the basic framework that we ve laid out is still the framework that s being discussed and the details for the many component parts of that are progressing well  There is still a long way to go with regard to ultimately getting as broad of AG support as we can  and then AGs themselves going to their subdivisions and extending that broad support  So there is a lot of work that is ongoing  The discussions are really continuous  it d be too early for me to try to project a timeline or where the finish line might be  but I am pleased that the framework that we ve been negotiating continues to be the framework  the details are progressing and I think you    as we get through the coming months we ll begin to assess what the various AG and sub municipality just positions are Charles Rhyee    Cowen   Company    AnalystGreat  If I could have a follow up just on the core business  obviously you increased your outlook on the core Pharmaceutical segment here  you know  it s seems a lot of things are moving in the right direction  Is there anything you d point to specifically that is going to driving the improved outlook here  Thank you Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I ll start  and then Britt might want to offer a few comments  I mean  I think if you think about the general kind of industry fundamentals  The brand price inflation has been in line with where we thought it would be  the generic market is continuing to behave in a way that we had forecast  and then by that I mean our sourcing  our skilled sourcing entity continues to produce are in line with our anticipation  We are going in the market with a very disciplined approach  reflective of the transition  our industry has been in  And we think that the competitive    the sell side in the generics market remained stable  I mean  it s competitive and there s pressures  but it s stable I think we re seeing the benefits of a lot of the work and planning that we ve been    the last several quarters  we ve been executing and implementing  And so combining that I think with the market fundamentals and our really good positions in specialty is driving the results that you see Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMaybe I might just add  I think Brian you hit on it here  The focus and our execution against our differentiated assets particularly specialty and you talked a lot about that  I think is really driving a lot of this  And then I would just reiterate that our cost programs are really driving not only in our corporate line  but also across our segment and so that focus is not only on our core set of differentiated assets  but just the discipline and focus around cost for us not only our corporate segments  but our business segments Charles Rhyee    Cowen   Company    AnalystOkay  thank you Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Charles OperatorAnd next will be Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies Brian Tanquilut    Jefferies    AnalystHi  good morning and congrats on a good quarter  So I guess the question for me  as I think about Brian  you talked about the execution  and how are you guys seem really positive about it  So how do you think about the runway remaining in specialty as we head into fiscal   21 without going into guidance  specifically  And just how you re looking at the volume outlook from the key accounts  because it sounds like that s a volume driver that s been driving some upside as well  Thanks Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean  we re really pleased with our specialty businesses  we talked a few weeks ago about  you know  the  core  the distribution of these products to hospitals and retail pharmacies is being our biggest segment  clearly we benefit there from the growth that these products have just in general and the pipeline  If you look at the pipeline of the innovative products coming they tend to look that way and as you know and we ve got established scaled channels across both of these segments  And then if you think about the community setting  oncology we have a clear leading stake we re a leader in many of the other multi specialties settings  they re going to benefit from that same pipeline And I also think  if you step up from a more macro view  if you think about the challenges that the cost of healthcare represent in this country  We have a fundamental belief that to get access  cost and quality  care needs to continue to shift in just their community based settings  So that s where our community provider business  I think from a macro standpoint is well positioned  And then our US oncology business we have particular depth and strength in oncology and if you look at the pipeline there that continues to be strong  So I would say  all of those things are what are giving us our confidence  but at the bottom    at the end of the day  it s really the execution of the business that led to capitalize on those macro trends and opportunities Brian Tanquilut    Jefferies    AnalystI guess my follow up Britt  you mentioned the cost cuts and the opportunities that you ve found there  So do you think there is a lot of runway left as we think about cost opportunities both in the corporate side and also on the operation side Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOur cost program  Brian  What we talked about we would capture these cost savings at the end of fiscal  21  So we re still making progress not only in leveraging the scale of our enterprise across all of our business units  But some of the things that we ve talked about previously in terms of back office function  transformation  and there s still opportunities there as  you know  the size of our enterprise allows us to continue to work across and collaborate and drive additional cost synergies So I would say that  that program as we talked about is    we expect it to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal  21  However  as the business grows and our focus on execution in specialty continues there are still opportunities for us to leverage our scale and transform our back office functions Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerI mean  efficiency    the core part of the way you have to run a business like this at this scale  So it is a program that we implemented a few years ago  but most importantly to me it s a mindset  it s part of the way we think about how we manage and run the business Brian Tanquilut    Jefferies    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorAnd next will be Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  thanks for the questions  I guess just to go back to the segment guidance and specifically the US Pharma segment  it seems like if I look at what s implied with 4Q  at the high end it seems like you re kind of calling for year over year flat EBIT there in that segment  I know there s a number of moving pieces Britt  But maybe could you just help us think about what the major swing factors are in 4Q  because you guys highlighted the business there in particular specialty seems to be performing well and there s some momentum  but it seems like 4Q you re implying at least the things could potentially slow a bit  So just want to make sure we had the moving pieces there correctly Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Sure  Bob  that s    you re right about the implied  What I would just going back to end point out is that I ve talked about in the business  the size of ours with customers that are growing and you have mix that is changing in terms of customer and product mix  We are going to see fluctuations from quarter to quarter  We ve seen that historically  I think we re seeing that a little bit more this year some of our larger retail national customers are growing a little bit faster  And I think  what we re pleased with though  as Brian talked about there s some stability in the pricing environment  particularly with branded pricing certainly continue to see good progress against generics But what you should expect as I talked about at the beginning is that we are going to see some items that are going to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  We don t manage our business that way  we manage our business for the long haul  we look at our business on an annual basis and these items do tend to balance out over the course of the year  We re very pleased that we started the year with being able to guide back to growth in this segment  And we re very pleased that given the momentum and the execution that Brian talked about particularly in our specialty business we could raise that guidance today to the upper end  So we re making good progress  but I think you should expect to continue to see some fluctuation in our quarterly results Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThat s fair  And then I guess  Brian  you opened the door to a little bit of preliminary 2021 thoughts  and so I know we ll get more detail in May  But if I heard you correctly  it sounds like court drivers playing out in line this year with your expectations  you guys have highlighted the VA is not a material headwind sounds like cost savings will continue  it could be a benefit from capital allocation  you know  all have seem pretty neutral to tailwinds  Is there any major headwinds  you would have us start to contemplate as we start to think about framing 2021 more specifically well Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerWell  look  as    as we come to May  we ll try to be very thoughtful and share with you our view of the thinking  If I think about what could materialize as headwinds  I mean  the policy arena has been dynamic  Well  probably for most of my career  but certainly for my tenure as CEO  And yet while the clouds always seem to be gathering nothing has really materialize  I would suspect we ll hear some commentary tonight  I think as we come into the face of election year we ll be evaluating not only the policy proposals  but the politics that s around    that sort of set the framework for the likelihood of any of that really getting done  But to me that s just that s a normal part of being in healthcare  a normal part of being in this business I think our European business  it s coming off of a good quarter  but our experience there particularly in the NHS  as been challenges around being    having good line of sight into how the reimbursement mechanisms really play out  And so while we re encouraged that we have a five year macro agreement with NHS for the pharmacy community there  I think underneath the nuances of the timing and the different mechanisms that make up that framework  we ll have to continue to monitor and evaluate  So  I mean those are the two things that first pop to mind  Anything you want to add Britt Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think you ve captured them correctly  Brian OperatorAnd next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan Lisa Gill    JPMorgan    AnalystGood morning  Brian  I just want to follow up on that last point  as you talk about the policy arena  Clearly  specialty has been a growth area  you ve talked the whole call about specialty  What are your thoughts around IPI and what it could mean to your specialty business And then secondly  as we think about the European markets  what have you learned from the European markets where it is a fixed cost environment versus here in the US Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerGreat  Thanks  Lisa  I ll take the IPI business first    the question first  So IPI is    I guess there s been a lot of different constructs around getting to Part B  there s been discussions of caps or limiting ASP rates  future caps on allowable inflation  IPI would be a proposal to index what the US pays based on a basket of internationally referenced prices for various products  And I think there s even been some debate or discussion around MFN  our most favored nation  type clauses  So the proposals have really been very wide in the spectrum and without commenting on any of them specifically  I would say  first and foremost  we think any reform in Part B should be constructed and we work with industry  the government and our partners to advocate for this in a way that pushes care into the community  It s clearly the low cost  high access setting  and we believe it has extremely high quality as well  So it kind of hits all the three macro principles And so anything    any reform that were to happen  in our view should move care to the community  Anything that would move the opposite way would be counterproductive  really  for the US spend on healthcare in general  Now relative to IPI  if something were to occur the way I think about this is in most instances  in our core pharma distribution  in our community provider setting  This is an implication to our customer  so it will be a secondary effect really from a wholesaler perspective  The one place we would have some exposure would be in the US Oncology Network  where I remind you  through our partnership we share in the practice economics  So we continue to watch this very closely  I m not sure there has been a proposal that s had more commentary and more aligned commentary to kind of come out against it  because of the impact potentially the patients and patient access and cost of care  But I suppose we ll see what we hear tonight Lisa Gill    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat  And then just my follow up  I just    Britt  you talked about the change exit as being one of the key component to 2021  And you said it s consistent with what you ve said before  Can you just remind us what you ve said before on the timeline of the exit Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Lisa  So what we ve said previously  dating back to our Q2 earnings call from that point in time  we would expect to exit our transaction in six to 12 months  although that it could be before the end of our fiscal 2020  So I would reiterate that language today OperatorAnd next will be Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYes  Hi  good morning  I have a follow up question on the cost cutting initiative  I think you reduced your corporate expense guidance by about  45 million  So part of it is flow through of cost savings to the bottom line and some timing of investments  By our calculations  it s about  0 18 to the EPS  So as we think about the ongoing benefit of cost cutting  can we just  kind of  like run rate that  45 million that you saw in the fourth quarter Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Let me answer that  Ricky  Certainly  we are pleased with the progress that we re making against our cost initiatives  And I d reiterate that we expect to generate  400 to  500 million of savings by the end of  21  So the cost programs are ongoing  As I called out at the beginning of the year  there were some additional investments that we were going to be making  particularly in the areas of information security management and data and analytics  We are continuing to make those investments  but we re seeing good efficiency across the organization  So I don t think you can necessarily take our performance this quarter and just run it out  We re continuing to make investments in the business  but we re also continuing along getting the efficiencies from scale in some of the back office functions  So we wanted to do today was to update our guidance based on some of the benefits that we ve seen in performance and execution  but we re continuing to make investments along as we generate those savings Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And then one follow up on Change  I mean  obviously  I understand that the exit is tax efficient  But can you just remind us directionally  kind of  like the mechanics  Should we expect Change    what should we expect in terms of impact  would it be neutral to EPS accretive or dilutive  And same  how should we think about  just directionally  the impact to cash Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So let me just remind you that today is a filing that is another step along our exit  We have nothing that is included in our FY 20 guidance related to Change  So there s no additional information that I can provide you on that  And in terms of when we exit  spending on    regardless of how we exit  there ll be no cash impact OperatorAnd next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore Elizabeth Anderson    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  good morning guys  I guess with a broader long term picture on the specialty side  How do we think about the    like  the ramp up in sort of additional specialty services you re providing  particularly on the US Oncology side  but maybe also in the core business and sort of    are there sort of key moments that cause either providers or other customers to sort of take up that services  Is it something gradual  I just sort of looking for like a longer term vision of that Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerYes  it s a great question and it s obviously an area that we have some excitement about  And we have spent  really  a good part of the last 10 or 15 years building out some through internal development and some through acquisition  a set of capabilities that are really oriented around helping manufacturers identify which patients are appropriate and should be benefiting from their therapy  finding those patients and getting them started on that therapy  and then ensuring that they stay on that therapy through the full clinically appropriate course  so that they can get the best possible outcome So the first good news in that is that the patient gets the best outcome and we think it s good for the patient  it s good for the healthcare system  Obviously for our biopharma partners that can result in more patients benefiting from their products that has obvious benefit to them and that s a service therefore  they re quite interested in paying us for it  So as we think about building off of really our 20 year experience in this marketplace  building off of the sets of assets that we ve acquired for the commercialization of these products  there is opportunities to both refine and deepen and develop the tools we offer today  A few weeks ago  I shared an example of a program like that we re calling Access for More Patients  which fundamentally is getting at the same issue  but it s doing it in a more automated  efficient way that lets us get more    find more patients and get them on those therapies faster As we look at that as a core we think there are opportunities to extend downstream and to get earlier stage services to support pharmaceuticals and as we think about some of our provider segments there is opportunity to do some integration with providers downstream  So this is an area that we think as you look at the pipeline  as you look at the products  as you look at what s happening in terms of  you know  in the clinical trial space and the fragmentation of populations  that there s going to continue to be a good opportunity here for McKesson Elizabeth Anderson    Evercore ISI    AnalystPerfect  That s really helpful  Thank you OperatorAnd next will be Eric Coldwell with Baird Eric Coldwell    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThanks  good morning  So maybe just focus on the Med Surg segment for a second  you ve mentioned the early flu season consistent with peers  I m curious  if you could carve out for us what you think the incremental benefit of early flu was or heavy flu  And then I know it s probably a bit early and maybe evolving situation  but coronavirus any issues with sourcing out of the Asia Pac region or pricing changes  demand changes in the US as maybe some facilities pre stock on certain gloves  gowns  masks etc  Just any questions on    or answers on coronavirus impact so far would be interesting  Thanks so much Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Eric  This is Britt  I ll take the first one and let Brian comment on the second  As I talked about in my remarks we re really pleased with the performance of the medical business  We had good organic growth really across our business  but primarily in our primary care business  And I also called out higher pharmaceutical volumes as one of the drivers  We did see some modest impact from early flu season  I would remind you  though  that typically the flu season has a larger impact on our fourth quarter than our third quarter  We did plan the year for a normal flu season  So we saw a little earlier start than we had anticipated  But again  I would just remind you that the strong core organic growth across our primary care business  which is inclusive of higher pharmaceutical volumes  was really the driver for the performance Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerI ll take the coronavirus  Maybe before that  we ve been around this business for a long time  And we chart every year with the flu season    influenza season looks like in the US and every season is it s own    has its own cycle or rhythm  if you will  And so I think we    it s fair to say we have seen an early start ultimately how that plays out will depend on the duration and the severity  and it s probably hard to predict that right now Relative to coronavirus  I guess let me start by first saying our thoughts and sympathies go out to those particularly in China  but really Asia that are obviously dealing with this in a very real time way  We at McKesson have really been working across industry partners  peers  trade associations  government agencies for the better part of three or four weeks  so we try to jump on these things early and get ahead of them  And so we re monitoring this very  very closely  I would remind everybody that we don t manufacture these products  we procure them  we sell them and we distribute them  And we do have a domestic supplier base  although the majority of the products  the masks and the disinfectants and the gowns  are sourced from Asia or China I guess  fortunately or unfortunately  depending on your perspective we ve had some experience with SARS and H1N1  And so what we re doing is implementing the protocols  the monitoring capabilities that we ve built up through these prior experiences and working in close coordination with government agencies and industry partners to make sure we can keep this continuity of supply  Now whether    what that ultimately looks like depends really on how does the virus continue to proliferate  Does it stay contained in a region  And so those are things that we just have to watch  But we wake up every day thinking about the markets that we serve and how we make sure we have product available for our customers that operate in those markets OperatorAnd next will be Michael Cherny with BofA Securities Michael Cherny    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks so much for taking the question  I guess a lot of key topics have been asked  The one thing that did stand out  you highlighted the recent success of    on the transaction side  medical really rocking it  pretty low so far from an acquisition perspective  at least in terms of your historical spend year to date  As you re heading into fiscal  21 as you re getting rid of the Change position on the balance sheet and the ownership stake as you think forward of the portfolio  are there any macro trends that you think would drive some areas for opportunities for you to go and drive inorganic growth  Or anything from a broader picture perspective where your customers are really asking you to pursue an area that you may not be in or in a strong as you would like to be right now Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerGreat  great question  I think we probably  if you think    look back over the past few years  we came through a cycle of pretty heavy M A as we really bolstered some of the capabilities and assets that we thought surrounded our specialty biopharma manufacturer value prop and our oncology business or ecosystem  however you want to think about that  And as we ve done the work to integrate those  and it s a lot of work to integrate these things and to integrate them properly  In parallel  we ve really been refining our strategies and if you ve heard me    you ve probably heard me say this before all good M A follows a good strategy  And so as we put this strategy together  we ve identified the areas that we think we have differentiated capabilities  in markets that have good overall growth prospects  So when I think about capital deployment  so we ve obviously got to deploy capital to be invested in efficiency and compliant and safe  secure always on environments And then the second area we d look forward to growth  But those growth investments  meaning M A investments have to be closely aligned to the strategy  and I think that  that s what you should expect of us  So we like growth investments  we like growth capital either extend our capabilities or add scale to the places that we have capabilities  And what we always have to balance    I would say  your strategy can t be based on M A  because it takes a buyer and a seller that take a price that you can agree on  So as we ve looked at the market and looked at those trade offs  obviously the past 12 months or so  we ve been favoring to deploy our capital to buy back our shares  because we think those are a great investment  but we continue to be very active in looking for areas  we can inorganically help support the growth OperatorAnd next will be Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research Stephen Baxter    Wolfe Research    AnalystHi  thanks for the question  So wanted to ask about the generics business  I mean  you guys have been very clear that gross profit is growing here  and that appears to be a pretty different result than the rest of the industry  So from a macro point of view  it looks to us like the broader market is relatively flat  I was hoping to better understand what s driving your growth here in bigger picture terms  Are you growing generic revenue against the backdrop of stable margins  stable revenue with improving margins  really any color you can add on how you re achieving this results  so we can better assess sustainability going forward would be appreciated  Thank you Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  I ll start  and certainly Brian can add on  As we ve talked about previously  we re really pleased with a couple of dimensions that lead    that are around our generic business  First of all  we have a scaled and efficient sourcing operation  We think we source as well as anybody  and we continue to find opportunities from a sourcing perspective  We continue to be disciplined in a stable yet competitive environment  We think that  that is lead    those dynamics are leading to our ability to generate gross profit growth  We are seeing some growth in units and when you combine that with a scaled and stable sourcing operation and disciplined approach in a competitive  but stable market we think that those are dynamics that are really helping us be very successful in the generics area Holly Weiss    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOperator  we have time for one more question OperatorCertainly  that question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research  Your line is open Eric Percher    Nephron Research    AnalystThank you  Quick one on Europe  Loud and clear on expense reduction and a little benefit from the UK helping the uptick this quarter on op profit  Is it correct that the German business has not been moved to discontinued ops  So is that still flowing through and at some point  would we see that a benefit or may be a loss might be removed from that segment when the JV is struck or approved Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Eric  It is true  we have not moved it to discontinued operations as it doesn t qualify for discontinued operations  I did talk about a GAAP only charge that we took in the quarter and we have the assets as held for sale on our balance sheet Eric Percher    Nephron Research    AnalystOkay  And  can you state anything on whether that is in a loss position Britt Vitalone    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI d just go back to my comments in terms of the loss that we recorded from a capital perspective in the quarter of  282 million Brian S  Tyler    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Well  I think that runs us out of time  I want to thank everyone for your great questions and your continued interest in McKesson  I want to thank Jack for facilitating this call  To conclude McKesson continue to execute well in the third quarter and we remain confident in our fiscal 2020 outlook  I m extremely proud of how our employees are embracing the team McKesson culture and I want to thank them for everything they do day in and day out  not only to deliver these results  but most importantly to improve care in every setting we serve  Thanks again for your interest in McKesson  we will release fourth quarter earnings results in early May

127639,349154,MCK,U S  regions hard hit by opioids to ditch class action  pursue own lawsuits,news,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON  Del Reuters    Local governments in regions hard hit by the U S  opioid epidemic have opted out of massive litigation taking aim at the drug industry over the crisis  potentially weakening a novel legal mechanism created to help settle thousands of lawsuits 
Overall  98  of some 34 000 local governments agreed to be bound by a class action against companies such as drug distributor McKesson Corp  N MCK   drugmaker Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  and pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  O WBA   according to a Monday court filing 
However  the 541 local governments that opted out included Florida s Palm Beach County and counties in West Virginia  according to attorneys  raising the prospect that companies could face expensive trials even if they settled with the class  The two regions are among the hardest hit by the crisis  which has contributed to more than 400 000 deaths since 1997 
Officials from Houston s Harris County  one of the largest U S  counties  have said it would opt out  meaning they would pursue their own lawsuit and not receive funds from a nationwide settlement 
The court filing did not identify opt outs 
U S  Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland  who has been overseeing 2 600 consolidated opioid lawsuits  is pushing hard for a settlement to help get funds to those most in need in a timely fashion  He approved the novel  negotiation class  as a way to reassure companies that any deal to resolve the lawsuits would bind remaining governments and prevent them from filing a case 
The lawsuits generally allege that drugmakers improperly marketed opioids while distributors and pharmacy chains failed to stop suspicious orders  The defendants deny the allegations 
Typical class actions allow members to opt out after a settlement has been reached  but the negotiation class fixes the members first  Any settlement must be approved by 75  of the class 
Lawyers said towns and counties less affected by the crisis had little reason to opt out  while areas ravaged by opioids  like West Virginia  had more incentive to pursue and control their own lawsuit 
The number of opt outs represented around 20  of those that have already sued and could be significant if it included large cities  according to Elizabeth Burch  a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law 
 If I m trying to negotiate with a town of 80  that s very different from Houston   she said 
The negotiation class was opposed by some state attorneys general and drug distributors  and faces a legal challenge at the 6th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ",2019-12-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-regions-hard-hit-by-opioids-to-ditch-class-action-pursue-own-lawsuits-2032839,2032839

127642,349157,MCK,Is McKesson  MCK  A Profitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put McKesson Corporation   NYSE MCK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks  PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole  On this front  McKesson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 08  as you can see in the chart below   This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 79  If we focus on the long term PE trend  McKesson s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 27 over the past five years   Further  the stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Medical Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 54  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that McKesson has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 68  which is lower than the current PE level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for McKesson stock in the near term too  P S Ratio Another key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  McKesson has a P S ratio of about 0 13  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 59x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  McKesson currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes McKesson a solid choice for value investors  What About the Stock Overall  Though McKesson might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives MCK a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been bullish  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower  while the full year estimate has seen six up and no down in the same time period  This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 1 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it is the reason why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term  Bottom Line McKesson is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 37  of 255 industries   a Zacks Rank  2 instils investors  optimism in the stock  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below   We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry rank and performance  a good Zacks rank and bullish analyst sentiments signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in McKesson  Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020 In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold tickers for the entirety of 2020

127663,349178,MCK,McKesson  MCK  Q2 Earnings Meet Estimates,opinion,"McKesson  MCK  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 60 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  3 60 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this prescription drug distributor would post earnings of  3 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 31  delivering a surprise of 8 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
McKesson  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  posted revenues of  57 62 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 88   This compares to year ago revenues of  53 08 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
McKesson shares have added about 35 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 1  
What s Next for McKesson 
While McKesson has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for McKesson was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 39 on  57 90 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 40 on  223 43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

127683,349198,MCK,McKesson  MCK  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of McKesson  MCK  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 4 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  152 53 in the previous session  McKesson has gained 37 8  since the start of the year compared to the 0 3  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 2 5  return for the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 31  2019  McKesson reported EPS of  3 31 versus consensus estimate of  3 04 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 26  
For the current fiscal year  McKesson is expected to post earnings of  14 39 per share on  223 43 billion in revenues  This represents a 6 04  change in EPS on a 4 25  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  15 53 per share on  232 19 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 92  and 3 92   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
McKesson may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
McKesson has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are D and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 10 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 5 1X versus its peer group s average of 11 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 52  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  McKesson currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if McKesson passes the test  Thus  it seems as though McKesson shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mckesson-mck-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200475683,200475683

127698,349213,MCK,Special Report  How judges added to the grim toll of opioids,news,"By Benjamin Lesser  Dan Levine  Lisa Girion and Jaimi Dowdell WELCH  West Virginia  Reuters    The opioid epidemic that has so far killed half a million Americans is routinely blamed on greedy drug makers  feckless doctors and lax regulators  But there s another group that has contributed to the depth and duration of the catastrophe  judges  Judges like Booker T  Stephens  Until his retirement in May  Stephens sat on the West Virginia Circuit Court in Welch  deep in Appalachian coal country  where addiction took early root among miners who were prescribed the blockbuster opioid OxyContin for the pain their jobs inflicted  And it was in his court where the first lawsuit filed by a state against OxyContin s maker  Purdue Pharma LP  landed in 2001  West Virginia accused Purdue of duping doctors into widely prescribing the drug by minimizing its risks  convincing them it was less addictive than other opioids because just one dose delivered steady relief for 12 hours  In the pretrial  discovery  phase of the case  Purdue sent thousands of pages of internal memos  notes from sales calls on doctors  marketing plans and other records to the state s lawyers who had requested them  That evidence was clearly compelling  In a 2004 ruling  Judge Stephens rejected Purdue s motion that he dismiss the case and sided with the state s assertion that the material could convince a jury that Purdue s sales pitch was full of dangerous lies  But Stephens sealed the evidence on which he relied in that ruling  And when Purdue and the state reached a settlement that year  before the case went to trial  the evidence remained hidden  out of sight to regulators  doctors and patients  Over the next few years  as OxyContin sales and opioid related deaths climbed  more than a dozen other judges overseeing similar lawsuits against Purdue took the same tack  keeping the company s records secret  It would be 12 years   and 245 000 overdose deaths   before evidence Stephens and other judges kept hidden was made public  and then only after it was leaked to a newspaper   What it showed was revelatory  OxyContin  the first billion dollar a year narcotic  was not the reliable 12 hour painkiller Purdue long claimed it was  Its effects often wore off much sooner  exposing patients to a relapse of pain  withdrawal  or both   suffering relieved only by the next pill  When doctors raised concerns  the documents showed  Purdue sales reps counseled them to put patients on bigger  more dangerous doses  The eventual release of the evidence reinforced the widely held view that OxyContin was a catalyst for the epidemic  which by then had expanded beyond prescription opioids to include illicit drugs such as heroin  The material also informed hundreds of new lawsuits seeking to force accountability on the entire opioid industry for its role in the addiction crisis  But for untold numbers of opioid users who had overdosed  it was too late   Heartbreaking and sickening  is how Congresswoman Katherine Clark  a Massachusetts Democrat who has been involved in investigating the causes of the opioid epidemic  described the early decisions to seal the Purdue evidence  In an interview  Clark said she believes that had the secrets come out earlier  doctors would have written fewer OxyContin prescriptions and fewer insurers would have covered the drug   We don t know how many lives we could have saved   she said  Stephens told Reuters he doesn t second guess his decision   It happened  and that s all that I can say about it   he said   It speaks for itself   CONTINUING THE TRADITION Today  15 years after Stephens protected Purdue s secrets  Federal Judge Dan Polster is providing the same cover for multiple opioid makers  distributors and retailers  He is presiding over a mass of litigation that seeks to hold the entire industry responsible for the epidemic  Life saving information contained in those cases  too  may remain under seal  as Polster has stuck to a strict secrecy playbook  Polster declined to comment for this article  The trail of hidden evidence running through the opioid crisis is emblematic of a pervasive and deadly secrecy that shrouds product liability cases in U S  courts  enabled by judges who routinely allow the makers of those products to keep information pertinent to public health and safety under wraps  And since nearly all such cases are resolved before trial  the evidence often remains secret indefinitely  robbing consumers of the chance to make informed choices and regulators of opportunities to improve safety  In an unprecedented analysis  Reuters found that over the past 20 years  judges sealed evidence relevant to public health and safety in about half of the 115 biggest defective product cases consolidated before federal judges in so called multidistrict litigation  or MDLs  Those cases comprised nearly 250 000 individual death and injury lawsuits  involving dozens of products used by millions of consumers  drugs  cars  medical devices and other products  And the numbers don t convey the full extent of information locked away because they don t include thousands of product liability cases heard in state courts  The impact is broad  Although secrecy makes complete analysis impossible  Reuters found that hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly defective products after judges in just a handful of cases allowed litigants to file under seal  beyond public view  evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger  For example  beginning in the early 1980s  judge after judge kept under seal evidence that the trigger on Remington Arms Co s Remington 700 hunting rifle was prone to misfiring  In 2014  after decades of secrecy  a judge presiding over a class action lawsuit in Missouri refused to seal the trove of documents  which showed that the company had been aware of the defective trigger since the late 1940s  By then  nearly 200 people had died from accidental shootings blamed on the problem  The company then recalled the defective rifles  Thousands more people died in rollover accidents involving General Motors Co  NYSE GM  cars and trucks while judges agreed to hide records showing the company knew that reinforcing vehicle roofs would save lives  After a decade of lawsuits in which those records were kept secret  a Los Angeles judge released the information in 2004 at the request of plaintiffs who wanted to share it with regulators  In 2009  the federal government upgraded a decades old standard on roof strength  Remington declined to comment  In a statement emailed to Reuters  GM said   Advances in auto safety effectively addressed this concern many years ago   Also  it s fair for individuals or companies to be able to request that certain sensitive or personal information be safeguarded   THE LAW AND THE REALITY In fact  court records are presumed to be public as a matter of law  They can only be sealed for valid concerns about privacy  including personal medical records  and to protect company trade secrets  In most states and nearly all the 13 federal appellate circuits  judges are legally obliged to weigh any litigant s request that information be sealed against the broader public interest in making it public  They also must explain in the court record any decision in favor of secrecy  Judges incur no penalty for failing to do these things  In practice  secrecy has become so ingrained in the system that judges rarely question it  In 85 percent of the cases where Reuters found health and safety information under seal  judges provided no explanation for allowing the secrecy  Judge Stephens was bound by West Virginia law to weigh secrecy against transparency and provide in the court record his reasoning  Like many judges in his position  he did neither   This case was sealed because both sides agreed and asked me to seal it   he told Reuters  That reasoning explains why secrecy has become the norm  It makes things easier for everyone involved  Corporate lawyers want to protect their clients  reputations  Plaintiffs  lawyers want to avoid miring their clients  cases in lengthy courtroom wrangling over requests that filings be sealed or redacted  And judges want to keep the business of justice moving  Secrecy is amplified by the growing practice of consolidating similar lawsuits under a single judge  MDLs  which now cover as much as 40 percent of all lawsuits filed in federal courts  are meant to promote efficient resolutions  Each decision the judge makes applies to all of the consolidated lawsuits  Thus  with one sealing order  a judge can impose secrecy in thousands of cases  That is now happening in federal district court in Ohio  where Judge Polster is managing nearly 2 000 lawsuits filed against the opioid industry  Cities and counties across the country claim that companies up and down the supply chain   drug makers like Johnson   Johnson s Janssen Pharmaceuticals subsidiary and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  Ltd  as well as Purdue  distributors like McKesson Corp  NYSE MCK   and retailers like  Walgreen Co   NASDAQ WBA    contributed to the public health disaster by using misleading marketing and other ruses to boost sales at the expense of public safety  So far  Polster has imposed a draconian secrecy on the proceedings  The judge  a former federal prosecutor confirmed to the bench in 1998  has given the litigants broad discretion to determine what records remain secret  As a result  entire lawsuits have been filed under seal in his court  including supporting evidence drawn from millions of records that detail the industry s conduct over two decades  All the companies have denied the allegations  Teva and McKesson declined to comment for this article  Walgreens did not respond to a request for comment  Janssen said its marketing of opioids was  appropriate and responsible   Privately held Purdue  controlled by the Sackler family  said that OxyContin  has been deemed safe and effective for 12 hour dosing   that it has always given the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  all information the agency requires  that protective orders are routine  and that any suggestion the company used court ordered secrecy to withhold relevant safety information about OxyContin is misleading and inflammatory  Purdue said it has spent more than  1 5 billion on efforts to solve the opioid crisis   These efforts  not the disclosure of Purdue s internal documents  will help solve the complex opioid abuse crisis   it said  A few states  including Texas and Florida  have adopted  sunshine  rules and laws that limit the sealing of health and safety records  At the federal level  corporate lobbying has stymied sunshine legislation for decades  Opponents of sunshine laws often cite a 1991 Harvard Law Review article in which New York University law professor Arthur Miller wrote that no hard evidence showed that court secrecy caused any harm to public health or safety   Research or statistical data is completely nonexistent   Miller wrote  In an interview  Miller said Reuters  analysis of court data helps fill that void and suggests that judges are not fulfilling their responsibility to guard the public interest   Certainly  anything relating to public health or things tied to social policy  you would want to have an explanation as to why something is sealed   he said   THAT S BANANAS  In the years following the Purdue case  Judge Stephens watched the wreckage of opioid addiction flow through McDowell County Circuit Court  burglaries  robberies  assaults  Thursdays in the hilltop courthouse in Welch were usually spent dealing with parents accused of child abuse and neglect  On one rainy Thursday last February  a clerk led a steady stream of mothers and fathers into Stephens s chambers  where he decided whether their children could remain with them   In almost every case  the parents are addicted   Stephens said later   We have parents who are now choosing drugs over their own children   When the state s suit against Purdue came before him in 2001  the cumulative U S  death toll from opioids since 1999 was 16 000  according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse  Stephens  who served for more than three decades on the McDowell County court before his May retirement  still counts it as his most high profile case  During the discovery process  each side was obliged to send information requested by the other   including the Purdue documents describing the company s development and marketing of OxyContin  That exchange is where secrecy gets its start in lawsuits  For decades  the rules of civil litigation required that evidence collected during discovery be logged with the court  open to public scrutiny  Secrecy was the exception  In the 1980s and 1990s  rule changes moved discovery out of the courthouse and thus out of public view  Instead  the material was to be swapped privately between the lawyers involved  Companies eager to keep their records confidential had pushed for the change  but it also served the interests of judges and court clerks inundated with increasingly complex product liability cases and huge caches of documents accompanying them  In the early 2000s  under the new discovery rules  Purdue s lawyers sent the company s documents directly to lawyers working for West Virginia  outside the court record and thus inaccessible to the public  This exchange occurred  as it almost always does  under the judge s protective order that the material remain confidential  Lawyers for Purdue filed a pretrial motion asking Judge Stephens to dismiss the case  West Virginia  to support its argument that the case should go to trial  submitted as evidence some of the documents Purdue had handed over in discovery  Such evidence entered into the court record to support a pretrial motion is generally the only way  short of a trial  that discovery material is made public   though that evidence often represents only a tiny fraction of what s produced in discovery  Here  too  secrecy prevailed  Lawyers for Purdue and the state agreed between themselves that the state would file its motion and supporting evidence under seal  Stephens did not evaluate the material to determine whether secrecy was warranted  as required by state law  and he provided no rationale   That s bananas   said Jennifer Oliva  a professor at West Virginia University College of Law   He s not allowed to do that without providing reasons   Judge Stephens was no rogue outlier  At least 16 other judges allowed internal documents produced by Purdue in lawsuits filed between 2001 and 2007 to be sealed without explanation  Court records make clear that evidence under seal pertained to Purdue s marketing  More broadly  in at least 31 of the 115 large federal product liability cases Reuters reviewed  judges sealed entire arguments that dealt directly with the strength of the evidence  Court rules frown on such broad sealing practices because truly confidential information rarely spans an entire legal brief  In most of those cases  nothing in the court record indicates that the judge conducted any analysis of whether secrecy was merited  Almost immediately after Stephens s 2004 ruling that the evidence against Purdue was sufficient for the case to proceed to trial  Purdue settled with West Virginia for  10 million  Stephens left his sealing order intact  The evidence was locked away in a vault in McDowell County Courthouse  By the end of that year  opioid deaths neared 65 000  Stephens told Reuters that he was simply honoring the litigants  wishes   Obviously when you settle a case of this magnitude and of this nature  Purdue Pharma would not want to let the world know they had engaged in deceptive marketing practices   he said  Frances Hughes  West Virginia s chief deputy attorney general at the time  said the state agreed to Purdue s sealing requests to get the evidence it needed and avoid a potentially lengthy court fight   We were doing something that is very much routine and necessary when you are involved in litigation with a major corporation   she said  Many plaintiffs  lawyers privy to evidence that could affect public health and safety told Reuters they had often employed a similar calculus  Bound by ethics rules to put their clients  interests first  they want access to records that can help their cases  Demanding transparency can cause protracted delays  Judges  while charged with guarding the public interest  also have large caseloads  At the federal level  their efficiency in handling those caseloads is measured by the Administrative Office of the U S  Courts  the federal judiciary s management agency  but judges aren t formally penalized for letting cases drag on  Many judges want to avoid getting bogged down in confidentiality battles  said Jeremy Fogel  who as a judge until last year managed the Federal Judicial Center in Washington  D C   an agency that helps educate judges   You re overburdened  You ve got limited bandwidth  You have lawyers fighting about everything  And so  when they finally agree on something  you re all too happy to accept that   said Fogel  now head of the Berkeley Judicial Institute at the University of California  As a result  he said   information that could have really made a difference sometimes doesn t come to light   LITTLE DATA  LITTLE SUNSHINE In the years following Stephens s ruling  Purdue benefited from the secrecy that had shrouded the West Virginia and similar cases  The U S  Department of Justice in 2007 brought criminal charges against Purdue  accusing it of lying in its marketing about how easy it was to abuse OxyContin by crushing the pills to get their full narcotic payload all at once  In a filing in federal court in Abingdon  Virginia  Purdue reasserted its 12 hour claim   When taken as directed  without tampering with the product s controlled release delivery system  OxyContin is indisputably safe and effective   Under a plea bargain  three Purdue executives admitted guilt but served no time  The company paid  600 million to resolve the case  The three executives later left the company  Company records that dribbled out over the years generated newspaper and government reports about aggressive sales tactics  But evidence undermining Purdue s claims about OxyContin remained locked away in courthouses across the country  And Purdue continued marketing its drug based on the contested 12 hour claim  OxyContin sales surged  topping  2 billion in 2008  Opioid deaths climbed to 135 000 by the end of 2008  The next year  Purdue s 80 milligram Oxycontin pill  the largest dose version  was the company s biggest moneymaker  That year  drugs   fueled by the spike in opioid overdoses   surpassed car accidents as a cause of death in the United States  By then  Mississippi lawyer Philip Thomas was trying to bring information about Purdue s marketing of OxyContin to the attention of regulators  Thomas represented Patricia Gwen Kiser  a nurse who alleged in a lawsuit against Purdue that her doctor had prescribed OxyContin for her fibromyalgia and arthritis pain based on the company s false claims about the drug s safety  Purdue turned over more than 250 boxes of records to Thomas  designating most of the evidence confidential  Thomas asked Purdue to share just 21 of the documents   emails  meeting minutes and the script Purdue asked sales reps to use when pitching OxyContin to doctors   with the FDA  Purdue declined  Thomas then asked Judge Linda Anderson  the judge hearing the case in federal court in Mississippi  to allow him to share the records with the regulator  Purdue resisted  arguing that the records were confidential trade secrets  Anderson  in a 2010 order  agreed with Purdue  Anderson did not respond to a request for comment  In its statement to Reuters  Purdue said it provided  all or most  of the documents to the agency  though they  do not contain the type of scientific information  the agency usually relies on  Some regulators have made efforts to counter the potential harm of court secrecy  In 2016  the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  issued guidance for judges on allowing exemptions in secrecy orders so that lawyers can share health and safety records with the agency  The Consumer Product Safety Commission followed suit  The FDA has not  In a statement to Reuters  the agency said the current regulatory regime gives it  the tools to keep patients and consumers safe   The year after NHTSA issued its guidance  the agency opened an investigation into possible safety defects in Goodyear tires on thousands of motor homes  In its December 2017 announcement  the agency said the inquiry  which is continuing  was made possible  in part  only after an Arizona judge allowed the release of the tire maker s records  including insurance claims and complaints data  Goodyear declined to comment  as did NHTSA  In the absence of such exceptions  lawyers or anyone else with knowledge of confidential evidence put themselves at risk if they share that information outside the confines of court  David Egilman was an expert witness in a lawsuit alleging Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY    Co s antipsychotic drug Zyprexa could cause excessive weight gain and diabetes  Egilman  a clinical professor of family medicine at Brown University  made Lilly records he had reviewed in the case available to the New York Times  After the newspaper published articles  based on the documents  Lilly threatened to seek criminal sanctions against Egilman  In 2007  he agreed to pay  the drug maker  100 000 to resolve the matter  About a year later  Lilly pleaded guilty and agreed to pay  1 4 billion to resolve charges it had illegally marketed Zyprexa  Lilly declined to comment  Egilman had that earlier experience in mind when he sought to shine a light on OxyContin  which he had prescribed to a few patients in the drug s early days  While reviewing Purdue s records as an expert witness in a lawsuit against the company  Egilman became convinced that doctors were getting the wrong message about OxyContin  This time  he went to court to try to force Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley to release evidence her office had gathered during an investigation into Purdue s sales practices  Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Linda Giles took a dim view of his petition  asking Egilman s lawyer during a 2012 hearing   What s his agenda   and  You want me to believe he s some noble citizen   Sensing the case wasn t going his way  Egilman said  he agreed to withdraw his petition rather than risk establishing an unfavorable precedent with a ruling that evidence collected in a state investigation was confidential   I could have stopped this   Egilman said in an interview   I am morally and ethically responsible  I took an oath to protect my patients  health  not corporate profits   Coakley and Giles declined to comment  By the end of 2012  the opioid death toll stood at 223 000  The evidence that OxyContin wasn t the benign pain reliever its maker said it was remained locked away until 2016  That year  the Los Angeles Times published a report  based on copies of sealed records  detailing how Purdue sold OxyContin as a 12 hour drug  even though the company knew it often didn t last that long  The report cited the company documents that Stephens and other judges had long kept under seal  revealing that OxyContin wore off early in Purdue test patients and that physicians complained to sales reps about the problem  Gaps in a narcotic s effect can cause bouts of pain  withdrawal and relief known to foster addiction  The sealed records further showed that despite what Purdue knew  it hired hundreds of sales reps to push OxyContin as a 12 hour drug because insurers would balk at paying top dollar for a pain reliever that was little different from cheaper alternatives  After the Los Angeles Times report  Judge Stephens began releasing the records he had sealed in 2004 to news organizations that requested them  including Reuters   I felt that it would be helpful to others who are going to pursue this type of litigation   he said  He was right  Many lawsuits against Purdue have cited the newspaper report and the original records  When the opioid epidemic landed on Judge Polster s docket in federal district court in Cleveland in late 2017  it had claimed 350 000 lives  Blame for the public health disaster was now directed at the entire industry   drug makers  distributors and retailers  The allegations in the hundreds of cases consolidated in Polster s court remained consistent  The companies hyped opioids for everyday pain relief  downplayed their addictiveness  and then blamed the people who used them for getting hooked   What s happening in our country with the opioid crisis is present and ongoing   Polster told a courtroom packed with lawyers for a Jan  9  2018  hearing   Since we re losing more than 50 000 of our citizens every year  about 150 Americans are going to die today  just today  while we re meeting   The judge said then  as he has said many times since  that he wanted the suits settled quickly so that communities ravaged by addiction can receive money to combat the crisis   I don t think anyone in the country is interested in a whole lot of finger pointing   Polster told the standing room only crowd   People aren t interested in depositions  and discovery  and trials   The tobacco industry settlement of 20 years ago  however  shows that when evidence is aired  it can have a big public impact  Under their landmark agreement with 46 states in 1998  cigarette makers paid  246 billion and divulged more than 26 million pages of records showing how they had manipulated nicotine to foster addiction and funded research to sway policy  That information formed the basis of public health initiatives and regulatory action in 160 countries  Since then  smoking rates in the U S  have plunged to historic lows  Citing the tobacco archives  public interest lawyers recently filed a brief in Polster s court asking that any resolution of the opioid litigation require the disclosure of all documents to promote research  changes in public policy  regulations and consumption  In Polster s court  as lawyers began fleshing out their cases against the opioid industry in amended complaints  they redacted details of the companies  conduct  In almost every instance  Polster failed to provide on the record his reason for allowing the secrecy  though the U S  Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit  which oversees his jurisdiction  has established precedent requiring that he do so  A few courts  recognizing the breadth of the opioid crisis  have recently signaled a less tolerant stance on secrecy  putting them at odds with Polster  Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Janet Sanders was presiding over a hearing in January on Purdue s request to maintain hundreds of redactions in a lawsuit filed against it by the state  News organizations  including Reuters  had petitioned Sanders to lift the redactions  Sanders reminded the lawyers that they were in the courthouse where records of child sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests had been sealed   until the Boston Globe petitioned the court  for their release  That case  she said  showed that even if the litigants on both sides want to keep evidence secret  the  court has to separately make a determination   Purdue s lawyers argued that disclosure would stoke outrage and embarrass the company  Noting the  tremendous  public interest in the information  Sanders said   This material   some part of it or all of it   is going to come out one day  I m not sure why it shouldn t be sooner rather than later   Tony LaGreca  whose son fatally overdosed after becoming addicted to opioids prescribed for a football injury  was in the courtroom that day   She was pretty awesome   he said of Sanders  LaGreca said parents like him are eager for the world to see evidence placing some responsibility for addiction on the drug companies   It should be all made public   he said  In an emergency motion filed in Polster s Cleveland court  Purdue urged the judge to block Sanders from lifting the redactions  The Massachusetts lawsuit was full of details that could make the company look bad  a Purdue lawyer complained at a hearing  and the effort to get Judge Sanders in Boston to release them was an attempt to get around Polster s secrecy order  Polster sympathized   I m not very happy with the Massachusetts AG either   he said  But he decided he didn t have the power to overrule Sanders  The next day  an unredacted version of the Massachusetts lawsuit was made public  The state used excerpts of emails between Purdue executives and board members and details from other records to bolster its main allegation  Purdue s sales campaign was a  deadly and illegal scheme to deceive doctors and patients  that had contributed to at least 671 fatal overdoses in Massachusetts since 2009  The unredacted material supported allegations that  after pledging reforms in the 2007 plea agreement with federal prosecutors  Purdue pressed doctors to prescribe OxyContin to the elderly and military veterans  groups vulnerable to addiction  The state also alleged that Purdue sought to boost prescriptions for bigger doses  even though a 2012 internal analysis acknowledged that the more potent pills  very likely  carried heightened  dose related overdose risk   The underlying analysis remains under seal  Purdue denies the allegations  The unredacted material shows why doctors continued to write historically high numbers of OxyContin prescriptions even as deaths mounted  said Harvard Medical School professor Jerry Avorn   It helps patients and doctors understand why so much OxyContin is being used   Judge Sanders declined to comment on the case  In product liability cases generally   the public has very much right to know what s going on   she said   Transparency gives assurance that what s going on is fair   There s no hanky panky  There are no agreements between the parties that are contrary to the public interest   Polster has since ratcheted up the secrecy in his court  He signed a Feb  11 order that allows litigants to designate any document as  highly confidential   attorneys  eyes only information   That bars disclosure to anyone   even the mayors and other state and local officials the lawyers represent   without signed permission from Polster or the litigant who produced it  Last week  the Sixth U S  Circuit Court of Appeals rebuked Polster for his secrecy orders  after the Washington Post and the Gazette Mail of Charleston  West Virginia  appealed his sealing of government data on the flow of opioids around the country  The three judge panel unanimously agreed that Polster had not stated adequate reasons for allowing parties to file documents under seal  not just about the government data  but beyond  They ordered him to do so  Polster  is advised to bear in mind that the party seeking to file under seal must provide a  compelling reason  to do so   Judge Eric Clay wrote  
In the coming weeks  the plaintiffs will file their most extensive briefs yet about the opioid industry s conduct  It will be up to Polster to decide what the public will be allowed to see ",2019-06-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/special-report-how-judges-added-to-the-grim-toll-of-opioids-1906852,1906852

127716,349231,MCK,UPS eyes in home health services with U S  vaccine project,news,"By Lisa Baertlein and Michael Erman LOUISVILLE  Ky     United Parcel  Service Inc  NYSE UPS  wants to get beyond U S  doorsteps with a new push into healthcare   The world s largest package delivery firm is preparing to test a U S  service that dispatches nurses to vaccinate adults in their homes  Reuters has learned  as the company and its healthcare clients work to fend off cost pressures and competitive threats from Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   UPS did not disclose which vaccines it would be using in the project  but drug and vaccine maker Merck   Co told Reuters it is looking at partnering with the company for the initiative  The project  previously unreported  shows how UPS is targeting a larger slice of the  85 billion outsourced healthcare logistics market  Deutsche Post s DHL Group dominates the market  which is expected to grow to  105 billion by 2021   Over the threshold services is where the world is headed   Chris Cassidy  who joined UPS last year from GlaxoSmithKline PLC to oversee global healthcare logistics strategy  told Reuters in an interview at UPS  Worldport facility in Louisville  Here is how the test  slated to launch later this year  will operate  Workers in UPS  1 7 million square foot healthcare complex at Worldport will package and ship the vaccine to one of the more 4 700 franchised U S  UPS stores  A home health nurse contracted by UPS  clinical trial logistics unit known as Marken will collect the insulated package  transport it the  last mile  to the patient s home and administer the vaccine  which will target a viral illness in adults  The aim of the test is to  see if we can connect all these dots   said Wes Wheeler  chief executive at Marken  which was purchased by UPS in 2016 and is overseeing the vaccine project  It comes as the parcel delivery industry braces for the impact of a cooling economy and competition from customer turned rival Amazon  which is building its own logistics network to contain the swelling cost of dropping millions of packages at shoppers  homes   UPS healthcare customers  facing political scrutiny over high drug prices and systemic waste  are also under pressure from Amazon  The world s biggest online retailer is teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  to lower prescription drug costs for their employees  And  it rocked the sector last year with its roughly  1 billion purchase of specialty online pharmacy PillPack  Experts say raising low U S  adult vaccination rates would reduce healthcare spending by curbing preventable illnesses that result in doctor visits and hospitalizations  Merck  a major UPS healthcare customer  has a portfolio of vaccines for viral illnesses ranging from shingles and hepatitis B to the flu  Spokeswoman Pamela Eisele said the company is considering the project as it looks for new ways to increase access to its medicines and vaccines and boost adult vaccine rates  Experts said the UPS project could also save money by having contract home nurses  rather than higher paid doctors  administer the vaccine  But the test  a first for a large U S  shipper  is not a guaranteed slam dunk for UPS  Marken s CEO said it must figure out how to get medical insurers to pay for the new service   NEW FRONTIERS UPS  DHL and specialty shippers have a smattering of home health projects around the world   mostly in countries with single payer health systems  DHL  the healthcare logistics leader with annual medical related revenue of more than 3 billion euros   3 4 billion   transports U K  patients from home to non emergency hospital appointments  Polar Speed  a U K  specialty logistics company UPS bought in 2014  has trained and background checked drivers who enter homes to drop off prescriptions  deliver and install medical refrigerators and infusion pumps  and remove waste such as used syringes and wound dressings  Pharmaceutical companies already pay Marken to give vaccines to patients testing their experimental drugs  Cathy Morrow Roberson  who founded consulting firm Logistics Trends   Insights after working for more than a decade as an analyst at Atlanta based UPS  said the vaccine project taps the assets and expertise the company has acquired since getting into healthcare in the early 2000s   They re reaping the benefits of all the acquisitions and investments they ve made   she said  The effort is designed to put even more distance between UPS and Amazon  which lacks the specialized warehouse  temperature controlled shipping and regulatory infrastructure that healthcare companies require  Amazon currently uses UPS and FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  for PillPack home deliveries  Major insurers contacted by Reuters declined to say what they pay to have vaccines administered  But an analysis of 2010 MarketScan health claims data sheds some light on the subject   finding that the average cost of a shingles shot was  208 72 at a doctor s office and  168 50 at a pharmacy  Flu shots cost less than  30 at both locations  The provider of that data declined to update it  Delivering home vaccines at a competitive price may not be the only hurdle to the UPS project s success  said Stephen Buck  chief executive of Courage Health and a former vice president at McKesson

127721,349236,MCK,MCK Vs  ALGN  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical   Dental Supplies sector might want to consider either McKesson  MCK  or Align Technology  NASDAQ ALGN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
McKesson and Align Technology are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that MCK likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ALGN has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
MCK currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 62  while ALGN has a forward P E of 34 99  We also note that MCK has a PEG ratio of 1 39  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 1 44 
Another notable valuation metric for MCK is its P B ratio of 3 17  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ALGN has a P B of 10 65 
These metrics  and several others  help MCK earn a Value grade of A  while ALGN has been given a Value grade of D 
MCK stands above ALGN thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that MCK is the superior value option right now ",2019-09-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mck-vs-algn-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200460776,200460776

127733,349248,MCK,Opioid Overdose Crisis In US Likely To Affect These 3 Stocks,opinion,Opioids are a diverse class of moderately strong  addictive and cheap painkillers  whose misuse claims more than 130 lives daily in the United States  Notably  the opioid epidemic began in the late 1990s and the death rates have increased manifold since then  Though  expects these deaths to drop in 2019  pharmaceutical giants are ending up facing increasing number of lawsuits for allegedly aggravating the opioid crisis Now this might raise the alarm for potential investors Opioid Lawsuit Wave Rattles IndustryAugust ended on a bitter note for the pharmaceutical industry as drug giant Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   was slapped with a penalty of  572 million in a landmark opioid trial  Notably  the company has been alleged to have spread highly addictive painkillers in the state of Oklahoma  Earlier this year  Oklahoma also settled disputes over opioid use with Teva Pharmaceutical   NYSE TEVA   for  85 million That s not all  Privately held Purdue Pharma  a maker of OxyContin  is offering  10  12 billion to settle more than 2 000 lawsuits  Notably  the lawsuits from various states  cities and counties have alleged the company of fostering the opioid crisis The scenario is clearer when we look at the total consumer spending on medicines in the United States  Spending totaled  482 billion in 2018  significantly up from  316 billion in 2010  per   Remedial Measures Likely to Baffle InvestorsIn the wake of the recent events  President Trump announced  1 8 billion in new grants earlier this month  to help fight the opioid epidemic  This  along with the FDA s latest stance on combating the epidemic  might further vex investors about the future of opioid makers and distributors Notably  the FDA suggested the consumption of a life saving drug called naloxone to reverse the effects of an overdose  In fact  most states have passed laws or made rules to allow pharmacists to provide over the counter naloxone to consumers  Although this creates a remedial scope for pharmaceutical companies  the glare of opioid lawsuits is likely to remain and impact drug manufacturers  pharmacy operators and distributors Stocks Likely to Bear the BruntGiven the present situation  we have zeroed down on three stocks which rake in billions from drug retailing and

127740,349255,MCK,Can McKesson  MCK  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering McKesson  MCK   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this prescription drug distributor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 4 85   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  McKesson was expected to post earnings of  3 04 per share  but it reported  3 31 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 88   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 66 per share  while it actually produced  3 69 per share  a surprise of 0 82  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for McKesson lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
McKesson has an Earnings ESP of  2 82  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  46 15  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
At this time  Rite Aid has a great Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C  However  the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side  putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Rite Aid has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rite-aid-rad-down-235-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-rebound-200445641,200445641
127758,349273,MCK,McKesson  MCK  Q1 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"McKesson  MCK  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 31 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 04 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 90 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8 88   A quarter ago  it was expected that this prescription drug distributor would post earnings of  3 66 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 69  delivering a surprise of 0 82  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
McKesson  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  posted revenues of  55 73 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 26   This compares to year ago revenues of  52 61 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
McKesson shares have added about 29  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for McKesson 
While McKesson has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for McKesson was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 67 on  54 84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 17 on  221 21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   Dental Supplies is currently in the top 38  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mckesson-mck-q1-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates-200448627,200448627
127761,349276,MCK,McKesson  MCK  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of McKesson  MCK   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5 3  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  149 99 in the previous session  McKesson has gained 34 2  since the start of the year compared to the 4  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 17 6  return for the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 31  2019  McKesson reported EPS of  3 31 versus consensus estimate of  3 04 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 26  
For the current fiscal year  McKesson is expected to post earnings of  14 2 per share on  221 93 billion in revenues  This represents a 4 64  change in EPS on a 3 55  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  15 42 per share on  230 08 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 8 58  and 3 67   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
McKesson may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
McKesson has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 10 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 5X versus its peer group s average of 12 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 51  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  McKesson currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if McKesson meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though McKesson shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mckesson-mck-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200449967,200449967
127762,349277,MCK,MCK Vs  WST  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks have likely encountered both McKesson  MCK  and West Pharmaceutical Services  WST   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  both McKesson and West Pharmaceutical Services are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
MCK currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 20  while WST has a forward P E of 47 29  We also note that MCK has a PEG ratio of 1 48  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  WST currently has a PEG ratio of 4 13 
Another notable valuation metric for MCK is its P B ratio of 3 35  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  WST has a P B of 7 40 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to MCK s Value grade of A and WST s Value grade of C 
Both MCK and WST are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that MCK is the superior value option right now ",2019-08-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mck-vs-wst-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200455133,200455133
127768,349283,MCK,Should Value Investors Consider McKesson  MCK  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put McKesson Corporation   NYSE MCK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  McKesson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 46  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 85  If we focus on the long term PE trend  McKesson s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 62 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 59  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that McKesson has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 09  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for McKesson stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  McKesson has a P S ratio of about 0 13  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  McKesson currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes McKesson a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for McKesson is just 1 46  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 85  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  MCK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though McKesson might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of B  This gives MCK a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up and none down in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 1 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat mixed trend the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMcKesson is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 29  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick It s Illegal in 42 States  But Investors Will Make Billions LegallyIn addition to the companies you read about above  today you get details on the newly legalized industry that s tapping into a  habit  that Americans spend an

Shares of AT T  NYSE T   the world s largest telecommunications company  are up nearly 22  this year  The stock closed at  34 72 on Tuesday  within sight of a 52 week high of  35 50  touched on August 22  giving it a market cap of  253 7 billion 
With the trade war more likely to affect goods producers with significant revenue exposure to China  services companies that generate most of their sales domestically should suffer less than their multi national counterparts  which makes AT T a good bet going forward 

The Dallas  Texas based telecom and media giant posted upbeat second quarter results on July 24  AT T reported earnings per share  EPS  of  0 89  matching expectations  Sales in the quarter were  44 96 billion  up 15  from the same period a year earlier  and just ahead of expectations for revenue of  44 89 billion 
AT T s high dividend growth the company is currently paying out  0 51 per share per quarter implies an annualized dividend of  2 04 per share  This just enhances the appeal of both the company and the stock  Its dividend yield is currently 6 01   almost triple the implied yield for the S P 500  which is 2 04  
2  Visa  Credit Card Giant With Limited China Exposure
Visa is the second name on our radar  The world s largest payment processing company  with international operations in more than 200 countries  ranks the U S  as its largest market 
The company s limited exposure to the world s second largest economy makes it one of the top China proof names to consider as trade tensions accelerate 
Visa shares have gained almost 35  since the start of the year  making it the Dow s best performing component of 2019  The stock closed at  178 38 last night  not far from its recent 52 week high of  184 07  reached on July 29  At current valuations  the credit card giant is the seventh largest company in the world with a market cap of  387 5 billion 





The San Francisco based payments processor easily beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines when it released earnings for its fiscal third quarter on July 23  Earnings per share totaled  1 37 in the quarter ended June 30  surpassing expectations for EPS of  1 32 and up from  1 20 in the same period a year earlier  Revenue climbed 11 5  to  5 84 billion  above forecasts of  5 7 billion   
Total payments volume on a constant dollar basis rose 8 7  to  2 23 trillion  with the U S  accounting for about 8 8  of that 
3  McKesson  U S  Focused Healthcare Stock
Our final name comes from the healthcare sector  Like the two companies mentioned above  McKesson  NYSE MCK   widely considered to be the leading healthcare company for pharmaceutical distribution  also has limited revenue exposure to China and generates most of its sales within the U S 
The stock  which finished yesterday at  138 75  has gained 25  in 2019  giving it a market cap of  25 6 billion  On August 23 it hit a fresh 52 week high of  150 82 





The Irving  Texas based company announced earnings and revenue on July 31  which easily topped consensus estimates thanks in large part to its strong performance in its U S  domestic operations  Earnings per share totaled  3 31  much better than expectations of  3 03  while revenue climbed 6  from the same period a year earlier  to  55 7 billon  easily beating estimates for sales of  54 0 billion 
Its strongest performance came from the U S  Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment  which climbed 8  
The upbeat results prompted McKesson to boost its guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year  The drug distribution and wholesale specialist now expects EPS in a range between  14 00 to  14 60  up from its previously provided target of  13 85 to  14 45 ",2019-08-28,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-set-to-outperform-as-the-uschina-trade-war-escalates-200459207,200459207

cents per share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 2 cents  In the year ago quarter  the company reported adjusted earnings of 2 cents per share Notably  the bottom line was hurt by a decline in adjusted EBITDA coupled with higher income tax expenses  somewhat offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense as well as lease termination and impairment charges Management stated that quarterly results lagged expectations owing to prescription reimbursement rate pressure in the Retail Pharmacy Segment  Also  margin compression in the company s Pharmacy Services Segment weighed

127795,349310,MCK,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For McKesson  MCK ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  McKesson  MCK   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This prescription drug distributor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 87  
For the most recent quarter  McKesson was expected to post earnings of  3 66 per share  but it reported  3 69 per share instead  representing a surprise of 0 82   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 18 per share  while it actually produced  3 40 per share  a surprise of 6 92  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for McKesson  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
McKesson currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 10   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 31  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-mckesson-mck-200441580,200441580

127798,349313,MCK,MCK Vs  COO  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Dental Supplies sector have probably already heard of McKesson  MCK  and Cooper Cos   COO   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
McKesson and Cooper Cos  are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
MCK currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 80  while COO has a forward P E of 27 14  We also note that MCK has a PEG ratio of 1 46  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  COO currently has a PEG ratio of 2 52 
Another notable valuation metric for MCK is its P B ratio of 3 21  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  COO has a P B of 4 65 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to MCK s Value grade of A and COO s Value grade of C

127803,349318,MCK,McKesson  MCK  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when McKesson  MCK  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 8  
Revenues are expected to be  53 97 billion  up 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 77  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McKesson 
For McKesson  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 77  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that McKesson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that McKesson would post earnings of  3 66 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 69  delivering a surprise of  0 82  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

127814,349329,MCK,McKesson  MCK  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"McKesson  MCK  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 9  
Revenues are expected to be  53 35 billion  up 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McKesson 
For McKesson  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 48  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that McKesson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that McKesson would post earnings of  3 18 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 40  delivering a surprise of  6 92  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

127816,349331,MCK,McKesson  MCK  Tops Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"McKesson  MCK  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 69 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 66 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 49 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 82   A quarter ago  it was expected that this prescription drug distributor would post earnings of  3 18 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 40  delivering a surprise of 6 92  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
McKesson  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  posted revenues of  52 43 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 73   This compares to year ago revenues of  51 63 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
McKesson shares have added about 13 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 1  
What s Next for McKesson 
While McKesson has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for McKesson was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

127845,349360,MCK,Is McKesson  MCK  A Great Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is McKesson  MCK   MCK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 9 63  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 16 13  MCK s Forward P E has been as high as 11 72 and as low as 7 78  with a median of 9 56  all within the past year 
MCK is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 36  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MCK s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 80  MCK s PEG has been as high as 1 46 and as low as 1 12  with a median of 1 33  all within the past year 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is MCK s P B ratio of 2 77  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 2 92  Over the past 12 months  MCK s P B has been as high as 3 24 and as low as 2 22  with a median of 2 69 
Finally  investors will want to recognize that MCK has a P CF ratio of 8 81  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  MCK s P CF compares to its industry s average P CF of 13 86  Over the past year  MCK s P CF has been as high as 10 07 and as low as 4 59  with a median of 7 81 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in McKesson s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  MCK looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-mckesson-mck-a-great-value-stock-right-now-200390130,200390130

127854,349369,MCK,McKesson in record  150 million U S  settlement over suspicious drug orders,news,"By Nate Raymond
 Reuters    McKesson Corp  NYSE MCK   one of the largest U S  distributors of pharmaceutical drugs  will pay a record  150 million to resolve a U S  investigation into whether it failed to report suspicious orders of addictive painkillers 
Tuesday s deal with the U S  Justice Department followed an earlier settlement with the company over similar violations in 2008  The latest accord came as U S  authorities continue to grapple with the nation s opioid drug epidemic 
 The consequences of McKesson s decision to circumvent its obligations are too devastating to ignore and warrant today s punishment   New Jersey U S  Attorney Paul Fishman  whose office was involved in the deal  said in a statement 
Under the settlement  San Francisco based McKesson must on a staggered basis suspend sales of controlled substances from distribution centers in Colorado  Ohio  Michigan and Florida for several years 
It will also be subject to new and enhanced compliance obligations and be required to hire an independent monitor to assess compliance  a first of its kind arrangement under a Controlled Substances Act civil penalty settlement 
McKesson in a statement said it has implemented significant changes to its monitoring and reporting processes and was committed to combating prescription drug diversion and abuse 
 We are committed to tackling this multi faceted problem in collaboration with all parties in the supply chain that share the responsibility for the distribution of opioid medications   McKesson Chief Executive Officer John Hammergren said in a statement 
Each day about 78 Americans die of an opioid overdose  according to authorities  Oxycodone  a big source of profit for drug dealers  is abused by over 13 million Americans annually  prosecutors say 
Tuesday s accord came after McKesson in 2008 reached a  13 25 million settlement resolving claims that it failed to design and implement an effective system to detect and report suspiciously large or frequent orders 
The Justice Department said that following that deal  from 2008 until 2013  McKesson supplied various pharmacies an increasing amount of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills  both opioid drugs that are frequently misused 
The Justice Department said the evidence showed that McKesson did not fully implement or adhere to its own compliance program designed after the 2008 settlement 
As one example  the Justice Department said that in Colorado  McKesson processed over 1 6 million orders for controlled substances from June 2008 through May 2013  yet only reported 16 as suspicious ",2017-01-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mckesson-in-record-$150-million-u.s.-settlement-over-suspicious-drug-orders-453762,453762

127872,349387,MCK,MCK Vs  ALGN  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks have likely encountered both McKesson  MCK  and Align Technology  ALGN   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  McKesson has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that MCK has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
MCK currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 49  while ALGN has a forward P E of 47 63  We also note that MCK has a PEG ratio of 1 45  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 21 
Another notable valuation metric for MCK is its P B ratio of 2 61  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ALGN has a P B of 16 43 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to MCK s Value grade of A and ALGN s Value grade of D 
MCK has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ALGN  so it seems like value investors will conclude that MCK is the superior option right now ",2019-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mck-vs-algn-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200383200,200383200
127873,349388,MCK,Is McKesson Corporation  MCK  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put McKesson Corporation   NYSE MCK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  McKesson Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 0  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 3  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts McKesson Corporation s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 13 5  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that McKesson Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for McKesson Corporation s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  McKesson Corporation has a P S ratio of 0 1  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  McKesson Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MCK a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for McKesson Corporation is just 1 4  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 8  which is considerably better than the industry average of 16 9  Clearly  MCK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though McKesson Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D  This gives MCK a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 1 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMcKesson Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  top 26  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019 In addition to the stocks discussed above  wouldn t you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the year From more than 4 000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank  these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market  Even during 2018 while the market dropped  5 2   our Top 10s were

127893,349408,MCK,U S  moves to block massive health insurer deals led by Anthem  Aetna,news,"By Caroline Humer and Carl O Donnell NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  antitrust officials on Thursday moved to block an unprecedented consolidation of the national health insurance market  filing suit against Anthem Inc s  N ANTM  proposed purchase of  Cigna Corp   N CI  and Aetna Inc s  N AET  planned acquisition of  Humana Inc   N HUM    The U S  Department of Justice said the two multibillion dollar mergers would reduce competition  raise prices for consumers and stifle innovation if the number of large  national insurers were to fall from five to three   It was the latest example of the Obama administration challenging massive combinations in major industries  from oilfield services to telecommunications   We will not hesitate to intervene  We will not shy away from complex cases   U S  Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a news conference on Thursday   We will protect the interests of the American people   The deals would hurt consumers in the different markets served by the four companies  from medical coverage provided by large corporations to their employees to Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly and insurance sold to individuals on exchanges created under President Barack Obama s healthcare reform law  the Justice Department said   We have no doubt that these mergers would reduce competition from what it is today   said Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General William Baer  who spearheaded the antitrust reviews  Merging Aetna s and Humana s Medicare Advantage businesses would create the largest U S  manager of the healthcare insurance for seniors and the disabled   The Anthem deal for Cigna would create the largest U S  health insurer by membership  with about 53 million members  surpassing UnitedHealth Group s  N UNH  45 9 million as of June 30  and make it the leader in employer based health insurance  Aetna and Anthem had each argued their proposed purchases would help lower prices for consumers by giving them greater leverage in negotiating with doctors and hospitals   AETNA VOWS LEGAL FIGHT Aetna and Humana said Thursday they plan  to vigorously defend the companies  pending merger   worth  33 billion  Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said the company has proposed divesting enough assets to ensure competition in markets where it overlaps with Humana   If we can t come to a negotiation on what markets to divest  although we have two very complete remedies in front of the Department of Justice now  I think I m willing to let a judge decide   Bertolini told business news channel CNBC   We ll go all the way we need to make this happen    Anthem had a more muted response  saying it was committed to working toward a settlement with the Justice Department for its  45 billion transaction  but would challenge the lawsuit if necessary  Cigna said it was evaluating its options  It does not believe a deal would close before 2017   if at all    After news of the lawsuit  Humana raised its 2016 earnings forecast  saying its core businesses  Medicare Advantage and Healthcare Services  are performing better than expected  Humana shares rose 8 3 percent  Cigna climbed 5 4 percent  Anthem closed up 2 6 percent and Aetna rose 1 6 percent  Speculation that the U S  government would block both deals had weighed on shares of all four insurers for several weeks  Humana s raised forecast  bodes well for the rest of the industry  Now you can expect the other guys to report good numbers and perhaps raise guidance as well   said Jeff Jonas  portfolio manager for Gabelli Funds  which holds Cigna and Humana shares   There s somewhat of a relief rally  too  given that this has been an overhang for so long  particularly with Anthem and Cigna   he said  CONCERN FOR DIFFERENT CONSUMERS  In the suit against Aetna  the Justice Department cited specific concerns about damage to 1 6 million people in 364 counties who are customers of Medicare Advantage  the program that serves older people   It also said there were issues for the individual plans sold on Obamacare exchanges  where the government has sought to spur competition and keep prices low  About 20 state insurance departments were required to review the Aetna Humana deal  Missouri came out firmly against it  while others  including California and New York  approved it after reaching a settlement  In the suit against Anthem Cigna  antitrust regulators said the combination would substantially lessen competition in an already consolidated industry  harming millions of Americans  doctors and hospitals  The Justice Department said it was concerned about the impact on the national corporate business  which serves large companies and which it said has only four competitors  It also said there were issues with local business markets  the individual Obamacare exchanges and the impact a combined company could have on contracts with doctors  Doctors and hospitals had urged the Justice Department to try to block the deal  and some large employers were also against the combination  Aetna and Anthem had each proposed asset sales to the regulators  but they did not adequately address the loss of market competition  Baer said  Eleven states and the District of Colombia joined the Justice Department suit against Anthem and Cigna  eight states and DC joined the suit against Aetna and Humana  If the government successfully scuttles the deals  Anthem would owe Cigna  1 85 billion in breakup fees  Aetna would have to pay Humana  1 billion  If the deals fail for other reasons  the breakup fees would be different  The unusual move against two deals in the same industry represents a repeat of history for Baer  who headed the department s Antitrust Division until a short time ago and is now the No  3 official in the Justice Department

127897,349412,MCK,Is McKesson  MCK  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put McKesson Corporation   NYSE MCK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  McKesson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  McKesson s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that McKesson has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 5  which is in line with the current level  Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company s current share price P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  McKesson has a P S ratio of about 0 1  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MCK is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  McKesson currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes McKesson a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for McKesson is just 1 4  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 5  which is far better than the industry average of 18 8  Clearly  MCK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though McKesson might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B  This gives MCK a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current fiscal quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen seven upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2 2  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMcKesson is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 37  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past three years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Medical Stocks to Buy NowThe greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating revenue  and cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in the pipeline So are big potential profits for early

127900,349415,MCK,Why McKesson  MCK  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering McKesson  MCK   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this prescription drug distributor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 5 05   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  McKesson came out with earnings of  3 60 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 28 per share  representing a surprise of 9 76   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 89 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 90 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 35  
Price and EPS Surprise

For McKesson  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
McKesson currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 76   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 31  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-mckesson-mck-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200374535,200374535

In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  400  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
Currently  Rite Aid has a great Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F  However  the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side  putting it in the top 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift  Notably  Rite Aid has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rite-aid-rad-up-142-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200377082,200377082
127903,349418,MCK,Earnings Preview  McKesson  MCK  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when McKesson  MCK  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 18 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 7  
Revenues are expected to be  55 27 billion  up 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 09  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McKesson 
For McKesson  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McKesson will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that McKesson would post earnings of  3 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 60  delivering a surprise of  9 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
McKesson doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-mckesson-mck-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200378943,200378943

reports on 16 major stocks  including Lockheed Martin  Mastercard and Colgate  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today Strong Buy rated Lockheed Martin s shares have gained  40 4  over the last one year  underperforming the Zacks Aerospace Defense sector  which has gained  60 8  over the same period  However  Lockheed Martin ended 2017 on a solid note  Its fourth quarter earnings as well as revenue figures comfortably exceeded expectations The recent tax reform adopted by the U S  government had an adverse impact on the company s year over year earnings growth  while revenues reflected an uptick  The Zacks analyst emphasizes that being the largest defense contractor in the world  Lockheed Martin experiences strong demand for high end military equipment in both domestic as well as overseas markets Strong order growth has been a primary growth driver for this company  The latest  7 billion deal for the sustainment of F 22 air vehicle is one such order  Lockheed Martin continues to be a strong cash generator  helping it to take important cash deployment decisions  However  the F 35 program  despite being a prime defense project for the U S  government  has been facing criticism for being overtly expensive  for past few years Shares of Mastercard have gained  62 3  over the past one year  outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry which has gained  43 3  over the same period  Mastercard s fourth quarter earnings beat expectations  driven by higher switched transactions  increase in cross border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions  An increase in rebates and incentives from the prior year quarter was a partial dampener The Zacks analyst likes Mastercard s solid market position  ongoing expansion and digital initiatives  Further  there are significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments  The acquisitions of VocaLink and NuData Security complement the company s efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings  However  it continues to face increasing costs  Also  higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on the bottom line Colgate s shares are up  11 2  over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks Consumer Staples sector  which has gained  10 5  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes the progress on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program Moreover  the company has been infamous with investors for its meet or beat earnings track record  Notably  it delivered in line earnings for the third consecutive quarter in fourth quarter 2017  However  margins continue to be strained due to higher raw material and packaging costs  as well as advertising expenses  It anticipates advertising costs to remain high in 2018  which should hurt operating margin Colgate expects the backdrop to remain challenging in 2018 due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide  Nonetheless  it remains confident of the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives  which are likely to boost results Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Electronic Arts and McKesson Wall Street s Next Amazon

127949,349464,MCK,Is McKesson Corporation  MCK  A Suitable Value Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put McKesson Corporation   NYSE MCK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  McKesson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 9  If we focus on the long term PE trend  McKesson s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having fallen over the past few months  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that McKesson has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for McKesson stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  McKesson has a P S ratio of about 0 1  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MCK is almost in line with the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  McKesson currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes McKesson a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for McKesson is 1 4  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 8  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 0  which is far better than the industry average of 12 4  Clearly  MCK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though McKesson might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives MCK a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current fiscal quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen nine upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2 5  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has risen by 3 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMcKesson is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 17   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2018-03-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-mckesson-corporation-mck-a-suitable-value-stock-now-200300305,200300305

growth projection What s in Store for Medical Device Industry The medical device space within the broader Medical sector somewhat displays a mixed bag of sorts  As part of the tax overhaul  corporate tax rates have been slashed down to 21  from the previous 35   thus lending a huge relief to the MedTech mammoths However  ahead of the industry s fourth quarter earnings release  a section of analysts expect this new tax law to negatively impact the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending  if certain criteria are not fulfilled by a specific date  The Congressional Budget Office apprehends that in absence of any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax reduction  automatic cut backs worth  136 billion including  25 billion in Medicare cuts from the mandatory budget of spending in 2018  could be triggered Amid tax reform related concerns  the news of Congress delaying the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge boost to

total market cap  reported their numbers  Total earnings for these members have gone up 9 4  on 7 3  higher revenues However  investors are concerned about the Medical sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  that saw a lot of struggle during the first nine months of the year  thanks to the political change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle The ensuing lack of visibility has roiled the favorable trend that this sector maintained in the trailing few quarters  For the third quarter  the expected earnings growth rate stands at a mere 2 2  on a 4 8  revenue growth projection  In comparison  the second quarter earnings growth was quite impressive at 7  on 4 4  revenue growth What s in Store for the Medical Product Space While twists and turns continue to unfold at Capitol Hill  the scenario within the  space  an important part of the medical device subcategory within the broader Medical sector  is getting gloomier  The latest executive order released by the Republicans points to a shrinking customer base  indicating a cut in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices  This may lead to major supply demand disequilibrium within this space However  major medical device players have been pinning hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2 3  medical device sales tax  though its elimination is far from reality Considering these tax issues  investors

Drug Eluting Stent   continues to build momentum worldwide However  ahead of this earnings release  the quarter s IC business is likely to be grossly impacted by the company s product recall issue

128050,349565,MCK,Book Review  The CEO Pay Machine,opinion,"Everybody  except perhaps the CEOs themselves and their compensation committees  know that CEO pay in the U S  is out of control  At large firms the CEO to worker compensation ratio  20 to 1 in 1965 and 26 to 1 in 1978  is now more than 300 to 1  perhaps as high as 700 to 1   In Japan the ratio is 16 to 1  in Denmark 48 to 1  and in the UK 84 to 1   How did CEO pay in the U S  become so untethered to the wages of average workers and what can be done to bring it back in line  if indeed doing so would be in the best interests of the companies themselves and the economy as a whole 
Steven Clifford  formerly CEO of King Broadcasting Company and National Mobile Television and a director of 13 companies  tackles these questions with wit and compelling logic in The CEO Pay Machine  How It Trashes America and How to Stop It  Blue Rider Press Penguin Random House  2017   He sets out to show  how the sausage is made how the Pay Machine actually works  how its parts interact  and how every step in the process pushes CEO pay to higher and higher levels  
He starts with a fairy tale about a loan officer at the Midwest Bank who asks his fairy godmother to help him get a promotion because his  75 000 salary isn t enough  Ah  she replies  she can do better than that  She can get him more money for the same job  Applying CEO compensation practices to the loan officer s pay package  the fairy godmother steers him  wide eyed step by wide eyed step  from his modest  75 000 salary to a whopping  5 845 000  In the process  the author sketches out the inner workings of the CEO Pay Machine 
Excessive CEO pay  the author argues  harms companies  shareholders  and the economy and undermines democracy  Not just because it is excessive but also because of the way in which it is typically structured  For instance  it usually misaligns CEO incentives with effective corporate practices and goals 
Clifford lays the blame for the emergence of the Pay Machine at the feet of  three totally unrelated actors  Michael Jensen  Milton Rock  and Bill Clinton    They were not attempting to overpay CEOs and might be stunned and insulted to be grouped together as causal agents   Jensen s basically sound recommendations  that CEOs own a significant amount of company stock and be paid in part for performance  were largely misapplied 
Rock and his fellow compensation consultants introduced the idea of using peer groups to calibrate executive pay and benchmarking  usually above average  to the salaries of the peer group CEOs  It s easy to see that  the above average benchmarking of pay within peer groups creates a relentless upward spiral in pay a game of CEO leapfrog  Every time a CEO leaps  he establishes a higher compensation base for the next CEO in the group to leap over   By the way  at this year s annual Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  meeting  Charlie Munger said  I have avoided all my life compensation consultants  I hardly can find the words to express my contempt   He did  however  find the words at the 2012 meeting when he said  for  compensation consultants  prostitution would be a step up   Warren Buffett added at this year s meeting   If the board hires a compensation consultant after I go  I will come back mad  
The last culprit  Bill Clinton  executing on his campaign promise to clamp down on excessive executive compensation  set out to eliminate tax deductions for executive pay  at first above a certain level and then  in a compromise move  above a certain level that wasn t performance based  Business was still unhappy  so he agreed to exempt stock options from this cap   Boards could now pay unlimited amounts as long as they could pass it off as  performance based  and could grant unlimited stock options with no performance requirements  
Clifford examines the pay packages and performance of the highest paid executives of 2011 thru 2014 the CEOs of UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   McKesson  NYSE MCK   Cheniere Energy  and Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA   The disconnect should come as no surprise 
By way of a solution  Clifford proposes a simple  blunt instrument   For every dollar above  6 million that the companies pay their CEO or any other executive  and this includes all forms of compensation   they would pay a dollar in luxury tax  It would not be tax deductible   Punkt  No loopholes  And  he realizes  no way it would ever get through this Congress  But maybe someday  ",2017-05-14,Brenda Jubin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/clifford,-the-ceo-pay-machine-200188989",200188989

128053,349568,MCK,Should Value Investors Consider McKesson  MCK  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put McKesson Corporation   NYSE MCK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  McKesson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 67  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  McKesson s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 57 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 90  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that McKesson has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 25  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  McKesson has a P S ratio of about 0 18  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MCK is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  McKesson currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes McKesson a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for McKesson is just 1 91  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 11  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 68  which is far better than the industry average of 13 92  Clearly  MCK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though McKesson might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives MCK a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite mixed  The current quarter has seen two upward and downward estimate revisions each in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a somewhat positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate is the same as it was two months ago  while the full year estimate has increased 4 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus    However  this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term  Nonetheless  the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock s future prospects look good Bottom LineMcKesson is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  While this Zacks Rank  3 stock belongs to the Zacks categorized Medical Dental   Supplies industry that has underperformed the broader market in the last two years   the industry ranks among the Top 29  of the Zacks industries  This hints at favorable broader prospects  alongside signaling chances of revival So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades

128080,349595,MCK,MedTech Sails Through Macro Woes  Stocks In Focus,opinion,"Three full quarters of 2016 are behind us and  as expected  the trend has hardly changed for the bullish MedTech sector even amid severe economic instability surrounding one of the most controversial political power changes in history  This is because some powerful long term tailwinds like mergers   acquisitions  M A   emerging market expansion  positive demographic trends and new product innovation are the vital forces behind the continued uptrend in the sector s performance 
In addition  the recent change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the healthcare system  This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally invasive surgeries  rising demand for liquid biopsy tests  use of IT for ensuring efficient patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value based model 
Let s go through some of the major long term tailwinds of the MedTech sector 
Major M As
By now we know how Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT  knocked Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  from its indisputable position as the top firm in the medical devices space  thanks to its  43 billion Covidien merger  It s really amazing how a single mega consolidation shook up the dynamics of the entire medical devices space 
And after that the industry hasn t taken a breather with strategic mega consolidations continuing to pour in  Deals like Zimmer Biomet  ZBH   Johnson   Johnson Synthes  Thermo Fisher Life Technologies and many more gave birth to unprecedented leaders in their respective niche markets 
Although going by the last available EvaluateGroup data  the first half of 2016 witnessed a slump is mergers and acquisitions on a very tough year ago comparison  there are a number of sector changing deals in the pipeline  Most notable among these is Abbott Laboratories   ABT  impending consolidation with St  Jude Medical for a deal value of  25 billion  Post completion  this will create a leader in high growth cardiovascular markets 
Apart from this deal  Abbott has inked a number of deals this year which include its  5 8 billion agreement to acquire Alere  ALR  which should strengthen its presence and leadership in the global diagnostics market  As per EvaluateGroup data  following the completion of these deals  the company will capture the third place in company rankings in 2022  with potential sales of around  22 billion 
Also  Zimmer Biomet s impending acquisition of LDR Holding Corp  for a total deal value of  1 billion is expected to boost the spine portfolio of the former 
Other recently completed significant acquisitions are 
Thermo Fisher  TMO  Affimetrix  The acquisition of Affymetrix for  1 3 billion is expected to boost Thermo Fisher s biosciences and genetic analysis portfolio 
Thermo Fisher FEI Company  Thermo Fisher acquired FEI Company for  4 2 billion  FEI s industry leading high performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study will facilitate Thermo Fisher s life science research 
Medtronic  MDT  HeartWare  Recently  Medtronic acquired this company for a total value of  1 1 billion  This acquisition is expected to significantly boost Medtronic s cardiac rhythm and heart failure business  alongside providing a strong foothold in the global market 
Divestments 
Medical device majors continue to offload their non core business segments  specifically to focus on the main segments and to divest assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers  as required by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and other international anti trust regulators  This restricts the chance of monopoly practice in the market 
Let s take a look at some of the significant divestments of recent times 
Abbott announced that it will divest its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics to Johnson   Johnson for about  4 33 billion in order to better streamline its newly added businesses 
Wright Medical s  WMGI  recent divestment of its large joints  hip knee  business to CorinOrthopaedics is an example of the company s focus on its core businesses 
On the other hand  in its motto to reduce and refine its portfolio and repay its debts  Community Health Systems  Inc   CYH  has decided to divest its Rockwood Health System and associated assets to MultiCare Health System 
Emerging Market Openings
As per recent data from Euromonitor International  the global medical device production value is likely to register strong growth of almost 6  in 2016  to reach  315 billion  While the traditional market continues to be plagued by difficulties like growing regulatory scrutiny and pricing pressure  it s the Asia Pacific region on which all bets are being placed this year 
The MedTech market in Asia Pacific grew the fastest at a CAGR of 10  during 2008 2014 and is expected to continue to grow rapidly over 2016 as well  According to the report  China and India s healthcare service revenues are expected to grow by 12  and 9   respectively  in 2016 alone 
Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50  of sales from this region  In the third quarter of 2016  sales in key emerging markets climbed in double digits driven by growth in India  China and Latin America 
At Medtronic  emerging markets demonstrated strong growth in its second quarter of fiscal 2017  contributing 120 basis points  bps  to the company s overall revenue growth  Boston Scientific Corp   NYSE BSX  achieved 19  organic growth in emerging markets in the third quarter  driven by 26  growth in China and 21  growth in Latin America 
R D  Innovations
According to a survey by KPMG  the number of medical device companies that expect to spend more than 6  of revenue on R D innovation is rising and is fast exceeding the number of companies spending on R Ds in other manufacturing industries 
Edwards Lifesciences   EW  SAPIEN or its competitive product Medtronic s CoreValve transcatheter heart valve or surgical aortic valves are one of the most appropriate examples of such breakthrough innovations  As the global heart valves market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14 28  during the period 2016 2020  according to the latest Market Research Report   it is needless to say how impactful these breakthroughs are for the Medtech market for it to remain on its growth trajectory 
Strongest Links
Among the medical product stocks  Nxstage Medical  Inc   NXTM  looks attractive  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and with a VGM score B  We note that  stocks with a  of A or B and a Zacks Rank of  1 or  2 have highest probability of success

Weaker Stocks
Coming to the weakest links in the MedTech sector  we advise investors to stay away from names that offer little growth opportunity in the near term  These include companies for which estimate revision trends reflect a bearish sentiment

128081,349596,MCK,Inovalon Holdings Inc Shares Crash Down On Lower Guidance Numbers,opinion,"Inovalon Holdings Inc  NASDAQ INOV 
Inovalon Holdings  Inc   INOV   announced yesterday reported that they are updating their Full year 2016 Financial guidance numbers  Inovalon has updated their Non GAAP net income per share to be  0 32 to  0 33 per share which is lower than their previous guidance of  0 39 to  0 46 per share  Inovalon updated their full year revenue numbers to be in between  426 to  428 million which is down from previous guidance of  470 to  490 million 
Inovalon Holdings  Inc  CEO s Comments

Keith Dunleavy  M D   Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Inovalon commented   While this is certainly not the situation we expected or desired  it does demonstrate the level of market opportunity for our platform capabilities  the significance of value that can be driven by those capabilities  and the size and scale at which Inovalon is being called upon to partner and deliver them   

INOV Technical Analysis

INOV opened trading yesterday at  15 05 which was exactly the same as the previous day s trading close  INOV closed trading yesterday at  14 85 and crashed down after market to  9 95  equivalent to a 33  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that we are in unchartered territory as INOV is now trading at all time lows  Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down INOV had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to November 25th when it traded at highs of  16  INOV has a float of 53 81 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday  For trading purposes  I would like to see INOV open trading on Tuesday below  11 50 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

128110,349625,MCK,McKesson Corp  MCK  Stock Down Over 24  Today ,opinion,"On Friday  pharmaceutical giant McKesson Corp   NYSE MCK   experienced a 24  drop in their stock price  down to  124 57  as of 3 15pm central  This comes after the release of their 2nd quarter fiscal 2017 earnings 
MCK reported revenue of  49 96B and earnings of  2 94 per share  These figures are lower than expectations  which projected earnings of  3 04 per share and revenue of  51 2B  MCK CEO John Hammerger explained how the company needed to lower drug prices in order to reciprocate competition  This explains the sudden drop in stock price  as investors displayed uncertainty in MCK s future earnings 
Hammerger displayed annoyance while discussing competition and the drop in prices  saying   What we began to see more recently is competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations  more aggressive  and across several areas of our U S  pharmaceutical business  When a competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing  we are compelled to respond  
The hope for MCK is that investors will see value in their impressive track record  Historically  the company has been able to post notable growth on both revenue and EPS  and recently  McKesson separated its technology sector from its other businesses  According to Zacks  MCK analysis summary page  McKesson  has been actively pursuing deals and acquisitions to drive growth  The separation of its Technology business into a new healthcare information technology that will enable the company to concentrate on the primary pharmaceuticals distribution business  
This explains why Zacks Rank had Value  Growth and VGM all rated at  A  as of October 27  2016  The company is showing growth and focus on their most profitable sector  However  with its current standing  it s clear to why the stock was downgraded from a  3  Hold  to a  4  Sell  on the Zacks Rank

128111,349626,MCK,Q3  16 S P 500 Earnings Look Healthy  With Or Without Energy ,opinion,"The headline on this week s Thomson Reuters  This Week in Earnings  is that S P 500 earnings are  3 6  after 300 of the S P 500 companies have reported their 3rd quarter  2016  results 
Ex Energy  S P 500 have grown  6 7  
About a month ago  this blog predicted   based on historical surprise factors 
Now here is the catch  Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  reported their Q3  16 financial results Friday morning  October 28th  2016  while Thomson Reuters cuts off the data as of Thursday night  and with XOM s revenue miss  we could see different data as soon as Monday  October 31  16 
In other words  with XOM being  by far  the biggest component of the Energy space and Energy being the largest expected delta within the S P 500 over the next few quarters  the revisions for XOM and CVX matter 
Monday or Tuesday night  look for an update on Energy estimates on this blog  for Q4  16 and forward quarters 
Thomson Reuters by the data  as of Thursday  10 27 16
Forward 4 quarter estimate   128 97 vs last week s  129 16
P E ratio  16 5 x 
PEG ratio  4 4 x 
S P 500 earnings yield  6 07  vs last week s 6 03   Usually an S P 500 earnings yield above 6  has triggered a decent rally 
Year over year growth rate of forward estimate   3 74  vs last week s 3 83    Most recent high from late 2014 was over 7   Readers can see the dramatic effect the Energy collapse has had on S P 500 earnings  
Conclusion  This requires a separate blog post later this weekend  but for Q4  16  Technology and Financials are the two sectors seeing higher upward revisions  versus the current Q3  16 results  Again  it bears repeating many times for readers  but the trend in revisions at this time for forward quarters is usually downward  so to see upward revisions for a sector is an important tell 
The takeaway today is that Q3  16 earnings look very healthy  The financial media will crow how Q3  16 is the first quarter of positive earnings growth in the last 3 4 5 quarters  but that was easy to see coming just from the S P 500 earnings  surprise  factor  On average the S P 500 actual results usually come in 3    5  higher than the expected growth rate on Jan 1  April 1  July 1 and October 1 
Health Care was ugly this week  and again  because McKesson  NYSE MCK  and Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  reported Thursday night  and Friday morning  10 28 16  the revisions following those numbers are NOT in the Thomson Reuters data as of this weekend 
Our two largest sector overweights for clients are Technology and Financials  the rationale for the weightings was that these two sectors saw their bear markets last decade and thus all the valuation excess and optimism was flushed entirely from these sectors  which also happen to be the two largest sectors of the S P 500 comprising about 35  of the S P 500 by market cap   Health Care may now be the 2nd largest weighting in the S P 500 by market cap   now that real estate has been spun out from Financial s  but the out performance in Financial s since Q3 started and now with Health Care woes the last 8 weeks  might have narrowed some of the differential

128140,349655,MCK,McKesson s IT Business To Merge With Change Healthcare,opinion,"McKesson Corporation   NYSE MCK   announced that it will collaborate with Change Healthcare Holdings to create a new healthcare information technology company  We note that Change Healthcare is a leading provider of software and analytics  network solutions and technology enabled services  with Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group as its largest stockholder  
Structure of the New Entity
As per the terms of the agreement  McKesson will offer majority of its Technology Solutions businesses  The company will  however  retain RelayHealth Pharmacy and Enterprise Information Solutions  EIS  
On the other hand  Change Healthcare will contribute all of its businesses to the new company  excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing units  which will be owned separately by the current stockholders of the company 
McKesson and Change Healthcare will own approximately 70  and 30   respectively  of the new company 
This new entity has received funding of  6 1 billion  via funded debt  which will be used to repay existing debt of approximately  2 7 billion of Change Healthcare  make cash payments of  1 25 billion to McKesson and  1 75 billion to Change Healthcare 
What to Expect from the Transaction
The transaction is slated to close in the first half of 2017  As per the agreement  McKesson and Change Healthcare will make efforts to launch an initial public offering post closure  The combination of Change Healthcare s business with the majority of McKesson s Technology Solutions business will create a diverse portfolio of technological solutions which should help lower healthcare costs  improve patient access and outcomes  and make it simpler for payers  providers and consumers to manage the transition to value based care  
The new entity  with combined annual revenues of  3 4 billion  is expected to generate synergies in excess of  150 million by the second year of closing deal  Since the separate entity will focus solely on healthcare technology and technology enabled services  it should be able to respond more efficiently to customer needs and better deliver next generation innovations  while addressing the three important areas   cost  quality and outcomes   across the healthcare sector MCKESSON CORP Price
   Our Take
McKesson s Technology Business has been facing challenging conditions for quite some time now as revenues continued to decline  Hence  a spin off of the business was around the corner as the company was looking to focus on its core distribution business 
We believe that the separation is a positive for the company as it can now concentrate on its primary pharmaceuticals distribution business  This business has also been facing headwinds in the form of pricing trends and negative impact from customer consolidation in the healthcare supply chain 
Meanwhile  the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the EIS division and we believe a divestiture of this business is coming up

The company has beaten estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 0 45   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market  The company s distribution solutions segment recorded steady growth on the back of a robust performance of the U S  pharmaceutical business over the last few quarters 
Although the company faced challenges related to a shift in generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and customer consolidation in the pharmaceuticals business in the U S   McKesson expects the business to perform strongly   In Jun 2016  management raised its fiscal 2017 guidance due to the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016 09  as released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board  The standards primarily relate to stock based compensation 
The company also updated its guidance to reflect the impact of foreign currency exchange effects  related particularly to the British pound sterling denominated activities following the UK s exit from the European Union  The company continues to expect growth in the high single digits at the Distribution Solutions segment driven by market expansion and acquisitions in fiscal 2017 
On a constant currency basis  the pharmaceutical distribution and services business in North America is projected to grow in the high single digits as well  while international Pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues witness low double digit growth  Revenues at the  Medical Surgical distribution and services division are projected to grow in the mid single digits 
The company acquired Biologics and Vantage Oncology in Apr 2016 in a bid to expand specialty pharmaceutical distribution  oncology focused pharmacy offerings  and solutions for manufacturers and payers 
In Jan 2016  McKesson undertook a review of its cost structure and planned to realign its business model for better efficiency  value and innovation 
On the other hand  McKesson collaborated with Change Healthcare Holdings to create a new healthcare information technology company  McKesson will offer majority of its Technology Solutions businesses for the new company  It will  however  retain RelayHealth Pharmacy and Enterprise Information Solutions 
McKesson s Technology Business has been facing challenging conditions for quite some time now as revenues continued to decline  Hence  a spin off of the business was around the corner as the company was looking to focus on its core distribution business  The company is also evaluating strategic alternatives for its Enterprise Information Solutions business MCKESSON CORP Price and EPS Surprise
   What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model shows that McKesson is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates and McKesson has the right mix 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 20   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  3 38  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  3 34 
Zacks Rank  McKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  The combination of McKesson s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season 
Conversely  we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or  5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Ironwood Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ IRWD   has an Earnings ESP of 13 3  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is expected to report earnings on Aug 4

128175,349690,MCK,UDG Healthcare  Scope To Grow Faster With Sale Of Drug Distribution ,opinion,"UDG Healthcare  London UDG  plans to divest its drug distribution and travel health businesses to McKesson  NYSE MCK  for  408m  At 11 5x 12 month trailing EBITDA  the sales multiple looks attractive in view of McKesson paying 10 5x EBITDA for Celesio in 2014  The deal concludes UDG s transformation from low growth  low margin drug distribution to more dynamic and profitable healthcare outsourcing services  Our forecasts and valuation are under review 
We estimate the planned sale of Supply Chain Services  SCS  and MASTA travel clinics will accelerate UDG s pro forma operating profit CAGR FY16 20e from 6  to 8   The deal will reduce regulatory and pricing pressures  which have depressed SCS s operating profit from  46m in FY13 to  33m in FY15e  while joint operating profits in Sharp and Ashfield have grown from  48m to  87m 
Based on  27m divested EBITA   3m reduced interest costs and  1 2m lower corporate overhead  we estimate the deal will initially dilute earnings by c 20   2015e pro forma   However  we forecast UDG s pro forma FY15e financial firepower will rise from  130m to a minimum  380m  based on 2 5x debt EBITDA  excluding both  35m EBITDA in sold businesses and extra borrowing capacity from acquired EBITDA   as well as net cash of  103m after the deal  At 11x EBITA  UDG bought KP360 at 9x   UDG could buy  35m EBITA and offset the initial earnings dilution even including  12m interest costs  External and accelerated organic growth in Ashfield and Sharp may spur EBITA growth to a double digit level 
UDG announced that COO Brendan McAtamney will take over from CEO Liam Fitzgerald in March 2016  concluding a well flagged leadership transition process

128211,349726,MCK,Top Trade Ideas For The Week Of April 20  2015  The Rest,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Aetna  NYSE AET 
Aetna  AET  moved out of a  W  like consolidation in November and has just kept going  Currently it is taking a breather  as it consolidates between 105 and 110  While the MACD is resetting lower during the consolidation the RSI is holding in the bullish zone  Look for a break of the zone for the next leg higher or a retrace below 100 
Jd Com Inc Adr  NASDAQ JD 
JD com  JD  rose out of its IPO to a peak in September  Since then it has pulled back and then reversed in a rounded pattern  a Cup  Currently it is consolidating over the prior high  As it does so  the RSI is working off a technically overbought condition while the MACD is starting to roll over  The Handle may be forming in this consolidation or it may pullback to form it  The move higher out of it is what will make it interesting 
McKesson  NYSE MCK 
McKesson  MCK  has been trending higher since the October pullback with the market  What makes it interesting now is that the recent price action since late February shows consolidation of that move and a touch back at the rising trend support line  The RSI is now moving back higher  after holding in the bullish zone on the pullback  and the MACD crossed up last week  giving a buy signal 
Phillips 66  NYSE PSX 
Phillips 66  PSX  had a choppy pullback over the back half of 2014  But since the bottom in January it has recovered and is bouncing off of resistance at 80  The higher lows show some strength as it tightens against resistance  The RSI has held bullish and over the mid line during the consolidation while the MACD rest lower and is now flirting with a bullish cross 
Visa Inc  NYSE V 
Visa  V  is moving in a falling wedge as it pulls back from a top in early March  This is often a bullish pattern on the break of the wedge  As it moves lower the RSI is nearing the oversold region while the MACD has reset to levels where price has reversed in the past

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into next week sees the equity markets remaining positive in the longer run but mixed with a bit of trepidation in the short term 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue to hold around 1200 while Crude Oil continues its short term bounce  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to consolidate sideways while US Treasuries are biased higher if they break their consolidation range  The Shanghai Composite is on fire and frothy but who know when it will stop while Emerging Markets consolidate their recent move higher 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts suggest that the longer term view remains stronger while in the short term the IWM continues to be the strongest but with some short term trepidation and the SPY and QQQ with a decent possibility to start the week lower  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

128246,349761,MCK,What The Market Wants  More Waiting,opinion,September s first trading day opened flat but later gave way to volatility as the market retreated rather sharply on the heels of slightly weak economic data  Manufacturing ISM fell further below the neutral line of 50  to 49 6  despite forecasts that it would move ahead to 50 after last month s tepid 49 8 reading  That makes three consecutive down months for manufacturing  The market s downward momentum accelerated with the announcement that Construction Spending fell  0 9    much worse than the expected growth of  0 5  and last month s growth of  0 4   Fortunately  Motor Vehicle Sales late in the day helped continue a rally begun by Apple s invitations to a September 12 anticipated showcasing of iPhone 5  Auto sales were up  6 4  year over year and truck sales higher by a similar amount The market rallied into positive territory late in the day before succumbing to concerns about this week s ECB meeting and whether or not President Draghi can sell his three year sovereign debt purchases to assist Greece  Spain  and Italy  That meeting will be followed  about a week later  by the September Fed meeting which  hopefully  will reveal whether QE3 is ready for primetime or simply another tease from Bernanke  All of this uncertainty  coupled with our Presidential election and dysfunctional Congress  are likely to keep equity buyers on the sidelines  Our opinion is that current equity prices are reasonable  if not a tad on the cheap side  unless of course none of the above action items turn out positive for investors  The U S  economy could probably survive without QE3  however  Draghi s task is of particular concern  The amount of European sovereign debt held by banks could be disastrous if Greece  Spain  and Italy collapse  A decline in the euro would lead to downward EPS revisions in U S  equities and place them on an overvalued shelf With so few alternatives sellers are likely to be timid  Bond yields are so low that the downside risk is great if interest rates were to rise  Real estate is risky  precious minerals are expensive  and currency is a dangerous game to trade  The picture for equities remains the most enticing  unless no one acts to get world economies moving ahead faster 4 Stock Ideas for this MarketThis week  I created a custom search in MyStockFinder that picked stocks with strong GARP characteristics in the sectors and market caps favored in Sabrient s Market Stats  namely Cyclicals and Small caps  Here are four you may find interesting  including two Small caps and one Cyclical Consumer Globecomm Systems  Inc   GCOM  TechnologyEnergy Partners Ltd   EPL    EnergyMcKesson Corporation  MCK  HealthcareCooper Tire   Rubber Co   CTB  Cyclical Consumer,2012-09-05,David Brown,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-the-market-wants:-more-waiting-135190,135190

128249,349764,MCK,S P 500 Range Bound,opinion,"They say the trend is your friend  While the S P 500 may be going up  it has yet to really go anywhere in 2014  Every time it sells off the bears jump on the sell side  it sells off  and then stops  That s what it did last Friday and that s what it s done all year  As of Friday s close the S P is up 1 63   the Dow is up fractionally  0 04   while the NASDAQ Composite is down  2 51  
Rotations
At some point the S P will sell off  but until then it seems very range bound  Whether you re a bull or a bear  it s always important to keep an eye on the overall price action of the S P  Yes  the Russell and Nasdaq were weak  but it looked like the mutual funds were buying the Dow and S P and selling the Nasdaq and Russel  As weak as the markets may have been acting  the Dow rose to a record close on Friday while at the same time the Nasdaq ended its worst week in a month 
Friday to Friday

If you get the feeling that the S P isn t going anywhere right now  you re right  On Friday  May 2  the E mini  CME  ESM14  settled at 1874 50  and last Friday  May 9  the ESM14 settled at 1873 50  After all the hundreds of handles of up and down  the S P closed 1 handle  point  lower from the prior week  After all the thrashing  the S P didn t go anywhere 
Fridays  Mondays and Tuesdays
Clearly there are days when the S P goes up  like Turnaround Tuesday  and there are days the S P goes down  Recently Fridays have not been good  in fact  the S P has closed lower 6 out of the last 8 Fridays while 9 of the 17 Mondays this year have closed higher  with the last 4 all up  But the big day this year has been Turnaround Tuesday  of the 18 Tuesdays so far this year 15 have closed higher and 3 have closed lower  with 5 of the last 6 closing higher

128250,349765,MCK,Company Notes Digest  Retailers Stick To The Same Script,opinion,"It s half way through May and we re still talking about the weather
Every retailer pretty much stuck to the same script  business was weak in Q1 because of the weather
 Like other retailers in the United States  the unseasonably cold and disruptive winter weather negatively impacted our U S  sales and drove operating expenses higher than expected for the company   Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT  
 we were expecting sales to be stronger than they were at both Bloomingdale s and Macy s  and as I just stated  the weather clearly played a major role in the weakness   Macy s Inc  NYSE M  
 We had very tough business in February and March like everyone else  we were down something like  40 million to plan at one point just from weather   JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP  
Even online shopping is apparently not immune from the grip of cold weather
 Obviously  E Comm was also affected by some of the difficulty from a weather perspective in the quarter   Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  
Everyone agrees that things got better when the weather warmed up though
 once the weather warmed up  there was a significant change in the trend  So  again  a couple of weeks doesn t a quarter or a year make  But it is encouraging to see that and particularly in the northern climate  So that s part of why we re feeling confident   Macy s Inc  NYSE M  
 I m encouraged by the sales momentum in the back half of the quarter   Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT  
 I am encouraged by the consistent improvement that we saw as the quarter progressed   Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  
 we had a great recovery in April   JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP  
 Our business did get better as the quarter went on  First month was  February was the toughest month of the quarter for us and last month was the best   Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN  
But here s the rub  Q1 for retailers lasts Feb April  Bad weather affected only two out of thirteen weeks
 As we indicated in February  we realized negative comp sales during the first two weeks of the fiscal year from severe winter storms  A solid start to the spring season and a strong Easter holiday drove positive comps over the remaining 11 weeks of the quarter    WMT  
And April got a strong boost because Easter shifted later in the year
 April was very  very strong because of the shift in the Easter holiday    JCP  
When Macy s was pushed  they admitted they couldn t be sure it was all weather related
 While we aren t sure that all of the weakness in the quarter was weather related  we continue to believe that the underlying customer demand is strong enough to enable us to achieve our annual guidance    M  
And conceded that they planned for a so so consumer and that s what they re seeing
 when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year  We were not expecting the consumer to be all that strong  So that really hasn t changed with anything we ve seen in the first quarter  Obviously  could make it a little more challenging but we still think that the consumer is okay but not great    M  
Walmart makes an emphatic statement on accelerating inflation
 Q1 was marked by a rapid acceleration in inflation  as cost inflation was approximately 160 basis points  compared to 30 basis points in Q4    WMT  
If the weather is unfavorable  food inflation could get worse  uggh  more weather 
 even though supplies appear to be adequate  global grain and oil seed demands remain strong  Unfavorable growing conditions in any part of the world would hurt production  reduce the stock to use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher    DE  
Consumer
You have to invest heavily to stay on top of the pack in e commerce
 I don t know how a retailer could compete going forward without a really strong online presence and investing heavily to keep up with all that s happening technologically in that world    M  
 An important element is our technology investments  which represent  1 2 billion or 30  of our capital plan    JWN  
Home was a weak category for Macy s after a long run of strength
 it stood out for us too because as you know  home has been so strong for so long  So I m hoping it s just an outlier and by the second quarter that would no longer be the case  Early May is making us feel a lot better  But there s really nothing we re seeing on the competitive front that would lead us to be concerned about home longer term    M  
JC Penney may have steadied the ship
 as I go to stores I don t hear from associates that we re in misalignment at this point  I think we re back to running the business properly    JCP  
 I think we put to bed a lot of the previous anxieties and frankly our results will only enhance that we are going forward    JCP  
Millenials shop both online and in store
 There is sort of assumption that many people have that it s all online  is actually not the case  Millennials love shopping in stores as well as online and browsing in one channel and shopping in another  so both have been doing well    M  
Online shopping has made pricing much more competitive
 the competitive issue has been  it s been made more dramatic by the fact that the online business has really made things much more transparent and really better for customers if all the choices are out there    JWN  
Online and off price outlets are a way to generate new customer relationships
 we re not interested in isolating the channels  The reason we ve invested the way we have is because we want to have a complete offering online  in store  regular price and off pricing  We believe that that s going to allow us to engage with more customers and we also believe particularly in the online and off price segment that it s a great vehicle for us to acquire new customers  And we find that a lot of those customers do migrate to a regular price offering as time goes on  and we also have regular price customers that periodically look to shop at the Rack  And as long as we can continue to offer that more robust offering  we believe we re going to create more lifelong customers    JWN  
Healthcare
The healthcare landscape is shifting  everyone more focused on better quality of care at lower cost
 Pharmacies are increasingly positioning themselves as convenient alternative sites for primary care and offering services to patients to assist them in managing their health  Payers and providers are collaborating in innovative ways to design effective value based reimbursement programs that will slowly shift our fee for service based approach to a care delivery to our payment for value approach tied to outcomes delivered by providers  And consumers are more engaged in understanding the cost and quality of healthcare than ever before    MCK

Still too many dry bulk ships to balance the market
 we still say the same thing that the numbers of that available in the waters are too many  We have still vessels coming into the water demolition has been slowing down since its peak in 2012   Diana Shipping inc  NYSE DSX  
Diana is sorry for being right that everyone was overly optimistic
 We regret to say that we were once again correct in our way of thinking at the previous conference call where everyone was over optimistic about the market  And we said to you read the sign better and see that the market is not   the things are not so good as they were presented to you being    DSX  
The Dry Bulk market will improve eventually  but unlikely to get better in the next 12 24 months
 even though we assure that the market will improve eventually and it will improve significantly from the level at that we re now  we are not very optimistic about the next 12 to 24 months as regard to rate  which does not exclude spike in rate  especially spot rate  due to seasonal reasons or other disruptions in the supply stream of ships    DSX  
Private equity money is distorting the market
 big chunks of money that are coming into the picture from private investors and together with the capital market but they have distorted the way of thinking and they create a kind of not normal optimism about the market but influences everybody    DSX  
Low interest rates are also delaying the equilibrium
 there is also the very low cost of the money  If you have interest rates very low  then the equilibrium between the values does not come quickly stronger    DSX  
Farm income expected to decline slightly in 2014
 While remaining near long term averages  grain prices and farm income are expected to decrease in 2014  As a result  farm machinery demand is expected to be lower for the year   DAX 
Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom
Forecasting is a part of business  You do the best you can with the information you have 
 Like any other estimate that we have to make  whether it s brand inflation or generic inflation or generic launches  et cetera  what we attempt to do is use the best resources we have internal to the company and whatever resources are available externally to create those views It certainly could be wrong  and the manufacturers don t typically tell us what they re going to do   McKesson Corporation  NYSE MCK  
Enter new markets with an underdog mentality
 We go in with a lot of humility  it s not easy to go to another country and we have to win with the customer  So we re going in with an underdog mentality   Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN

128251,349766,MCK,Summer Slog Likely To Keep A Lid On Further Stock Gains ,opinion,"Stock investors entered the Fourth of July holiday on a high note  pushing the Dow Jones Industrials Index above 17 000 and the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index above 21 000  and even pushing the S P 500 to a smidge above the upper trend line of its long standing bullish ascending channel that has been in place for nearly three years  However  with the Independence Day cheer behind us  persistently overbought technical conditions  and two months of summer doldrums ahead until the Labor Day holiday  I don t think stocks are likely to muster much in the way of further progress over the near term  This may give bears a chance to make their long stymied move   Although bulls should be able to maintain the upper hand in the longer term  I expect bears will finally have their window of opportunity to drive prices down  at least a little  before summer is over 
Last week I reported that among the ten U S  business sectors  defensive and income oriented Utilities displayed the best first half performance  But last week was harsh on Utilities  allowing Energy to become the new leader  while Utilities fell into a virtual dead heat with Healthcare and Technology for second place  Basic Materials also has shown good strength of late  This recent action might suggest some early signs of positioning for rising inflation and interest rates on the horizon 
Although the U S  10 Year Treasury bond continues to remain strong with a low yield of 2 66   this is actually a bit of a spike from the prior week s close of 2 53   Nevertheless  some top bond fund managers are still predicting that the 10 year yield could fall as low as 2 2  this year 
While the CPI is showing no signs of inflation  there s no doubt that healthcare and housing costs are rising  But with the labor force participation rate on a downtrend and capacity utilization still relatively low  wage pressures and GDP will gradually rise  As a result  assuming the Fed starts raising interest rates by the end of next year  some  like Guggenheim Partners  are predicting 10 year Treasury yields to approach 4  over the next few years  Much of this capital should rotate into equities 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  continues on its slow trek toward the depths of single digits  closing the short week on Thursday at 10 32  While some observers have been predicting single digits for the VIX  others expect an imminent reversion to the mean  perhaps all the way up to test resistance at 15  But short of a major black swan event  catalysts for such a volatility spike seem scarce 
Indeed  investor sentiment is definitely not overly bullish  which means from a contrarian basis that there is plenty of fuel available to fill the tank  For example  there has been three straight months of outflows from U S  equity funds  Also  short interest in S P 500 stocks has been rising  trading volume is moribund  and individual investor participation remains low 
Furthermore  corporate stock buybacks continue in earnest  and with persistently low interest rates and wage inflation  central banks can continue their liquidity programs without constraint  This means that equity prices and P E multiples still have plenty of room to the upside 
Economists are expecting strong economic growth in the second half of 2014  Sell side analysts are anticipating record earnings per share for both the second quarter and the calendar year  Companies in the S P 500 are estimated to achieve 7 1  EPS growth compared with last quarter s actual of 3 4   However  top line revenues are only projected to grow at 2 6   indicating cost cutting and productivity gains as the key drivers  At some point  revenues will have to become the driver for earnings growth  Notably  all ten business sectors are expected to report positive growth 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed the short week on Thursday at 198 20  The upper line of the long standing bullish rising channel has been extremely tough resistance  but on Thursday SPY showed some desire to want to break through during the low volume  holiday shortened week  However  even if it succeeds this week  I believe the writing is on the wall for a failed breakout and a cycle back down to test the 50 day simple moving average and the lower Bollinger Band as we slog through the summer doldrums  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all acting fatigued at these heights and wanting to cycle back down  A successful test of the 50 day SMA  around 192 or so  would be healthy for bullish conviction by attracting fresh capital to make a new run at the 200 level  which is both psychologically attractive and ominous  Now that would be a test of resistance that I would really like to see 

By the way  the Russell 2000 small cap index has rallied from a May double bottom formation back above the 1200 level  but now might be forming a bearish double top formation 
Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each   
Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology remains in first place with a strong Outlook score of 87  although Energy is catching up fast at 82  Technology continues to display generally solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a reasonable forward P E  the highest return ratios  and good sentiment among Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates   Energy displays the most upward revisions from Wall Street  the second lowest forward P E  and the strongest insider sentiment  open market buying  this week  Healthcare takes third place  scoring 61  with solid sell side sentiment and a strong forward long term growth rate  while Financial and Industrial round out the top five  However  Financial and Industrial are both scoring well below the 50 mid point  so only three sectors are scoring above mid point  which is concerning  Notably  Utilities continues to fall  as well 
2   Basic Materials is in the cellar this week with an Outlook score of 14  as it displays the worst sentiment among both Wall Street analysts  downward revisions to earnings estimates  and insiders  open market selling   Telecommunications takes a rare trip out of the bottom spot but remains in the bottom two with a score of 20 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Technology is the leader with a relatively low score of 52  followed by Industrial at 51  while Utilities is the clear laggard at 35  The top bottom spread is 17 points  reflecting lower sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities is the clear leader with a 64  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Industrial displays the lowest score of 44  The top bottom spread is up to 20 points  reflecting lower sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  so this is promising 
5   Technology displays the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Telecom is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy is the leader  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Telecom scores the lowest  indicating general investor avoidance during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still look neutral  On the one hand  economically sensitive sectors Technology  Financial  and Industrial are all in the top five  while defensive sector Utilities continues to fall  But on the other hand  only three of the ten sectors hold an Outlook score above 50  and none of sectors are displaying very high Bull scores 
These Outlook scores represent the view that the Technology and Energy sectors are relatively undervalued  while Basic Materials and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests continuing to hold Technology  Energy  and Healthcare  in that order  in the prevailing bullish climate   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is still above its 50 day simple moving average while also remaining above its 200 day SMA
