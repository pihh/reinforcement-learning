Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  and welcome to the Ameris Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call   Operator Instructions  Please note this event is being recorded I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Stokes  Chief Financial Officer  Please go ahead Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Sarah  and thank you to all who have joined our call today  During the call  we will be referencing the press release and the financial highlights that are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at amerisbank com I m joined today by Palmer Proctor  our CEO  and Jon Edwards  our Chief Credit Officer  Palmer will begin with some opening general comments and I will discuss the details of our financial results before we open up for Q A Before we begin  I ll remind you that our comments may include forward looking statements  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  The actual results could vary materially  We list some of the factors that may cause result to differ in our press release and in our SEC filings  which are available on our website  We do not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information  early development or otherwise  except as required by law Also during the call  we will discuss certain non GAAP financial measures in reference to the company s performance  You can see our reconciliation of these measures and GAAP financial measures in the appendix to our presentation And with that  I ll turn it over to Palmer for opening comments H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Nicole  and thank you to everybody who s joined our call this morning  I m excited to share a few highlights about the quarter in the year and then I d like to spend some time discussing the plan and opportunities we have going into 2020 For the quarter  we earned  66 6 million  or  0 96 per diluted share on an adjusted basis  This represents a 1 47  return on average assets and an 18 45  return on tangible equity  As expected  our efficiency ratio improved this quarter to 55 61  as we continue to realize our cost saves from the Fidelity acquisition  And for the year 2019  we earned  22 9 million  or  3 80 per diluted share on an adjusted basis and this is up 12  over 2018  This represents a year to date return on assets of 1 52  and an improvement from the 1 50  reported last year  I m also pleased to report that our efficiency ratio improved during the year from 56 19  last year to 55 67  this year On our third quarter call  I reviewed  what we said we were going to do when we announced the Ameris and Fidelity merger and how we were tracking with those plans  And I m pleased to say that we continue to be on track with the plans  The core data conversion  as many of you know was completed in November  It was planned as any conversion  We certainly identified some things we can do better next time  but overall  the conversion went very well  We also closed two additional branches in the fourth quarter  bringing the total branches closed to 29  We ve had very little to no attrition of core deposits from these closures And one final example I want to share on how close we are to the stated plan is  we previously guided  we expected double digit growth in tangible book value in 2019 and that s even with the Fidelity dilution  And our actual growth in tangible book value was 10 5  for the year  That announcement we had modeled our tangible book value would be right at  20 80 and at the end of the year  we came in at  20 81  which was exactly in line with projections and this is quite an accomplishment and we remain focused on that tangible book growth Now I d like to turn our attention to the current plans  We recently spent several days with our Board of Directors on our strategic planning  and I have to say  we all walked away extremely energized about the future  When you look at the markets we operate in  we have critical mass and we ve got tremendous opportunity  In many of our markets  as you know are high growth areas with estimate growth rates of anywhere from 9  to 11  such as the Atlanta  Orlando  Jacksonville  Colombia  of course  the list goes on  Yet we still have the stability in the core strength of our non metro stable markets as well  Everyone keeps talking about disruption and how they re going to capitalize on it  and while we remain opportunistic and our markets are fully aware that we are in control of our own destiny We continue to look for and recruit top talent that also had the luxury of knowing that we can be successful on 2020 with our current A Team  Phonetic  that we have in place  So our focus remains for the execution of our organic growth strategy without distraction of M A at this time  And that focus really includes four core strategies  First one  being the core deposit funding  second is asset quality  third is operating efficiencies  and last but not least is growth in the tangible book value  And these are all strategies that will continue to drive shareholder value for the Company And I ll stop there now and turn it over to Nicole to discuss our financial results in more detail Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Palmer  As you mentioned  we re reporting adjusted earnings of  66 6 million  or  0 96 per share for the fourth quarter compared to  45 9 million  or  0 96 for the fourth quarter of last year  These adjusted results primarily exclude the merger charges  the losses on the sale of branch buildings  a partial reversal of the gain on BOLI  MSR impairment and expenses related to the government investigations that we announced in the fourth quarter  Including these items we re reporting GAAP earnings of  61 2 million  or  0 88 per share  The  66 million of adjusted net income represents a 45  increase over the fourth quarter of last year and the 96      0 96 per share EPS is consistent with what we reported last year  Our adjusted return on assets in the fourth quarter was 1 47   which was a slight decrease from the 1 57  reported last quarter and the 1 61  reported in the fourth quarter of last year  Our return on assets was negatively impacted during this quarter by elevated loans held for sale balances as we integrated our mortgage delivery teams and they had record production levels For the full year 2019  our adjusted ROA was 1 52   compared to 1 50  last year  Our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 18 45  in the fourth quarter of  19  compared to 18 95  last quarter and 20 95  in the fourth quarter of last year  For the full year  our 2019 adjusted return on tangible common equity is 18 74   compared to 19 18  last year  As Palmer mentioned  we remain focused on tangible book value  For the quarter  we saw an increase in tangible book of  0 52 in the quarter to  20 81  Ironically  this is the exact table book value per share that we had at June 30  2019  the day before the Fidelity acquisition  For the full year of 2019  we had over 10  increase in tangible book value of  1 98 per share from  18 83 at the end of last year to  20 81 at the end of this year  We re pleased with the increase in tangible book value  considering it absorbed the Fidelity as well as the repurchase of about  18 5 million of stock during the year During the fourth quarter  our net interest margin increased by 2 basis points from 3 84  to 3 86   This increase is mostly due to additional accretion income during the quarter related to the workout of a problem loans that had a large discount tied to it and also early payoffs from acquisitions  I don t think the future in accretion income will be as high as the fourth quarter and I think it will normalize in 2020 to about an average of  3 million per quarter  Also in the fourth quarter  the elevated mortgage loans held for sale negatively impacted our margin by 8 basis points I know I said last quarter that we expected to shrink that during the fourth quarter  but based on production  it actually increased  Basically  our mortgage group refill the bucket faster than they were selling  I don t want to sound like a broken record  So we are monitoring that level daily  and we have sales currently pending to bring that balance down by the middle of the first quarter  I believe the ongoing balance going forward to be in the closer to the  900 million range  as previously guided that in the  500 million to  600 million range  but I think with the two mortgage companies coming together and our elevated level of production will stay in that  900 million range going forward During the fourth quarter  our yield on earning assets declined by 4 basis points while our interest bearing deposits and total funding costs both decreased by 10 basis points  And for the year to date  our margin declined 4 basis points from 3 92  to 3 88  even with the three Fed cuts throughout the year  And during the year  our yield on earning assets increased by 17 basis points  while our funding costs increased by 34 basis points  Non interest income grew over 80  from the fourth quarter of  18 to the fourth quarter of  19  The increase in service charge income due to the additional deposit account from Fidelity was partially offset by the Durbin impact and our mortgage revenue grew over 179  this quarter  compared to fourth quarter last year  Mortgage production was strong in the fourth quarter at  1 6 billion  compared to  414 million in fourth quarter last year  We saw a slight decline in the gain on sale percentage and we anticipate that we ll return to higher levels in 2020 as we continue to manage product mix and pricing models between Fidelity and Ameris Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 55 61  this quarter from 57 25  last quarter  And for the full year 2019  our adjusted efficiency ratio improved from 56 19  to 55 67   We completed  as Palmer said  the core system conversion in November and we anticipate the realization of all cost saves by the end of the first quarter 2020 as we still had some administrative cost overhang in the fourth quarter numbers  However  some of these costs in the first quarter will be offset by typical first quarter cyclicality such as the increased payroll taxes that we will see in the first quarter  Total non interest expenses were  122 6 million for the quarter  However  when you remove the management adjusted such as the merger and conversion charges that I already mentioned  our adjusted non interest expenses totaled  118 3 million  down  8 5 million from the third quarter  Approximately half of that decrease within the core bank and administrative functions while the other half within the mortgage line of business  mostly in salaries and commissions On the balance sheet side  we ended the year with total assets of  18 2 billion  compared to  17 8 billion last quarter and  11 4 billion last year  We were pleased with our organic growth both on the loan and deposit side  Excluding the Fidelity acquisition  organic loan growth was  751 million  or 9 16  for the year  Organic loan growth this quarter slowed mostly due to seasonality and the continued repositioning of various portfolios  Total loan production in the bank was actually  1 1 billion  up over 81  from the fourth quarter of last year  Yields were down on new production  which was we expected due to the recent Fed cuts On the deposit side  we continued the momentum on non interest bearing deposits and improved our mix  so the non interest bearing deposits now represent 29 94  of total deposits  compared to 26 12  a year ago  And for the full year of 2019  our non interest bearing deposit growth was just over 15   as our bankers continue to be focused on core deposit growth to fund the overall bank growth  At the end of 2019  our loan to deposit ratio was 91   compared to 94  at the end of the third quarter and 88  at the end of last year  And credit quality remained strong  As you recall from our last call  we saw a slight bump in NPAs due to the Fidelity acquisition during the third quarter Our team was able to liquidate a significant portion of Ginnie Maes that caused that bump  So we re pleased to report that our non performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased 17 basis points  down to 56 basis points at the end of the year  This compares to 73 basis points last quarter and 55 basis points this time  For the quarter  our annualized net charge off ratio was 9 basis points of total loans  17 basis points of non purchased loans  For the full year 2019  our annualized net charge off ratio was 10 basis points of total loans and 15 basis points of non purchased loans  compared to 18 basis points of total loans last year and 27 basis points of non purchased With that    that was a lot of numbers  With that  I ll turn the call back over to Palmer H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerGreat  Thank you  Nicole  As said in the earnings release and I ll mention it again here  we went through a tremendous amount of change this year  including the largest conversion and integration in our Company s history  And to execute on our plan and deliver these types of financial results while having the distraction of everything that s happened this year is quite an accomplishment and I couldn t be more proud of our team  From the support staff to our customer facing teammates  these results are truly a group effort of the new combined Ameris team  And as we look forward into 2020  we remain up optimistic about the opportunities for growth and especially in the diversified lines of business that we have  However  that being said  we do operate in a very competitive market and we will not compromise the asset quality for the sake of growth So I ll close with this message again is that  you will see the Ameris continue to become more and more active but not more aggressive I d like to thank everyone for listening to our fourth quarter earnings results and we look forward to 2020 Now  I ll turn it back over to Sarah for any questions from the group Questions and Answers OperatorWe will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Tyler Stafford with Stephens  Please go ahead Tyler Stafford    Stephens    AnalystHey  good morning  guys and thanks for taking the questions Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Tyler Tyler Stafford    Stephens    AnalystI hopped on a couple minutes late  so I apologize if you covered this in the prepared comments  but Nicole just I did hear the outlook about the held for sale balance is coming back down toward around  900 million  So my question is  one  how quickly do you think it will get back toward that level  Is that to happen in the first quarter  And then  just in terms of the held for investment growth expectations for the year  can you guys comment on what you are expecting there Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  Hey  first  I ll talk about the mortgage loans held for sale  So we have sales in progress today  So we anticipate that will come down by the end of the first quarter  and I realize that I said that at the end of the third quarter that we have allocated some additional resources to make sure that does happen in the first quarter  And like I said  we are monitoring that daily  We re still funding that with short term FHLB advances  So as soon as that comes down  the FHLB advances can go back to normal levels as well  And I don t no  just to reiterate that that was about an 8 basis point decrease on the margin in the fourth quarter  having those lines go up instead of down So  and then your second question was on loan growth  And I think this goes a little bit to what Palmer has has alluded to  is that we are going to become more active but not more aggressive and then we are very cognizant of credit quality  So as we see things in the market changing  we will react accordingly  So I think in the past  we have guided loan growth in the 7  to 9   I think that will soften a little bit  and could come more in the 5  to 7   I think all of the    all of our analysts are close to that 7   but I definitely think that could come down a little bit from those 7  to 9  that I previously guided  We ll be closer in the  say  5  to 7   6  to 7  Tyler Stafford    Stephens    AnalystAnd just to be clear Nicole  is that 5  to 7  solely for held for investment growth or is that in the totality point to point total loan growth  which includes the run off or the declines in held for sale Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNo  that is just the held for investment Tyler Stafford    Stephens    AnalystOkay  All right  perfect  Thanks for clearing that up  So with that  I guess reversion of the held for investment  excuse me  held for sale balances by the end of the first quarter  can you just talk about the kind of margin expectations given continued if there is continued funding cost relief with    you guys were funding that held for investment I think with FHLB advances  I assume those are going to come down and then the held for sale balances will come down  So lots of kind of moving pieces there  Can you just give us a little bit of color on where you see the margin from here Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  And I think that s a great question  and you said that very well  So you ve got several components  So we ve got the mortgage loans held for sale piece  if that comes down and the FHLB borrowings come down  again  that was 8 basis points in the fourth quarter  assuming that we get that for at least half the quarter  So I think that could be a 3 basis point to 4 basis point pick up in the first quarter based on when I think those loans    when I think our balance is going to normalize in the first quarter Again  that s on     we were talking about GAAP margin  And I don t necessarily focus on the margin  excluding accretion just because that s a non GAAP measure  but when you look at our core margin    I m sorry  when you look at our GAAP margin this quarter that went up 2 basis points  We did have that elevated accretion in the quarter that we observed  We also had the loan for sale hit  So the net of those two was the positive two  When you look at our margin  excluding accretion that fell during the quarter by 11 basis points  but that had    did not have the accretion pick up  but it only had the held for sale pick up or decline  So our margin excluding accretion could potentially increase next quarter because that accretion bound is already out of that number  but we will have to pick up from held for sale And when we look at our balance sheet  we really do you have  especially if the Fed hold with no additional rate  we are very much asset neutral in both the short term and the long term  We actually have some positive momentum coming in on the deposit side  We were pleased with our reduction in rates there  But to give you an example  we have about 62  of our upcoming CDs that are maturing are greater than wholesale funding cost today  And just to give you an update on December  as an example  our CD production in December    so our maturing CDs that rolled into new CDs they averaged 56 basis point decline in those CDs  So that is  when you think about fourth quarter  really we absorb two Fed cuts  we absorb the September Fed cut and the December because September was so late and then also the December  So  to be able to say that our December CDs reprice 56 basis points  that s a greater than 100  data on this repricing of CDs  which we were very pleased with  That was probably too many details  but just to kind of give you some color on the momentum that we have going in Tyler Stafford    Stephens    AnalystYes  Okay  So maybe just to summarize the margin excluding the accretion as we head into 2020 should have a few basis points of upward movement giving the lower held for sale balances  Is that    is that few basis points of tailwind the right kind of way to think about that for the first quarter Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThat s exactly right  For the net interest margin  excluding accretion Tyler Stafford    Stephens    AnalystYes Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerAnd then our GAAP margin  I anticipate being fairly consistent Tyler Stafford    Stephens    AnalystGot it  Okay  I will hop out and let somebody ask questions  Thanks Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGreat  Thank you  Tyler OperatorOur next question comes from Casey Whitman with Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Casey Whitman    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning  Palmer and Nicole  How are you Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Casey Whitman    Piper Sandler    AnalystJust I guess  first I d touch on capital  So you bought back small amount of shares in the quarter  but maybe just update us on your thoughts around capital management here and the use of of buybacks as we think about 2020 Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  So our stock buyback  we did in    to timber our Board renewed for another  100 million of stock buyback  And then we realize it and we are seeing  you re saying that we are very cognizant of tangible book value and we want to preserve the capital at this point  And so a stock buyback is a little bit counter intuitive that but I think we will be opportunistic  we like having that in our tool belt  I don t think that we will go out  if we have  100 million approved  Our plan is not to go out and buy  25 million a quarter  But if we can buy a little bit each quarter  bring back a little bit of shares  but be able to absorb that tangible book value along the way  that s kind of what we re doing again  it s not our Number 1 strategy  but we ll be opportunistic if the opportunity comes up to buy stock of  6 million  Phonetic  worth a quarter Casey Whitman    Piper Sandler    AnalystUnderstood  And then just thinking about expenses  I guess my first question would be  are there more like one time cost to come between additional merger charges sale of bank premises anything like that that you expect going forward or is a pretty clean kind of run rate going forward here Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWe feel like it s a clean run rate going forward  The only thing that we still have  when you look at what we adjusted for management adjusted the things that will go forward unfortunately  or the government investigation legal fees concerning that will continue to be there and then also the branch sales  I mean  if we have empty branch buildings and we have an opportunity to sell  we have current appraisals on all those and we feel like they are valued correctly  but you always have the opportunity that if one came along and we had a sale on    I mean a loss on that  But as far as merger and acquisition  we feel like all of that is behind us  we ve got all of that accrued and recorded in 2019 Casey Whitman    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then just to be clear on just the remaining cost saves coming out  are those coming out of the bank segment  mortgage segment or kind of a combination of both Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerIt s a combination of both  We have still  I would say  of what s left  we ve got  it s probably a split 70 30 in kind of what I d say lines of business being whether that s mortgage and then the other 30   Well  actually  I d unlike the back and look at the numbers  it s closer to 60 40  60 in mortgage and 40 in administrative and bank side Casey Whitman    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  I guess  and then just one last question I ll ask on credit  Do you guys have a preliminary estimate for the loan loss adjustment for CECL or any kind of commentary around what the day to impact might be on provisioning levels Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  We actually have got  we are working on the disclosures for the 10 K so that will be much more robust  So I m going to be a little bit hesitant until we get all of that out in the 10 K in just a few weeks  But we have all of our day one  day two entry  So we have a lower boundary and upper boundary  In our lower boundary  we re going to give a range is about  30 million range that we ll put in the 10 K  In that range  the lower range of that is very  very close to what we said all along being our total allowance plus our total discounts  However  there is a portion of those discount that are not on PCI  PCD loans  So that will continue into our accretion  And that rolls into that  3 million accretion number I gave  So there will be a day one entry to retained earnings for the portion of going into the CECL allowance that was not in our discounts  Just to get    I will say on our unfunded commitments  that s a new component for CECL that range we believe it s  12 million to  17 million and that was not covered in our allowance or our discounts previously  So that is definitely a day one  And then we also had an additional that will come in as well in the first quarter  but we believe that the total adjust    we know that the total adjustment in the first quarter is in line with our expectations and will be absorbed by earnings in the first quarter  We shouldn t see capital go down at the end of the first quarter like some banks might Casey Whitman    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Great  thank you for taking my questions Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Casey OperatorOur next question comes from Brady Gailey with KBW  Please go ahead Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystHey  thanks  good morning guys H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystWhen we re talking about 5  to 7  loan growth just held for investment loans  does that include the impact of continued shrinkage of the indirect auto book Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerIt does  That 5  to 7  is net of that run off Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystOkay  great  And then looking at mortgage fees  I know fourth quarter is a seasonally soft quarter for mortgage  but we ve seen some mortgage peers have relatively good mortgage quarters this quarter  Looking at your mortgage fees  they were down about 37  linked quarter on an annualized  but was there anything    is there anything to note that would be included in those mortgage fees  I thought they would come a little better  So is there anything one time or anything to know within that mortgage fee line Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think it s actually at the third quarter was such an anomaly  The third quarter was very  very high for us  I mean it was higher than we had projected with the Ameris and the Fidelity combined and so I think fourth quarter was in line  I know that there was an article that there is another bank that picked up some of our mortgage bankers and I think I have that number right in front of me of what our Florida production lies  But there was not a decline in our Florida production  When you look at production in a mortgage  our overall    I mentioned  it is also well    I m jumping around a little bit  I don t need to do that  So fourth    third quarter  our production was  1 8 billion and our fourth quarter production was  1 6 billion  So that s a very small decline and a lot of that is just fourth    normal fourth quarter cyclicality  Our gain on sale percentage dropped from about 7 basis points  So  that accounted for some of that  And like I said  we anticipate that going back up  if we kind of work through some of the product mix and the pricing Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystAll right H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerMore specifically  your question    mortgage is still extremely robust for us and the Florida production this month was a record high  With that we did more volumes this month and for this quarter in Florida than we have historically in Florida  With the exit of several of those operations folks and a few of the originators  So we feel good about the production  And if you look more importantly  one of the things we always focused on and pride ourselves on is the purchase originations and if you compare last year s purchase origination volume fourth quarter to this year s is almost triple  So that kind of gives you an idea of the magnitude of the volume that we ve been able to generate  especially  when you combine two large mortgage operation  So Robert Odom and his team have done an excellent job of doing the just that Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystAll right  that s helpful  And then finally for me Palmer  I hear you on that M A pause  We have seen several notable Southern merger of equals  and it s not the traditional one bank by another but kind of a MOE style deal  Is that    when you say an M A pause  are you more talking about you guys just continuing to buy other banks or would you consider some sort of a big picture strategic MOE with a life size bank at this point H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think we ve been pretty consistent in our response there  Our focus remains on the organic opportunities we ve got in the incredible markets we re blessed to be in  So  we just don t need that distraction right now  We re getting the Fidelity acquisition fully integrated  we ve got all of our right people in the right seats  and there s just tremendous opportunity here and we just don t need any distract from the M A right now  And that s very consistent with the four to six quarters that we had said from the inception  So nothing has changed there Brady Gailey    KBW    AnalystOkay  Got it  Thanks for the color guys OperatorOur next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust  Please go ahead Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystThank you  Good morning Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Jennifer Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystNicole  question on expenses  you said  obviously there is seasonality in first quarter every year  But you ll realize the rest of your cost savings from LION  So as a result  do you think expenses will be flattish sequentially between fourth and first quarter Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI don t    I think there is still room for a slight decline from the second    from the fourth quarter of this year to the first quarter of next year  I do think it will be a slight decline as we continue to have    like I said  we had an administrative overhang  so even though conversion was November 1  we held a lot of employees    retained a lot of employees to make sure that that was all clear before they were displaced  And so  we do anticipate  but I just wanted to warn everybody  we always seems like every first quarter there is always    you ve got payroll taxes and some various other things that increase  One thing I wanted to    maybe it will help when we were looking back and kind of going through some of our budgeting and strategic planning  when you look at Ameris and Fidelity combined  from 2018 to the 2020 expectations  our non interest expense is about a 6  to 7  increase  but our revenue growth is greater than 15   And I think that s really where we are working really hard to make sure that we execute on all of those cost saves  And then we continue to drive revenue  but there were a little    there are a few other projects that will help efficiencies where we re reallocating some resource  and so we re definitely working to keep that efficiency ratio in the 54  range  to continue to drive that down below 54  Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystYes  Okay  And can I had to hop on a few minutes late  Can you talk about any merger disruption opportunities you guys have been able to capitalize on thus far H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerYes  We remain  Jennifer  focused on the customer side of that equation  Obviously  we continue to look and interview for opportunities with talent  But as I mentioned earlier  we were just fortunate to already have boots on the ground and talent in place to capitalize from the customer side  So a lot of the growth you re seeing  we ve had some really good success on the core deposit funding side from the disruption and the loan side remains extremely competitive  but we are getting a lot of looks at deals  some are probably a little too rich for us in terms of pricing but those opportunities I think will continue to exist as we move forward with the disruption in the market  We did hire  just    this quarter  we focused    the new hires we had on the lending side has been predominantly on the C I side  and there are a couple down in Florida and then we ve got two or three in Georgia that we hire this quarter Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystOkay  Great  thank you Operator Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from David Feaster with Raymond James  Please go ahead David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystHey  good morning  guys Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  David David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystJust a quick one  Following up on the seasonal expenses  do you have a    could you quantify what the FICA and the payroll taxes are just kind of on a combined basis  The expectations for the first quarter Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWe can  I need to    give me one second  Maybe I should sing and dance  I don t have it right in front of me  but I will have it in just a few   David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystAnd I guess if there is    on the FDIC credit if you guys have any remaining and when you expect that to normalize Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWe do have a little bit remaining and we ll use that in the first quarter  And so you ll see that bump come in the first quarter as well  That is another thing that will come out David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystI guess just  I ll ask something on the hiring front  Have you seen any change in the tone of conversations or the pace of conversations  Anecdotally  I ve heard that things that might have picked up now that some of the deals have closed  And I guess just what are your expectations for new hires in 2020 H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerI ll tell you  our expectations are probably different than others in terms of our dependencies  We have less of a dependency on having to hire lenders  as many others did  that are new entrants into the market just because  as I mentioned earlier  we ve got so many people already in place to take advantage of the opportunity  But I do think  to your point there is some acceleration and discussions  a lot of these payouts with the larger disruption  meaning the Church hit  those are February and March  and so I think you ll start seeing some movement first quarter there  end of the first quarter  and that s something I think will start to shift a little bit more  but the    right now  the main thing we ve got our existing team focused on are the customer opportunities  In addition  obviously looking for new talent  But I think that shift will continue to accelerate this quarter David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystGot it Nicole S  Stokes    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerAnd David  that payroll tax is a little shy of  2 million David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  Terrific  And then just kind of    we talked about it briefly  but credit s been very benign for you all  But I d be interested to hear your thoughts on credit  whether you re seeing anything in the market that s causing you any concern either in Florida or Atlanta  it just kind of the competitive landscapes in your markets Jon S  Edwards    Executive Vice President   Chief Credit OfficerSure  David  The market is still pretty robust in general  especially in our four state footprint  and there are really very few lending opportunities that we are really looking at right now  But the competitiveness as Palmer put it  we are more active in less and not more aggressive  So the competitiveness of the landscape is may be on the more aggressive side and we ve had to kind of really look hard at that  But from a market perspective  there s plenty of new investment going on  there s plenty of new growth  there s plenty of new folks coming in  So the market is still remain pretty robust David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystAre there any specific segments where you re seeing that aggressiveness  And do you see it more in Florida or Atlanta  And I guess  from whom  Is it the big guys or non bank lenders H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerI think you have to kind of define what the growth aggressiveness  Phonetic  is  I mean if it s pricing that s consistent throughout the markets in which we operate  A lot of that is because we are in some very competitive market  From an asset quality standpoint  most of the banks have been pretty disciplined from what we ve seen out there  Where you start tinkering with structure though in terms of amortization or REIT non recourse  that s where we re starting to see a little pickup on deals that we did not see in the past  But in terms of cash flow and operations and solid sponsors that seems to be pretty consistent throughout  I m not seeing a large or small banks kind of get too aggressive on that front David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  Perfect H  Palmer Proctor Jr     President   Chief Executive OfficerIt s mainly on the structure and terms David Feaster    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  Thanks for the color Operator

107095,328610,ABCB,Should Value Investors Consider Ameris  ABCB  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Ameris Bancorp   NASDAQ ABCB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ameris Bancorp or Ameris has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 24  as you can see in the chart below   This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Ameris  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years   Further  the stock s PE also compares pretty favorably with the Zacks   Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 66  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Ameris has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 0  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for ABCB stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Ameris has a P S ratio of about 2 93  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ameris currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes the stock a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio comes in at 10 88  which is far better than the industry average of 11 53  Clearly  the stock is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though ABCB might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives ABCB a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen three downward revisions with one upward movement in the past sixty days  For the next year  the estimate has seen two downward revisions in the same time period with one movement in the opposite direction This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus estimate has decreased 2 7  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched down 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Ameris Bancorp Price and Consensus   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmeris is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 39  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Southeast Banks industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you can do today to become one
