33579,255094,VRSN,Internet Software   Services Outlook  Ripe For The Picking,opinion,"The Internet Software   Services industry is a relatively small industry primarily involved in enabling platforms  networks  solutions and services for online businesses and facilitating customer interaction and use of Internet based services    
Here are the three major themes in the industry As businesses increasingly move their operations to the cloud  the demand for enabling software and services will continue to increase  This means high costs for players as they continue to expand their offerings in the race to grab more business  As a result  most players continue to make little to no profit despite strong revenue growth  It follows that the general level of industrial growth and progress also impacts the amount of business transacted online The level of technology adoption by businesses and the proliferation of connected consumer devices that might help people connect and do business online also impacts growth  As a result of the high penetration of mobile devices among users  it now makes sense for businesses to adopt technology that they earlier stayed away from because of the cost involved Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects
The Zacks  industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  29  which places it at the top 11  of more than 250 Zacks industries  It includes players like VeriSign  NASDAQ VRSN   VRSN  
The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates that near term prospects remain bright  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analyst confidence on the group s earnings growth potential is wavering  although there s some improvement in the last few months  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year is down 5 6  
Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture 
Industry s Stock Market Performance Is Impressive
The past year s performance of the Zacks Internet   Software   Services Industry shows a net gain over the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector as well as the S P 500 index 
Aggregate share price of the industry appreciated 19 7  over this period compared to the S P 500 index s gain of 7 1  and broader sector s increase of 8 2  
One Year Price Performance

 
Industry s Current Valuation
On the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Internet companies  we see that the industry is currently trading at 32 8X compared to the S P 500 s 17 0X  It is also overvalued compared to the sector s forward 12 month P E of 20 2X 
In fact  the industry is currently trading at the upper end of its annual range of 40 2X to 27 0X but below the median value of 35 8X  as the chart below shows 
Forward 12 Month Price to Earnings  P E  Ratio

Bottom Line
The Zacks Internet   Software   Services market should continue to see secular revenue growth because the underlying drivers are strong  However  profitability will take time  So it s mainly recommended for long term investors 
Buy ranked stocks aren t hard to find in the Zacks Internet   Software   Services market  So here are some of our picks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

33580,255095,VRSN,VeriSign  VRSN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects VeriSign  NASDAQ VRSN  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This internet infrastructure services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 31 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 5  
Revenues are expected to be  308 32 million  up 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for VeriSign 
For VeriSign  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that VeriSign will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that VeriSign would post earnings of  1 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 33  delivering a surprise of  3 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
VeriSign doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verisign-vrsn-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200474699,200474699

33615,255130,VRSN,VeriSign  VRSN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"VeriSign  NASDAQ VRSN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This internet infrastructure services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 24 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 9  
Revenues are expected to be  302 44 million  up 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for VeriSign 
For VeriSign  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that VeriSign will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that VeriSign would post earnings of  1 21 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 58  delivering a surprise of  30 58  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in

33635,255150,VRSN,VeriSign  VRSN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"VeriSign  NASDAQ VRSN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This internet infrastructure services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 3  
Revenues are expected to be  306 52 million  up 1 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for VeriSign 
For VeriSign  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that VeriSign will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that VeriSign would post earnings of  1 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 31  delivering a surprise of  5 65  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

VeriSign shares have added about 46 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for VeriSign 
While VeriSign has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for VeriSign was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

33664,255179,VRSN,Top Research Reports For Comcast  ConocoPhillips   Delta Air Lines ,opinion,"Wednesday  October 31  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Comcast  CMCSA   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked Comcast s shares have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry year to date  losing  5 8  vs   11 4  in the space  Comcast s third quarter 2018 results benefited from solid growth in the number of residential high speed Internet customers  
Advertising revenues also increased due to higher spending on political advertising  Moreover  strong adoption of Xfinity Home drove top line growth  The Zacks analyst thinks the nationwide rollout of the DOCSIS 3 1 technology and the completion of the nationwide rollout of Comcast s wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand will continue to boost subscriber base  Partnerships with the likes of Charter  Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Prime are other positives  
The Sky acquisition expands Comcast s international reach  Sky s content portfolio strength is a major growth driver  However  the company continues to lose voice and video subscribers due to cord cutting and stiff competition  Additionally  high debt level is a headwind 
 You can   
Shares of Buy ranked ConocoPhillips are up  33 5  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks U S  Integrated Oil industry  which has gained  13 7  over the same period  In terms of production and proved reserves  ConocoPhillips is the largest oil and gas exploration and production  E P  player in the world  
The company recently reported strong third quarter 2018 results  courtesy of higher oil realizations and strong volumes from unconventional assets  The Zacks analyst thinks there are significant opportunities for the upstream energy player in the Eagle Ford where it owns about 3 400 undrilled locations  In fact  a strong focus on two other prospective resources like Delaware basin and Bakken shale is expected to help ConocoPhillips achieve its target of 22  CAGR of production through 2017 to 2020  
Importantly  through 2017  the firm had lowered its debt load by 30   thereby enhancing its credit rating  Consequently  ConocoPhillips offers substantial upside potential from the current price levels and is a preferred E P company to own now 
 You can   
Delta Air Lines  shares have lost  1 5  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Airline industry s  21 8  decline  The stock has also outperformed fellow airline heavyweight  American Airlines  which has declined  33 4  in the same time frame  Delta performed impressively in the third quarter of 2018  despite high fuel costs  Both earnings and revenues surpassed the respective estimates and improved year over year  
Strong demand for air travel aided results  causing passenger revenues to increase 8 2   Anticipating travel demand to remain strong  Delta raised its view pertaining to revenue growth for 2018  The Zacks analyst is also impressed by the company s efforts to reward its shareholders  
Despite the robust third quarter performance  the threat posed by rising fuel costs  which increased 32 1  in the third quarter  is a major concern  Also  its fuel bill rose 35  in the quarter  Fuel costs are anticipated to be between  2 47 and  2 52 per gallon in the final quarter of 2018  Expenses on the labor front might also limit bottom line growth

VeriSign shares have added about 17 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9  
What s Next for VeriSign 
While VeriSign has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

You can see 
Visa s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year   20 5  vs   16    Visa s first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings beat expectations and increased year over year  The results were driven by growth in payments volume  cross border volume and processed transactions  and a lower tax rate  
The Zacks analyst thinks Visa s strategic acquisitions and alliances  technology upgrades and effective marketing have paved the way for long term growth and consistent increase in revenues  Visa is well poised to gain from growing electronic payment processing and a solid brand name  Its strong capital position enables investments in business  
Nevertheless  high client incentives and operating expenses  and foreign exchange volatility might put pressure on margins  Softness in cross border volumes is another concern

Shares of Charter Communications have outperformed the Zacks Cable TV industry over the past year   1 4  vs   5 1    Charter s fourth quarter 2018 revenues increased on growth in Internet  video  advertising and commercial revenues  Growth in Internet customers and rate adjustments aided Internet revenues in the reported quarter  
Additionally  Charter s Spectrum Internet Gig service  which uses DOCSIS 3 1 technology  is available across its entire footprint  The Zacks analyst thinks this service  which provides enhanced Internet speed is expected to further boost subscriber growth  Moreover  Charter s All Digital initiative  which will help the company offer advanced products and services and enhance video picture quality is now complete across its entire residential and business footprint  
However  Charter s bottom line suffered due to higher interest expense  The company continues to struggle in a saturated and competitive multi channel U S  video market

Biogen s shares have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past year   2 5  vs   17 1    Biogen beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q4  Biogen has a strong position in the MS market  The Zacks analyst likes the company s efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke among others  
Meanwhile  its newest drug Spinraza is performing well and has multi billion dollar potential  Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline are encouraging since several of them have transformative potential  Several data readouts are expected in 2019 with multiple potential launches in the early 2020s  
However  its core MS business  excluding Ocrevus royalties  has been largely flat  Also  potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern  Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area

33669,255184,VRSN,Congress expected to reboot Internet tax issues in 2015,news,"By Kevin Drawbaugh
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Congress is moving this week toward putting off until 2015 any conclusive action on a tangle of Internet tax issues  including online access taxes and online state sales taxes 
Though technically separate  the two have become entwined by political maneuvering  with a holding action in the works on Capitol Hill  according to analysts and lobbyists 
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said on Tuesday  as expected  that a one year extension of a moratorium on any new taxation of Internet access will be included in a massive stopgap spending bill still being negotiated in Congress 
That will likely leave until next year consideration of the broader question of possibly making that moratorium permanent  as well as demands for a new approach to online sales taxes 
 What we re looking at is kicking the can down the road and putting this issue into 2015   said Clay Brockman  an analyst at Height Securities 
Bricks and mortar retailers have pushed for years for empowering the 45 states that charge sales taxes to require etailers to collect it on online purchases  At present  only some states require this and only for some etailers 
The inconsistency of the system gives many online merchants that do not collect sales tax a pricing advantage over traditional stores that must  under law  collect sales tax 
Online shoppers are supposed to submit payment for tax due  but almost no one does  As a result  many online purchases are tax free and cheaper than in store purchases 
The Democratic led Senate approved a bill last year to enable states to force collection of sales tax on Internet purchases  but it stalled in the House of Representatives  Republicans there opposed it as a tax increase even though online shoppers were already  by law  supposed to pay sales tax 
Separately  the House in July approved a bill to permanently ban new taxes on Internet access  The Senate did not approve that bill  but some House and Senate lawmakers crafted new legislation that would both extend the Internet access tax moratorium and close the online sales tax  loophole  
That  too  stalled after state and local governments pushed back  with as much as  500 million in tax revenue on the line and potentially more put at risk by a multi year moratorium 
House Republican leaders have signaled that all these matters are likely to be taken up again early in 2015  when Republicans will control both the House and Senate

    Intel s earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector  but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with the chipmaker s competition  Of late  the company has been sensing the pressure from the likes of NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  and Avanced Micro Devices  Nvidia s artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry  while AMD has doubled down on its server chips  And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever important gaming segment   Read   However  we anticipate the company s strong growth at the data center group segment to cushion its top  and bottom line results  Increasing demand for data storage and high performance networks has been propelling this segment s growth  As the number of smartphones and Internet connected devices escalates  along with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing  Intel s Data Center business will expand The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s revenues is pegged at  4 82 billion  representing year over year growth of 6   As Intel s data center business accounts for nearly half of the company s operating margin  the benefit of increase in segment s revenues will trickle down to the bottom line as well We expect Alphabet s third quarter 2017 results to benefit from strength in paid clicks  solid advertising revenues  mobile search ads and increasing momentum in the Other Bets segment  Also  increasing use of machine learning features in Google Maps  YouTube  Gmail and Google Photos will drive top line growth We expect paid clicks to grow in the to be reported quarter  driven partly by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube  YouTube remains a strong contributor  benefiting from the heightening online video consumption  More than a thousand creators are currently engaged in the platform  bringing in a thousand subscribers every day The company s advertising revenues will likely be driven by healthy growth in its mobile search ads  YouTube ads and programmatic advertising  Furthermore  given an encouraging performance of the Other Bets segment during the second quarter  we estimate the segment to continue its momentum this quarter as well In addition to this  the increasing use of machine learning features in Google Maps  YouTube  Gmail and Google Photos will continue to drive top line growth in the upcoming quarter   Read   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s revenues is pegged at  21 94 billion for the quarter under review  up 20 1  from third quarter 2016  Moreover  the Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  8 39 per share and the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Alphabet Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

33734,255249,VRSN,Tech Earnings Roundup  GOOGL  AMZN  MSFT  INTC  TWTR  More,opinion,"It s the second week of earnings  and nearly all the biggest companies have reported  So let s get started 
Alphabet  Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   reported a strong quarter beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates on both top and bottom lines  Google earned more in the last quarter at lower margins as volumes came at the cost of weaker pricing and rising traffic acquisition costs  especially to distribution partners such as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  
But the company also exercised notable cost discipline that included the use of artificial intelligence to lower cooling costs by 40  and overall electricity costs by 15   Reduced losses at Other Bets also contributed  This enabled it to generate solid cash flows with the balance sheet cash crossing  100 billion   Read more  
Amazon  If you re waiting to see increase in Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   profitability  you re going to have a long wait  Amazon s earnings growth comes from the increased scale of its business rather than its ability to squeeze out stronger margins  So it s satisfied with tiny margins to deliver large amounts of goods and services to customers  That s why a capital intensive business like AWS  which is growing in leaps and bounds  actually expands its margins  it would have done the opposite to most technology companies  
But then Amazon isn t just a technology company  Most of its revenue comes from retail  where it is pushing many traditional players out of business while opening its own physical stores to support its online model  Amazon s success stems primarily from the fact that Bezos thought about it first  So things like the quick  free shipping that it offers has quickly set the benchmark that others must also deliver on  Only  Amazon is the one with the warehouses  trucks  planes and partnerships that can make this possible at the kind of volumes that it does 
So like it or not  it will continue on its own path  beating estimates along the way  But investors would do well to look at the free cash flow  less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases  and ROA  which are showing a not unexpected but not so positive trend  Read more  
Microsoft  The strength in the software giant s first quarter earnings results was attributed to Microsoft s   NASDAQ MSFT   growing cloud prowess  And rightly so  because Microsoft is working to become a cloud first company  The highlight of the quarter was the  20 4 billion annualized revenue runrate it said it achieved from its commercial cloud business because that was a target it set for some time in 2018 
Of course  Microsoft multiplies revenues in the last month of the quarter by 12 to arrive at the annualized rate instead of quarterly revenue by 4 the way AWS does  so results may just look a bit more favorable  Around 89  of this business is annuity based lending visibility and improved prospects for the future 
To be fair  the rest of the business also did rather well  with Windows taking slight share  according to management calculations   Surface and search growing double digits each and gaming software services XB Live users also growing strongly  Read more  
Intel  Intel   NASDAQ INTC   beat our estimates on both the top and bottom lines  sending share prices soaring  The company still remains hugely dependent on the PC market where its continued innovation ensured a 55  revenue share in the last quarter  The data center side of things looks good  although investments in AI and other technology are currently a pressure on profits 
Recent acquisitions of Altera and Mobileye  OTC MBBYF  and its partnership with Micron have added muscle to three other product lines segments  So Intel has several strong growth engines that should help it tap emerging opportunities in IoT  self driving cars and more  This structure  however  means that nearly half the business  non PC  is growth oriented  so this half will pressure profitability  Therefore  it s encouraging to note that Intel intends to bring opex down to about 30  of revenues by 2020  Read more  
Twitter  The benefits of restructuring are clearly showing on Twitter s   NYSE TWTR   quarterly performance  So while revenues declined again in the last quarter  on a larger user base and weaker pricing   its losses continued to come down 
Encouragingly  user growth and ad engagements improved in the last quarter  although management focuses on the daily active user  DAU  metric rather than the monthly active user  MAU  metric generally used for such platforms  That s again probably not a bad thing since the company recently admitted that it has been miscalculating inflating its MAU growth numbers  Read more

33736,255251,VRSN,Top Stock Reports For Apple  NextEra   Ford,opinion,"Thursday  February 15  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Apple  AAPL   NextEra  NEE  and Ford  F   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Apple s shares are up  23 6  over the last one year  outperforming the S P 500  up  15 5   and in line with the Zacks Technology sector  up  20 5    Apple reported strong earnings and top line growth in first quarter 2018  
The company s top line growth benefited from iPhone X s higher average selling price  ASP   which offset sluggish unit sales growth  Paid subscriber base grew in the Services segment  which reflected strength in portfolio  Going forward  the Zacks analyst thinks Apple s foray into fast growing technologies like autonomous vehicle  artificial intelligence  AI    AR VR will drive growth in the long haul  
Moreover  Apple s new investment plan will boost its subscription based services business and put an end to the criticism it is facing for not creating enough jobs in the United States  Additionally  the impressive cash balance  post the tax reform  is expected to boost shareholder value  However  the sluggish demand for iPhone X remains a concern amid intensifying competition

Shares of NextEra have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry over the last one year  the stock is up  19  vs   3 5  decline for the industry   NextEra Energy s performance was mixed with its earnings lagging expectation while total revenues surpassing the same in the fourth quarter  
The Zacks analyst stresses that the company s investment to strengthen its infrastructure and ongoing capital projects  when completed  will help it serve its expanding customer base more efficiently  The company s focus on clean energy has helped it lower emission levels  and use of new technology has saved on energy bills for its customers  
The natural gas pipelines  which came online in first half of 2017  are expected to boost its performance  The company s nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal  state and other regulations  Despite investments made to strengthen its infrastructure the unpredictable nature of natural disaster could derail normal operation and impact profitability

Ford s shares have underperformed the Zacks Domestic Automotive industry over the last three months   10 8  vs   2 7    Ford s recent plans to rev up production of new Lincoln Navigator   Ford Expedition at its Kentucky factory  is expected to drive its profit margins and create challenges for its rivals  
The company reported mixed fourth quarter earnings  Ford is expanding its production capacity in many emerging markets to facilitate supply  cost reduction and manage transportation challenges  It has been making quite a large amount of investment for the development of next generation cars  which can be beneficial in the long run but are likely to create short term strains on the financials of the company

33737,255252,VRSN,Godaddy Inc  Overstated Profits Can t Even Justify This Stock s Valuation ,opinion,"Check out this week s  with Chuck Jaffe of Money Life 
We first rang alarm bells on this company when it went public in April 2015  Since then  profits have declined and the market has grown more competitive  yet the stock has tripled 
Now  the firm s lack of resources  relative to competitors  and low profitability make the expectations baked into the stock price look overly optimistic  These issues  and more  make Godaddy Inc  NYSE GDDY      61 share  this week s Danger Zone pick 
Revenue Growth and Accounting Earnings Mislead Investors
We leverage our Robo Analyst technology to analyze the footnotes and MD A in company filings to get an accurate look at a company s true profitability  Through this work  we find that GoDaddy s GAAP net income was artificially increased in 2017 due to hidden  and non hidden  non operating income 
We made 10 adjustments to GoDaddy s 2017 income statement  with a total value of  279 million  One of the larger adjustments was the removal of  32 million  23  of GAAP net income  in non operating income related to the gain on   We also removed  123 million  90  of GAAP net income  in tax receivable agreement liability adjustments included on the income statement 
After taking into account all adjustments  we removed  86 million in non operating income from GAAP net income  These adjustments revealed that despite GAAP net income increasing from   17 million in 2016 to  136 million in 2017  after tax profit  NOPAT  fell from  54 million to  50 million over the same time 
This disconnect in GAAP net income and the true recurring profits of the business is not new either  Since 2015  GDDY s net income has grown from   47 million to  136 million while NOPAT has fallen 10  compounded annually  per Figure 1 
Figure 1  GDDY s Misleading GAAP Net Income



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The decline in NOPAT stems from NOPAT margins falling from 4  in 2015 to 2  in 2017  At the same time  average invested capital turns  a measure of balance sheet efficiency  have fallen slightly from 0 70 in 2015 to 0 68 in 2017  Falling margins and inefficient capital use have dropped GDDY s return on invested capital  ROIC  down from 3  in 2015 to 2  in 2017 
Lack of Comparability in Shifting Non GAAP Metrics 
We ve long warned investors about companies using non GAAP metrics to obscure actual profits  GoDaddy s use of non GAAP takes this misleading practice one step further and limits comparability to previous years by changing the non GAAP metric on which they tell investors to focus  At the end of 2016  GoDaddy stopped reporting adjusted EBITDA  which removed significant expenses  such as equity based compensation  from its calculation  In its place  the firm began reporting  unlevered free cash flow   which is supposed to  evaluate the business prior to the impact of its capital structure and after tax distributions   Unlevered free cash flow adds back cash paid for interest and cash paid for acquisition related costs 
Both metrics significantly overstate the profitability of the business  Adjusted EBITDA removes real operating expenses and completely ignores the balance sheet  while  unlevered free cash flow  doesn t take into account the costs of acquisitions  like GoDaddy s  1 8 billion acquisition of HEG in 2017  Switching between the metrics exaggerates their flaws by making it difficult to compare profitability between periods 
In either case  Figure 2 shows that non GAAP metrics provide a misleading picture of GDDY s profitability  From 2015 2016  adjusted EBITDA increased from  147 million to  263 million  When calculating adjusted EBITDA  GoDaddy removed  40 million   100  of net income  and  57 million   100  of net income  in equity based compensation expense in 2015 and 2016 respectively  Meanwhile  economic earnings  the true cash flows of the business  fell from   65 million to   68 million 
Figure 2  GDDY s Non GAAP Metrics Paint False Picture of Firm


  Prior to 2016  GDDY reported Adjusted EBITDA  which was replaced by Unlevered Free Cash Flow in 2016
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
From 2016 2017  unlevered free cash flow rose from  357 million to  496 million  while free cash flow fell from  161 million to   1 5 billion and economic earnings fell from   68 million to   152 million 
Compensation Plan Rewards Execs Despite Shareholder Value Destruction
GoDaddy s executive compensation misaligns executives  interests with shareholders  interests  The misalignment helps drive the profit decline shown in Figures 1 and 2 
GoDaddy s executives earn annual cash bonuses based on the achievement of corporate and individual performance goals  The corporate performance goals include bookings  adjusted EBITDA  unlevered free cash flow  and total customers  Equity awards are given in either time based options or performance based stock units  which are also tied to bookings and adjusted EBITDA 
As noted above  these non GAAP metrics do little to measure the true profitability of the firm  Instead  they include numerous adjustments that allow executives to earn bonus awards while destroying shareholder value  We ve demonstrated through numerous case studies that ROIC  not non GAAP net income or similar metrics  is the primary driver of shareholder value creation  A recent white paper published by Ernst   Young also validates the importance of ROIC and the superiority of our data analytics  Without major changes to this compensation plan  e g  emphasizing ROIC   investors should expect further value destruction 
GoDaddy s Brand Name Can t Outlast Superior Competition
GoDaddy may be best known for its flashy Super Bowl ads from years ago  but the company operates in three main segments  domains  hosting   presence  and business applications  See Figure 3 
Figure 3  Domains Still Make Up Largest Portion of Revenue


Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
GoDaddy may have had an advantage at one point due to its superior brand recognition  but its advantage has disappeared  Customers today are just as familiar  if not more so  with many of its competitors 
Per Figure 4  GoDaddy s margins and ROIC  rank well below its largest competition  as noted in its 10 K  and only outrank previous Danger Zone Pick Dropbox  DBX   More alarming  GoDaddy s margins have declined despite diversifying its business away from the commoditized domain registration business

GoDaddy Losing Ground in Commoditized Domain Registration
The domains segment allows customers to register and purchase domain names  This segment is largely commoditized  as the price registrars pay for domains is set by VeriSign  NASDAQ VRSN   which holds a contract to distribute domain names from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers  ICANN   This contract runs through 2024 and sets a standard price on the cost of domains  With set costs  this segment provides little room for margin expansion despite being GoDaddy s largest revenue source 
Domain registration competitors include Web com  NASDAQ WEB   namecheap com  DreamHost  United Internet  Donuts  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL    which recently entered the domain registration market   and more 
Even worse  what was once GoDaddy s namesake business is losing ground  From 2014 2016  GoDaddy s market share in domain registration fell from 21  to 19   It jumped back to 22  in 2017  but largely due to GoDaddy s acquisition of Host Europe Group  which added 1 6 million customers  With dwindling capital  more on this below  GoDaddy cannot rely on acquisitions to boost market share 
Hosting and Site Creation Are Not Strengths Either
The hosting   presence segment offers website hosting services as well as tools to build websites and online stores  GoDaddy provides these services in an effort to diversify its revenue sources while also providing additional value to its customers 
Website hosting and creation competitors include Amazon Web Services  NASDAQ AMZN   Automattic  owner of WordPress   Shopify  NYSE SHOP   Squarespace  Weebly  Wix  NASDAQ WIX   and more  Unfortunately for GoDaddy  its site creation lags many of its competitors  in both market share and function  According to Datanyze  which calculates market share for web technologies  Wix is the leader in website building with a 23  market share  Squarespace comes in second with 17   while Weebly has 15  and GoDaddy has just 9  of the market 
Additionally  numerous reviews note that GoDaddy s site builder  which does not offer a free version  lacks standard features often provided by free competitors  Product integration  domain and site building  can be a positive add on  but only if you re offering clients the best available services and tools 
Business Applications Market Dominated by Tech Giants
Lastly  the business applications segment includes email accounts  email marketing tools  and IP based telephone services 
Business application competitors include tech giants such as Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Google  via Gmail   and Dropbox  NASDAQ DBX   Social platforms and third party e commerce sites such as Facebook  NASDAQ FB  or Etsy  NASDAQ ETSY  also present competition as they provide sales and marketing capabilities outside of creating a traditional website 
We don t think it is likely that this business segment will generate much  if any  profit growth given the stiff competition and relatively weak offerings of GoDaddy 
Bull Case Ignores A Commoditized Product  Years with No Profits  Rising Costs    Less Flexibility 
Despite being founded in 1997  GoDaddy s first reported accounting profits occurred in 2017  As we noted earlier  this reported profit was artificially achieved with significant unusual income  Because of the lack of real profits  investors have chosen to focus on revenue growth and customer growth  while ignoring real issues in the business  As the industry slows  rising costs and lack of resources in a highly competitive  and commoditized  industry threaten any bull case 
According to Verisign s Domain Name Industry Brief reports  the growth in domain name registrations is slowing significantly  Per Figure 5  top level domain name registrations grew 1  year over year in 2017  down from 10  year over year in 2011 
Figure 5  Domain Name Registration Growth is Slowing

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Despite the slowing growth of domain registrations  GoDaddy achieved record revenues in 2017 and grew its customer base by 18   11  came from an acquisition   However  its operating expenses grew even faster  Year over year  general   administrative  technology   development  and customer care costs grew 28   24   and 21   respectively  Cost of revenues and marketing and advertising grew 18  and 11  YoY as well  For reference  revenue grew 21  YoY 
Making matters worse  some of these costs may not be reduced  unless GDDY sacrifices key functions  For instance  customer care expenses represent the cost to advise and service customers  As GoDaddy strives to increase customer count  it must also increase customer care  For a firm already plagued with numerous complaints regarding its customer care  this cost structure could prove a challenge to sustaining customer growth and achieving profitability 
Beyond cost concerns  GoDaddy lacks the capital and the operational flexibility to grow at rates required by its valuation  GoDaddy s excess cash is dwarfed by its more profitable competitors

quarter to be reported  this does not ensure earnings beat for all firms in the space  It should be noted that a company s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment  as well as management s ability to implement operating and strategic plans In other words  a company might perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Looking for Accelerated Earnings Growth  3 Solid Picks 

	Earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time  Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts 

	Better than expected earnings results mostly lead to an uptick in the share price  Studies  however  have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement  Hence  earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price 

Spot the Outperformers

	In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates 

	Earnings acceleration is basically the increase in a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth within a stipulated frame of time  In other words  it is the incremental growth in earnings of a company 

	Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down 

	This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance 

Screening Parameters  

	Let s pick stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates have been more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates 

EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1     The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  

EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2     The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  

EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3     The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3

33811,255326,VRSN,VeriSign  VRSN  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"VeriSign Inc    NASDAQ VRSN   is set to report first quarter 2017 results on Apr 27  In the last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 6 33  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated  com and  net domain industry  The renewal of the  com contract and price hikes for the  com and  net domain names are likely to drive VeriSign s top line 
Furthermore  the company received approval from ICANN to increase domain fee from  7 46 to  8 20 effective Feb 1  2017  which will be accretive to its revenues 
Also  we believe that gTLD prospects  international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results  Additionally  VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service  DDoS  security market  VeriSign also has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space VeriSign  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   However  the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain primary headwinds  We note that VeriSign has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry on a year to date basis  The company s shares have increased 16 3  compared with the industry s gain of 21 7  during the period 

Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that VeriSign is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for VeriSign is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at earnings of 86 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  VeriSign s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Kraft Heinz  KHC   Nike  NYSE NKE   NKE  and Stryker  SYK  
Kraft Heinz shares have gained  2 4  year to date  outperforming the beleaguered Zacks categorized Food Miscellaneous Diversified industry which has lost  1 1  over the same period  Estimates have also remained stable ahead of the company s first quarter earnings release  Cost savings initiatives and strong gains from innovation continue to have a positive impact on the company s performance 
The Zacks analyst also likes the company s productivity improvement initiatives including zero based budgeting  modernization and capability building  However  the company is experiencing top line weakness over the past several quarters 
Soft spending by U S  shoppers and shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food are hurting the company s categories  Unfavorable currency translation continued to be a dampener for the segment through 2016 and is likely to hurt results in 2017 as well   You can  
Shares of Nike have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector on a year to date basis  gaining  8 2  vs   11 6  for the sector  But the Zacks analyst likes the company s customer centric approach  innovative products and strong brand portfolio  This  along with the company s desire for increasing its global footprint  popularity and market share demonstrates its growth appetite 
These factors  along with SG A leverage and ecommerce growth have helped Nike to beat earnings for 19 straight quarters now  However  Nike s top line fell prey to stiff competition and a tough retail backdrop in the last reported quarter  Persuaded by these factors  management provided soft sales growth outlook for fourth quarter fiscal 2017  It also expects currency headwinds to linger and hurt revenues in the fiscal 
But Nike remains confident of driving sustainable and profitable capital efficient growth in the long term  Moreover  its shareholder friendly moves bode well   You can  
Stryker shares have gained  17 4  over the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has gained  11 2  over the same period  Stryker ended the first quarter of 2017 on a solid note  squarely beating expectations  The Zacks analyst thinks the company s innovative product pipeline will be a key catalyst in the near term 
Additionally  growing adoption of MAKO will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market  Additionally  the acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio Control and the tie up with Indo UK Institute of Health s Medicity Program are major positives 
On the flip side  China might prove to be a challenging market for the company  Coming to supply side headwinds  the company has been grappling with issues in the spine business for a while  Additionally  challenging global economic conditions raise concerns   You can

33828,255343,VRSN,Cybersecurity Stocks To Benefit As WaanaCry Hits Worldwide,opinion,A massive ransomware attack shocked the world last Friday which halted daily work at several companies  government offices and even hospitals across the globe  According to a report from cybersecurity firm  FireEye Inc    NASDAQ FEYE    the attack which persisted throughout the whole weekend  infected over 200 000 computers in at least 150 countries across the Americas  Europe  Russia and Asia over the weekend Known as WannaCrypt or WannaCry  the malicious software reportedly seizes the control of computers and encrypted files with a password which only hackers have access to  After that  victims were asked to pay ransom in order to regain control of their systems  The hackers demanded ransom in bitcoin Citing a report of Avast Software BV  Bloomberg revealed that heavy concentration of infections has been seen in Russia and Ukraine  Apart from this  about 16 National Health Service  NHS  organizations in the UK  some of Renault  PA RENA  factories and Nissan s car plant in Sunderland were hit by this attack Operations of various other companies  like in the U S  FedEx Corp    NYSE FDX    in Germany Deutsche Bahn  China s China National Petroleum Corp   in Japan Hitachi Ltd   and many others across the globe were adversely affected by this ransomware attack The most notable thing in this whole attack was that the hackers were able to infect only those computers which have older versions of Microsoft s   NASDAQ MSFT   operating systems  OS    Windows XP  Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003  Notably  Microsoft stopped providing support to its older OS in the latter half of 2016  due to which these systems were not upgraded with Microsoft s new security patches This made the older OS more vulnerable and hackers took the advantage of the same  However  Microsoft  taking a serious action on this issue  stated it will be releasing a security patch for its older OS According to Bloomberg  Aleks Gostev   chief cybersecurity expert for Kaspersky Labs   is suspecting some Russian language cybercriminals behind this attack  Notably  Russian hackers were in the limelight throughout last year  either for their supposed involvement in the   DNC  leak or   WADA  data breach Cybersecurity Stocks GainedThe latest cyber attack proved that government or private   most organizations across the whole world lack proper security measures But believe it or not  there does appear to be a positive side to this episode   A cyber attack is good news for cyber security companies  because it increases the chances of security related purchases by both companies and governments  Hence  investors flock to these shares  sending up share prices This time was no different   Barracuda Networks   NYSE CUDA   and FireEye were the top gainers   witnessing 3  and 2 3  rise  respectively  This was followed by Check Point Software   NASDAQ CHKP   and Palo Alto Networks Inc    NYSE PANW   gaining a respective 1 7  and 1 1   Another cybersecurity company  Fortinet Inc    NASDAQ FTNT    also marginally gained last Friday We expect to see this upswing in share prices of the Cybersecurity stocks to continue during today s trading session as well Computer and Technology Sector 5YR   ReturnFresh Boost for Security StocksThe silver lining to this whole episode will be rise in demand for security related products among companies and governments  in our opinion  We believe that it could bring cybersecurity stocks back into the limelight  which witnessed a dismal run in 2015  Though the cybersecurity stocks seem to be recovering since April last year  most stocks are still trading very low to their all time highs It should be noted that the financial well being  brand image and reputation of enterprises  and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats  Consequently  cybersecurity has become a mission critical  high profile requirement Clearly  cases of such attacks drive the need to beef up cyber safety measures  in turn increasing demand for the services offered by cybersecurity companies Furthermore  with rapid technological advancement  organizations are increasingly adopting the  bring your own device   BYOD  policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime anywhere access  This trend  in turn  calls for stricter data security measures Moreover  various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead  According to a Markets and Markets report  worldwide cybersecurity spending will reach  101 billion in 2018 and  170 billion by 2020  Gartner had earlier mentioned that IT security spending peaked to  75 billion in 2015 Bottom LineConsidering the aforementioned factors  it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cybersecurity players are likely to witness sturdy growth  moving ahead  Some better ranked stocks in the cybersecurity space are Fortinet  VeriSign  NASDAQ VRSN  and VASCO Data Security  all of which carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Apart from this  we believe that the recent attack will also benefit Microsoft as it may see a huge demand from organizations and individuals for its Windows 10 OS  The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies

Wainwright also pointed out that the attack had taken place on an unprecedented scale  Further  there were indications that attacks were likely to continue into the current week  which has brought cybersecurity companies into focus once again  Investing in these stocks is an imperative now  given that such attacks are likely to continue in the near future 
 WannaCry  Strikes 150 Countries
According to Europol  Friday s  WannaCry  ransomware attack took place across a minimum of 150 countries  Ransomware is named as such because it takes computers or even entire networks hostage until a specific ransom is paid up  However  its impact may have been muted since most European companies were preparing to close over the weekend 
Consequently  government agencies across the pond bore the brunt of the attack  in particular  the United Kingdom s National Health Service  rail systems in Germany as well as Chinese government agencies 
Among those companies which were singed by the attack are the likes of PetroChina Company Ltd    NYSE PTR    Nissan Motor Co   Ltd    OTC NSANY   and Renault  PA RENA  SA   OTC RNLSY    Though the majority of U S  companies remained unaffected  FedEx Corporation   NYSE FDX   bore the brunt of the attack  According to an Associated Press report on Friday  FedEx was quoted as saying that it was  experiencing interference  
Microsoft Describes Attack as  Wake up Call 
The fact that such attacks have become commonplace to some companies was evident from Telef nica  S A  s   NYSE TEF   reaction  The Spanish telecom major said that it did not face much trouble from the incident because it was used to facing such attacks on a regular basis  However  Microsoft Corp    NASDAQ MSFT   described the event as a  wake up call  for the U S  government 
This is because the attack was orchestrated using information about security vulnerabilities stored by the U S  government   Additionally  the software giant underlined the need for companies to keep their information systems up to date  Microsoft said that it had released a patch to tackle the Windows security flaw in March  but several users had not yet installed it 
Further Disruptions Likely
An unnamed security expert who is believed to have stopped the contagion by Saturday issued a warning the very next day that a fresh assault was possibly in the works  A new attack was likely to fix the chink in the ransomware s armor  The fallout of the attack was evident even on May 14  with PetroChina s parent yet to connect 20  of its large network of gas stations  
A section of exports believe that Russian cybercriminals possibly perpetrated the attack  This is because they were more likely to use ransomware as a weapon  The countries hit by the attack also support such a theory  Estimates of the total ransom paid out by victims of the attack range from  40 000  50 000 
Our Choices
The  WannaCry  ransomware attack once again highlights the need for security software and systems  Even though the U S  has remained largely unscathed  future attacks are unlikely to spare its shores  This only means that companies  particularly of the larger variety will spend larger amounts on cybersecurity in the days to come

5 Stocks to Buy for Explosive Earnings Acceleration 

	Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings 

	Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price

	Basically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration 

	In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates 

	Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down 

	This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance 

The Winning Strategy

	Let s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates 

EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1     The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  

EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2     The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  

EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3     The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  

	In addition to this  we have added the following parameters 

Current Price greater than or equal to  5   This screens out the low priced stocks 

Average 20 day volume greater than or equal to 50 000   High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   Only Zacks   Buys  and  Strong Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off  

	The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7 889 stocks to only five  Here are the stocks

33846,255361,VRSN,VeriSign  VRSN  Is Oversold  Can It Recover ,opinion,"VeriSign  Inc    NASDAQ VRSN   has been on a bit of a cold streak lately  but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock  And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at VRSN given that  according to its RSI reading of 22 78  it is now in oversold territory 
What is RSI 
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet  VRSN s low RSI value isn t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround  as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late  This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to VeriSign s earnings consensus 
Over the past two months  investors have seen 1 earnings estimate revisions move higher  compared with none lower  at least when looking at the key current year time frame  And the consensus estimate for VRSN has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days  as estimates have risen from  3 17 share two months ago to just  3 20 share right now  
If this wasn t enough  VeriSign also has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy which puts it into rare company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now  or holding on   as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long ",2016-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/verisign-(vrsn)-is-oversold:-can-it-recover-200148972,200148972

Factors to Consider
The renewal of the  com contract and price hikes for the  com and  net domain names drive VeriSign s topline  In addition  an expected increase in domain name base will remain a key driver of its growth 
Also  we believe that gTLD prospects  international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results over the long run  Additionally  VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in its network security products  We are optimistic about VeriSign s Network Security services business  VeriSign s partnership with Juniper Networks  Inc    NYSE JNPR   will boost its growth in the fast growing Distributed Denial of Service  DDoS  security market 
However  the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain primary near term headwinds  Intensifying competition is an added concern 
At present  VeriSign has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Stocks to Consider
Here s a stock worth considering that  as per our model  has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

Friday brought us the first dose of holiday cheer from an economic standpoint when we learned that the economy added 271 000 jobs in October  the unemployment rate fell to 5 0   and average hourly earnings rose 2 4   The weak US employment report for September was seen as at least partially responsible for October s global rally  So  the question is  will the strong October jobs report do the opposite 
In a classic case of good news is bad news  this terrific economic news appears to have been taken as a temporary sell signal by investors since it was perceived as a green light for unwanted changes to monetary policies  Actually  it s not so much that the changes are unwanted as that it creates uncertainty about the ultimate impact of moving away from the long standing ZIRP policy  After all  nothing is ever as simple as it seems  Any change in policy  whether fiscal or monetary  will have direct and indirect effects that are both positive and negative  and we can only guess as to what those might be 
So  investors took some risk off the table on Friday  and then Monday s trading brought a continuation of the pullback  which market commentators blamed on weak Chinese trade data and a reduction in the OECD s global growth forecast 
But the reality from a technical  chart  standpoint is that the market simply became so overbought that it needed to stop for a breather  Any excuse would do  The big October rally began with short covering as the major driver  and more recently was led by large and mega caps that masked the persistently weak market breadth  It has been particularly hard this year to outperform the cap weighted S P 500 large cap index 
Notably  ETFGI reported that exchange traded funds listed in the U S  have gathered a record  175 billion in net new assets this year  as of the end of October  with over  28 billion coming in October alone  which marked the ninth consecutive month of positive net inflows  Also S P reported that ETFs in all U S  sectors except Healthcare experienced inflows during the month  with Consumer Staples and Real Estate segments particularly strong  while Utilities and Energy were the most highly correlated internally  which makes sense given that these sectors are typically buffeted by macro issues  
Certainly  market participants are factoring in higher short term rates and a further strengthening dollar  which are expected to negatively impact income oriented companies  like REITs and Utilities  and export oriented multinationals  as well as emerging market debtors  whose debt is usually repaid in more expensive dollars   Indeed  immediately after the Friday jobs report  the 10 year Treasury yield popped while REITs and Utilities fell 
After the latest FOMC statement  the fed funds futures  which tend to be quite prescient  are now forecasting a 68  chance of a quarter point rate hike at the December 16 meeting  while bond guru Bill Gross has asserted that there is a 100  chance of a December hike  On the other hand  Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital believes the Fed should hold off  noting that the implied inflation rate in bond pricing is near zero  the Goldman Sachs  N GS  Financial Conditions Index sits at its worst level since the Great Recession  a strengthening dollar is badly hurting corporate earnings  and danger is growing in the high yield credit markets 
Nevertheless  longer term rates are indeed moving up  The 10 year Treasury yield closed Friday at 2 33   which is up significantly from 2 06  just two weeks ago  However  there is an interesting observation about the yield curve s response since the lows of October 14  The 2 year 10 year spread has remained steady at about 1 43  2 33 0 90   while the 5 year 30 year spread has actually flattened from 1 56   2 84 0 56  on October 14 to 1 35   3 09 1 74  on Friday 
This flattening is probably not what many observers expected  but demand for higher rate long dated Treasuries remains strong  especially among foreign investors seeking the safety of the U S  as the ECB and BOJ are hinting at additional QE  It is also worth noting is that this year is on pace to set yet another record for corporate bond issuance  with the biggest and strongest of corporations essentially getting the risk free interest rate on their debt  which continues to fuel stock buybacks and M A 
For my betting money  I m from Missouri when it comes to the Fed actually boosting the fed funds rate in this global economic environment  as the adverse risks of tightening still seem to outweigh the positives  I ll believe it when I see it  But even if they do  it will only be a token raise  and monetary policy will still remain loose for the foreseeable future 
The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 14 33 and has been essentially straddling the 15 fear threshold  Then on Monday  VIX spiked 15  to close at 16 52 
We may be seeing the start of a rotation now that the Fed has the data to justify a rate hike    and assuming that they choose to act    with money moving from income and export oriented stocks into growth  The rotation may also involve a movement from large caps into mid and small caps  and perhaps from NYSE listings into NASDAQ  This would be a formula that makes Santa Claus proud and investors happy  at least for the near term 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  N SPY  closed Monday at 208 and remains above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  In fact  it came close to testing the 200 day intraday on Monday before getting a late day bounce  The W bottom formation off of 187 was a very bullish pattern  and indeed October was quite strong  leading to overbought conditions that needed to be worked off  As I expected  the August highs around 211 212 provided resistance  The pullback over the past few days has allowed oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic to begin their cycle down  but that doesn t mean they have to cycle all the way back to oversold territory  Ever since the gap up on October 5  there is an uptrend line forming that connects the subsequent daily lows  and Monday s action shows that the uptrend line also provided support  along with the 200 day SMA  This uptrend line may be forming a bullish wedge as it approaches resistance at 212 that will likely resolve to the upside  Next resistance is the summer high near 214  Support resides at the 200 day and 100 day SMAs  previous support at 204  followed by the 50 day SMA and the round number 200 level  corresponding to 2 000 on the S P 500   and then the gap up from 195 

Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  N IYF   Technology  N IYW   Industrial  N IYJ   Healthcare  N IYH   Consumer Goods  N IYK   Consumer Services  N IYC   Energy  N IYE   Basic Materials  N IYM   Telecommunications  N IYZ   and Utilities  N IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Healthcare remains in the top spot this week with an Outlook score of 79  despite the turmoil among biotechs  Although none of its factor scores are particularly notable  it displays a solid forward long term growth rate and return ratios  and relatively good sentiment among Wall Street analysts  net revisions to earnings estimates   Even though the overall trend continues to be skewed toward reductions to forward estimates in all sectors  a lack of cuts  even without a strong upside bias  earns a sector a good relative score  Largely because of this  Utilities remains in second with a score of 65  primarily boasting a relatively low forward P E  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   Technology  and Financial round out the top five  followed by Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   Notably  Industrial continues to fall in the rankings  Financial still displays the lowest forward P E  about 15 2x   which is just slightly better than Utilities  while Technology has the highest forward long term growth rate and Telecom the best  or least negative  Wall Street sentiment 
2  Energy remains at the bottom with an Outlook score of 3 as the sector scores among the worst in most factors of the GARP model  although the sell side has lightened up on the barrage of downward revisions  In particular  the sector still shows an increasingly negative forward long term growth rate and low return ratios  as well as the highest forward P E  which is now over 27x   Basic Materials takes the other spot in the bottom two with an Outlook score of 21 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy tops the list with a 63  while Utilities is the lowest at 41  The top bottom spread 22 points  which reflects low sector correlations on particularly strong market days  which is good  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than broad risk on behavior  
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities displays the top score of 66  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Healthcare now scores the lowest at 43  as investors flee this sector during market weakness  The top bottom spread has surged to 23 points  which reflects low sector correlations on weak market days  which is good  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  rather than broad risk off behavior   so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Utilities and Healthcare display the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is the worst  However  looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy is by far the best  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Healthcare is the worst 
6  I must say  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings have taken a defensive turn  although I will still categorize them as neutral  with defensive sectors Utilities and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  in the top three and Telecom rising  plus falling scores for economically sensitive sectors Technology  Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   and Industrial  Also  the constant flow of negative earnings revisions from Wall Street is unsettling  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing  momentum  or relative strength factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stocks And ETFs
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   maintains a bullish bias and suggests holding Energy  Technology  and Financial  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Energy  Technology  and Financial sectors include IQ Global Oil Small Cap ETF  N IOIL   SPDR S P Software   Services ETF  N XSW   and iShares US Regional Banks  N IAT   Other highly ranked ETFs in our quant model include US Global Jets ETF  N JETS   which is mostly airlines  plus the First Trust LongShort Equity ETF  FTLS   which employs an absolute return strategy that licenses our Earnings Quality Rank  a quant model we developed together with our forensic accounting subsidiary Gradient Analytics  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Energy  Technology  and Financial sectors include Western Refining  N WNR   Rowan Companies plc  N RDC   Adobe Systems  O ADBE   VeriSign  O VRSN   Signature Bank  O SBNY   and PacWest Bancorp  O PACW   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score among the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our Earnings Quality Rank  a k a   EQR   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of Sabrient subsidiary Gradient Analytics 
If you prefer to take a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Utilities  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   in that order  But if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Technology  and Consumer Goods  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio
