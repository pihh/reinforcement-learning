108763,330278,HMC,Honda faces long haul to recoup jet costs,news,By Naomi Tajitsu and Maki Shiraki TOKYO  Reuters    After three decades building an airplane from scratch  Michimasa Fujino  56  chief engineer of the Hondajet  might have to reach a ripe old age to see Honda Motor Co s  T 7267  pet aviation project recoup its development costs  Honda has declined to reveal the costs  but the automaker has been researching aircraft development since 1986  and Richard Aboulafia  vice president of analysis at aerospace consulting firm Teal Group  thinks it has likely spent roughly  1 billion on the jet program since the early 2000s   more than double the  400 million typical for similar jets  A five year delivery delay and developing its own engine bumped up the bill  The company that gave the world the Honda Civic  which revolutionized compact cars in the United States in the 1970s  is betting its  4 5 million dollar  six seater light business jet  the first aircraft developed by an automaker since World War Two  will expand the fuel efficient private jet market  The jet began deliveries in late 2015 and is priced slightly higher than competitors in the conservative light businessjet segment   The biggest mistake people make when getting into the aircraft business is  thinking  that the cash hemorrhaging ends once you start delivering aircraft   said Aboulafia   But very often  it increases   he said  citing marketing and production ramp up costs  Fujino  CEO of Honda Aircraft Company  has said he expects it will take at least five years to start generating profits  and Aboulafia thinks it could take much longer to recoup sunk costs   If they  miraculously  can generate  1 million in profit on each aircraft  then they need to sell 1 000 planes  after they build the  first 100 or so  aircraft that are unprofitable   he said  The project has depended on Honda s deep pockets  The automaker s net profit for the 2016 financial year was around  3 billion  more than triple that of Textron  N TXT   maker of the rival Cessna Citation M2 jet  Honda hopes the project will have intangible benefits   varnishing its brand image to claw back automobile market share in North America  which has slipped below 10 percent in the past few years  and leveraging jet engineering skills to raise the efficiency and performance of future car models   For graphic on  Business aircraft market  click   NO TRACK RECORD Fujino acknowledges that customers  particularly first time buyers  may need convincing   We want to show customers that even though we don t have a history of selling aircraft  we re in the market because we have something new to offer   he told Reuters in an interview   For us that s more important than having a track record   Businessjet operators have shown interest  as it would offer an upscale alternative to turbo prop jets  often used for small charter services   The Hondajet would provide a new product for that segment  which is now mostly rattling around on old turbo props   said Richard Hodkinson  vice president of aircraft sales and acquisitions at aircraft services operator Clay Lacy Aviation in Van Nuys  California   It wouldn t be bigger than a turboprop in terms of the cabin  but it would be new  it would be quiet  it would be more efficient  and you d be in a jet   To sell the jet  Honda  which is targeting wealthy individuals and business owners  has taken a page from the auto industry playbook  establishing a dealership network across the Americas and Europe  though it plans to sell directly to fleet operators   The car dealership model works for achieving high volume  localized sales  The model may not be perfect  but Honda U S  car sales have expanded by leveraging the strengths of the dealer system   said Fujino  Some think that could be a mistake  Established makers often sell directly to customers and offer maintenance and parts services through their own sales outlets  which takes time and resources to establish  but enables them to control quality and consistency of service   You can t transfer the dealership model from the auto industry to aircraft   said Aboulafia   You re sending a message that you re not going to be a big player     If they want to develop a family of products and really get out there and be a force in the market  then it s a missed opportunity   LABOR OF LOVE Unlike the cheap and cheerful Civic  the Hondajet is marketed like an expensive sports car  presented on a slowly rotating platform in the company s delivery room  a pristine  high ceilinged hangar at its headquarters in Greensboro  N C   The Hondajet is meant to evoke the image of being the sports car of business jets  We wanted it to have the  wow  factor of a beautiful car   Fujino said late last year  The jet has been a labor of love for Fujino  who confounded industry colleagues with the craft s engineering masterstroke  engines mounted on the wings  not the fuselage  which reduces cabin noise and makes space for a full sized washroom  a first in its segment  He also says he found an aerodynamic sweet spot for the engine placement  helping the jet use an average of roughly 15 percent less fuel than rivals  which include the Phenom 100  made by Brazil s Embraer SA  SA EMBR3   and the Citation M2  its biggest competitor  In the delivery room  Fujino obsesses over every detail of presentation  angling the lighting to highlight the contours of the aircraft s softly pinched nose  inspired by a Ferragamo stiletto  He often personally hands over the keys to new owners and says he intends to keep that up even as annual production rises from around 25 now to perhaps 80 in the coming years  nearly double the Citation M2  according to Teal estimates   I know the faces of all of our current customers   he said ,2017-03-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/honda-faces-long-haul-to-recoup-jet-costs-468959,468959

108819,330334,HMC,Blindsided by SUV boom  Hyundai Motor trims costs  perks,news,"By Hyunjoo Jin SEOUL  Reuters    Headed for a fourth straight annual profit decline   Hyundai Motor   KS 005380  is trimming its cost fat  scaling back on business class flights and annual family home trips for overseas employees  executives told Reuters  The South Korean automaker has been hit by its exposure to weak emerging markets  and a product line up that features more sedans than sport utility vehicles  just as SUVs have become more popular across many global markets  The belt tightening   which also includes cutting back on printing and fluorescent light bulbs   aims to buy Hyundai time to prepare new models and a design revamp   We re trying to address a mismatch between the market trend and our product line up   said one Hyundai insider  referring to a need for more SUV models   That s a longer term plan  For now we re trying to save every penny   he said  declining to be identified because the plans are not public  Since October  Hyundai Motor Group executives have taken a 10 percent pay cut  the first such move in seven years  The number of executives at Hyundai Motor alone has risen by 44 percent in five years  to 293 last year   The group has also downgraded hotel rooms for executive travel  and is encouraging video conferencing as a cheaper alternative to travel  insiders said   We re in emergency management mode   said another insider  who didn t want to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media  In a response to Reuters for this article  Hyundai Motor said it is  making various cost saving efforts   with shrinking global demand and growing business uncertainty  but did not elaborate  Other costs  such as low margin supplier parts and labor at the heavily unionized automaker  are tougher to pare back  said Ko Tae bong  analyst at Hi Investment   Securities  noting Hyundai needs also to spend more on research and development in self driving and other new technologies  While Hyundai remains cash rich  its costs as a proportion of revenue have risen for five straight years  to 81 percent so far this year  regulatory filings show   Cutting expenses are stopgap measures  and won t do much to improve its bottom line   Ko said  calling them more  symbolic   SALES DECLINE Hyundai grew quickly after the global financial crisis  with brisk sales of its Sonata and Elantra sedans  It was the only major automaker to increase sales in the United States in 2009  But it has struggled to maintain that momentum as rivals  sales of SUVs have boomed and emerging market economies have weakened  Hyundai Motor shares have fallen 40 percent in the past three years  the worst performer among global automakers  The automaker s top U S  executive has resigned  and the South Korea sales chief and China head have been replaced  Sales of Hyundai cars  and those of its affiliate Kia Motors  KS 000270   could drop to 8 million this year  a first decline since Hyundai bought its smaller domestic rival in 1998  said Ko  the analyst  For next year  Hyundai Kia Executive Vice President and research head Park Hong jae  expects sales to pick up again   It was a difficult year this year  Things will get better   he told reporters on Thursday  citing recovery in markets such as Brazil and Russia  Another Hyundai source said the group has trimmed its preliminary 2017 sales target to 8 2 million vehicles  from 8 35 million forecast in mid year  MORE SUVS While it looks to manage its staff budget  Hyundai is beefing up its SUV offerings  freshening up its Sonata sedan  and redirecting exports from slow demand markets such as the Middle East to the United States  In the United States  SUVs accounted for 28 percent of Hyundai s sales in January November  up from 23 percent a year earlier  according to Autodata Corp  but less than half the industry average  At its plant in Montgomery  Alabama  Hyundai has replaced some Sonata production with its popular Santa Fe SUV  Next year  Hyundai will look to plug a gap in its SUV offerings for developed markets by making a sub compact model   under the project name  OS    in South Korea for sale at home  in the United States and Europe  people inside the company said  Hyundai makes sub compact SUVs locally in China  India and Russia   We need that small SUV in the U S  much sooner than later   Scott Fink  one of Hyundai s biggest U S  dealers  told Reuters  In sedans  Hyundai is pushing sales of bigger  higher margin models like the Azera  or Grandeur  and its Genesis luxury line  Its smaller sedans  including the Elantra and Sonata  have lost ground to rivals like Honda Motor s  T 7267  Civic  which one Hyundai executive said has  wowing design   Hyundai is working on a next generation of cars with  a different flair  to hit the market from 2019  Luc Donckerwolke  senior vice president for design  told Reuters on the sidelines of a recent event  The biggest holder of Hyundai Motor preferred shares  the Norway based Skagen Kon Tiki fund  expects the automaker to get back on track over the next couple of years  with new SUVs  recovering emerging market currencies and better plant utilization

research reports on 16 major stocks  including Chevron  Accenture and Adobe Systems  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Chevron s shares have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry over the past year   4 4  vs   3 7   and the analyst believes that the outperformance should continue on the back of a project pipeline that is among the best in the industry  thanks to planned expansion in the lucrative Permian Basin Chevron s well economics in the West Texas shale play also continues to improve as the company has been able to achieve a 40  reduction in its development and production expenses since 2015  However  the continued drop in Chevron s downstream unit earnings  partly attributable to a fall in domestic refined products sales margins  is a concern Moreover  the energy supermajor s massive  10  11 billion impairment charge is expected to increase its gearing  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point Shares of Accenture have gained  11 4  in the past three months against the Zacks Consulting industry s rise of  10 6   The Zacks analyst believes that Accenture has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses The company has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through acquisitions and partnerships  The company s strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases  and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential  Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space However  Accenture continues to face pricing pressure due to significant competition from strong companies like Genpact  Cognizant  NASDAQ CTSH  and Infosys  Global presence exposes Accenture to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  Buyout related integration risks is a concern Adobe s shares have gained

epicenter of the deadly coronavirus outbreak  is a major business hub for various global corporations  The city  with a population of around 11 million people  is under lockdown  As worries surrounding coronavirus heighten  authorities are making efforts to prevent a pandemic by locking down nearly 18 cities  in which around 56 million people are affected  The virus outbreak has crossed

China poses a very high risk  even on a global basis Virus related shutdowns are anticipated to dent spending in the Lunar New Year holiday  when consumers typically spend more on travel  entertainment and gifts  While stocks linked to airlines  cruise operators  casinos  hotels and luxury items have already started faltering  it seems that the coronavirus scare is also trickling down to automakers Automakers Take Precautionary MeasuresVarious international corporations including major auto companies having operations in China are restricting travel and forgoing long held traditions around the Lunar New Year amid the coronavirus outbreak  which shows no signs of abatement  The coronavirus can pose concerns for various global auto biggies including Groupe PSA  General Motors   NYSE GM    Ford   NYSE F    Fiat Chrysler   NYSE F    Honda Motor   NYSE HMC    Nissan Motor   OTC NSANY   and Renault  PA RENA   all of which have large manufacturing plants in Wuhan  China

markets As it is  global auto companies that command a strong presence in China and rely on the country s gigantic market for profitability have started witnessing sales decline lately  Auto sales in China   which is the world s largest car market   witnessed its second consecutive annual decline  by 8 2  year over year  in 2019  After recording growth for decades  the wheels are coming off China s auto market since July 2018 owing to tighter emission standards  trade tensions increasing popularity of ride sharing platforms and economic downturn According to CAAM projections  China auto sales are likely to fall 2  in 2020  which would mark the third straight year of sales decline  The World Bank forecasts China s growth to decelerate to 5 9  this year In addition to a weak economic outlook  tighter terms for vehicle financing and the possibility of re escalation of global trade tensions may impact consumer sentiment  which is crucial for the sale of big ticket discretionary items like automobiles  Amid all these headwinds  the coronavirus outbreak is also likely to intensify near term business concerns Last WordsAs China is essentially off work for the New Year holiday  the extent of impact of the ongoing health crisis on automakers can be gauged only when most firms resume operations in the first week of February  Projects under construction and new model launches  which especially have a timeline  draw special concern  The scope of this crisis on automakers will become clearer only when the Lunar New Year holiday ends Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to

Palladium  the world s number one catalyst and emissions purifier for petrol  or gasoline driven cars  was back in rally mode in Asian trading Tuesday  snapping a four day red streak that had wiped nearly 9  off its prices  
The silvery white metal was up about 1  on the day   relatively modest for a commodity used to setting one stupendous record high after another  as investors stayed in perpetual fear of its tight supply  amid worries that the world might one day run out of palladium 
Whatever the case  Tuesday s rebound in the precious metal seemed outrageous  when stocks in South Korea had crashed more than 3  amid broad declines in Asian equities and Wall Street s biggest rout since October had occurred just a day earlier 
What s Next For Palladium 
 Is there any stopping it from reaching another high   Arkadiusz Sieron  an independent investment adviser  wrote on the Kitco precious metals site  referring to palladium   What s next in store for the white metal   While the year isn t even four weeks old  palladium has gained four times more than gold  its best rival in precious metals  Ahead of Friday s month end  spot palladium is up 20  for January  while palladium futures show a 16  gain  In 2019  the spot market rose 48  and the futures finished up 55   trouncing all major commodities Analysts at Bank of America Securities predicted on Monday that palladium will reach  3 500 an ounce before it runs out of steam  That s an 85  premium over last year s close and 50  or more above current prices   though still lagging the metal s astronomical rally of 1 500  since 2009 
Valid History Behind Rally
Like most analysts  I can understand the upside price pressure that has brought palladium this far  We can all see the chronic squeeze on the metal s  supply in top producing centers South Africa and Russia and that there are very few practical alternatives for the automobile industry to this metal  
While there have been suggestions that the cheaper platinum  which serves as catalytic converter and emissions purifier for diesel cars  can be a substitute for palladium  the cost of retooling auto factories for the change might just outweigh any cost benefits 
But It s A Different Reality Now
To me  a palladium rally in the present circumstances will just seem surreal 
And my argument has to do with fundamentals too  Just like the supply squeeze that produced one record high after another for palladium  there should now be a demand vacuum for the metal as the Chinese car industry   the world s largest  is going to be in the slow lane  thanks to the coronavirus 
China typically accounts for nearly 30  of world vehicle production  exceeding the European Union s production or even the combined output of Japan and the United States  
Right now though  automakers are withdrawing employees from China and weighing whether to suspend manufacturing in the country as the coronavirus ravages industries across the board 
Automakers Taking A Break In China
 Honda  Motor  NYSE HMC  and PSA Group  PA PEUP    OTC PUGOY  are among the big auto names withdrawing employees working around Wuhan  the city of 11 million people that has become the epicenter of the viral outbreak  CNBC reported on Monday 
Manufacturing in China was temporarily halted in honor of the Lunar New Year  which kicked off this weekend  and normal operations are due to resume this week  But automakers across the globe with operations in China could keep their plants closed even longer  people familiar with the matter told CNBC  
As I said earlier  some logic should prevail now over palladium s cheerleaders 
Where Is The Demand For Palladium 
China  the world s largest carmaker  is in contraction and that logically means demand for palladium should at least be easing  if not shrinking  alleviating the months long squeeze placed on the market  The shutdowns in China may not have made enough material impact for automakers to roll back on their demand for raw materials  Yet that could very logically follow  
Some will argue that the negative impact on palladium is more perceived than real  and that those bullish on the metal should stay the course  taking it to new highs  Yet if psychological fears related to Chinese oil demand can drive crude prices down 10  in a week  can t a potential slowdown by the largest car producing country on the globe even stall the palladium rally   
Fundamentally  palladium should give back a chunk of its recent gains built on the notion of ever increasing demand from automakers  If not  it should at least stop making crazy new highs in the interim ",2020-01-28,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-party-over-for-palladium-its-cheerleaders-might-not-agree-200502051,200502051

108888,330403,HMC,Is Honda  HMC  A Buy Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Report  ,opinion,"Honda Motors   NYSE HMC   is set to report its second quarter results before the opening bell on Friday  November 8  The automobile giant has had a somewhat stagnant year thus far  shares are up only 4 6   lagging behind the broader automobile market s 15 5  run 
The company is trying to finish the calendar year off strong with a solid quarterly report that can potentially send shares to a new high  The company is also coming off a strong last 12 weeks as its shares have climbed over 15 3  
Overview 
Honda had a terrific month in the US market in August  It sold almost 174 000 vehicles for a year over year gain of roughly 18   The performance in August marked the firm s all time best monthly sales result in the United States  The increase was driven in part by strong sales of the mainstay Civic and Accord sedans  demonstrating that the two models still have appeal in a market that has largely turned away from sedans 
The car manufacturer also posted solid gains in the Chinese market where it sold just over 124 000 vehicles for a Y Y 5 9  gain  The impressive performance came despite the macroeconomic headwinds between Washington and Beijing  and was driven by strong demand for the compact CR V crossover SUV and the Civic sedan  The company s ability to weather broader geopolitical headwinds was a welcome sight for Honda shareholders 
However  despite a strong month in August  Honda was not able to keep the momentum going in the subsequent month  it reported that US sales fell 14 1  in September  Sales of the Accord and Civic sedans  historically two of Honda s biggest sellers in the United States  were down 19 8  and 10   respectively  Honda s compact CR V crossover  its top seller in the United States in recent times  still led the company s portfolio with 25 904 sold in September 
Outlook 
At the end of October  Honda Motors reported that it would be merging its auto parts makers with Hitachi Limited   OTC HTHIY   to build a major global supplier  The companies announced the merger last week  responding to significant changes in the auto industry  Hitachi will take a 67  stake in the merged auto parts maker  whose annual revenue is estimated at  15 61 billion  and Honda will take the remaining 33  
For investors looking to Honda Motor s upcoming quarterly report  it should be noted that the US sales report has been a mixed bag of results  US sales for Q2 were up 2 4  from the prior year s second quarter but the gain was driven by a strong August performance which was due to aggressive marketing and sales incentives that were up 16  from a year ago 
Our Q2 consensus estimates call for earnings to decline 14 95  to  0 91 per share and for net sales to drop 0 52  to  34 29 billion  Looking ahead to the automaker s full fiscal 2020 figures  our estimates project earnings to grow 9 29  to  3 41 per share and for net sales to reach  142 82 billion for a 1 62  jump 
Bottom Line 
Honda Motors had a superb August that carried the load for US sales in the quarter  but the jump in incentives that the company undertook in the same month might weigh on the firm s regional margin  However  for investors feeling bullish about Honda heading into its report  the stock is currently trading at a discounted forward multiple relative to the indsutry 
Honda s product diversity spreads out the firm s market exposure  which helps separate it from other automakers  It also pays out a healthy 3 02  dividend that can anchor shareholders in times of turbulence  Honda Motors sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  with a Style Score of A in Value

Coupled with that  foreign direct investment  FDI  is collapsing at a time when  due to the weak exchange rate  British assets must represent a cheap bargain to foreign buyers 
Yet  according to the Financial Times  cross border data shows capital entering the U K  has fallen by 30  since the Brexit referendum  while investment into the E U  s other 27 countries in the three years since the referendum has surged 43  up to the first quarter of 2019 
About  340 billion of capital has been invested in the 27 remaining E U  states in that period  up from  237 billion in the previous three years  according to the Financial Times  Yet  over the same period  the capital invested by foreign firms in greenfield projects in the U K  dropped by  36 billion to  85 billion  The data tracked greenfield investments and did not include mergers and acquisitions   which are also down  as it happens   because greenfield investments tend to drive greater productivity gains and contribute to national GDP growth 
Job creation has also grown in the E U   the paper reports  with more than 1 2 million jobs created in the EU27 in the past three years as a result of new FDI   474 000 more than the number of jobs created in the previous three years  according to the FT  About 53 000 of the rise in jobs was the result of U K  companies creating operations in the rest of the E U   particularly in information and communications technology and the electronics sectors  with about 150 000 jobs created in the EU27 in the three year period  marking a 30  increase  By contrast  the U K  s job growth in such sectors has dropped by 28  during the period 
Maybe not surprisingly  GDP growth has slowed in the U K  over recent months  in part as a result of low investment  The bigger reasons  it would seem  is uncertainty among U K  exporters  European clients   witness British Steel s demise  which it blamed on a falloff in European orders 
GDP growth in Britain contracted by 0 4  in April  mostly as a result of the dramatic fall in car production from planned pre Brexit shutdowns  Manufacturers had announced temporary shutdowns in expectation of disruption after the planned March 29 exit date from the E U  However  by the time Britain s departure from the E U  was delayed in March it was too late to reverse the plans 
Car production fell by 24  in April  the biggest drop since records began in 1995  While some pundits are predicting it will bounce back  closures by Honda  NYSE HMC   JaguarLandRover  Nissan  T 7201   Ford  NYSE F  and others suggest a new normal has been reached  making production unlikely to recover if European supply chains are ruptured by a no deal  hard Brexit 
If a deal is struck and there is some certainty that just in time supply chains can continue to function much as before  it is possible some recovery may occur  Nonetheless  some of these plant closures are permanent and  deal or no deal  suggest car making in Britain may struggle to ever recover to previous levels

108949,330464,HMC,Can Value Investors Consider Honda Motor  HMC  A Solid Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Honda Motor Co   Ltd    NYSE HMC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Honda Motor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 42  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 79  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Honda Motor s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Auto Tires Trucks sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 68  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Honda Motor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 14  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Honda Motor stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Honda Motor has a P S ratio of about 0 34  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  HMC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Honda Motor currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Honda Motor a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Honda Motor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D  This gives HMC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The full year estimate has seen one upward revision in the past sixty days  compared to no downward revisions This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate as the full year estimate has inched higher by 3 5  in the past two months  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Honda Motor Co   Ltd  Price and Consensus   Despite the bullish trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHonda Motor is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 38  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Automotive Foreign industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10

General Motors  NYSE GM   which reports sales on a quarterly basis  reported it delivered 665 840 vehicles in the first quarter of 2019   with a selling mix of trucks  SUVs and crossovers above 80 percent  
In addition  the company posted its highest first quarter average transaction price in its history 
First quarter sales  however  were down 7  compared with the first quarter of 2018 
 After a slow start to the year  the retail SAAR has risen each month since January   said Elaine Buckberg  GM chief economist   Consumer sentiment continued to recover in March and the other key drivers of auto sales like employment  wage growth and household balance sheets are healthy  The Fed paused in raising interest rates  which eases a headwind facing auto sales  Overall  the U S  economy is in solid shape  which bodes well for the industry outlook  
Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co   meanwhile  which also recently announced a switch to quarterly sales reporting  will unveil its Q1 2019 sales Thursday morning 
Fiat Chrysler  meanwhile  saw sales dip 7  year over year in March  last month  the automaker posted a year over year sales dip  breaking an 11 month streak of monthly sales growth  
 The industry had a tough first quarter but with spring finally starting to show its face and continued strong economic indicators  such as a boost in housing sales  lower lending rates and a strong labor market  we are confident that new vehicle sales demand will strengthen going forward   said Reid Bigland  Fiat Chrysler s head of U S  sales   Meanwhile  our Ram brand sales and average transaction prices continue to be strong and our much anticipated  game changing Jeep Gladiator pickup is on track for its in market debut this month  
Honda sales in the U S  were up 4 3  year over year  while Nissan sales fell 7 2   Toyota sales inched up 0 1  on a daily selling rate basis but were down 3 5  on a volume basis 
According to a report by the Associated Press  total U S  auto sales were down 2  in the first quarter  In other downward indicators  we recently noted U S  housing starts fell 8 7  in February compared with January  Both of these could plausibly be chalked up to the winter season  it remains to be seen if these and other inauspicious economic indicators portend a slide into a longer term economic slide  or if they are merely blips on the radar

Chicago  IL   February 25  2019  Stocks in this week s article include Shenandoah Telecommunications Company   NASDAQ SHEN    Honda Motor Co   Ltd    NYSE HMC    PolarityTE  Inc    NASDAQ PTE    Ubiquiti Networks  Inc    NASDAQ UBNT   and Titan Machinery Inc    NASDAQ TITN    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks to Buy as New Analysts Initiate Coverage
New analyst coverage unearths extensive data on stocks for investors  Analysts are privy to vital information  which is crucial for investment decisions  Lack of information creates chances of misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  
Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  usually portrays higher investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely holds some value 
Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t like to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks 
Needless to say  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change 
Impact on Stock Price
The price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation 
Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock 
So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks

108996,330511,HMC,Exclusive  Honda and Takata s stealth airbag fix,news,"By Paul Lienert and Jessica Dye DETROIT  Reuters    In August of 2009  after ruptured airbag inflators in Honda vehicles were linked to least four injuries and a death  the automaker quietly requested a design change and did not notify U S  regulators  Honda confirmed in response to inquiries from Reuters  Honda Motor Co  T 7267  asked supplier Takata Corp  T 7312  to produce a  fail safe  airbag inflator  according to Takata presentations and internal memos reviewed by Reuters  The previously undisclosed redesign could make Honda and Takata more vulnerable in more than 100 pending federal lawsuits and dozens more state suits  according to several legal experts and an attorney suing the companies  The request shows that Honda understood the safety risks posed by the inflators long before it started expanding recalls by the millions in 2014  the attorneys and law professors said  U S  law requires automakers to disclose safety risks and actions to prevent them to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  But Honda spokesman Chris Martin said the redesign did not require notice to regulators because the safety risk involved Takata manufacturing errors rather than a specific design defect  Honda requested the redesign to  protect against the possibility of future manufacturing errors   it was not an acknowledgement of a larger design flaw in the inflators   Martin wrote  Honda started installing the modified inflators in some  but not all  vehicles in 2011 and continues to do so today  Martin said  Honda expanded recalls as it became aware of more defects  he said  The fail safe modification   outlined in Takata technical documents and internal presentations between 2009 and 2011 and confirmed by Honda   added vents in the inflator to channel pressure from an explosion away from a driver s neck and torso  For a graphic depicting the  fail safe  fix  see    NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas declined to comment on the design change or whether Honda had a legal obligation to notify the agency  Takata confirmed in a statement that it  tested and deployed  several versions of the redesigned inflator  at the request of an automotive customer   The supplier declined to answer more detailed questions and declined to respond to Honda s explanation of the reasons for the change  Takata has previously acknowledged that some of the ruptures were connected to manufacturing errors at its factories  Honda is Takata s biggest customer  and the automaker owns a small stake in the airbag supplier  LEGAL PERIL Peter Henning  a corporate law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit  called Honda s distinction between manufacturing and design problems a  technical argument  that is at odds with the law and regulatory practice   You can t say   It s a supplier problem  not ours  so we don t have to talk about it   he said   They are responsible for every part on their car and also responsible to report a problem with any part on that car   John Kristensen   a Los Angeles product liability plaintiff s lawyer who has worked on major product defect lawsuits against Toyota and other manufacturers   agreed that the cause or type of a safety risk is irrelevant to legal notification requirements  Honda officials  made a determination of a defect when they asked for the fail safe design   said Kristensen   They had an obligation to tell the government back in 2009  Good luck defending that    In many states  plaintiffs alleging design defects are required to prove that companies could have used a safer design  said Rob Ammons  a Houston lawyer who has represented clients suing Honda and Takata in three cases alleging that inflator defects caused death or injury   Obviously  this would be significant evidence that one existed  certainly as early as 2009   said Ammons  who has settled two of the cases and has one pending  Bryant Walker Smith  a law professor at the University of South Carolina and an expert in automotive safety and regulation said that Honda could make an argument that  it s always improving its products   for instance  that air bags are getting safer every year   he said   I m not sure how a jury would approach or examine that   The federal cases against Takata  Honda and other automakers have been consolidated in a Miami court  They involve individual claims for injuries and deaths and proposed class actions seeking to represent millions of customers who say their vehicles lost value  Trials in both types of federal cases could start as soon as 2017  according to court filings  Honda has reached confidential settlements in some personal injury lawsuits  court records showed  AN EFFECTIVE FIX Since 2008  Honda has recalled 8 5 million vehicles to replace defective inflators  including 2 3 million in February  All but 875 000 of those recalls came in 2014 or later   
Takata inflators in Honda vehicles have been linked to nine deaths and more than 90 injuries in the U S   according to NHTSA  Seven of those deaths and 70 injuries have occurred since Takata began producing the new inflator design for Honda starting in late 2010  The redesign worked as intended  Martin said  All of the deaths and injuries happened in vehicles with older inflator designs  2016 03 24T233902Z 7 LYNXNPEC2N182 RTROPTP 1 AUTOS HONDA FAILSAFE JPG",2016-03-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-honda-and-takata's-stealth-airbag-fix-391837,391837

109007,330522,HMC,U S  Trade Rifts Spread To Europe And Autos,opinion,"With U S  markets closed on Monday for President s Day  Asian and European markets were left setting the tone for trading in the early part of the week 
Whilst Asian markets continued to hover around four month highs on U S  China trade talk optimism  European and U S  futures were looking less rosy 
As trade remains in focus  concerns over Europe s promised retaliation should the U S  apply tariffs on imported vehicles kept European bourses mixed ahead of the open  Even as progress is being made between the U S  and China  this seems less the case for trans Atlantic trade relations 
Europe and particularly Germany are already experiencing a slowdown in growth momentum  Serious trade issues concerning vehicles  predominantly made in Germany  could easily be the straw that breaks the camel s back 
Concerns over the health of the eurozone and German economy will remain in focus today as investors look towards ZEW economic sentiment  data  Sentiment unexpectedly rose last month  despite the challenging outlook  Another increase in sentiment could help propel the euro comfortably back over  1 13 
HSBC misses estimates
HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA  reported a 15 9  increase in profits in 2018  buoyed by growth in core business areas in Britain and Asia  However  weakness in Q4 resulted in the bank missing estimates 
HSBC reported profits of  19 6 billion  short of the  22 billion forecast  HSBC focuses on Asia since the bank makes three quarters of its profits there  A slowdown in growth in China  combined with Brexit in the U K  could leave the bank vulnerable going forwards 
Pound slips on Honda announcement
The pound was slipping in early trade as traders digested Honda s decision to close its Swindon branch in 2022 costing 3 500 jobs 
This is just the latest blow to U K  manufacturing as Honda  NYSE HMC  joins a growing list of firms that don t see their future in the U K  post Brexit  The news comes shortly after Nissan  T 7201  also pulled the manufacturing of the X Trail from the U K 
Whilst Brexit certainly plays a part here  it is also worth noting that this is part of a larger slowdown in the car industry which is also being hit by increased trade tensions and a huge shift away from diesel cars 
Will U K  average earnings lift the pound 
Pound traders will look towards UK jobs data for a slither of optimism  Unemployment in the UK is expected to remain at 4  
More importantly average earnings are expected to tick higher in the three months to December  increasing to 3 5   up from 3 4  in November 
An increase of this level would be well ahead of inflation  once again easing pressure on U K  households and offering some support to the U K  economy just ahead of Brexit

include  Walmart   NYSE WMT    Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    Honda   NYSE HMC    TransCanada   TO TRP   and TransUnion   NYSE TRU   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Top Analyst Reports for Walmart  Amgen and HondaThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Walmart  Amgen and Honda  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Walmart s shares have outperformed the Zacks Supermarkets industry over the past six months   6 3  vs   5 7    due to its focus on strengthening e commerce and store operations  The Zacks analyst thinks these factors helped the company retain its sturdy comps trend in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter marked its fourth consecutive beat  Notably  U S  comps rose for the 18th straight time Further  e commerce sales surged on the back of strong Walmart com and online grocery performances  E commerce sales are expected to rise nearly 35  in fiscal 2020 Walmart is also making efforts to improve its International unit by shifting focus to profitable countries  To this end  the company s investment in Flipkart is however expected to dent the bottom line in fiscal 2020  Transportation costs and a compelling pricing strategy are threats to gross margin  Nonetheless  the Flipkart deal bodes well for the long term  You can   Shares of Amgen have gained  2 4  in the past year versus the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry s decline of  16 3   Amgen beat expectations for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  However  its 2019 guidance reflects a year over year decline The Zacks analyst thinks that while Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Blincyto  Kyprolis   will drive sales  biosimilar and brand competition faced by its legacy products will create pressure on the top line in 2019  Meanwhile  uptake of key drug  Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions and the recent price cut will hurt sales going forward Amgen is progressing with its pipeline and the approval of Aimovig was a huge boost  In the past five years  The company has launched nine products  including two in new therapeutic areas  Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars pipeline  which could be an important long term growth driver for the company  Its restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient  You can   Buy rankedHonda s shares have outperformed the Zacks Foreign Automotive industry over the past six months  losing  9 2  vs   15 2   In third quarter of fiscal 2019  Honda s revenues improved year over year The Zacks analyst likes the company s Vision 2030 plan which aims to boost coordination between research and development as well as procurement and manufacturing of its products that will aid the company to reduce developmental costs and focus more on electric vehicles Also  its revenues streams in motorcycle and financial segments and favorable model mix are adding to profits  The company s collaboration with other companies to develop

109009,330524,HMC,5 Stocks To Buy As New Analysts Initiate Coverage,opinion,New analyst coverage unearths extensive data on stocks for investors  Analysts are privy to vital information  which is crucial for investment decisions  Lack of information creates chances of misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  usually portrays higher investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely holds some value Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t like to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks Needless to say  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Impact on Stock PriceThe price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual investors  Here are five of the six stocks that passed the screen Shenandoah Telecommunications Company   NASDAQ SHEN    a telecommunications service provider  currently

109050,330565,HMC,Exclusive  Global automakers wary of China certification shift,news,"By Norihiko Shirouzu BEIJING  Reuters    Some global automakers are worried that China is pushing its weight around as the world s biggest car market   by enforcing its own  often outdated  vehicle certification standards on foreign cars  China previously allowed global brands to sell cars without local certification in many cases  as long they were approved under international standards  Chinese rules essentially apply older standards to features such as bumper strength  brake performance and the size and positioning of lamps and mirrors  Global car makers say the move to enforce local standards more rigorously highlights the unpredictability of doing business in China  is a step back in technology and could mean costly re designs and delayed new car launches  In one instance  Chinese regulators made an issue of the position of a Nissan Motor  T 7201  car s fog lamps   something that has since impacted other automakers  people with knowledge of the matter said  Shifting a lamp by a few centimeters can mean re designing exterior body panels  investing in stamping dies and lighting assemblies  and delaying planned launches by more than a year  said people close to the Japanese Automotive Manufacturers Association  JAMA    It s an inconvenient and sudden departure from the status quo   said an executive at a leading international automaker   We re essentially being asked to redo some aspects of new vehicles in China using outdated standards  This may cost us critical time and money   To be sure  compliance won t break the bank  but car makers are concerned they may be sacrificing technical advances as China s standards can lag global norms by as much as a decade   They can enforce whatever standards they want  The question is  are those standards high enough to protect consumers   said Yale Zhang  head of Shanghai based consultancy Automotive Foresight   People think China does not have proper standards and that s why the car quality here is lower   STANDARDS LAG As European certification standards   the de facto global norm   have evolved in line with advances in technology  China s have lagged behind  Foreign car makers say this is in part because China wanted to help protect its domestic automakers from competition  Feng Yi  director of the China Automotive Technology and Research Center  CATARC   which oversees the National Technical Committee of Auto Standardization  said there was no aim to protect local producers or hinder foreign automakers  In emailed comments to Reuters  he said local standards had lagged those from Europe  though China was now speeding up setting its own standards  based on European rules    However  because it takes quite a long time to set up or update standards and prepare new auto products  new standards will still be one step behind compared with  Europe    he said  After a decade of double digit growth  helped by subsidies and other policy measures  China s light vehicle sales slowed to single digit growth last year  and research firm JD Power predicts that will likely be the norm for the next few years   We ll see more of this as the market slows     to make sure state owned and domestic automakers will be solvent   said John Humphrey  a JD Power consultant   Without that  a lot of those companies won t be able to withstand the raw market forces   A spokesman for Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely  GEELY UL  said he did not know if the shift was benefiting local car makers   Geely Auto s design  R D and production facilities fully comply with standards and certification in China and in overseas markets where our vehicles are sold   he said  INNOVATION HURDLE In another case  Honda Motor  T 7267  was told by Chinese regulators that sensor frequencies in one of the on board diagnostic systems monitoring engine and transmission performance and tire pressure on one of its new models did not meet their certification standards  Spokespersons for Nissan and Honda declined direct comment  but said they support the JAMA playing a lead role on this issue  A Toyota spokesman declined to comment  The JAMA sent a delegation to Beijing in November to voice its concern to the CNCA department that deals with automotive certification  three people close to the JAMA said  Feng at the CATARC said he was not aware of any such meeting  The European Automobile Manufacturers Association  ACEA   which represents firms including Volkswagen  DE VOWG p    Daimler   DE DAIGn  and BMW  DE BMWG  as well as top U S  manufacturers  says it prefers its car makers to try to resolve issues themselves case by case  China representative Dominik Declercq said the ACEA welcomed signs of China embracing the rule of law  and  less arbitrarily  than before  but has concerns about the impact on future sales

109059,330574,HMC,5 Auto Stocks That Are Poised To Beat The Market In 2019,opinion,The automotive industry witnessed a shift in trend toward spacious and large SUVs  and crossovers during this year  backed by high employment rate and favorable economic conditions  However  tit for tat tariffs slapped by the United States and China have partially slowed revenue growth of auto companies Year to date   stocks have underperformed the broader market  The industry has lost around 21  over this period  lagging the Zacks S P 500 composite s corresponding fall of 0 8  Over the past few years  the sector has been going through a wave of changes  ranging from ever changing customer preferences to stricter emission reduction policies  Players in the sector have to comply with the fuel emission standards for vehicles  which require upgraded technology  For this  the companies have to continue focusing on technological innovation apart from developing futuristic electric and autonomous vehicles  Furthermore  the players have to keep a check on their bottom lines  strained by raw material costs and tariffs Regardless of such imminent challenges  Moody s projects that the global automotive manufacturing will remain unchanged in 2019 due to constant demand in all of the key markets  This financial research and analysis firm expects global light vehicle sales to grow in a modest 1 3  in 2019 Why There s Growth Ahead for the SectorTariff Slash  China plans to cut import tariffs to 15  from the current payout of 40  on vehicles imported from the United States  Although not finalized so far  the probable rate reduction in China will place U S  imports at par with tariffs paid for products manufactured in other countries  The tariff reduction will benefit automakers that manufacture in the United States  who had to raise vehicle prices in China owing to high tariffs  Apart from being the number one auto market in terms of volume  China is among the first mover countries to launch mobility services  This places the country among the top markets for the auto sector Demand for Spacious Cars  While the industry and consumers are enthusiastic about electric and autonomous vehicles  rising number of consumers are dumping passenger cars and opting for SUVs  In this changed situation  automakers are launching a range of new and technically advanced crossovers  trucks  and SUVs in the market  LMC Automotive has reported to Quartz that SUVs in the United States will account for 35  of light vehicle global sales in 2018 compared with only 15  in 2013  In fact  the figure is expected to cross the 50  mark by 2020  As the electric and autonomous vehicles are at their developmental stage  big and spacious cars like SUVs will be growth engines for the auto sector in 2019  thus  helping the players to boost their bottom lines Growth Opportunities  Vehicle purchases in the emerging markets are climbing record high levels  In fact  the automotive industry is witnessing a continuous shift in volume and market share toward emerging markets  In 2019  Moody s projects robust growth for the auto sector in emerging economies   consisting India  Brazil and Russia   spurred by improved macroeconomic conditions  This provides ample opportunity for the players to gain a large portion of the global manufacturing capacity Choosing the Winning StocksWe

109060,330575,HMC,4 Bruised Stocks At Bargain Prices Set To Recover In 2019,opinion,While 2017 had been one of the most tranquil years in the market history owing to low volatility  the U S  stock market faced a bumpy ride in 2018  To say that the markets have been volatile this year is an understatement  Since the beginning of the year  Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  gained almost 9  to reach a high of 26 951 81 on Oct 3  However  the upside was checked when the index lost momentum  thanks to domestic and global issues that plagued the market  Similarly  the S P 500 index also tumbled into correction in October after hitting a lifetime high of 2 930 75 on Sep 20 On an encouraging note  Trump s tax reform policies have been boosting corporate spending  raising productivity for several industries along with fueling earnings growth and share buybacks  Moreover  low unemployment levels  job growth and rising wages have uplifted consumers  sentiment  Notably  consumer spending continues to be strong  having increased almost 4  in the third quarter of 2018 However  these positive developments seem to be overshadowed by broader macroeconomic factors  straining the stock markets  Trade tussle  rate hikes  sluggish economic growth in China and Japan  declining oil  uncertainty over Brexit and slowdown in the Euro zone induced volatility in the markets  Hit by such odds  the DJI and the S P 500 have lost 4 7  and 5 6   respectively  so far this year Delving Deeper Into Stock Market Volatility in 2018Below we provide an insight into the macroeconomic factors that weighed on the U S  stock market this year  The year 2018 has been fettered by various issues  with majority of the bruises being caused by rate hikes  U S  China trade disputes  along with a slowdown in China and Japan s growth   Fed Rate Hike Rocks the Market  Notably  the market has witnessed three interest rate hikes so far this year  chiefly on the back of strong economic growth  While the rising rates have no direct impacts on the stock market  it does have a ripple effect that can eventually rock the market  A rise in interest rate raises consumers  borrowing costs  making loans and mortgages expensive  as well as leaving the households with less disposable income  which eventually impacts profits and revenues of businesses  The rising rate also impacts other capital intensive businesses that had cut down on their spending levels  resulting in the slowing down of the growth of such firms  with their stock prices taking a hit  There are speculations that another hike is imminent  which might further tighten financial conditions U S  Sino Trade Tussle  Intensifying trade tensions between China and the United States have weighed on the growth prospects of some major companies  With both the parties refusing to back down on the tit for tat tariff war since July  the trade tussle between the world s two biggest economies has been ratcheting up  The Trump administration  in July  had imposed tariffs on  34 billion in Chinese goods that led China to retaliate with tariffs on American products of equal value  Again in August  the United States and China levied a tariff on  16 billion worth of each other s products  In September  Trump slapped a fresh tariff on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  with Beijing announcing retaliatory tariffs on  60 billion of U S  goods China and Japan Economy at Crossroads  The Chinese economy is steeply declining of late  with trade war hurting both the country s business and consumer confidence  Notably  China s industrial production has slowed down and retail sales growth has recently hit a 15 year low  Importantly  Japan has also been witnessing sluggish economic growth amid weakening exports and declining consumers  willingness to spend  as the wages have not managed to keep pace with the rising prices Chink in the Armor in 2019It seems that tax cuts  infrastructural spending and other favorable reforms by Trump will have a fleeting effect on the overall economy  as the growth prospects for 2019 are weakening  Key economic readings related to employment data and GDP have also started softening  It is much likely that the economy will slow down in 2019 and 2020 as well  Bloomberg forecasts United States  net contribution to global GDP to drop from the current 12 3  to 8 5  in 2022 However  with mounting risks to the U S  economy  it is expected that the Fed may slow down the pace of interest rate hikes next year  providing some breather for equity and bond markets in the United States and across the globe  Nonetheless  these are only predictions  One thing which is certain is that the level of interest rates will have a huge impact on the markets While the United States and China have temporarily put their trade war on hold  the uncertainty definitely lingers  The trade tensions have raised a red flag about increasing slowdown in the Chinese economy  which is a concern Moreover  the British Prime Minister Theresa May s tentative  withdrawal agreement  with the European Union  EU  failed to get an approval from her own party  thereby increasing uncertainty surrounding Brexit  The United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the EU on Mar 29  2019   deal or no deal  While the U K  leaving the European Union will certainly have global economic consequences  the severity and timeline of the consequences is a wait and watch story Concerns over inverted yield curve are further adding to the jitters  While the five year treasury rate has lately dipped below the two year yield  we are not very sure if it is a precursor of a recession down the road  as it was in the past  Markedly  the latest inversion of the Treasury Yield Curve is certainly not a good sign As such  concerns surrounding U S  Sino trade dispute  inverted yield curve  sluggish economic growth and uncertainty over Fed rates do not provide much rays of hope  Market volatility is likely to persist in 2019 as well  with earnings growth expected to decelerate in 2019 amid various concerns  In fact  per Zacks Earnings Trends report  earnings growth for the S P 500 companies is likely to decline to around 8  in 2019 from a multi year high of 21  in 2018 Value Investing is the Right WayMaking money in stock markets is certainly not a cakewalk  Especially  at a time when the market is facing a thicket of risks  one must don a protective armor to come out unscathed  If investors are eager to lap up opportunities in this market  a prudent move would be to buy the beaten down stocks with encouraging fundamentals In fact  when the market is weak and uncertain  value investment is the way to go as most of the fundamentally good stocks fall within the discounted range  We suggest the investors to take help of our screening criteria and access the key metrics to select stocks that are currently trading cheap and have huge future prospects We have used the o identify stocks that possess a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have a  of B or better  Further  the stocks  which we shall cherry pick  currently come at a bargain price after declining more than 20  so far this year  However  these have the potential to turn around in 2019  Finally  since value investors typically look for stocks with low P E ratios  we have chosen companies that trade at a discount to their respective industry averages  You can see Our PicksSynchrony Financial   NYSE SYF    Stamford  U S  based Synchrony Financial  one of the nation s premier consumer financial services companies

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Synchrony Financial   NYSE SYF    Honda Motor Co   Ltd    NYSE HMC    American Airlines Group Inc   NASDAQ AAL   and Silver Bow Resources Inc    NYSE SBOW   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  4 Bruised Stocks at Bargain Prices Set to Recover in 2019While 2017 had been one of the most tranquil years in the market history owing to low volatility  the U S  stock market faced a bumpy ride in 2018  To say that the markets have been volatile this year is an understatement  Since the beginning of the year  Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  gained almost 9  to reach a high of 26 951 81 on Oct 3 However  the upside was checked when the index lost momentum  thanks to domestic and global issues that plagued the market  Similarly  the S P 500 index also tumbled into correction in October after hitting a lifetime high of 2 930 75 on Sep 20 On an encouraging note  Trump s tax reform policies have been boosting corporate spending  raising productivity for several industries along with fueling earnings growth and share buybacks  Moreover  low unemployment levels  job growth and rising wages have uplifted consumers  sentiment  Notably  consumer spending continues to be strong  having increased almost 4  in the third quarter of 2018 However  these positive developments seem to be overshadowed by broader macroeconomic factors  straining the stock markets  Trade tussle  rate hikes  sluggish economic growth in China and Japan  declining oil  uncertainty over Brexit and slowdown in the Euro zone induced volatility in the markets  Hit by such odds  the DJI and the S P 500 have lost 4 7  and 5 6   respectively  so far this year Delving Deeper into Stock Market Volatility in 2018Below we provide an insight into the macroeconomic factors that weighed on the U S  stock market this year  The year 2018 has been fettered by various issues  with majority of the bruises being caused by rate hikes  U S  China trade disputes  along with a slowdown in China and Japan s growth   Fed Rate Hike Rocks the Market  Notably  the market has witnessed three interest rate hikes so far this year  chiefly on the back of strong economic growth  While the rising rates have no direct impacts on the stock market  it does have a ripple effect that can eventually rock the market  A rise in interest rate raises consumers  borrowing costs  making loans and mortgages expensive  as well as leaving the households with less disposable income  which eventually impacts profits and revenues of businesses The rising rate also impacts other capital intensive businesses that had cut down on their spending levels  resulting in the slowing down of the growth of such firms  with their stock prices taking a hit  There are speculations that another hike is imminent  which might further tighten financial conditions U S  Sino Trade Tussle Intensifying trade tensions between China and the United States have weighed on the growth prospects of some major companies  With both the parties refusing to back down on the tit for tat tariff war since July  the trade tussle between the world s two biggest economies has been ratcheting up  The Trump administration  in July  had imposed tariffs on  34 billion in Chinese goods that led China to retaliate with tariffs on American products of equal value  Again in August  the United States and China levied a tariff on  16 billion worth of each other s products  In September  Trump slapped a fresh tariff on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  with Beijing announcing retaliatory tariffs on  60 billion of U S  goods China and Japan Economy at Crossroads  The Chinese economy is steeply declining of late  with trade war hurting both the country s business and consumer confidence  Notably  China s industrial production has slowed down and retail sales growth has recently hit a 15 year low  Importantly  Japan has also been witnessing sluggish economic growth amid weakening exports and declining consumers  willingness to spend  as the wages have not managed to keep pace with the rising prices Chink in the Armor in 2019It seems that tax cuts  infrastructural spending and other favorable reforms by Trump will have a fleeting effect on the overall economy  as the growth prospects for 2019 are weakening  Key economic readings related to employment data and GDP have also started softening  It is much likely that the economy will slow down in 2019 and 2020 as well  Bloomberg forecasts United States  net contribution to global GDP to drop from the current 12 3  to 8 5  in 2022 However  with mounting risks to the U S  economy  it is expected that the Fed may slow down the pace of interest rate hikes next year  providing some breather for equity and bond markets in the United States and across the globe  Nonetheless  these are only predictions  One thing which is certain is that the level of interest rates will have a huge impact on the markets While the United States and China have temporarily put their trade war on hold  the uncertainty definitely lingers  The trade tensions have raised a red flag about increasing slowdown in the Chinese economy  which is a concern Moreover  the British Prime Minister Theresa May s tentative  withdrawal agreement  with the European Union  EU  failed to get an approval from her own party  thereby increasing uncertainty surrounding Brexit  The United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the EU on Mar 29  2019   deal or no deal  While the U K  leaving the European Union will certainly have global economic consequences  the severity and timeline of the consequences is a wait and watch story Concerns over inverted yield curve are further adding to the jitters  While the five year treasury rate has lately dipped below the two year yield  we are not very sure if it is a precursor of a recession down the road  as it was in the past  Markedly  the latest inversion of the Treasury Yield Curve is certainly not a good sign As such  concerns surrounding U S  Sino trade dispute  inverted yield curve  sluggish economic growth and uncertainty over Fed rates do not provide much rays of hope  Market volatility is likely to persist in 2019 as well  with earnings growth expected to decelerate in 2019 amid various concerns  In fact  per Zacks Earnings Trends report  earnings growth for the S P 500 companies is likely to decline to around 8  in 2019 from a multi year high of 21  in 2018 Value Investing Is the Right WayMaking money in stock markets is certainly not a cakewalk  Especially  at a time when the market is facing a thicket of risks  one must don a protective armor to come out unscathed  If investors are eager to lap up opportunities in this market  a prudent move would be to buy the beaten down stocks with encouraging fundamentals In fact  when the market is weak and uncertain  value investment is the way to go as most of the fundamentally good stocks fall within the discounted range  We suggest the investors to take help of our screening criteria and access the key metrics to select stocks that are currently trading cheap and have huge future prospects We have used the o identify stocks that possess a Zacks

109079,330594,HMC,GM targets double digit earnings growth in 2016,news,By Joseph White and Bernie Woodall MILFORD  Mich   Reuters    General Motors Co  NYSE GM  told Wall Street on Thursday that its recovery is gathering momentum with improving margins  strong brands  new markets for high tech vehicles  and prospects for stronger profits in coming years   The No  1 U S  automaker said it is targeting an increase in earnings per share to between  5 and  5 50 per share before items  from the  4 50 per share that Wall Street analysts expect for this year  GM earned  3 05 per share in 2014 before items  GM said it will increase its return to investors by stronger profit margins in China and North America  as well as operating efficiencies and share buybacks  An improving U S  economy and rapid jobs growth have put 2015 U S  car sales on track for sales of more than 17 million  GM  the market leader  has shown a 4 2 percent increase in the U S  market through September  which is expected to be in line with industry growth when that figure is known later on Thursday  In an annual presentation to investors in the Detroit suburb of Milford  Michigan  GM said its pre tax global margins target is 9 percent to 10 percent by  early next decade   The Detroit based automaker  which reported a 12 percent rise in U S  September sales  has had a difficult time convincing Wall Street of its value and its shares have fallen below  30 recently  well short of its 2010 initial public offering of  33 per share  That IPO came a little over a year after GM emerged from a government funded bankruptcy in which the company pared four of its brands and much of its U S  dealership network  GM said it will have revenue of  155 billion this year as well as global margins of 6 8 percent and a 24 percent return on invested capital  Shares rose 1 3 percent to  30 42 on the New York Stock Exchange  while the broader market was down slightly   The company will save about  5 5 billion in the next three years in efficiencies in manufacturing  administration and purchasing  which will pay for investments in technology and brand development  The savings through 2018 will  more than offset  the technology and brand investments  GM said  Some  2 billion of the savings will be on materials GM uses for its vehicles  said Mark Reuss  the company s global product chief  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said the company will develop its autonomous vehicle program by having its employees at its primary technical center in Warren  Michigan drive a fleet of plug in hybrid 2017 Chevrolet Volts   We will redefine customers and their personal mobility   said Barra  Barra spoke with Reuters about this effort earlier this week  She said this effort  starts with connectivity  that will be used to advance its autonomous vehicles  It will also include an electric bicycle that the company expects to be sold in densely populated global cities  It plans to launch a citywide car sharing service in the U S  in early 2016  expanding efforts to compete for revenue from consumers who want to pay for using cars instead of owning them  Barra said GM executives will update investors on its plans in China and India later on Thursday  GM plans for 39 percent of its global sales to come from new or refreshed vehicles  up from 26 percent this year  It said that the share of those new vehicles will be 40 percent of its total sales in 2017  31 percent in 2018  and 40 percent in both 2019 and 2020  Barra said she has not had any further contact with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  NYSE FCAU  NV  Several months ago  Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne sent Barra an email saying he wanted the two companies to merge  a notion Barra has consistently said she and the company s board of directors are not interested in   GM said it expects  9 billion to  10 billion of annual free cash flow by 2020  GM expects industry growth in China of 3 percent to 5 percent each year from 2014 to 2020  One of major reasons that GM shares have fallen recently is that its China sales are threatened by a general weakening of the world s top auto market and No  2 economy  While the electric vehicle market has been pressured by low fuel prices in 2015  a lowering of the costs of EV battery cells will fall by 2022 to the threshold of  100 per kilowatt hour that analysts have said will allow EVs to compete with vehicles fueled by petroleum  GM said that when it introduces the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt small electric car next year  it expects the cost of its battery cells to be an  industry leading   145 per kWh  Global auto sales industrywide will grow by more than 50 percent to 130 million vehicles by 2030  from about 85 million now  While GM  the No  3 global automaker by sales  is not interested in merging with global No  7 automaker Fiat Chrysler  it expects to gain  2 billion to  3 billion in savings from developing technology with other automakers

Ford Motor Co    NYSE F   posted adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents in the first quarter of 2018  The reported figure was 3 cents higher than the year ago figure  Also  earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents per share  During the reported quarter  Ford logged automotive revenues of  39 billion  up from the prior year quarter figure of  36 5 billion  Its Zacks Consensuses Estimate for revenues was  37 billion 
Honda Motor Co  Ltd    NYSE HMC   reported consolidated income of  107 7 billion or  60 59 per share  56 cents per ADR  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  ended Mar 31  2018   up 12 3  from the year ago period  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share during the reported quarter was 46 cents  Consolidated sales revenues increased 4  year over year to  3 91 trillion   36 1 billion   The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  34 7 billion  The year over year increase can be attributed to higher revenues in all business operations despite unfavorable foreign currency translations 
In the current scenario  we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have a pure focus on auto companies 
First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund 
This fund focuses on providing exposure to the global automotive sector  It has AUM of  20 50 million and charges a fee of 70 basis points a year  It has an 8 05  allocation to Toyota  7 71  to Ford  7 69  to General Motors and 7 61  to Honda  The fund has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  with a High risk outlook  see  here  
To Sum Up
The fund has lost about 0 6  since Apr 25  Earnings beat hardly benefited the fund as investors mainly focused on weak April sales and punished the fund  So  gutsy investors impressed by the earnings beat of the sector may buy the dip

109101,330616,HMC,U S  agency opens probe into 2008 Honda Accord air bag controller,news,"DETROIT  Reuters    U S  safety regulators have opened an investigation into air bags on Honda Motor Co s 2008 Accord sedans after 19 complaints of air bags failing to deploy including in a front crash that resulted in an injury  federal officials said on Friday  The issue involves a module that controls deployment of the air bag  It appears to be a problem separate from that of combustible air bag inflators made by Takata Corp  T 7312  in Honda  T 7267  vehicles  At least 17 million vehicles made in the United States by 10 different carmakers have been recalled  because some Takata airbag inflators have exploded  spewing metal shards that have injured or killed drivers and front seat passengers   Malfunction of the air bag control module may prevent air bags from deploying in a crash   said a filing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration   This malfunction causes the air bag status readiness indicator lamp to illuminate and the air bag system remains disabled until repaired   A Honda spokesman said the company is cooperating with NHTSA  while doing its own review  He also said the part involved was not made by Takata  though he did not say which supplier made the SRS module  About 384 000 of the 2008 Accord sedans in the United States may be recalled if NHTSA finds in the investigation that a recall is warranted  The federal safety agency said consumers have filed 19 complaints claiming that the air bag controlling SRS module failed  A person filed a complaint saying   My son was driving my car and did not make a turn and ran into a concrete block wall at about 50 miles per hour  The air bags did not deploy   There was an injury of unknown severity in the incident that occurred five months ago  the complaint said  A person in Maryland said that his Honda dealer said it will take  700 to fix the problem  another complaint said  Another complaint from an owner in Illinois said   I had to pay out of pocket close to  500 for parts and labor  which  seems silly as this is a safety related service   
NHTSA said it is investigating to determine the  scope  frequency and consequence of the alleged SRS module failures  ",2015-08-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-agency-opens-probe-into-2008-honda-accord-air-bag-controller-357074,357074

 NHTSA will take appropriate action after gathering additional information on the scope and causes of this failure   he added ",2015-09-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fiat-chrysler-faces-safety-data-issues-months-after-record-u.s.-fine-363807,363807

109111,330626,HMC,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  General Motors  Ford  Fiat  PACCAR And Honda,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 25  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Autos  including General Motors Company   NYSE GM    Ford Motor Company   NYSE F    Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N V    NYSE F    PACCAR Inc    NASDAQ PCAR   andHonda Motor Co   Ltd    NYSE HMC   Industry  Autos  Part 2Link  After a tepid start to 2018  major automakers reported robust sales in March  A strong jobs market and favorable tax measures spurred consumer demand  which in turn pushed up sales  The March sales upsurge is in contrast to what the auto industry witnessed in the past year In fact  in 2017  U S  vehicle sales declined for the first time since the financial crisis  It slipped to 17 2 million from 17 55 million in 2016  Last year s decline notwithstanding  the overall level of sales aren t that far from all time record levels Elevated consumer confidence  a strong job market  big discount and a growing U S  economy have aided this rise  Even concerns over high interest rates and growing oil prices could not stop Americans from splurging on sport utility vehicles  SUVs  and pickup trucks  This has led to strong unit sales of SUVs  crossovers and pickup trucks Per Autodata  auto industry sales rose 2 5  to 1 653 529 while new vehicle sales gained 6  in March  Moreover  seasonally adjusted annual rate  SAAR  was 17 5 million in comparison to 16 8 million  a year ago  General Motors Company posted a sales increase of 15 7  year over year to 296 341 vehicles This upside was attributable to the Chevrolet  GMC  Buick and Cadillac brands  Ford Motor Company announced a 3 5  rise in year over year sales to 244 306 vehicles  boosted by crossover and truck sales  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N V  reported 13 6  growth in year over year sales to 216 063 vehicles in the United States There are also other reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry for both the short and the long run  Below  we highlight those that should drive the sector s performance in the near to medium term OpportunitiesStrong Economy   Elevated Consumer ConfidenceAccording to a recent report by the Federal Reserve  unemployment has dropped from 10  in October 2009 to 4 1   This is the lowest level in about 20 years  About 17 million jobs have been added through this expansion  The labor market has remained robust and is likely to also remain strong in the future Additionally  growing household wealth  stable income gains and elevated consumer confidence continue to support consumer spending  Also  fiscal sops and accommodative financial measures are aiding both household spending and business environments  These positive macroeconomic factors are likely to aid the U S  auto sector at least in the near term Improved Global Auto Industry OutlookLeading rating agency Moody s has upgraded its outlook for the global auto industry from negative to stable  Improving business conditions have partly led to this rating upgrade  The rating agency has further added that it anticipates sales of cars  SUVs and light trucks to be higher this year than the previous projection In fact  prospects for growth are improving for the majority of the auto markets in the world  Moody s anticipates 1 5  rise in sales for 2018  unchanged from its previous projection  In addition  the rating agency expects U S  auto sales to shrink less in 2018 than its previous forecast Rising Vehicles Age in the United StatesThe increasing average age of vehicles on U S  roads is adding to the replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  The steadily improving quality of vehicles is mainly behind this rise in average age of vehicles over time  According to IHS Automotive  as of 2016  the average age of light vehicles was 11 6 years  whereas it was 9 9 years a decade ago  Moreover  by 2021  around 81 million vehicles are expected to be over 16 years old compared with 62 million vehicles today  This will benefit replacement part manufacturers and retailers  apart from new vehicle manufacturers Huge Opportunities in Self Driving IndustryOf late  the self driving industry has been growing by leaps and bounds  In fact  a few cases of accidents have not deterred the confidence of the auto giants to enter into this field in a big way  Several leading automobile and technology companies have been pouring in a huge amount of money to develop the niche technology and raise their market share  Huge prospects of self deriving vehicles to transform the auto industry and the transportation landscape have mainly resulted in this lofty investment Attractive  Tech Savvy Vehicle LaunchesIn order to stay in competition  automakers have to constantly strive toward introducing new and attractive  technologically advanced vehicles  A majority of automakers are revamping their popular vehicles with new technologies and visual appeal  Features such as backup cameras  automatic emergency braking and in car connectivity are common in most vehicle segments Bottom LineThe solid outlook for the economy is certainly a blessing for the auto sector  which is facing a myriad challenges  Moreover  given the rising thrust on the self driving industry  the auto space is gradually moving toward a seismic shift At this juncture  we recommend stocks such as PACCAR Inc  and Honda Motor Co   Ltd   each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  You can see  PACCAR has an expected long term growth rate of 9 8   In the past year  shares of the

109211,330726,HMC,U S  West Coast ports reopen as labor secretary arrives for talks,news,"By Steve Gorman LOS ANGELES  Reuters    U S  West Coast ports that were closed to incoming cargo vessels during the holiday weekend reopened in full on Tuesday as Labor Secretary Tom Perez arrived in San Francisco seeking to broker a settlement ending months of shipping disruptions  Perez was sent to meet with the two sides in the conflict at the behest of President Barack Obama  who has come under mounting pressure to weigh in on a labor dispute that has cascaded through the U S  commercial supply chain and beyond  But there was no immediate word on exactly when or under what conditions he would join in talks between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union  representing 20 000 dockworkers  and the bargaining agent for shipping companies and terminal operations  the Pacific Maritime Association  Neither side has spoken about the negotiations since agreeing on Friday to honor a news blackout requested by a federal mediator  No face to face talks between the parties are believed to have occurred since then  The PMA previously said the talks  which have dragged on for nine months  hit a new snag on a union demand for changes in the system of binding arbitration of contract disputes  The union has insisted the two sides are near an accord  Operations to load and unload cargo vessels at all 29 West Coast ports were halted through the holiday weekend as of Friday night but resumed Tuesday morning  port authorities said  More than 30 freighters idled through the weekend waiting for berths to open outside the adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach  the nation s two busiest cargo hubs  It was the longest such suspension in the months long labor dispute  Vessel operations were likewise suspended for two days last weekend  and again last Thursday  which was a union holiday  But shippers said work at the ports continued in the dockyards  rail yards and terminal gates to move cargo already unloaded from ships  DOMINO EFFECT The affected ports handle nearly half of all U S  maritime trade and more than 70 percent of imports from Asia  A domino effect has rippled through much of the U S  economy  extending to agriculture  manufacturing  retail and transportation  California farmers have been hit especially hard  with port disruptions posing a major barrier to perishable goods headed to overseas markets and export losses estimated to be running at hundreds of millions of dollars a week  Asian exporters faced rising shipping rates and some have been forced to reroute their goods by more costly air freight  One automaker  Japan s Honda Motor Co  T 7267   said on Sunday it would slow production for a week at plants in Ohio  Indiana and the Canadian province of Ontario  because of port related delays in parts shipments to those factories  The shippers have said they were curtailing port operations because they were no longer willing to pay union workers premium overnight  holiday and weekend wages during work slowdowns the companies have accused the union of orchestrating  The union has blamed changes in shipping practices instituted by the carriers themselves for causing worsening backlogs and say that suspending vessel operations has only made matters worse  Port officials say it will take six to eight weeks to clear the immediate backlog of cargo containers piled up on the docks once the dispute is settled and several months for freight traffic to return to a normal rhythm   Shipping industry experts say a longer term concern is that American export business lost to other countries and other ports  may not return once the crisis is over   
The retail and manufacturing industries have projected that a full  extended shutdown of the ports could cost the U S  economy some  2 billion a day   Reporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles  Additional reporting by Jeff Mason in Rancho  Mirage  California  Editing by Bill Trott ",2015-02-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-west-coast-ports-reopen-as-labor-secretary-arrives-for-talks-328425,328425
109212,330727,HMC,Pressure mounts on shippers  union to settle West Coast ports dispute,news,"By Steve Gorman LOS ANGELES  Reuters    The U S  labor secretary joined congressional leaders  three governors and a big city mayor on Wednesday in pushing shipping lines and the dockworkers  union to settle a contract dispute that has led to months of turmoil and cargo backups at 29 West Coast ports  Labor Secretary Tom Perez was sent to San Francisco as an emissary of President Barack Obama  who has come under mounting pressure to intervene in a conflict that has reverberated through the trans Pacific commercial supply chain and could  by some estimates  cost the U S  economy billions of dollars  Worsening cargo congestion that the union and shippers blame on each other has slowed freight traffic since October at the ports  which handle nearly half of all U S  maritime trade and more than 70 percent of the country s imports from Asia  More recently  the shipping companies have sharply curtailed operations at the terminals  suspending the loading and unloading of cargo vessels for night shifts  holidays and weekends at the five busiest ports  Works has continued around the clock in the dockyards  rail yards and terminal gates for most of the ports  Some smaller ports remained open to nighttime vessel operations as well  The union and shipping companies each accuse the other side of instigating the disruptions to gain leverage in contract negotiations that have dragged on for nine months  appearing to hit a roadblock in the last two weeks  ARBITRATION CITED IN SNAGGED TALKS The bargaining agent for the shippers and terminal operators  the Pacific Maritime Association  has said talks hit a snag over a union demand for changes in the system of binding arbitration of contract disputes  The International Longshore and Warehouse Union  representing 20 000 dockworkers  has insisted that an accord was near in the negotiations  which a federal mediator was assigned to oversee last month  Perez joined the talks for the first time on Tuesday  according to his spokeswoman  Xochitl Hinojosa  urging the parties to  come to an immediate agreement to prevent further damage to our economy   Sources familiar with the situation said Perez huddled with each party separately  then briefly together on Tuesday  and met with both sides again on Wednesday as negotiations and  sidebars  stretched into the evening  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti  whose city encompasses the nation s busiest cargo port and lies adjacent to the No  2 cargo hub at Long Beach  also met with representatives of both sides in San Francisco on Wednesday  his spokesman said  Meanwhile  the governors of the three West Coast states   California  Oregon and Washington   all Democrats  issued a statement on Wednesday welcoming Perez  involvement and calling for a quick resolution to the dispute  Separately  eight congressional Republicans who chair House or Senate panels with jurisdiction over transportation and labor sent a letter to Obama on Wednesday urging him to take further unspecified action if a settlement is not reached by March 2   two months from the date the federal mediator was appointed  A Senate Commerce Committee spokeswoman  Lauren Hammond  said the letter s reference to  exercising additional leadership to resolve the situation  could be interpreted to mean invoking the 1947 Taft Hartley Act  Under that law  a president can seek a federal court order compelling the end to a work stoppage in a labor dispute if it poses a national emergency  But labor law experts have said it would be difficult to make such a case to a judge under current circumstances  The union and the PMA have declined public comment since a federal mediator called for a news blackout last Friday  
The last time contract talks led to a full shutdown of the West Coast ports was in 2002  when the companies imposed a lockout that was lifted 10 days later under a court order sought by President George W  Bush under Taft Hartley   Reporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles  Additional reporting by Krista Hughes in Washington  Editing by Will Dunham  Peter Cooney and Sandra Maler ",2015-02-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-labor-secretary-to-hold-more-talks-in-west-coast-ports-dispute-328608,328608
109213,330728,HMC,Japan s annual exports jump most since late 2013 in boost to economy,news,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Mari Saito
TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s annual exports in January jumped the most since late 2013 in an encouraging sign a weak yen is finally boosting the nation s all important export engine and helping the economy crawl out of recession 
The 17 0 percent year on year gain in exports marked the fifth straight month of increase  supported by shipments of cars to the United States and of electronics parts to Asia  data by the Ministry of Finance showed 
Ministry officials say exports are on a firm footing  adding that special factors helped boost shipments such as a rebound from last year s Chinese New Year holidays which fell in January  and extreme cold weather which hit the U S  economy a year ago 
A pickup in shipments   which had been a soft spot in the economy   is welcome news for policymakers who hope exports will offset still weak private consumption  and cheaper oil prices will spur firms to spend more on wages and investment  generating a virtuous growth cycle 
And with the economy recovering at a subdued pace after slipping into recession last year  stronger exports growth would let the central bank hold off on any additional stimulus 
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday he saw no need now to expand monetary stimulus as the bank raised its view on output and exports and stuck to its assessment that the world s third largest economy is recovering moderately 
 The BOJ will wait to see how oil prices may impact people s deflationary mindset  and brisk trade data will encourage Kuroda to stand pat on policy for the time being   said Takeshi Minami  chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute 
A jump in export volume suggests that Japanese exporters who have gained hefty profits due to a weak yen are lowering exporting prices to boost shipments  Minami added 
Nissan Motor Co is trying to boost car exports from Japan to benefit from the weaker yen  Honda Motor Co  which has virtually no exports from Japan now  aims to ship abroad about 10 20 percent of its cars built at home 
January exports topped a 11 9 percent annual gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll  following a 12 8 percent rise in December 
Export volume grew 11 2 percent  the fastest gain since December 2010 
Imports fell 9 0 percent in the year to January  due to slumping oil prices  narrowing the trade deficit to 1 18 trillion yen   9 94 billion   but still a record run of shortfalls stretching 31 months 
Exports to the United States rose 16 5 percent on year in January  while those to Asia  which account for more than half of Japanese exports  grew 22 7 percent  driven by a rush in demand before the Chinese New Year holidays

109298,330813,HMC,Is Honda Motor  HMC  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Honda Motor Co   Ltd    NYSE HMC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Honda Motor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Honda Motor s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Honda Motor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 86  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Honda Motor stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Honda Motor has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  HMC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Honda Motor currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Honda Motor a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio for Honda Motor comes in at 4 6  which is far better than the industry average of 5 6  Clearly  HMC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Honda Motor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives HMC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been promising  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen two up in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up by 0 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Honda Motor Company  Ltd  Price and Consensus     This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineHonda Motor is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a strong industry rank  among Top 4  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  1 boosts investor confidence  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Although the industry has not performed up to par in recent times  its strong rank makes us hopeful of a turnaround soon 5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s

include Seiko Epson Corp   OTCMKTS   OTC SEKEY        Honda Motor  NYSE   NYSE HMC       and Park Ohio Holdings Corp   Nasdaq   NASDAQ PKOH       Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  What Is the Greatest Threat to Our Nation The following is an excerpt from Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank s full To access the full PDF  I  U S  Markets I am going to start this U S  overview with Eurozone budget data  Eurozone data  you ask  Shouldn t that be in the global overview  Not this month  This month  I will have the USA and Mainland China trade date in the global section What am I thinking harder about  The big policy issues most investors to this publication would like to know more about  U S  trade and tax decisions What this PhD economist needs to do first  Cover tax changes  To start  I don t know much of what is going to actually happen on the Federal budget  The House and Senate both must approve a finalized tax plan Tax plans come with joint decisions on personal and business taxes  debt financed spending  and revenue sent to Federal programs to fund needed operations    like national defense  Medicare  and interest on the huge accrued debt  That s where the rubber meets the runway A core matter  then  concerns annual Macroeconomic Balances  I want to share more on that in this letter  There s a logical structure  Most of you are not aware of it  That is the relationship trade balances and their financial sister    current account balances    have with Federal budget balances  You cannot violate this All economies    regardless of size    function under Macroeconomic Identities  1  Aggregate Demand  Spending    Aggregate Supply  Output   which implies 2  Consumption C    Investment  I    Government  G    Net Exports   NX    Y 3  C   I   G   Exports   Domestic Production of Goods and Services   ImportsBelow  The latest Consensus Economics macro balances for the Eurozone Study this table of twin balances closely  See the relationships  Macro Identities predict Tight countries with bigger Budget Surpluses  the Netherlands  Germany   Ireland  run bigger Current Account Surpluses  identical to Trade Surpluses   Loose countries at the bottom  France  Spain  Belgium  Portugal   Italy  run the largest Budget Deficits  The identical countries also accrue the biggest Trade Deficits This is a key point I want to make    on the USA    and any other country  The bigger your Federal budget deficit  the bigger is your national trade deficit  I will re state that final identity equality  Closely inspect this key relationship Consumption   Investment   Government   Exports   Domestic Output   ImportsWhen the USA    or any other country    is at full employment  4 2  in an unemployment rate is clean evidence of that   running a Federal deficit means over spending on the ability of the domestic economy to supply the excess demand     created by the visible excess seen in government budgetsIn times of deep stress    like a recession or depression in private domestic spending    John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s argued very effectively  This was a good idea  Get the Federal government to spend  when the private consumer and businesses cannot  That is persuasive  Running and asking for enlarged Federal budget deficits in times of deep private macro stress is forever called  Keynesian  However  what about an economy that is at full employment  That will mean internal domestic spending  however created  has fully engaged the capacity of the domestic economy to supply it At full employment of domestic resources  any Federal overspending is balanced by production shipped in from abroad  aka Imports   That means this  Larger Federal Budget problems must lead directly to larger Federal Trade Deficits So what  you say Realize  the current USA Federal government is attempting to deal with lowering trade deficits  It is re negotiating trade deals with Canada  Mexico and Mainland China  among others  Then  the same USA Federal government proposes to increase the Federal budget deficit with tax cuts Ensuing larger Federal budget deficits will surely DRIVE UP the U S  trade deficit I restated it  Because that s a BIG point It is an undisputable one  from both the point of view of Macro Identities and the recent macro data I showed you from the Eurozone  or any other sovereign for the matter  If you want to cut your overall trade deficit  you MUST CUT your budget deficit Why USA politicians try and violate Macro Identities  I do not know II  Global Markets For a Global Outlook  I will present the freshest trade data for the USA and China In 2016  the U S  exported  1 45T and imported  2 19T  leaving a trade deficit of  735B  The U S  had an  18 6T economy  The trade deficit in   of annual GDP is then  3 95  In 2016  in comparison  Mainland China was nearly a mirror image  China exported  2 1T and imported  1 59T  leaving a surplus of  510B  China had an  11 2T economy  The trade surplus in   terms of annual GDP is  4 5  The US China mirror image is no artifact of statistics  It is real  Also pay attention to the statistics on the US s major trading partners  The US runs chronic trade deficits with ALL of its major trading partners  sans our mother in history  the United Kingdom What s my big point  Our Federal budget deficit creates our overall trade deficit  U S  general government borrowing lending is  4 4  of GDP in 2016  Now  consult the trading partners of China  Lo and behold  Hong Kong and the US see these huge trade surpluses Hong Kong is an entrep t An entrep t or trans shipment port is a port  city  or trading post where merchandise may be imported  stored or traded  usually to be exported again  These commercial cities are spawned due to the growth of long distance trade Japan  Germany  South Korea and Taiwan  All of these high income countries currently import much more than they export to China  Really    They don t display the US story  at all  It s the reverse Current Republican Senator from Tennessee Bob Corker  and a member of the Senate Budget Committee  summed up this situation succinctly  I think the greatest threat to our nation is us  The way we handle our finances  we as a nation are the greatest threat to our nation  It s not ISIS  It s not North Korea  It s not ascendant China  It s not Russia  We are the greatest threat     Sept  29th  2017III  Zacks October Sector Industry Company TelescopeFall is the season  Sector leaders are clear It is no

sentiment  which in turn managed to grab the interest of foreign investors Foreign investment in Japan s stocks touched 4 4 trillion yen or  39 billion in the last six weeks  This came as welcome news for the country after foreign investors sold around 2 4 trillion yen or  21 billion of Japanese stocks during the mid July to early September period Currently  it is necessary to look beyond the success of the domestic market and diversify into other markets  in particular Japan  Strong earnings performance along with improved economic conditions attracted billions of foreign investment in Japan  In this context  adding mutual funds with significant Japanese exposure to your portfolio would be a good idea Benchmarks Hit New HighsThe Nikkei Stock Average climbed 1 86  or 408 47 points to

109302,330817,HMC,U S  regulator orders national Takata driver side air bag recall,news,"By Bernie Woodall DETROIT  Reuters    The U S  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  on Wednesday ordered Japanese air bag supplier Takata Corp to expand its regional recall of driver side air bags to cover the entire United States 
NHTSA gave Takata until Tuesday to declare that its air bag inflators are defective and issue a recall  If it does not  NHTSA could begin steps to fine the Japanese firm up to  7 000 per vehicle  as well as forcing a recall 
The regulator is limited and cannot fine a company more than  35 million  The U S  Department of Transportation  which includes NHTSA  has asked Congress to raise that limit to  300 million 
Shares in Takata plunged as much as 7 9 percent in volatile Tokyo trade and were down 2 7 percent by mid morning on Thursday 
A spokesman at Takata  which has resisted NHTSA s past requests that it expand the recall nationally  said the company was still reviewing the letter and could not immediately say what action it would take 
Defective Takata air bags have been linked to at least five deaths  all in Honda Motor Co vehicles 
A nationwide recall would affect vehicles made by at least five automakers  Honda  Ford Motor Co  Chrysler Group LLC  a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  Mazda Motor Corp and BMW AG 
NHTSA has made no estimate of the number of vehicles that would be included in such an expanded recall  The regional recalls have involved about 4 1 million vehicles 

The Wednesday letter from NHTSA to Takata Senior Vice President Kazuo Higuchi said Takata s previous recall limited to areas of high humidity should be expanded because of incidents reported in California and North Carolina that are outside the initial regional recall area

109334,330849,HMC,Takata  Honda sued over death linked to faulty air bag,news,"By Jessica Dye NEW YORK  Reuters    Takata Corp and Honda Motor Co were hit Monday with a lawsuit over an air bag linked to the death last month of a woman in Florida  the latest legal issue for the companies as they continue to recall millions of vehicles for the faulty part 
The family of Hien Tran filed a wrongful death lawsuit in state court in Orange County  Florida  according to the family s lawyer  Henry Didier  Tran died on Oct  2  three days after her 2001 Honda Accord hit another car and the air bag exploded  the suit said 
A medical examiner in Florida told Reuters that Tran had  stab type wounds  from air bag shrapnel that contributed to her death  which was originally investigated as a homicide due to the nature of her wounds 
 A Honda spokesman said the company had not seen the suit and could not yet comment  He said Honda encouraged owners of recalled cars to get their vehicles fixed  
A Takata spokesman declined to comment 
Takata air bags are the target of a U S  safety investigation that started earlier this year over the risk that they could explode during an accident  spraying metal shards  More than 16 million vehicles made by nearly a dozen different automakers have been recalled globally over the problematic parts since 2008 
Tran s death is the most recent of four in the U S  known to be linked to Takata air bags in Honda vehicles  Three of those deaths  including Tran s  were in Honda Accords  the lawsuit said  Honda has also identified a fifth air bag related fatality in Malaysia 
The lawsuit accused Honda of failing to adequately warn car owners about the potential dangers  even after it had issued recalls and received reports about air bag related injuries and deaths  Between 2009 and 2014  at least eight serious injuries were linked to the air bags  the suit said 
The lawsuit cited a Sept  22 message from Honda to its dealer network telling them not to  proactively contact customers at this time  about the issue because there were not enough replacement parts  That message went out a week before Tran s accident  the lawsuit said 
 She didn t know about it  because she never got a recall notification until after she was dead   Didier told Reuters 

In addition to several personal injury and wrongful death suits  Takata  Honda and other car makers affected by the recalls face more than 15 proposed class actions from customers who say the safety issues caused their vehicles  value to plummet

So far  five fatalities  in Virginia  Oklahoma  Florida  California and Malaysia  have been linked to faulty Takata air bag inflators 
Edward Markey  a Democratic senator from Massachusetts  and Richard Blumenthal  a Democratic senator from Connecticut  said in a statement the Arizona accident victim s sister will be at the news conference on Thursday in Washington 
A spokesman for Markey declined to provide details and Blumenthal s office could not immediately be reached for comment 
The press conference will take place ahead of a hearing in Congress at which officials from Takata  Honda Motor Co Ltd  Chrysler Group and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are scheduled to testify regarding recalls involving the Takata air bags 
All of the deaths linked to the faulty Takata air bags  which can potentially explode and spray metal shrapnel at occupants of the vehicle  occurred in Honda cars  But a spokesman said the Japanese automaker was  not aware of an incident in 2003  involving an air bag related fatality in one of its vehicles 
Takata U S  spokesman Alby Berman said the company was not aware of this incident mentioned by the senators and was looking into it 
On Tuesday  NHTSA said it had told Takata and five automakers   Ford Motor Co  Mazda Motor  Honda  Chrysler and BMW   to expand nationwide a regional U S  recall of vehicles with the potentially defective air bags 
The regional recall has involved 4 1 million cars in hot and humid areas where the air bags may be prone to fail  including Florida  Alabama  Mississippi  Georgia  Louisiana and parts of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico 
Around 16 million cars with Takata air bags have been recalled worldwide over the past six years  with more than 10 million of those in the United States 

Safety advocate Clarence Ditlow  executive director of the Center for Auto Safety  also will attend the senators  press conference  However  he said Wednesday he had not been told details of the Arizona accident

Honda said in a statement that its count of underreported claims came from a third party audit 
Honda cited  various errors related to data entry  and also said it used an  overly narrow interpretation  of its legal reporting requirements  The company said it is taking steps to remedy these shortcomings 
The Japanese automaker s U S  arm responded to a Nov  3 order from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  seeking an explanation for why Honda failed to fulfill its legal obligation to report deaths and injuries  especially those involving air bags 
Honda and Japanese supplier Takata Corp have been at the center of investigations of defects in Takata air bags 
Since 2008  Honda has recalled more than 7 5 million U S  cars because defects can cause the inflators in some Takata air bags to rupture  spraying metal shards into vehicle occupants 
NHTSA sent a second order to Honda on Nov  5  seeking details and documents related to the air bags and inflators 
Honda sent its response on Monday to NHTSA s first order  A summary of that response was read on Monday by Rick Schostek  executive vice president of Honda North America 
Schostek testified last week at a U S  Senate Commerce Committee hearing on Takata air bags  During Monday s conference call  he declined to take questions 
In the early warning reporting data required by U S  law  Honda failed to disclose eight incidents of ruptured Takata inflators that resulted in one death and seven injuries  Schostek said  The company said it provided details of those incidents to NHTSA outside the early warning reporting process 
Separately on Monday  a lawsuit was filed in South Carolina federal court tying a Takata air bag to the 2008 death of Mary Lyon Wolfe in a 2002 Honda Accord  The lawsuit said the air bag in Wolfe s car  deployed with excessive force  and caused grave injuries  according to the suit 
Wolfe died 18 days later due to her injuries from the accident  the lawsuit said  A Takata spokesman declined to comment 
Also on Monday  the Senate requested additional air bag related documents from Takata  to gather information that could address questions left unanswered  at last week s hearing

Akihiro Ohta  Japan s transport minister  said Tuesday that the task force will deal with the recall of 2 54 million vehicles in connection with Takata s air bags  Bloomberg reported  Honda  which has the highest number of affected vehicles  is being probed by the task force to ascertain if the company avoided reporting more than 1 700 claims of injury or deaths over the last 11 years  Nearly 16 million vehicles equipped with Takata air bags have so far been recalled globally  and over 10 million of those vehicles were sold in the U S 
Takata  which is the subject of a criminal investigation in the U S  due to the faulty air bags  is also facing over 20 class action lawsuits  and a probe by the U S  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  Reuters reported  The air bags in question reportedly injured drivers  in some cases fatally  by deploying with excessive force and shooting out metal fragments 

A recent New York Times report  citing former Takata employees  had said that the auto components maker had conducted investigations on its airbags after a 2004 accident  and had told its workers to delete the test results  The company has denied the claims and  last week  Hiroshi Shimizu  Takata s senior vice president of global quality assurance  said  during a senate hearing that the recalls had been mostly linked to places with high humidity  as moisture was causing the air bags to inflate with explosive force 
While Takata s shares have fallen over 50 percent since January  Honda s shares have fallen nearly 14 percent in the same period ",2014-11-25,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japan-sets-up-task-force-to-handle-takata-air-bag-recalls-317948,317948
109339,330854,HMC,Japan reports  unusual deployment  of Takata air bag  may lead to more recalls ,news,"TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s transport ministry said on Wednesday it received a report of an  unusual deployment  of a Takata Corp air bag outside an existing recall program   raising the prospect that recalls could be expanded in Japan 
Officials at the ministry  Japan s auto safety regulator  told reporters a passenger side air bag exploded as it was being removed from a scrapped car in Gifu prefecture in central Japan on Nov  6  shooting out metal shrapnel  No one was hurt 
 In this case  we don t yet know the cause of the unusual deployment and we don t yet have detailed information  so we are instructing the carmaker to determine the cause and report back as soon as possible   said Masato Sahashi  director of the ministry s recall enforcement office 
The ministry would not disclose the car s maker  noting only it was a Japanese model  The 2003 model car was fitted with a Takata air bag with an inflator manufactured in January  2003 
Officials said this particular inflator produced at this time was not subject to recalls in Japan  but may already be part of a wider recall by some automakers abroad 
 The type of inflator which malfunctioned in this case is carried in other cars that are still on the road  so this is useful in determining whether there should be more recalls   Sahashi said 
Japan has set up a special taskforce to deal with the expanding recall crisis  Ten automakers have so far recalled 2 54 million vehicles in Japan over potential defects with Takata air bags  More than 16 million vehicles have been recalled globally  and at least five deaths   all in Honda Motor Co  T 7267  cars   have been linked to Takata air bags 
Part of the vehicle scrapping process in Japan is to set off the air bag to prevent its accidental deployment  There have been six previous cases where an inflator ruptured the air bag in cars at salvage yards in Japan from 2008 to 2014 

In addition  there have been four incidents in which air bags in cars in use deployed with excessive force  damaging the vehicles  No deaths or injuries have been recorded from any of these incidents in Japan

109340,330855,HMC,U S  regulator  Chrysler recall delay hikes air bag risk,news,"By Bernie Woodall DETROIT  Reuters    Chrysler Group LLC must expand its regional recall of vehicles with Takata Corp air bags and begin notifying customers of the action by Monday  the U S  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said 
Chrysler s delay in alerting owners of potential defects in Takata air bags  exacerbates the risk to motorists  safety   the NHTSA said in a letter sent on Tuesday to company Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne 
Chrysler  a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  MI FCHA   N FCAU   was among 10 automakers that in June began recalling vehicles registered in some high humidity states and U S  territories because the Takata air bags in those vehicles can rupture and spray metal shards into occupants 
Ruptured inflators in Takata air bags have been linked to at least five deaths in Honda Motor Co  T 7267  cars since 2004 
In June  Chrysler recalled 371 000 Chrysler and Dodge vehicles from model years 2005 to 2008 with the air bags  In a September memo on the regional recalls made public last month  NHTSA estimated that Chrysler would need to replace the air bags in about 441 000 cars 
Chrysler is still reviewing the Nov  25 NHTSA letter to Marchionne  a company spokesman said on Wednesday 
NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman said  Chrysler is obligated  to expand its recall to coastal areas of Texas  Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama as well as southern Georgia  Guam  Saipan and American Samoa  Takata had sent NHTSA a report on Nov  10 that said its air bags in those areas were defective  he said 
So far  Chrysler s recall has only covered Florida  Puerto Rico  Hawaii and the U S  Virgin Islands 
Takata told NHTSA it will begin shipping replacement parts to Chrysler on Monday 
Chrysler has said it will wait until Dec  19 to tell customers because of a lack of replacement parts 

Shares of Fiat Chrysler were down 0 8 percent at  12 55 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange  They fell 0 4 percent in Milan

109353,330868,HMC,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Protect Your Portfolio ,opinion,Per the theory of cost of capital  a company s capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that are used to finance its capital projects  Now a comparative analysis of the same theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper  especially in periods of low interest rates This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company s future profits as well  No doubt  debt financing is a popular financing option among the majority of corporations But debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant   A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affect the company s bottom line growth Therefore  to safeguard one s portfolio from notable losses  the real challenge for an investor is determining whether the organization s debt level is sustainable as a debt free corporation is rare to find  Historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt to equity ratio is one of the most common ratios Analyzing Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity Therefore  before blindly pursuing high growth yielding stocks  investors must consider their debt level  Since large debt loads can make a so called growth stock volatile in times of economic crisis  it is better to go for stocks bearing low debt to equity ratio The Winning StrategyIn theory  the optimal capital structure for a company is one that offers the ideal debt to equity ratio that maximizes its value and minimizes its cost of capital   Since  in practice  screening stocks based on these criteria is a bit difficult  herein  we choose low leverage stocks as these are considered safe bets However  an investment strategy based solely on the debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other criteria  as discussed below Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success  Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best

109363,330878,HMC,Honda ordered to give Takata air bag papers to U S  agency,news,"By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert DETROIT  Reuters    U S  safety regulators ordered Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co Ltd  T 7267  on Wednesday to provide documents and answer questions under oath about potentially defective air bags installed in millions of recalled U S  vehicles 
The air bags were made by Japanese supplier Takata Corp   which received a similar order last Thursday from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
For the past 18 months  Takata has been besieged by chronic  widespread problems with defective inflators in its air bags  which can explode with excessive force and spray metal shards inside the vehicle  The issues have led to recalls at 10 automakers  but only Honda  Takata s biggest customer  has been sent a special order by the NHTSA 
The U S  safety agency is seeking all internal Honda communications related to Takata air bag inflators  as well as any field reports  warranty claims and pre suit legal claims  incidents and lawsuits related to the issue 
The agency also is asking Honda whether it sent any employees to visit Takata plants in the United States or Mexico  starting in 2000 
Honda was ordered to deliver the documents by Dec  15 
NHTSA Chief Counsel Kevin Vincent issued an earlier special order to Honda on Monday as part of an investigation to determine whether the automaker failed to fully report accident related deaths and injuries as required by U S  law  The deadline for information pertaining to that order is Nov  24 
 Honda has had regular communications with the NHTSA regarding the issues addressed in the special order  and we will continue to cooperate   the company said in an email statement 
Takata spokesman Alby Berman said the company  will continue to fully cooperate with the government investigation  
Since 2008  10 global vehicle manufacturers that use Takata air bags have recalled more than 11 million cars in the United States and more than 17 million worldwide to replace inflators linked to at least four deaths and numerous serious injuries 
Honda has recalled nearly 7 6 million cars in the United States since 2008 because of the defective inflators  and more than 9 5 million cars globally 
One safety advocate said NHTSA s order was a must given Honda s prominence in the various cases involving the potentially defective air bags 

 Honda had the first known Takata air bag inflator explosion in 2004 and has all 4 known deaths linked to Takata air bags   Clarence Ditlow  executive director of the Center for Auto Safety  said in an email  Honda reported an unusual air bag deployment to Takata in 2004  but did not report it to the NHTSA until September 2009

109385,330900,HMC,Honda executives to take pay cut after fifth Fit hybrid recall,news,"By Chang Ran Kim TOKYO  Reuters    Honda Motor Co  T 7267  said on Thursday its president and 12 other executives would take an unprecedented pay cut after the Japanese automaker announced the fifth recall in a year of its new Fit model 
The recall  which covers 425 825 vehicles in Japan  comes as Honda is facing lawsuits due to accidents involving airbags supplied by Takata Corp   The airbags have been linked to four deaths   all on Hondas   and have triggered a multi million vehicle recall by several automakers worldwide 
 We have inconvenienced many customers  and we re deeply sorry   Honda spokeswoman Akemi Ando told reporters after announcing the latest Fit recall  Shares in Honda ended down 1 4 percent on Thursday  underperforming the benchmark Nikkei average  N225  
No injury or death has been reported from the defects  as with the previous four recalls  Honda added 
The recall will cost about 5 7 billion yen   53 million   and the impact on earnings is minimal  Honda said  The overall cost of the five recalls involving the Fit hybrid now stands at 16 5 billion yen  it added 
Because the recall highlighted quality concerns  the company said that over the next three months  Chief Executive Takanobu Ito will take a 20 percent pay cut while other senior executives including Chairman Fumihiko Ike and Executive Vice President Tetsuo Iwamura will give up 10 percent of their pay 
Honda also said it had appointed Senior Managing Officer Koichi Fukuo to oversee quality improvements across the organisation 
Honda said the latest recall was over two noise related defects in the Fit and Vezel hybrids as well as some gasoline engine Fit and N WGN models  The automaker will also recall 183 cars overseas for the same glitch 

Honda first recalled the Fit hybrid in October 2013   just one month after launch   for defective controls on its newly developed seven speed twin clutch transmission system  Two recalls followed for the same issue

109387,330902,HMC,Faulty Takata air bags may not be replaced for months,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  safety regulators do not expect Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp to be able to fully supply replacement parts for millions of defective air bags until January or later  and urged Takata and the automakers it supplies to seek additional parts from other companies 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  which has come under fire for being too lax and slow in dealing with the defective air bags  also called on automakers to be ready to expand their recalls beyond the warm and humid regions believed to be the epicenter of the problem 
The defective air bags  which can launch metal shards into car occupants  have been tied to at least four deaths and many serious injuries  They have triggered the recall of more than 10 million vehicles since 2008 by 10 different manufacturers 
Takata must boost production and even tap competitors to address demand while car makers must do much more to aid the recall effort  a top safety official said in letters to manufacturers 
 More can and should be done as soon as possible to prevent any further tragedies   the agency s deputy director  David Friedman wrote to auto makers 
Car makers should boost advertising to alert drivers of air bag dangers and offer loaner cars during repair  he said  He said car makers should even test Takata air bags themselves  as regulators keep studying why the safety device has been involved in so many mishaps 
If test results indicate potential defects with inflators in other parts of the country   you will need to act quickly to expand your recall   he wrote  also asking if the companies are seeking to buy replacement parts from other suppliers 
Friedman will meet with Takata executives on Thursday and expects weekly updates on progress  the official wrote 
Regulators reached out to General Motors  Nissan  Ford  BMW  Honda  Mazda  Chrysler  Mitsubishi  Subaru and Toyota 
Separately on Thursday  lawmakers called for an independent review of NHTSA and asked whether the agency could do more to detect and snuff out design dangers  The agency briefed U S  lawmakers earlier this week 
The agency released summaries of three meetings with Takata and vehicle manufacturers over the past three months  The summaries indicate that an estimated 3 1 million inflators would need to be replaced as part of the regional recall announced in June  By September  that estimate had grown to 4 3 million inflators 
In a letter to Takata Senior Vice President Kazuo Higuchi  NHTSA Deputy Director David Friedman demanded that Takata provide updated estimates of its ability to produce replacement parts and called on the Japanese firm to provide details about a program to test inflators  as soon as possible  

 Corrects timing of replacement parts from  after February  to  January or later  in first paragraph

Federal regulators in June asked carmakers for help identifying suspect air bags manufactured by Takata Corp  7312 T    Honda s largest supplier of the safety device   The air bags and inflators can explode with excessive force and spray metal shards into vehicle occupants   Since 2008  ten global vehicle manufacturers that use Takata air bags have recalled more than 10 million cars in the United States and more than 17 million worldwide to replace inflators that have been linked to at least four deaths and numerous serious injuries ",2014-11-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-opens-probe-into-honda-reporting-of-takata-air-bag-failures-315260,315260
109393,330908,HMC,Should Value Investors Consider Honda Motor  HMC  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Honda Motor Co   Ltd    NYSE HMC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Honda Motor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 67  as you can see in the chart below This level is significantly favorable with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 34  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Honda Motor s current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 13 59  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Automotive   Foreign industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 71  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Honda Motor has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 33  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Honda Motor has a P S ratio of about 0 39  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Honda Motor currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes HMC a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 84  which is slightly better than the industry average of 6 58  Clearly  HMC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Honda Motor might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives HMC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen two downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up by 1 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined about 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Honda Motor Company  Ltd  Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHonda Motor is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  despite a decent industry rank  top 26  out of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  3  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Automotive   Foreign sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Best   Worst of ZacksToday you are invited to download the full  up

Among major Japanese exporters  Honda Motor Company Ltd  TOKYO 7267  was down 3 2   while Tokyo Electron Ltd   TOKYO 8035  was off 1 8  as the yen retraced earlier weakness  though support was mild on a central bank inflation survey 
The Bank of Japan Thursday released data on the inflation outlook measured in CPI among companies polled in its quarterly Tankan survey for September that showed an expected 1 5  rise in CPI in the coming year  unchanged from their average forecast in the previous 
The figures suggest companies are skeptical about the BoJ hitting the stable 2  inflation target during fiscal 2015 ending on March 31  2016 
Overnight  U S  stocks fell on concerns third quarter earnings may disappoint  while soft U S  data also pushed stock prices lower 
The Dow 30 fell 1 40   the S P 500 index fell 1 32   while the NASDAQ Composite index fell 1 59  
Earnings season is fast approaching  and fears that soft European and Chinese economies may affect U S  top lines sent stock prices falling on Wednesday  especially on concerns that the Federal Reserve will wind up its monthly bond buying program later this month 
Fed stimulus tools such as asset purchases aim to suppress long term interest rates  which makes stocks attractive while such programs are in place 
A mixed bag of economic indicators in the U S  took its toll on stock prices as well 
The Institute of Supply Management reported earlier that its manufacturing index fell to 56 6 in September from 59 0 in August  Economists had expected the index to decline less and come in at 58 5 
The employment sub index slowed to 54 6 from 58 1 in the previous month  while the new orders sub index fell to 60 0 from 66 7 
At the same time  separate data revealed that U S  construction spending fell 0 8  in August to an annual rate of  960 96 billion  Analysts were expecting a decline of only 0 5   and the day s data gave a few investors room to sell the greenback for profits 
Elsewhere on Wednesday  data showed that the U S  private sector added more jobs than expected in September  though stocks focused on global issues 
Payrolls processor ADP reported that the U S  private sector added 213 000 jobs last month  just ahead of expectations for jobs growth of 210 000  The economy created 202 000 jobs in August 
In other news  reports that the Ebola virus has arrived in the U S  added to the selloff  especially by hitting airline  cruise lines and other stoicks on fears people will avoid traveling

109410,330925,HMC,New kings of the road  Big motorbike makers rev up in Southeast Asia,news,"By Yantoultra Ngui KUALA LUMPUR  Reuters    Roads in Southeast Asia have been getting a little louder lately as motorcycle makers  an aspiring middle class and easy bank credit come together to breed a new genus of motorcyclists   the big bike rider 
Traffic in urban centers such as Jakarta  Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City has long been characterized by swarms of small motorbikes and scooters  Honda Motor  T 7267  and Yamaha Motor   the world s biggest motorbike makers  have dominated this sprawling regional market 
The landscape is slowly shifting as the Southeast Asian market  the world s third largest after China and India  undergoes a structural change  In Malaysia and Vietnam  motorbikes with bigger engine capacities are outselling their smaller cousins 
Italy s Ducati Motor Holding  DUMTG UL   Japan s Kawasaki and Austria s KTM are among motorbike makers looking to build a new axis of growth in this market of 600 million people as orders for larger bikes in first world countries slow 
They are wooing not just small bike owners graduating to larger models  They are also chasing riders who already own a four door subcompact sedan but have no qualms about taking on an additional financial commitment 
Harley Davidson  N HOG  plans to roll out a new entry level motorcycle  the Street 750  in Southeast Asia early next year  The 749cc model has been a hit in India  with sales accounting for 60 percent of the company s local revenue two months after its launch in February  The bike costs 410 000 rupees   6 663  
 We are optimistic about the Southeast Asian premium leisure motorcycle market   Marc McAllister  vice president and managing director of Harley Davidson Asia Pacific  told Reuters   The motorcycle is perfectly suited to the region s infrastructure and fast growing urban cities filled with a younger generation of riders who want an accessible premium ride  
The demand for premium bikes is in step with rising gross national income  GNI  in Indonesia  Thailand  Malaysia  Vietnam and the Philippines   vast countries held together by miles and miles of high speed motorways  urban roads and rural byways 
In Vietnam  GNI per capita is approaching the key  2 000 level  data from the World Bank shows  Crossing that threshold marks the first phase of a shift in a population s spending from subsistence to moderate consumption  U S  based private equity and investment consulting firm TorreyCove Capital Partners said in a report in 2013 
Indonesia and the Philippines both breached the  3 000 level in 2012  while in Malaysia and Thailand  GNI per capita stood at  10 400 and  5 370  respectively  last year  according to the World Bank data 
In Vietnam  sales of larger models are outpacing the broader market  according to Harley Davidson and Ducati  In Malaysia  sales of bikes with capacities of 250cc and above surged 49 percent last year  while the overall market was almost flat  local industry association data shows 
In Indonesia  the region s largest motorcycle market  bikes with similarly bigger capacities comprised 13 percent of total sales in 2013  up from 11 percent in 2012 
 We also see that not only bigger and heavier bikes will have a better volume  but also cross touring motorcycles like BMW  DE BMWG  and Triumph will have a better opportunity here   said Tony Tardjo  head of consumer lending of Indonesia s Bank CIMB Niaga  
 This kind of motorcycle offers the ability for on and off road  which is suitable for Indonesian road infrastructure   he said 
EXTRA COMMITMENTS
With a monthly salary of 4 000 ringgit   1 229   Hor Chee Fung  28  is one of the region s new middle class earners  working hard to pay off monthly commitments from phone bills to car loans  But that didn t stop him from taking another loan to buy a larger and more powerful motorcycle 
 I don t mind taking that extra commitment to join my fellow riding friends   said Hor  a Kuala Lumpur based financial analyst with International Business Machines Corp  N IBM  
Hor is moving from a moped to a 250cc sports motorbike   the Kawasaki Ninja 250R  He plans to eventually upgrade to a Harley Davidson or Ducati entry level model when he gets a pay rise and promotion 
An entry level Ducati  such as the Monster 795 assembled in Thailand  costs 59 900 ringgit in Malaysia  18 percent cheaper than an entry level Toyota Vios car  A Kawasaki Ninja 250R costs less  at 22 590 ringgit 
 These superbikes are highly affordable from 60 000 ringgit to the dream machines costing 500 000 ringgit and above   said Khairul Kamarudin  business development director at Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd  a unit of BIMB Holdings Bhd  KL BIMB  
 As there are presently not many financial institutions providing superbike financing  we view this under served community as an exciting prospect   he said   We are in this superbike financing for the long haul  
A consumer banking manager from a Kuala Lumpur based bank was more cautious  He said the superbike market is still small compared with car financing  though he agreed it is growing 
 I would say a lot of it is impulse buying   he said  adding that interest rates are high  as much as 10 percent if the client chooses zero downpayment 
Market research firm Nielsen estimates that middle class earners in Southeast Asia  or those with disposal incomes of as much as  3 000 a month  will more than double to 400 million by 2020 
CLOSE TO YOU
To be closer to this new growth segment  KTM  Europe s second largest motorcycle maker  last year opened its first assembly plant outside Austria in the northern Malaysian state of Kedah  That came two years after Ducati  a unit of Audi AG  DE NSUG   set up a factory in Thailand 
 We notice in Southeast Asia a clear demand for bigger engine capacities  Even premium high end models like our 1290 Super Duke R show potential  But clearly the main business is done with products between 200 and 400cc   Thomas Kuttruf  PR manager at KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH  told Reuters 
Apart from being closer to their customers  it also makes more economic sense for manufacturers to produce in Southeast Asia 
A regional free trade pact has meant lower import tariffs in the single digits  Bikes and components imported from outside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  are slapped with duties of up to 30 percent  making them more expensive 
 The choice of the factory in Thailand  the first for us outside of Italy  was an important step    We are able to deliver Ducati motorcycles throughout Asia taking advantage of the ASEAN duty agreement   Pierfrancesco Scalzo  general manager of sales and marketing at Ducati Asia  told Reuters 
For now  market leaders Honda and Yamaha remain unfazed by the entry of other motorbike makers 
Like Ducati  KTM and Kawasaki  a unit of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd  T 7012   Honda is starting to offer bigger bikes  producing the CB500 and CB650 series in Thailand 
 We are not competing with the other manufacturers   Yuka Abe  a Tokyo based Honda spokeswoman told Reuters   But we do this because in Asia  demand for bigger models is increasing while in developed countries  the demand for the same is decreasing  
Yamaha is not about to be left behind  The world s second largest motorcycle maker has recently started producing a new 250cc sports motorcycle in Indonesia   the R25   and is looking to launch the model worldwide soon

109413,330928,HMC,China Sept vehicle sales growth slowest in 19 months ,news,"BEIJING  Reuters    China s September auto sales rose 2 5 percent from a year earlier  its slowest pace in 19 months  dragged down by sluggish sales of commercial vehicles such as trucks  an industry association said on Monday 
Vehicles sales totaled 1 98 million units last month  the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  CAAM  told a press conference in Beijing  Passenger vehicle sales rose 6 4 percent while commercial vehicle sales slumped 16 percent 
During the first nine months of 2014  China s vehicle sales rose 7 0 percent from a year earlier 
CAAM has forecast that the market will expand 8 3 percent this year  slowing from last year s 13 9 percent pace 
 China already has a huge auto market  and with more cities expected to restrict auto sales to fight pollution  it s natural for growth to slow down   said Li Xiangfeng  an analyst at Shanghai based consultancy ISE 
 The market cannot grow at double digit pace forever   he said  adding that the slump in commercial vehicle sales might be cased by a slowing economy 
In September  Japanese carmakers Nissan Motor Co Ltd  T 7201  and Honda Motor Co Ltd  T 7267  both posted their third consecutive monthly decline in China sales  registering decreases of 20 percent and 23 percent respectively 
Nissan attributed the decline to sluggish sales of commercial vehicles and increased competition while Honda said dealers had been clearing inventory ahead of the launch of two new models later this year

109431,330946,HMC,Suddenly  Mexico Is A Major Auto Manufacturer,news,"By   

The announcement was so important for his country s economy  Mexico s president delivered the news himself   On the same day that General Motors Co  NYSE GM said it would be calling home Cadillac SRX crossover production from Mexico in a deal worked out with the United Auto Workers union  South Korean automaker Kia Motors Corp  KRX 000270 said it will spend more than  1 billion to construct its first auto manufacturing plant in Mexico  according to the Spanish language El Financiero news agency  President Enrique Pe a Nieto made the announcement Wednesday in Mexico City  highlighting the country s determination to attract automotive investment 
 The Kia plant in LaGrange  Georgia  is working at capacity  and they had a choice to expand capacity there or follow what the industry has been doing in recent years   Dean Barber  founder of Barber Business Advisors  a corporate site selection advisor  told International Business Times by phone after the announcement was made   Kia is building at the doorstep of the United States  Another good thing about that is Mexico has more free trade agreements than the United States  about 40  
Bordering the world s second largest auto market to its north  Mexico has long been an ideal location for car manufacturing  especially after Canada  the U S  and Mexico began dismantling protective trade barriers starting in 1994 with the North American Free Trade Agreement  At the time  Mexico produced a little more than one in 20 cars in North America  the most recent figures from the INEGI  the country s statistics and census bureau  puts that figure at closer to one in five 
 Having a Korean company enter Mexico will mean that practically all global automakers will be represented in the country   Armando Soto  president of Kaso y Asociados  a Mexico City auto industry consultant  told Bloomberg Businessweek 
Automakers have been attracted to Mexico s low labor costs to produce small sedans  which offer slim profit margins compared to trucks  SUVs and luxury cars  In February  Honda Motor Co  Ltd  TYO 7267 began making its Fit at a new  800 million plant in Celaya  Guanajuato state  marking the first time the five door subcompact   popular among money conscious empty nesters and first time new car buyers    is being built in North America  In February  Mazda Motor Corp  TYO 7261 opened its first wholly owned plant in North America  a  770 million facility in Salamanca  Guanajuato state  that can make as many as 175 000 Mazda2 supermini cars and Mazda3 compacts 
 The Forte compact  Soul subcompact or Rio subcompact could be among the possibilities to be built  at the Kia plant    reported Automotive News  Reuters confirmed Wednesday afternoon the Kia Forte would be the first car made at the plant 
In recent years Mexico has begun attracting the attention of companies seeking to build more high end vehicles  a nod to the country s manufacturing workforce which 20 years ago might not have been considered reliable or experienced enough to put together a BMW X5 or an Infiniti Q 
In June  Daimler AG  FRA DAI   the maker of Mercedes Benz  and Nissan Motor Co  TYO 7201 announced plans to spend about  1 36 billion building a plant near Nissan s existing one in the state of Aguascalientes  The project would see production of the Nissan s Infiniti luxury cars by 2017 and future Mercedes models as part of an expanding alliance between the German luxury carmaker and Japan s third largest car company 
A week after that announcement Daimer rival Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  ETR BMW  said it was spending  1 billion to build another plant in Mexico  one that will produce about 150 000 vehicles a year beginning in 2019  The German carmaker already makes four of its popular models for the North American market in the central industrial city of Toluca 
 BMW and Mercedes are going to be building cars down there  They  automakers  traditionally might have focused on lower end cars  but BMW  Mercedes  Infiniti   these aren t low end cars   said Barber 
Mexican automotive workers make in a day roughly what U S  car factory worker make in an hour  and there are more than a half million of those Mexican automotive workers  Since 2011 Mexico has attracted nearly  10 billion in foreign direct investment  including commitments that have not yet been fulfilled  from the automotive sector  according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor  Michigan

Toyoda  whose grandfather founded Toyota in the 1930s  has ordered company officials to re evaluate plans to open a second manufacturing facility in Mexico  a country that s benefitting from a recent influx of automotive activity as carmakers seek lower labor costs just south of the United States  the world s second largest auto market 
 There s absolutely no unused capacity lying around anywhere in North America  Installing production capacity to try to trigger growth is the old way that got us in trouble before   a top company executive told Reuters about Toyoda s eleventh hour re examination of plans to break ground by 2016 on a new central Mexico factory to produce the Corolla  the world s best selling sedan 
The verdict seems to be the company will move forward with the plan  but a final decision isn t likely until early 2015  two company executives told Reuters on condition of anonymity  The factory could be smaller than intended to save costs  but officials say local demand for Toyota cars in Mexico warrants some form of capacity expansion 
Toyota currently assembles its Tacoma pickup truck near Tijuana from break down kits  Under the North American Free Trade Agreement  Toyota pays less to export the assembled Tacoma to the U S  and Canada from Mexico and also benefits from the lower labor and operating costs compared to the U S  and Canada  where Toyota operates nine facilities  Mexico also benefits from free trade agreements with other Latin American countries  which makes exporting to them less costly 

 Mexico is becoming a key hub for auto exports and is expected to quickly grow in global auto significance   said a recent research note from Wood Mackenzie  an industry consultancy group   The opening of the first luxury car plants by Audi  Nissan Infiniti  Mercedes Benz and BMW in the coming years demonstrates automakers  confidence in Mexico s capability  
The recent influx of luxury cars is a positive sign for Mexico  which has traditionally been a platform for low cost  low margin vehicle production  But recent announcements from German luxury carmakers Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  FRA BMW  and Audi AG  FRA NSU  that they would set up shop in Mexico indicates the automotive labor force has developed enough to attract more upscale production 
Other companies that have announced plans to expand to Mexico or have started production there include Kia Motors Corporation KRX 000270  Honda Motor Co  Ltd  TYO 7267  Nissan Motor Co  Ltd  TYO 7201 and Mazda Motor Corp  TYO 7261 
Toyota s re evaluation comes as the automaker expects net profit from global sales to drop 2 4 percent in the current fiscal year through March 2015 as foreign exchange activity  the sales in foreign currencies that must be converted back into Japanese yen  will work against it this year compared to last year ",2014-09-16,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/toyota-taps-brakes-on-expansion-309631,309631

109467,330982,HMC,BMW to reveal Mexico factory plans this week  official,news,"MEXICO CITY MUNICH  Reuters    Germany s BMW AG  DE BMWG  will unveil this week plans to build a new factory in Mexico  a government official said  as the company seeks to meet growing demand for premium cars 
News of the factory comes just days after BMW s German rival  Daimler  announced similar plans  and adds to a growing list of companies plowing money into car making in Mexico 
Speaking on condition of anonymity  the Mexican official said the plant would likely amount to an investment of at least 1 billion euros   1 36 billion  and would be located either in Hidalgo state north of Mexico City or San Luis Potosi in central Mexico 
A spokesman for Munich based BMW said earlier on Monday that  a decision will be made public  on July 3 
BMW declined to comment further 
A new factory in Mexico would come on top of BMW s plans to invest  1 billion to expand capacity by 50 percent at its plant in Spartanburg  South Carolina 
BMW Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said last week that the Bavarian carmaker was still deliberating about where to locate a new factory and would reach a decision before the summer break 
Premium auto makers BMW  Audi and Mercedes Benz are expanding global production as their factories in Germany struggle to meet strong demand for off road vehicles and limousines in the United States and Asia 
Supplier sources said BMW had already mapped out a production timetable for Mexico  with a tentative plan to begin assembly in late 2017  ramping up annual capacity to 200 000 by 2020 
On Friday  Daimler AG  DE DAIGn  and Renault Nissan  PA RENA   T 7201  said they would invest 1 billion euros   1 36 billion  to develop small cars and build a factory in Aguascalientes  Mexico 
Manufacturing in Mexico allows European car makers to sell vehicles in the United States while avoiding some of the currency and tariff costs that crimp profits on imports  Mexico also offers lower labor costs than Germany and the United States 
Daimler s Mercedes Benz  Nissan Motor Co  Honda Motor Co  T 7267   Mazda Motor Corp  T 7261  and Volkswagen AG  DE VOWG p  already have large auto plants in Mexico

109468,330983,HMC,Honda says to expand U S  regional air bag recall to include California,news,"By Yoko Kubota TOKYO  Reuters    Honda Motor Co is expanding to the state of California a U S  regional recall of vehicles over potentially explosive air bags made by Takata Corp  the automaker said on Friday  after a complaint that said a driver was injured in an accident in the state 
Honda s move takes the regional recall involving the potentially faulty airbags beyond hot and humid southern states and into the nation s most populous state and a major market for automakers 
Honda decided to expand the recall after it was told on June 25 about an accident involving a 2005 model Accord that had taken place in California in May  a spokeswoman said 
According to a complaint filed to U S  safety regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA   the air bag in the car shot out  hot metal and plastic shrapnel  after a collision that happened at low speed  leaving the driver with  severe burns  bruises and abrasions on her arms and legs  
 While this case does not match the areas that NHTSA has determined  Honda is adding California into the areas in which it is conducting a regional recall in order to investigate the cause quickly   the Honda spokeswoman said 
It was not immediately clear how many vehicles would be recalled in California  In the regional recall  Honda is pulling back certain vehicles including model years 2001 2007 Accord  2001 2005 Civic and 2002 2006 CR V 
A Takata spokeswoman was not able to comment immediately on the matter 
In June  Honda and six other automakers said they were recalling vehicles in some high humidity regions at the request of the NHTSA to see if faulty Takata air bag inflators had been installed in their vehicles 
The car makers are recalling certain vehicles in Puerto Rico  Florida  Hawaii and the Virgin Islands  regions determined by NHTSA  Honda is also recalling vehicles in Alabama  Georgia  Louisiana  Mississippi  South Carolina and Texas 
Safety experts have said that the six other automakers could expand their regional recalls to include the additional areas covered by Honda  The NHTSA probe is still underway 

Over the past five years  automakers have recalled about 10 6 million vehicles globally with air bags supplied by Takata  the world s second biggest automotive safety parts maker  excluding the U S  regional recalls 
Out of that  Honda has recalled more than 6 million  At least two deaths are alleged to have been caused by faulty air bags  both of which were on Honda Accord vehicles

109472,330987,HMC,Consolidation Featured As Market Holds Its Breath,opinion,"The equity markets snapped their losing streak yesterday and are consolidating today  The US dollar is narrowly mixed  The euro and sterling are slightly firmer  but well within yesterday s ranges  The dollar bloc is a bit lower  and once again the Australian dollar is struggling to sustain moves above  0 7700 
The focus is of course on the US election  In addition to the national contest  a third of the Senate and the entire House of Representatives is up for election  While the media and some politicians warn against voter fraud  the real  rigging  is the legal kind  There are always a few irregularities  but why we can talk of swing states and the high re election rate of incumbents is not because of illegal fraud  but the legal gerrymandering  which is the drawing of districts for partisan purposes 
In addition  there is a long history of efforts to dissuade minority voters  The mere fact that the election is held in the middle of the week speaks to an ambivalence toward widespread participation  Many  if not most other countries hold elections on weekends 
In addition the power of incumbency should not be minimized  The US House of Representatives reelection rate is higher than the the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party  The CCP also have term limits  something US legislators do not  Patronage and clientele networks predated communism by thousands of years 
The die is cast  Despite some media continuing to report a knife edge decision  the market seems to be fairly confident of a Clinton victory  An as expected outcome would also likely include a Democrat control of the Senate  even if through the Vice President as tie breaker  Such a result would  of course  have considerably less impact than a Trump victory  with the GOP maintaining control of the entire legislative branch 
That said  like modern political parties  the Democrats and GOP are coalitions  The Warren Sanders wing of the Democrat Party will push for sympathetic nominees and policy  The GOP seems more divided with a burnt earth wing  an only Tea Party wing  the old guard  traditional leaders   and the Trump wing  Many commentators are seeing the GOP turn on Paul Ryan as they have the past two GOP speakers 
In terms of data  the market has a different focus today  Still for the record  note that Germany and the UK reported industrial production  Both were weaker than expected in September  German industrial output fell 1 8   The Bloomberg median was for a 0 5  decline  The August series was revised to 3 0  from 2 5   The year over year pace was halved to 1 2   The Bundesbank has already acknowledged that the economy softened in Q3  but there are already preliminary signs of a stronger Q4  The first look at Q3 GDP will be in a week  Most are looking for around a 0 3  gain after a 0 4  pace in Q2 
September industrial output in the UK fell 0 4   It is the second consecutive decline of the same magnitude  Outside of a 0 1  gain in July  UK industrial output has not increased since April  However  the manufacturing sector did better than expected  rising by 0 6  instead of the expected 0 4  gain  It is the second monthly gain  but the two months have not fully offset the 0 9  drop in July  Weakness was seen in oil and gas extraction   4 5    ONS shaved its estimate for Q3 industrial output to 0 5  from 0 4   but Q3 GDP may be revised higher  led by services 
Two of the world s large surplus countries  Germany and China reported trade figures  German s trade surplus rose to 24 4 bln euro from 19 9 bln in August  It is the largest surplus since June well above the 12 and 24 month averages  21 2 bln and 20 7 bln euros respectively   Exports and imports fell after strong gains in August 
China s trade surplus rose to  49 1 bln from  42 bln in September  Exports fell 7 3   It is the seventh consecutive month that exports have fallen  Imports fell 1 4  after a 1 9  decline in September  With the exception of the August when imports rose 1 5   imports have been falling since last 2014  As we saw with the depreciation of the yen  a weaker yuan   9  over the past 15 months  has not boosted exports  as ECON101 would suggest  For the record  exports to the US fell 5 6  in October  Exports to the EU fell 8 7   Crude oil imports slipped from September s record  Copper imports fell to their lowest level since February 2015  The drop in copper imports seems to reflect  import substitution  as domestic output is rising 
 Separately  we note China s auto sales surged by a fifth last month  It was the eighth month of gains  A key consideration appears to be beating the end of a tax cut on small engine autos  Although the tax cut is slated to expire at year end  the government is reportedly looking at extending it  Foreign owned producers are participating  General Motors Company  NYSE GM  deliveries reportedly rose 5 7  and Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  s deliveries rose 14   Nissan Motor Co Ltd  OTC NSANY  s deliveries increased 16  and Honda Motor Company Ltd  NYSE HMC  s surged 40  ",2016-11-08,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consolidation-featured-as-market-catches-and-holds-breath-200163383,200163383

109511,331026,HMC,Rare Earths MMI Stagnant  Substitution And Recycling Decimate Prices,opinion,"Our Rare Earths MMI held steady  or flat  depending on how you look at it  at 17 this month  an example of how stagnant prices have been in a low range this year 
The low price of rare earths did not come about because of export quotas being struck down in China or the World Trade Organization loss that precipitated the quotas  end  In China  heavy rare earths production became more stable  but that wasn t the reason either  What has caused the rare earths market to essentially collapse is substitution on a large scale and better recycling of the high tech minerals 

Rare earths demand has fallen because manufacturers sought to eliminate the threat of a national blockade  the likes of which Japan felt after Chinese rare earths producers essentially blacklisted the country in 2011 
Companies such as Siemens  NS SIEM   Samsung  KS 005930  and Honda  NYSE HMC  have accelerated research on how to use less of the minerals  especially the  heavy  rare earths such as lanthanum and dysprosium  In that way  China hurt its own monopoly by forcing their customers to apply more ingenuity and brains to eliminating or limiting the scarce elements in their supply chains  Honda even produced a hybrid car engine  the first ever  that doesn t rely on heavy rare earths 
Honda s apparent turning point was a partnership with fellow Japanese firm Daido Stee  T 5471  in 2011  prompted by China s squeeze  The result today is a new technique for designing crucial engine magnets that avoid heavy rare earths and are 10  cheaper and 8  lighter  Honda told the Wall Street Journal 
The world will still likely need rare earth elements  particularly for renewable energy products such as solar panels and wind turbines  but the evidence of the damage done by China s attempt to corner the market on heavy rare earths is now overwhelmingly apparent and a recovery in prices will not happen in the short term

109575,331090,HMC,The Inescapable Trap Of The  Dollar Short   Japan As China ,opinion,"Before World War II  in Japan there were four large conglomerates situated as vertically integrated family centered monopolies  Called zaibatsu  they were Mitsui  Mitsubishi  Sumitomo  and Yasuda  and many other smaller rivals  Each group would not just own companies in all industries  they would also organize and contain an assimilated banking concern  horizontal integration  to carry out capital and funding needs for within the group  In 1946  the Allied occupation authorities ordered them dissolved 
That meant that the individual companies formerly firmly pressed within each of the zaibatsu holding company orbits were freed and set about to their own designs  What they did  however  was to turn again toward the same organizing principles as zaibatsu but more loosely in affiliation  There was still the same kind of pooling of resources and general organization around a major holding concern or even a bank  though much more informally  These more flexible integrations and ties were called keiretsu 
Throughout the Japanese post war  miracle  period  the keiretsu were directly in the middle  By the 1970 s there were the  big six   each with a bank and financial services firms along with vertical and horizontal integration among many different industries  Further  to prevent any takeovers or other  interference   the memberships of any keiretsu would cross own shares and make other internal financial commitments as needed  debt   As you can appreciate  this was one of the major impediments to unraveling the banking collapse in the early 1990 s 
The entanglements work both within and without the keiretsu right up until the current time  meaning in more recent function it is more conceptual than perhaps it had been in the past  For example  Hitachi is part of both the Mizuho and Fuyo organizations simultaneously  accessing banks and financial services among both while cross holding shares also in both groups  Honda Motor Company Ltd  N HMC  is  on the other hand   strongly  independent  as it claims to be  Even so  with no formal ties  Honda is in practice tightly wound into the Mitsubishi keiretsu  with banking and funding needs performed at Mitsubishi Bank while several Mitsubishi firms  Tokyo Marine and Nichido Fire Insurance and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ for instance  are large shareholders in Honda to this day 
Further  there are layers to all these keiretsu associations that just cannot be appreciated from the outside in how industrial Japan functioned  They had presidents groups and chairmans groups in each that served to coordinate policy among the whole group  some of which held very specific rules for engaging and participating  It was  is   typically the bank at the center of each keiretsu that would host the monthly shacho kai  or president s assembly  These meetings were kept private and often proclaimed to be nothing more than social gatherings  but it was clear that they were significant in producing corporate harmony and something like individual keiretsu hegemony 
Penetrating the keiretsu structure was  as you can imagine  an impossible task  The Oxford Handbook of Business Groups  leaves little doubt  

Several analysts have used network clustering algorithms to infer groupings in the Japanese corporate network In this methodology  keiretsu materialize as blocks or clusters of firms occupying structurally equivalent positions in the network  We present the 1978 results because  of blockmodels generated by Lincoln and Gerlach every 3 4 years from 1978 to 1998  the earliest year gives the clearest picture of distinct keiretsu clusterings  In each succeeding period  the empirically derived groups were less sharply drawn and corresponded less well to external criteria as shacho kai affiliation  By the mid  to late 1990 s  the CONCOR map of the large firm network reveals general keiretsu dissolution  whether of the big six horizontal groups or such historically prominent vertical groups as Hitachi  Matsushita  Nissan  Nippon Steel  and Toyota 

Even if the keiretsu are no longer what they once were  there is at least good anecdotal evidence  I won t present here  that still looser affiliations remain   especially among the inner layers of what were keiretsu structures of the large industrial and trading firms tied closely to the banks 
In recent years  particularly beginning in 2011 with the devastating earthquake and tsunami but really once the yen was so disastrously  devalued  at the first whisper of Abenomics  and the  of QQE   Japanese production has moved increasingly offshore  Much of that  as I have chronicled over the past few years  has ended up in China  That suggests that as Japanese formerly keiretsu penetrated further into mainland China  they likely brought with them their banking  core   At the very least  Japanese banks with close ties to these offshoring Japanese firms were likely introduced to Chinese industrial counterparts 
I should clarify at this point that this is speculation on my part  reasonable I think  since finding and exposing direct data is exceedingly difficult  one of the reasons why I included the history above   It is my limited contention  at this moment  in trying to develop an operating theory of wholesale  dollars  that vitally encompasses as broad a spectrum as reasonably possible  that the offshoring trend plus QQE provided  from the Chinese perspective  an injection of external financing as well as an additional conduit to connect Chinese firms and banks to the global trade network  i e   a Japanese route for China s  dollar short  
The timing seems to align very well with general outlines provided by the events of the past especially two and a half years  Japan underwent QQE and yen alteration which gave Japanese banks  something to do  just as China s  dollar short  grew large and really unwieldy  the 2012 global economic slowdown bit into China s  dollar  recycling system  Japanese corporates were ramping up business with and within China  meaning more complete financing to go along with trade financing was undoubtedly in demand  Add back the eurodollar bank withdrawal starting in later 2013  particularly after November 20 of that year  and there is very good reason to suspect that Japanese financial importance vis a vis the  dollar  was amplified for Chinese counterparties 

It is  for me at this point  the most reasonable estimation as to why Japan suddenly appears with a  dollar  problem  especially since Japan almost certainly does not have one  As a conduit for wholesale financing flowing to and now away from China  it is possible that it would appear that way  depending upon a whole lot of additional assumptions that need verification   It isn t just the TIC data  however  that argues for some kind of Asian influence with eurodollar funding and even domestic money markets of late  While the Open Market Operation Reverse Repos  RRP   the program the Fed is using to help establish a money rate floor  continues to be underwhelming on all counts the  other  RRP is in overdrive   the pre existing reverse repo program the Fed has used as an  accommodation  to foreign governments  central banks and other overseas banking concerns  
If this is correct  then it will tell us hopefully a lot more about the shape of illiquidity as it is further presenting itself heading into 2016 ",2015-12-30,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-inescapable-trap-of-the-‘dollar-short’;-japan-as-china-378246,378246

109591,331106,HMC,Auto Industry  Endless Recalls And Other Headwinds,opinion,"Recall related headwinds are presently the biggest concerns for the auto industry  The last two years have been brutal in terms of the number of recalls as well as the number of affected vehicles  Just when the road started to feel smooth this year  massive recalls due to the defective Takata airbags steered the sector uncontrollably toward yet another bumpy ride 
Another major issue is the recent slowdown in sales in China  Automakers have been banking on growth prospects in Asia and a downturn in China will have a major impact on global sales  Many automakers have started resorting to price cuts in the country to entice buyers  However  this is bound to have a negative impact on margins  On the other hand  there are many positives such as exciting vehicle launches  declining fuel prices  impressive domestic sales and a recovery in Europe  Moreover  the sales volume in China is impressive  despite the slowing growth rate in the last few months  Still  there are plenty of reasons to be careful about the auto industry stock space for both the short and the long terms  Below  we discuss some of the key challenges that investors in the auto sector should watch out for in the coming months and years Safety Recalls Weigh on Financials Safety recalls and related costs have become a major issue for most automakers in recent years  An astounding 632 recalls covering 22 million cars were announced in 2013  In 2014  safety recalls were at record levels 
Automakers recalled over 60 5 million vehicles in the U S  in 2014  according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration   NHTSA    This figure is nearly double of the previous record of 30 8 million vehicles in 2004  Moreover  these figures only cover the recalls in the U S  and the global recall numbers are much higher  The recall saga continues in 2015  Defective Takata airbags  which resulted in significant recalls last year  can be blamed for the maximum recalls this year  Recently  Takata agreed to acknowledge that 33 8 million of its airbags are defective  This announcement will increase the number of vehicles and trucks recalls due to the faulty airbag issue by nearly 100  
Takata and 11 automakers  including Toyota Industries Corp  TOKYO 6201   Nissan Motor Co Ltd  OTC NSANY   Ford Motor  NYSE F  and Honda Motor Company Ltd  NYSE HMC  have been affected by the issue  The biggest victim  however  is Honda    Takata s largest customer 
The recall related repair costs intensify the financial burden of auto manufacturers Slower Sales Growth  Price Cuts in China Although China reported exceptionally strong auto sales in 2014  the rate of growth has lately seen a deceleration  By the end of 2014  the growth rate fell 7 percentage points from 2013 end  It declined 6 3 percentage points year over year in the first four months of 2015 as well  In fact  the sale of commercial vehicles fell 6 5  year over year in 2014 and 19 1  in Jan Apr 2015  While the sale of passenger cars increased during both periods  the growth rate slowed  Slowing economic growth in China is leading to the sluggishness in vehicle sales  As China is the largest and fastest growing automobile market in the world  a decline in vehicle sales or even a slowdown in the growth rate can significantly hurt the revenues of automakers  As a result of the decelerating sales growth rate  many automakers are cutting vehicle prices in China  Automakers usually sell vehicles at double or even triple the price in China from the price set in the U S  However  they are now cutting prices in the hope of salvaging the situation at the cost of bottom line growth Market Share Concentration Market share concentration makes the automobile sector highly competitive  The top 10 global automakers account for nearly 81  of the total vehicles sold  according to marketrealist com  Although automakers continue to focus on shifting their production facilities to new regions owing to cost and demand factors  developing a supplier network in these unfamiliar regions is one of their greatest challenges  especially when existing suppliers lack the financial strength to expand capacity into new markets 
Moreover  high dependence on automakers makes auto market suppliers vulnerable to pricing pressure and production cuts  Pricing pressure from automakers constricts margins of parts suppliers  Simultaneously  frequent production cuts by automakers to account for market adjustments affect suppliers  operations  Some auto industry suppliers that are highly dependent on a few major automakers are Meritor Inc  NYSE MTOR   Tenneco Inc  NYSE TEN  and The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company  NASDAQ GT  Bottom Line This analysis shows that while the industry s near  to medium term picture is fairly reassuring  a number of long term challenges remain ",2015-06-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/auto-industry:-endless-recalls---other-headwinds-253848,253848

109623,331138,HMC,Railroad Industry Remains Favorable,opinion,"Following third quarter results  railroad stocks appear to be recovering from the operational hazards faced earlier this year  The industry s operational efficiency despite uncertain market conditions positions it favorably 
Despite the expected headwinds associated with coal    one of the major products transported via rail    the sector emerged strongly backed by infrastructural developments that supported natural gas  grain crop and petrochemical product shipments 
Factors Influencing Current Industry Trends
 Intermodal While most of the other commodities  including Automotive and General Merchandize  have shown uncertainty in growth for 2014  intermodal volumes are strong  As a result  we expect railroads to significantly focus on intermodal expansion and tap underserved markets with highway to rail conversions  Railroads are now looking to the Mexican market  which is witnessing regulatory reforms  including rail reforms  initiated by President Enrique Pe a Nieto to lure foreign direct investments to boost economy  Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP   which serves all six gateways between the U S  and Mexico  is likely to seek this opportunity to increase its penetration into the Mexican market  Moreover  there are major investments to look forward to this year involving intermodal growth  These include BNSF Railway Company s  900 million spending on terminal  line and intermodal expansion and CSX Corp s  NYSE CSX   investments in nine projects  Montreal terminal  capacity expansion of its northwest Ohio intermodal hub  and terminal expansion in New Orleans and Savannah Crude Shipment According to the Energy Information Administration s  EIA  reports  crude oil growth may go up to 10 million barrels per day from 2020 to 2040  In addition  Association of American Railroads  AAR  reported that railroads transported 407 642 carloads of crude Oil in 2013  up from 234 000 carloads in 2012  Further information suggests that crude oil accounted for around 1 4  of total Class carloads in 2013  compared with 0 03  in 2008 when the concept of crude by rail started gaining importance  Major railroad companies like Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC   are looking for expansion strategies mainly due to development of the energy sector  including the gas exploration projects in Marcellus and Utica shale plays as well as ventures associated with coal and power generation  Over the coming years  the company plans to introduce 32 energy related projects in 14 states under its service areas  In the upcoming months  we expect the railroad companies to increase investment to create adequate service capacity for the oil and gas markets  This would lead to exponential growth in crude oil shipments across the rail industry  Consequently  we expect petroleum shipments to remain favorable and emerge as a significant revenue contributor over the long term 
Automotive Mexico is currently a growing market for automotive production and assembly  given the lower cost of production in the region  We believe that the plants established by Honda Motor Co   Ltd   NYSE HMC   Nissan Motor Co   OTC NSANY   Mazda  OTC MZDAY  and Audi  OTC AUDVF  would boost auto production in Mexico 
The growth will provide carriers like Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU    which operates across the Gulf of Mexico  ample opportunities to ship raw material to Mexico and return the finished products to the domestic market as well as to the U S  and Canada  The company has access to 12 automotive production facilities and is in talks with automotive companies to build five more near its rail network  Auto makers such as Audi AG  Kia Motors Corp   Mercedes Benz  Infiniti and BMW AG are expected to open their facilities in Mexico  boosting shipments for Kansas City Southern  According to reports  the new automotive production plant is expected to increase production capabilities by 923 000 units produced per year Coal Reduced electricity generation from coal turned into a major concern for rail freight carriers  According to the EIA s latest Short Term Energy Outlook  U S  coal production will increase 1 2  in 2014  lower than previous forecast of 4 1   Further  it is expected to remain flat in 2015 
Coal consumption in 2014 is expected to grow 1 2  to 868 million short tons  MMst  in 2014 but drop 0 4  in 2015  owing to retirement of several coal power plants  The EIA projects coal exports to decline to 96 MMst in 2014  In 2015  exports can go further down to 83 MMst owing to weak global economic conditions  slow demand growth rate in the Asian markets  rising coal production in other countries and lower international coal prices  These data currently indicate a bleak outlook for railroads business from coal shipments Grain Shipments While 2014 remained a good year for rail in terms of grain shipment  2015 forecast is comparatively modest  According to The United States Department of Agriculture  USDA   agricultural exports in 2015 are forecasted to be  143 5 billion  down  9 0 billion from 2014 
The decline will result from an expected fall in grain and feed exports owing to lower production of corn  wheat and certain feed products  Further  imports are anticipated to decline  As a result  we expect agricultural products to have a negative impact on railroad carloads in the coming year as grain shipment represents one of the key commodity segments Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  railroads are broadly grouped within Transportation  one of 16 Zacks sectors   As a guideline  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower is Positive  between  89 and  176 is Neutral and  177 and higher is Negative  The Zacks Industry Rank for the railroad industry is currently  92  implying neutral outlook  We believe while some of the product lines succeed or suffer  depending on seasonality or other external factors influencing market demand  intermodal remains on the growth trajectory 
Further  the surge in petrochemical shipments has bolstered the industry  thereby leading to earnings improvement  However  tepid growth in coal shipments continue to affect industry prospects  rendering a cautious outlook Earnings Trend of the Sector The broader Transportation sector  to which railroads belong  reflects a sustainable growth trend  All the sector participants have reported third quarter results  which have been stable in terms of both beat ratios  percentage of companies reporting positive earnings surprises  and growth  The earnings and revenues  beat ratio  for the quarter was 72 7  for the transportation sector  On a year over year basis  total earnings for the companies in this sector rose 10 4   while revenue growth was 6 6   The sector is expected to register full year earnings growth of 15 7  in 2014  In terms of revenue expectation  the sector is expected to record 5 7  ",2014-12-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/railroad-industry-remains-favorable-236723,236723

109647,331162,HMC,Railroad Stocks Navigate A Choppy Track,opinion,"The year 2014 set the railroads on a choppy track  Harsh winter weather had taken its toll on most of the freight transportation companies and railroads seem to be no exception  Operational efficiencies went down  while costs went up  leading some major railroads to lower their bottom line expectations for 2014 
Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  railroads are broadly grouped within the Transportation sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors   We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry   As a guideline  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative   The Zacks Industry Rank for the railroad industry is currently  32  implying that the outlook remains positive on this sector  This highlights an encouraging earnings outlook for the industry despite being persistently prone to seasonality factors  While the outlook of some of the product lines will fluctuate with seasonally  the demand outlook for Intermodal offerings remains consistently positive 
Expectations of improved U S  economic growth in the coming quarters and beyond is a net positive for this economically sensitive sector  We remain optimistic as railroads are witnessing gradual recovery in Coal shipments  Further  the upsurge in petrochemical shipments has also uplifted the markets conditions of this industry leading to earnings improvement 
Earnings Trends of the Sector
The broader Transportation sector  of which railroads are part  reflects a sustainable growth trend  In the currently underway Q1 earnings season  95  of the sector market capitalization have reported results  with total earnings up  7  on  3 3  higher revenues  with 66 7  beating EPS estimates and 33 3  beating revenue estimates  This is better performance than the broader S P 500  but weaker than what we saw from the same group of companies in 2013 Q4 and the 4 quarter average  Nevertheless  the sector is expected to register full year earnings growth of 7 4  in 2014  In terms of revenue expectation  the sector is expected to register 4 4  growth 
First Quarter 2014 Financial Results
The major companies that have so far reported include CSX Corp   NYSE CSX    Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  and Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP   While Union Pacific and Kansas City reported year over year increases in earnings  CSX recorded a drop  However  year over year top line growth has consistently been on the rise for these companies 
Major Contributors in 2014
Intermodal
While most of the other commodities including Automotive and General Merchandize have shown uncertainty in growth for 2014  Intermodal volumes are strong  As a result  we expect railroads to significantly focus on Intermodal expansion and tap underserved markets with highway to rail conversions  According to the Association of American Railroads  AAR   North American Rail Traffic was driven by 3 3  growth in Intermodal volumes in the first quarter  The growth was largely seen in U S  intermodal business with volume expanding 3 8  year over year Railroads are now looking forward to the Mexican market  which is witnessing regulatory reforms  including rail reforms  initiated by President Enrique Pe a Nieto to lure foreign direct investments to boost economy  Union Pacific  which serves all six gateways between the U S  and Mexico  is likely to seek this opportunity to increase its penetration into the Mexican market  Moreover  there are major investments to look forward to this year involving Intermodal growth  These include  BNSF Railway Company s  900 million spending on terminal  line and intermodal expansion and CSX Corp  s investments in nine projects  Montreal terminal  capacity expansion of its northwest Ohio intermodal hub  and terminal expansion in New Orleans and Savannah Norfolk Southern  NYSE NSC  has an investment plan of  487 million on developing intermodal facilities that include six projects  Further  Kansas City Southern is looking forward to its Monterrey to Nuevo Laredo track upgrade and developing its double track corridor between Sanchez and Nuevo Laredo  It is also expanding its Sanchez Yard and focusing on developments in Interpuerto San Luis Potosi 
Crude Shipment
According to the Energy Information Administration s  EIA  reports  crude oil growth may go up to 10 million barrels per day over a period of 2020 to 2040  Further  AAR reported that railroads transported 407 642 carloads of crude oil in 2013  up from 234 000 carloads in 2012  Further information suggests that crude oil accounted for around 1 4  of total Class carloads in 2013 compared to 0 03  in 2008 when the concept of crude by rail started gaining ground    According to AAR  U S  crude oil production will increase approximately 60  from 2008 through 2014  representing estimated production of 8 5 million barrels per day by 2014 end   This surge represents an opportunity for revenue accretion  which the railroads are trying to achieve with infrastructural development  Despite the fact that rail based crude transportation costs more   10  15 per barrel as against  5 a barrel through pipeline   crude shippers are compelled to rely on rail based transport  This is due to the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key oil and gas fields like Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and Montana  Eagle Ford Shale  Barnett Shale and Permian Basin in Texas  the Gulf of Mexico and Alberta oil sand fields in Canada  As a result  inadequate pipeline developments have given rise to higher penetration of railroad transportation for crude oil shipping in these areas  According to AAR s article   Moving Crude Oil by Rail   railroad moved over 60  of North Dakota s crude oil production  which contains the vast majority of new rail crude oil originations     Further  in terms of safety  railroads offer a better transportation avenue compared to pipeline given its better spill rate profile  According to U S  Department of Transportation  DOT   spill rate for pipelines are three times higher than rail based on crude shipments between 2002 and 2012  Additionally  railroads are simultaneously working toward tightening rail safety measures by appealing federal regulators to phase out old tank cars if these are not upgraded  Railroads are also seeking improved standards for new tank cars  Major railroad companies like Norfolk are seeking expansion strategies fueled mostly by the development of the energy sector  including the gas exploration projects in Marcellus and Utica shale plays as well as ventures associated with coal and power generation  Over the coming years  the company plans to introduce 32 energy related projects in 14 states under its service areas  Canadian Pacific projects crude shipment to reach 140 000 by the end of 2015  In the coming months  we expect railroads to accelerate their investments in order to create adequate service capacity for the oil and gas markets resulting in exponential growth in crude oil shipments across the rail industry  Consequently  we expect petroleum shipments to remain favorable and emerge as a significant revenue contributor in the long term 
Automotive
Currently  Mexico is a growing market for automotive production and assembly given the lower cost of production in the region  Although  total North American automotive shipment by rail fell 3 5  in the first quarter  the Mexican market saw a 12 8  rise in auto shipments by rail according to AAR freight rail traffic report  Despite a modest first quarter  industry sources project that auto production are slated to pick up  resulting in a record level of 16 million  representing the highest sales figure since the economic downturn in 2008    We believe plants established by Honda Motor Co   Ltd   NYSE HMC   Nissan  NISA TA   Mazda Motor Corp   7261 TOK  and Audi  NSUG F would further boost auto production in Mexico  The facilities also bode well for automotive shipments  Based on these expansions  finished vehicle production in the Mexican market is expected to reach 3 5 million units in 2015  up about 35  from the 2012 production level  The growth will provide carriers like Kansas City Southern  which operates across the Gulf of Mexico  ample opportunities to ship raw material into Mexico and return the finished products to the domestic market as well as to the U S  and Canada  The company projects Automotives shipment to register high double digit growth in 2014  Increased export activities at the Port of L zaro C rdenas will support future growth along with the opening of new auto plants in Mexico this year  In addition  the company expects North American full year auto sales growth in the range of 4 4 5  
Grain Shipments
Notably  2014 is expected to be a good year for rail in terms of grain shipment  North American grain shipment for the first quarter increased 9 5   led by 15  growth in grain shipment by the U S  railroad  However  shipping difficulties due to winter weather debarred Canadian railroads like Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railway from extraordinary gains derived from a strong Canadian harvest in 2013    
Coal
Reduced electricity generation from coal turned into a major foe for rail freight carriers  Class I railroads originated 6 2 million coal carloads in 2012  the lowest annual total output since 1993  Coal carloads dipped below 6 million in 2013  approximately 4 4  down from 2012 levels according to AAR reports  The decline in coal carloads offset the positive impacts of gains from crude oil for U S  railroads  Fraught with issues raised by the regulatory environmental agency  decelerating demand from power plants for electricity generation and the shutdown of coal fired power plants  there is only a bleak chance for railroads to draw any benefit from this commodity segment  which continues to contribute a large part of railroad tonnage  However  according to EIA s latest Short Term Energy Outlook  U S  coal production will increase 4 1  to 1 024 million short tons  MMst  given higher consumption due to severe winter that affected early 2014  Coal consumption in 2014 is expected to grow 4 2  to 964 MMst in 2014 due to higher natural gas prices than 2012 levels  EIA projects coal exports to total 101 MMst in 2014  which is lower than the previous projection of 107 MMst  In 2015  exports can go down even further to 96 MMs as a result of weak global economic conditions  slow demand growth rate in Asian markets  rising coal production in other countries and lower international coal prices 
Rail Investments
Investments in development and expansion plans remain crucial when analyzing railroads prospects  These capital investments are a double edged sword  While the investments put significant stress on margin performance  forgoing these would result in lesser growth prospects  Railway investments are paramount given the evolving supply chain management and increasing role of airfreight carriers in offering freight transportation services  These investments build the required infrastructure needed for railways to stay afloat in a competitive environment not only within the railroad industry but also with other modes like truck  barges and cargo airlines  As a result  investments in infrastructural projects have been an integral part of railroads development  However  this sector  characterized by huge capital influx  has been drawing funds primarily through private financing  As a result  investment plans when undertaken can have a considerable impact on the liquidity position of the company and may lead to a highly leveraged balance sheet  According to AAR reports  railroads invest approximately 17  of their annualized revenues  which compares with only 3  of average U S  manufactures  revenues on capital expenditures  According to DOT  the demand for rail freight transportation will increase approximately 88  by 2035  As a result  Class I carriers would have to expedite their investments to meet this growing demand  It is estimated that railroads would require  149 billion to improve rail network infrastructure within this stipulated period  Given the growing demand and need to upgrade railroad infrastructure to meet new regulations  deployment of fuel efficient locomotives  upcoming rules on track sharing  railroad safety and high speed rail services make it mandatory for railroads to infuse more capital on development projects  According to DOT  almost 90  of the railway capacity needs to be upgraded to meet the expected rise in demand level by 2035   Hence  for railroads it is important to balance profitability levels while investing in infrastructural development projects  Currently  the U S  railroad industry dominates less than 50  of total freight in America  indicating a huge opportunity for increasing market share  This opportunity can only be exploited by building railroad infrastructure that caters to the varied requirements of shippers 
OPPORTUNITIES
The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of opportunities that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors Discretionary Pricing Power  The freight railroad operators function in a seller s market and have enjoyed pricing power since 1980  when the U S  government adopted the Staggers Rail Act  The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike prices on captive shippers like electric utilities  chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry  As a result  of the Staggers Rail Act  railroads are hiking their freight rates by nearly 5  per annum on average  while maintaining a double digit profit margin Duopolistic Market Structures  Railroads have by and large gained by practicing discretionary pricing in the freight market  In the prevailing duopolistic rail industry  railroad operators will be able to reap maximum benefits from rising prices when the overall demand grows  This remains evident from the geographic distribution of markets between major railroads  Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe control the western part of the U S   while CSX Corp  and Norfolk Southern control the eastern part  On the other hand  Canadian Pacific and Canadian National control inter country rail shipment between the U S  and Canada 
CHALLENGES
Despite the above mentioned positives  the freight railroad industry  like other industries  faces certain external and internal challenges  These are as follows Capital Intensive Nature  Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructural improvements and acquisition of capital assets  Moreover  industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time  Adverse conditions in credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt  and may limit the companies  ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms Positive Train Control Mandate  The Rail Safety Improvement Act 2008  RSIA  has mandated the installation of PTC  Positive Train Control  by Dec 31  2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that involve passenger operations  The Federal Railroad Administration  FRA  issued its final rule in Jan 2010  on the design  operational requirements and implementation of the new technology  The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs for the rail industry at large Price Regulations  The pricing practices of U S  freight railroads are the major reasons of friction with captive shippers  who move their products through rail and do not have effective alternatives  According to the latest studies by the STB  approximately 35  of the annual freight rail is captive to a single railroad  allowing it monopoly pricing practices  The unfair pricing power exhibited by the U S  railroads has attracted congressional intervention for exercising stringent federal regulations on railroads  Congress has discussed railroad price regulation but has not passed any new rule so far U S  Environmental Protection Agency  Railroads remain concerned about the proposed regulation by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  for power plants across 27 states  The proposed guideline    Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants    aims at restricting emission of carbon dioxide by new power plants under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act  The standard proposes new power plants to limit their carbon dioxide emission to 1 000 pounds per megawatt hour  Power plants fueled by natural gas have already met these standards but the majority of the units using conventional resources like coal are exceeding the set limit  as they emit an average of 1 800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour  Railroads  which transport nearly two thirds of the coal shipment  are most likely to be impacted by the implementation of the new regulation that could pose a significant threat to utility coal tonnage ",2014-04-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/railroad-stocks-navigate-a-choppy-track-210779,210779

the 17 countries of the eurozone fell in November for the third successive month  The 0 3 percent decline for November was worse than forecast by financial analysts  who had anticipated a slight recovery  Compared to the same month in 2011  industrial production in the eurozone was down by 3 7 percent   Separate figures released Monday revealed that Europe s biggest economy  Germany  suffered a sharp contraction in the final quarter of 2012  The German economy  which accounts for 28 percent of all Gross Domestic Product  GDP  in the eurozone  contracted by 0 5 percent  This slashed Germany s growth rate for all of 2012 to just 0 7 percent  down sharply from the country s growth rate of 3 0 percent in 2011   The most significant expression of the economic downturn in Germany is the slump in investment by German companies in plant and machinery  Despite benchmark interest rates close to zero as set by the European Central Bank  investment in plant and machinery fell by 4 1 per cent during 2012  This compares to a 7 3 percent growth in such investment one year earlier  In line with the latest figures  the German government has cut its forecast for economic growth in 2013 from an already meager 1 0 percent to just 0 4 percent   The decline in investment in plant and machinery is the clearest indication that German executives expect the contraction in the country s key economic markets in Europe to continue and deepen  German exports to Europe declined by 2 0 percent in 2012  A full scale disaster was prevented only by increased German exports to North America  Mexico and the Far East   Germany s export industry is also threatened by the rise in the value of the euro  which has gained 8 percent against the US dollar in the past six months  At a meeting of business leaders in Luxembourg at the start of this week  the outgoing head of euro area finance ministers  Jean Claude Juncker  expressed concern over the rise in the value of the euro for European exports   Germany is currently the only major European country to be experiencing even a minimal level of growth  According to figures from the French Central Bank  the continent s second largest economy  France  barely avoided sinking officially into recession by posting 0 1 growth in the third quarter of 2012  In both the second and fourth quarters the national economy contracted   Inside the eurozone itself  seven countries are officially in recession  with Greece  Portugal  Spain and Italy mired in deep slumps  Outside the eurozone  Great Britain is expected to slide into a  triple dip  recession in 2013   The increasingly precarious nature of the European economy is underscored by the situation of one of its key industries auto  Although some German companies  in particular Volkswagen  were able to expand their sales in some parts of the world  auto markets in Europe are shrinking dramatically  VW sales dropped by 6 5 percent in Western Europe  excluding Germany   According to the region s biggest car makers  new car registrations in the European Union fell by 8 2 percent in 2012 to a little more than 12 million units  the lowest level since 1995  In Germany  the drop in car sales was relatively modest 2 9 percent in 2012 compared with the previous year  but in other European countries the slump was far more pronounced  Auto sales in Spain fell by 13 4 percent  in France by 13 9 percent and in Italy by 19 9 percent  Auto registrations in Greece slumped by over 40 percent compared to 2011   The recession in the auto industry is worsening  December was the worst month for new car registrations in 2012  declining by 16 3 percent across the EU  Auto sales have now been falling for the past 15 months  Auto makers have responded to the downturn in sales with a new wave of job cuts  A month ago  GM Opel announced it was winding down its operations at its German plant in Bochum   Just last week France s Peugeot Citroen reported a 16 5 percent fall in sales worldwide  blaming  the crisis affecting the European automobile market   and on Tuesday  Renault announced plans to cut 7 500 jobs in France by 2016  Across the channel  the Japanese carmaker Honda issued a statement Friday announcing 800 job cuts at its UK plant near Swindon  citing the fall in demand across Europe   The economic and social catastrophe enveloping Europe is being intensified and exploited by the European ruling class to slash the wages and social conditions of the continent s workers to a level approaching those in the special economic zones of China and the Far East   Fully aware of the dire social implications  European leaders are determined to intensify austerity measures  In his discussions Monday with Alexis Tsipras  leader of the Greek SYRIZA movement  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch uble declared once again that there is no alternative to austerity in Europe   The lack of profitable returns in European industry combined with the readiness of the world s leading central banks to make virtually interest free credit available to the banks is fueling a new junk bond bubble  The Financial Times on Monday noted that the year 2012 was characterized by a  dash for trash in global markets   and  in a reference to the financial crash of 2008  evoked a  sense of d j  vu  ,2013-01-19,Commodity Trade

109684,331199,HMC,C  Berry  Energy Metals Juniors With Derisked Projects Are Takeout Bait,opinion,Juniors in the oligopoly dominated energy metals space must break into the ranks of producers or become acquired to survive and reward shareholders  says Chris Berry  editor of Morning Notes  Strategies for success include good geographic location  sales contracts  ample cash and experienced management  but as Berry says in his interview with The Energy Report  macroeconomic conditions can turn the ambitious junior into acquisition bait  The Energy Report  In your Morning Notes in January  you defined much of the energy mining industry as an oligopoly  What do you mean by that  Chris Berry  Industries like uranium  lithium  vanadium  rare earths or potash typically have a few players at the top that control production and hence pricing  This is a huge barrier to entry for juniors looking to join the ranks of producers  TER  If the majors are producing enough material to meet today s demand  what are the prospects for the juniors in this market  CB  It s challenging in the near term because I see supply and demand in balance in many of the metals markets  This is why companies with ample cash on their balance sheets should attract attention they can survive until demand recovers  Economic growth has slowed across the globe  which implies lower demand and less need for the many juniors out there  To prosper  juniors across any of the energy metals need a competitive advantage  which usually boils down to low production costs  Uranium  for example  is a very interesting case study in this regard  The major producers like Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE   AREVA SA  AREVA EPA  or BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK  have halted expansion plans because of the depressed spot uranium price  To break even on new projects  these companies will need a uranium price closer to  say   70 per pound   70 lb   These delays provide a window for near term producers to either join the ranks of producers or become high priority takeover targets for majors looking to lower overall costs of production and add reserves  TER  What does this mean for the junior uranium market  What companies could run the gamut and come out winners  either by being acquired or becoming majors themselves  CB  Uranium is unique among energy metals and that is why I think we are reading so much about it right now  Security of supply is an increasingly important factor to consider  With ARMZ recently buying out the remaining 49  it didn t already own of Uranium One Inc   UUU TSX  for  1 3 billion   1 3B   I think this is a harbinger of things to come in the uranium space  The Russians realize that the Megatons to Megawatts agreement is set to end at the end of this year and are taking the necessary steps to ensure steady and reliable supply of uranium for their reactor fleet  Speaking of Megatons to Megawatts  I think the looming end of this program can serve as one of the catalysts for higher uranium prices over the next 12 24 months  The agreement has been in force for 20 years and supplies approximately 24 million pounds  24 Mlb  of reactor grade material to the U S  With that set to end by the end of this year  up to 24 Mlb of uranium will go off the market  so there s a looming supply demand imbalance here  There is one very important factor here that very few people are talking about  It involves the Transitional Supply Contract  which is an agreement signed between USEC and Techsnabexport  TENEX  of Russia to replace the uranium made available to USEC under Megatons to Megawatts  There is some confusion surrounding the exact amount of uranium that this agreement will produce  My research tells me it will be somewhat less than 24 Mlb  so a supply deficit arising from the end of Megatons to Megawatts seems likely  but not for the full 24 Mlb we read about  Combine this with some Japanese reactors coming back on line in the coming years and the nuclear build out in the emerging world  and you can get a sense of the looming supply crunch  A number of advanced stage development companies could serve as interesting takeout targets for majors  One is Uranerz Energy Corp   URZ TSX  URZ NYSE MKT   which has a project in the Powder River basin in Wyoming called Nichols Ranch  Uranium One has a producing uranium mine not far from Uranerz s deposit and Cameco is active in the basin as well  so the region has clearly been derisked from a production standpoint  The company is fully permitted and should start producing uranium later this year  Of particular significance is a toll processing agreement the company has in place with Cameco  This is a signal that Cameco has vetted Uranerz s operation and Uranerz could very easily integrate into Cameco s supply chain  In my opinion  Uranerz is clearly a takeout target because of this agreement  Another well positioned company is Ur Energy Inc   URE TSX  URG NYSE MKT   which is on the verge of production at its Lost Creek property in southern Wyoming  There are a number of similarities between Ur Energy and Uranerz in that they will mine and process uranium through a process known as ISR or in situ recovery  Without getting into too many specifics  this process minimizes the environmental footprint of the mine and also boasts among the lowest costs per pound of production in the industry  Both Ur Energy and Uranerz will survive the current low uranium price environment as their costs of production are so low relative to their competitors  Ur Energy should ramp up production to about a 1Mlb year run rate in 2014  TER  Uranerz already has a sales contract with major nuclear utilities  Does this give it an advantage in the market  CB  Yes  it derisks the project substantially  One of the keys to remember in the energy metals business is that securing an offtake agreement is essential to getting into production  These markets are very different from precious metals  which do not have the same variety of industrial uses  These metals are mined to be used rather than stored  Uranerz does have a leg up on the competition because it actually has two sales contracts in place  one with Exelon Corp   EXC NYSE  and one with another U S  based operator  These are five year deals with set pricing structures  so both the company and investors can forecast cash flow with a heightened degree of certainty  That is a huge derisking milestone for the company  TER  You mentioned Ur Energy  Its Lost Creek facility is scheduled for production in the middle of this year  Is that on track  CB  Yes it is  The company believes the stock will be rerated once production commences  Again  it s in a reliable geopolitical jurisdiction in Wyoming  it has ample cash on the balance sheet to push forward and its management has experience in the uranium development and production space  So Ur Energy has cleared a lot of the hurdles many of its competitors have yet to face  TER  What about European Uranium Resources Ltd   EUU TSX V  TGP FSE  EUUNF OTCQX   Is geography important to the supply and demand equation for uranium  CB  I think so  European Uranium Resources has a high grade deposit in Slovakia called Kuriskova and other earlier stage properties throughout Scandinavia  There s been a great deal of negative press surrounding nuclear energy in Europe  but it s important to remember there are dozens of operating nuclear reactors currently on the continent  Despite what the Germans  Swiss or Italians say  moving from nuclear energy to other base load sources will take decades  According to my research  there is only one currently producing uranium mine in Europe  in the Czech Republic  so I cannot imagine nuclear operators on the continent wouldn t welcome an additional source of supply  European Uranium Resources is a unique story  The Slovak government has voiced support for the development of Kuriskova  AREVA made an equity investment in the company and European Uranium Resources has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Slovak government to jointly work toward development at Kuriskova  European Uranium Resources  location  backing and deposit grades offer it a competitive advantage as it pushes toward feasibility and a production decision in the coming years  TER  Strathmore Minerals Corp   STM TSX  STHJF OTCQX  is located in the United States  where production is substantially below demand  and Korea Electric Power Corp   KEP NYSE  owns a piece of Strathmore  Could that location and those connections help this company  CB  Absolutely  Strathmore has two areas of focus  the Gas Hills district in Wyoming and a deposit called Roca Honda in New Mexico  Wyoming and New Mexico are historically two of the most prolific uranium production areas in the U S  and arguably in the world  The company is perfectly placed from a geographic perspective  Korea Electric is one of the largest shareholders of the company and is helping develop the Gas Hills district  The fact that KEP owns equity in the company says a great deal to me in that it has  skin in the game  and more than a passing interest in seeing this deposit develop  Korea Electric can earn in up to 40  here and so Strathmore can defray equity dilution by receiving project development funding from a partner  A phase 1 drill program on Gas Hills is scheduled to be completed soon  which should provide additional insight into the deposit  Strathmore s relationship with Sumitomo centers around a 60 40 joint venture in favor of Strathmore  The focus here is the Roca Honda project in New Mexico  which is one of the most prolific uranium producing regions in the world on a historical basis  A decision on the mine permit is expected in 2013 and will be the real catalyst for the project and the company overall  As with any junior mining company  how you handle dilution is crucial to survivability especially in the current environment  Strathmore s approach of partnering with two large Asian conglomerates is  I believe  a sound one  as it minimizes share dilution and establishes a relationship with two reliable potential offtake partners once a production decision is made  TER  Your references to oligopoly pop up quite often in the lithium market  Last year  Galaxy Resources Ltd   GXY ASX  acquired Lithium One Inc  and Chengdu Tianqi Industry Group Co  picked up Talison Lithium Ltd   TLH TSX   Is this proof of your theory that the only way to proceed in the lithium market is to be bought out by one of the big guys  CB  I m not sure if it s the only way to succeed  but I view lithium as a very tough market to break into  Much of my thinking has to do with overall supply and demand balance coupled with the macroeconomic picture we ve been discussing  Right now  we re in a period of generally slow or stagnant economic growth in the U S  and Europe and of slowing growth in Asia  Some of the economic data I study to get a sense of energy metals demand includes PMI surveys  These metrics look bleak right now  Couple this with an extremely challenging financing environment for junior mining companies and you can begin to see why I think the path of least resistance to reward shareholders in the lithium space is through a takeout  I just don t see any room for many more juniors in the current environment  When you re competing in an oligopoly  there are obviously very high barriers to entry  If the price is set by the oligopoly  you have to find other ways to compete  and if you have a deposit that can integrate into a producer s supply chain and lower the overall cost of production  then all of a sudden  you re in business  Lithium is somewhat unique in that lithium production is often accompanied by byproducts including potash  and these byproducts can also help lower overall costs  TER  Are the energy storage and auto electrification markets growing fast enough to expand this market  CB  There s a great deal of research and development going into vehicle electrification and energy storage all over the world  China s most recent Five Year Plan has hundreds of millions of dollars going toward a more sustainable  efficient  electrified society  Anyone who has seen the pictures of the smog choking Beijing can understand why  But it s hard to gauge how quickly a lot of these next generation technologies are growing and what the tipping point will actually be  The cost must fall for both vehicle electrification and electricity storage before they can become commercially viable  mainstream realities  I m not just talking about battery costs  but raw material costs as well  I watch the costs of raw materials like soda ash or sulfuric acid almost more closely than I do overall battery and lithium carbonate costs because the fluctuating prices of these raw materials have a direct varying effect on the price of the finished good  That said  charging infrastructure is becoming more ubiquitous  and if electricity demand increases in coming years and puts additional stresses on an aging electrical grid  the necessity for energy storage will become much more urgent  The junior exploration companies that wish to become a part of this shift must survive the current environment  however  TER  What juniors are acquisition targets for the big guys like Rockwood Holdings Inc   ROC NYSE  or FMC Lithium Corp   FMC NYSE   CB  Right now  the companies that are substantially derisked serve as the primary potential acquisition targets for major lithium producers  That would include Canada Lithium Corp   CLQ TSX  CLQMF OTCQX   Orocobre Ltd   ORL TSX  ORE ASX  and Lithium Americas Corp   LAC TSX  LHMAF OTCQX   It doesn t make sense for a major to go into acquisition mode unless the project has been substantially derisked  and all three of these companies have derisked projects  to differing degrees  Take a look at Rockwood  Though lithium is a tight market  none of the majors  Rockwood included  appear to be in a rush to acquire projects  Rockwood had approximately  1 3B in cash on its balance sheet at the end of 2012  and what it s doing right now is buying back shares  paying down debt and paying existing shareholders a dividend  I m sure Rockwood management would be very opportunistic if they found a project that they really liked and thought they could integrate it seamlessly into the company s supply chain  but they wouldn t necessarily rush to do this unless lithium demand spiked  which is currently unlikely  Rockwood is the largest producer of lithium compounds in the world  One method to maintaining that dominance is to lock up supply through acquisitions  Ultimately  one of these potential acquirers would need to decide if it wanted to focus on brines  which resemble a chemistry project  versus a traditional hard rock lithium mining project  Costs differ  but so do the mining and production processes themselves  The age old debate of  brines versus mines  in lithium is still an open one  A lithium producer must decide which type of mining fits its supply chain most efficiently before making an acquisition  TER  Do you also consider fertilizer  and potash in particular  to be an oligopoly  CB  Absolutely  You have a few global producers that dominate supply and by extension price  so any junior wishing to join the ranks of the producers has to do so on the basis of low cost production  We focus on Saskatchewan  but also on other development stories throughout North America  TER  What junior companies look promising  CB  One of the names that we have followed is Passport Potash Inc   PPI TSX V  PPRTF OTCQX   It has a large deposit in the Arizona s Holbrook basin and has recently released a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  that demonstrated promising economics  The company has also increased the qualified size of its resource and there is room for upside here as well  These were positive catalysts for the company  and this has resulted in a higher share price and good positioning going forward  The next catalyst for the company will be the release of a prefeasibility study by the end of 2013  I am looking for Passport to continue to enhance economics here in the coming months  TER  Passport s announcement about moving forward on exploring the Holbrook basin property seemed to boost the stock a bit  Did that do the company some good with investors  CB  I believe you are referring to the agreement Passport signed with the Hopi Tribe in Arizona to jointly explore the Holbrook basin  When you look at a map of Passport s holdings  they are checker boarded to the south with the Hopi holdings  This presents difficulties in getting a holistic appraisal of the basin  Signing a definitive agreement here is key to getting an understanding of just how big the Holbrook basin could be  TER  In your opinion  how should investors adjust their portfolios to take advantage of new realities in energy markets  CB  While I tend to agree with other analysts that the junior mining sector will shrink in size in the coming months  I think it s important to remember that mining is a cyclical business  Discoveries can and will be made even in this environment and patient shareholders can be rewarded  The tide will turn  but it is anyone s guess as to when  Because of this  I am focused on well capitalized companies in sound geopolitical jurisdictions with experienced management  There are  of course  many other factors to consider  but this is the initial method I use to derisk the companies I am following  I was recently in Palm Springs at the Cambridge House California Resource Investment Conference and delivered a speech titled   Four Billion Consumers Can t Be Wrong  Can They   I hope not  Your question about taking advantage of a new reality I think is a good one because this is indeed a new reality in which we live  Several billion individuals are slowly joining the global middle class and beginning to lead more commodity intensive lifestyles  Aspiring to achieve a higher quality of life is going to continue despite the sorry state of the junior markets and the uncertain global macroeconomic environment  The longer term demand picture is intact  Quality of life is a Pandora s box  Once you experience a leap like driving a car for the first time or using a cell phone or having access to education for free online  that is something that you don t easily give up  In fact  you want more of it  That s why I am focused on the types of energy metals companies I mentioned above  Overall  the energy metals space is interesting because it s a combination of traditional exploration and development  technology and R D  and macroeconomics  I try to formulate a clear view of what s happening in each of these three realms to challenge my thesis and formulate an investment strategy  TER  Thank you  Chris    with a

 By Lisa Twaronite	
 TOKYO  Oct 11  Reuters    The Nikkei share average jumped to
a three week high on Tuesday on expectations that a pledge from
Germany and France to come up with a plan this month to protect
the region s banks will prevent Greece s debt woes from
spreading  	
 The benchmark has gained about 5 percent from its intraday
low of 8 343 set last Wednesday  which had been its lowest point
since March 15 s 8 227  set in the wake of that month s
devastating earthquake     	
 Industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp jumped on news it
will replace Tokyo Electric Power Co in the Topix Core
30 index while shares of battered major exporters such
as Sony and Honda   outperformed  with both
climbing over 5 percent                       	
 But persistent doubts about whether euro zone policymakers
can actually muster a united response to the debt crisis are
seen capping the upside although market participants differed
slightly on where resistance would hold 	
  Markets are rallying on hopes for policy  rather than an
actual policy  There s still no guarantee there will be
effective policy  The target for the Nikkei will be around 8 800
to 9 000 for the next few days   said Yutaka Miura  senior
technical analyst at Mizuho Securities 	
 After a national holiday on Monday  the benchmark Nikkei
 rose 2 0 percent to 8 779 99  having briefly risen to as
high as 8 806 44 in the morning session  its highest level since
Sept 16 	
 The broader Topix index rose 2 percent to 756 10 	
 The Nikkei stood well above its 25 day moving average  now
around 8 650  and which is normally considered a bullish sign  	
 Immediate resistance is seen at an area defined by two peaks
last month  8 864 on Sept  16 and 8 876 on Sept  8  	
 Its 50 day moving average  above which the benchmark hasn t
traded since Aug  4  is also an upside target at 8 874  	
 Some analysts do think the rebound could extend to around
9 000  but more resistance looms there  such as the 38 2 percent
retracement of Nikkei s fall from July at 9 055 as well as the
bottom of the Ichimoku cloud at 9 094 	
  Credit spreads  for banks  are still far from tight  It s
hard to expect the Nikkei to move above 9 000 and stay there  A
fall below 8 500 is more likely   said Ryota Sakagami  chief
strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities 	
 Among exporters  Sony rose 5 5 percent to 1 493 yen while
Honda  the heaviest traded share by turnover  gained 5 8 percent
to 2 353 yen 	
  The latest news from Europe seems to have lifted
expectations that the crisis there will not destabilise the
financial system and drag down growth  so investors are buying
back some of the shares they sold in recent weeks   said Yutaka
Shiraki  senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities      	
 Fanuc Corp added 4 5 percent to 11 470 yen and was
the fifth heaviest traded share by turnover  contributing the
most to the Nikkei s gain 	
 Nidec gained 3 9 percent to 6 340 yen after the
electric motor maker said on Friday it would increase its stock
buyback plan to as much as 47 billion yen or as much as 4 14
percent of its outstanding stock    	
 Bank shares were mostly in line with overall market  with
the Tokyo Stock Exchange s banking subindex up 1 9
percent  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group added 2 9
percent to 2 141 yen and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 
rose 2 4 percent to 336 yen 	
 Volume was relatively modest  with 1 14 billion shares
changing hands on the Tokyo stock exchange s main board  on
track to fall short of last week s daily average of 1 86 billion
shares

109703,331218,HMC,Mark Lackey  Energy Stocks Could Deliver Stealth Profits ,opinion,In the midst of a global market lull  many companies are sitting on their hands  argues Mark Lackey of CHF Investor Relations  That s why he s scoping out smart management that s keeping busy and making great progress    whether or not the markets are quick to notice  Learn who s getting a running start in the uranium  oil and natural gas spaces in this Energy Report interview  The Energy Report  It s been a busy five months since your last  in August  What s your macro view on energy markets  Mark Lackey  The problems in Europe were somewhat worse than most people anticipated regarding Greece and long term bond rates in Portugal and Spain  Slower world economic growth wasn t a disaster  but it was enough to knock the price of oil back down under  90 per barrel   90 bbl   Natural gas had been climbing closer to  3 70 3 80 thousand cubic feet  Mcf   then retreated as well  And  of course  uranium got all the way down to  41 25 per pound   41 25 lb   Part of the reason for that was that only two out of 56 reactors in Japan were actually operating  but I m still bullish on uranium  The oil weakness experienced wasn t terrible  but oil certainly went a little lower than I anticipated  Now that it s back in that  88 89 bbl range  I m anticipating somewhat stronger prices next year for oil  as well as for natural gas and uranium  TER  Are you still expecting West Texas Intermediate  WTI  to average between  100 and  105 bbl next year  or has the supply demand picture changed  ML  I ve lowered my expectation to more like  95 105  partly because the shale oil supply has been a little bit better than I expected with more Bakken production on line  On the other hand  China  India  Indonesia  Japan and Brazil have all announced significant infrastructure spending programs for 2013  which will certainly increase the demand for energy  TER  You talk with many people in the analyst community  What s the current mood and outlook there  ML  There s a bit of a divergence  People on the street who agree with me believe that world growth will be fairly decent and that the five countries with the big infrastructure spending will  in fact  move the world forward  There are some who believe that both Europe and the U S  will do better  and they re seeing oil up in the  110 115 bbl range  Then  there s a smaller group looking at an  85 90 bbl range because they think the U S  economy will stagnate and the situation in Europe will continue to deteriorate  I would say that more analysts agree with where I am  but there s more divergence in opinions out there than I have seen in the last few years  TER  Natural gas prices have staged a strong comeback from last spring and now the main concern in the North American markets relates to winter weather usage  Any thoughts on that  ML  Last spring  natural gas hit close to a 10 year low  under  2 Mcf  It bounced off of that to  3 90 Mcf largely due to increased industrial demand and gas substitution for coal in the electricity market  It s since retracted a bit of that  In the very short run  if you re looking solely at the winter  a cold winter could move the price higher  Looking at fundamentals over the next year  I expect a better year for both the auto and chemical sectors  On the supply side  drilling activity for gas was down in November to a 16 year low in the U S  but partially offset by horizontal drilling advancements  On balance I expect we re going to see somewhat less gas than some people are anticipating  and I expect it to get back up to  4 Mcf by the end of 2013  TER  Can you update us on some of the oil and gas plays you discussed in your last interview  ML  We had mentioned Greenfields Petroleum Corp    TSX V   which operates in Azerbaijan  This is not wildcat drilling  Greenfields has been very successful reworking old wells and fields and finding oil and gas in established areas with past production  We see its production going up significantly this year  Being close to Europe  it gets a much higher price for natural gas as well    anywhere from  5 9 Mcf and also  15 20 bbl more for oil because it s based on the Brent price  not the WTI price  Azerbaijan has had a lot of expertise in drilling and a good labor force going back to the Soviet Union days  It s a very pro oil and gas jurisdiction and clearly one of the best areas for that business  TER  How s the stock done since we last talked  ML  It s thinly traded and has gone down some  even though it beat expectations  With oil prices coming down somewhat  people were selling small  and mid cap oil and gas stocks in the last three to six months of 2012  But I would suggest that people should now be looking at companies like this because of the lower entry point and better cash flow numbers in 2013  TER  What about Primeline Energy Holdings Inc    TSX V   ML  Primeline Energy will have operations in the South China Sea and its partner is CNOOC Ltd   CEO   one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world  Production is expected late in 2013 and it has some significant upside in terms of cash flow and earnings  particularly into 2014  That s when one analyst has forecast earnings of  0 24 and cash flow of  0 28 per share  which I agree with  An important point to remember about why it can see such good earnings is that it gets  15 16 Mcf for selling gas into China  or approximately four to five times what natural gas gets here  TER  That s definitely one to keep an eye on  You also talked about a company in the services business  ML  Right  That s Bri Chem Corp    TSX   which announced the takeover of Kemik Inc   a chemical blending and packaging niche company that will add to Bri Chem s cash flow and earnings  Bri Chem has been very strong in the drilling fluids  cementing and steel pipe business sector  supplying the oil and natural gas service area  Now it will have even better earnings and cash flow in the next two years if U S  gas drilling activity starts to turn up this year  And last week Bri Chem closed another U S  fluids wholesaler acquisition of General Supply Co  in Oklahoma  At this stock price level it s certainly one that people should be looking at and expecting appreciation in 2013  TER  Do you have any new names in the oil and gas sector that look interesting  ML  We ve started to follow a company called Strategic Oil   Gas Ltd   SOG   which is a very interesting play in the Steen River area of western Canada  It has primarily light oil  which sells at a premium to WTI or Edmonton light  It s done a great job of increasing production    more than doubling it in the last year  Another recent acquisition added approximately 10 12  to its production numbers  It s well capitalized and with such a good balance sheet  we see it going forward in 2013 with work that can further increase its light oil production  TER  So  where s that one trading these days  ML  It s trading around  1 20 per share  When we first looked at it three or four months ago  it was trading at  0 70  It s been a nice winner  given the performance of the rest of the TSX Venture market  which has gone from 2 450 in 2011 down to 1 200 at the end of 2012  Strategic Oil s big increase in production and the fact it produces light oil has caught the attention of the marketplace  TER  The other energy sector that seems to be coming back is nuclear  Prices had been pretty weak for several months and then suddenly jumped up to over  46 lb  Did the Japanese election have something to do with that  What s the outlook from here  ML  Yes  the Japanese election was the key factor in moving the price strongly in just a few days  Before that  people were only starting to wake up to the fact that the end of the Megatons to Megawatts program will take about 24 million pounds  Mlb  out of the marketplace by 2013 year end  Clearly  the fact that the Japanese government won with a largely pro nuclear position was a major catalyst  They need to stimulate the economy and will be facing potential electricity shortages if they don t begin restarting more of their nuclear plants over the next year  mind you restarts require new environmental assessments that the government has now said will be done in June  TER  So that s expected to create enough demand to justify higher prices  ML  That  and there are some other factors too  There are 66 reactors under construction worldwide as we speak  If the Japanese bring back even 20 of their 56 that are off line in the next year and more new reactors built come onstream in the next one to two years  then you can see some significant demand increase for uranium  In addition to the Megatons to Megawatts program phaseout  Cameco Corp   CCJ  has deferred its Kintyre project in Australia and BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP  has deferred expansion of Olympic Dam  Then Uranium One Inc   UUU  canceled its Zarechnoye project in Kazakhstan  Higher demand and lower supply lead us to expect significantly higher uranium prices in the next one to three years  TER  Have there been any interesting developments with the uranium developers you talked about in August  ML  Fission Energy Corp   FIS  had some very good drill results in the Athabasca Basin  at Waterbury Lake and Patterson Lake South  This caused the stock price to almost double in about a week and remain close to that peak  One of its properties is very close to the Hathor property that was ultimately acquired by Rio Tinto Plc  RIO   so we view Fission as a potential takeout candidate  It s going to do more drilling to define additional resources  but it s a company that has some pretty good potential  TER  A lot of companies are working the Athabasca Basin  where most of the North American uranium development has taken place  ML  Right  The two other big areas are Wyoming and New Mexico  where another company we mentioned and have followed for a number of years  Strathmore Minerals Corp     has projects  Its Gas Hills project is in Wyoming and the Roca Honda project is in New Mexico  I ve liked Strathmore over the years because  whenever management told me they were setting certain milestones  they met them  I ve spent a number of years in the uranium business and always thought the Gas Hills project area was one of the best in the U S   and it s now owned by Strathmore  I also really like its New Mexico play  and the company has considerable depth in its property portfolio for a junior  Strathmore expects to see production in the next three or four years  that would make it a relatively low cost and fairly significant uranium producer in the U S  If I m right about uranium prices going a lot higher in the next three years  this stock will be trading at considerably higher than present levels  TER  Do you have any new companies that look interesting  ML  Forum Uranium Corp   FDC  is one I ve watched for a while  Its two main projects are in the Key Lake area of the eastern Athabasca Basin near Cameco s Key Lake Mill  It s also on trend with Hathor s Roughrider discovery and Forum has two plays in the western Athabasca  Its management team of President  CEO and Director Richard Mazur  Vice President of Exploration Ken Wheatley and Chief Geologist Dr  Boen Tan are three of the best guys that I ve known in the whole Athabasca area  These guys have actually discovered over 300 Mlb of uranium throughout their careers  The company also has a very interesting play in the North Thelon  in Nunavut  I think there s some significant upside there  and it just announced some very good drill results  Many juniors aren t doing much these days  but these guys are out there drilling  raising money and moving their projects forward  That s important  because if we get the uranium prices I suggest  the markets are going to be looking at players who have been forging ahead  TER  Does it have money in the till to be able to do more work  ML  It has some money to do part of its next work program but will likely look to raise more  The company consolidated its shares Jan  3  This is an interesting play also because of its partnerships with Rio Tinto and Cameco  I used to look at about 60 small uranium explorers and now I m down to only about 10 that I think have a legitimate chance of doing something down the road  Forum is definitely one of them  TER  Any other ones  ML  There s Purepoint Uranium Group Inc      which is also a player in the Athabasca Basin and has done a lot of work this year  It signed a joint venture agreement with Cameco and AREVA  AREVA  on its Hook Lake uranium project and completed an NI 43 101 complaint technical report there and on its Red Willow project  Purepoint just raised some money and Chris Frostad  Purepoint s president and CEO  is continuing to move it forward  He ll be doing a lot more drilling over the next year with some big people behind him  Again  it s a micro cap company  but if you re going to buy some micro cap companies  buy the ones with active management  good properties  some money in the bank and good joint venture partners  Then you at least have a good chance of success down the road  TER  These didn t all start out being micro caps  ML  No they didn t  and that s an interesting point  I can remember when it was trading at  1 60 back in the better uranium days  It s way more advanced now at  0 07  which shows you what happens when you have such a bad market environment  The market doesn t seem to differentiate  at this point  between uranium players that have stronger odds at being successful and those that don t  They re all in the same basket  Once we get better uranium prices  I think investors will start to focus on which companies actually have not been sitting on their hands  TER  So what does the year ahead look like for energy stock investors and where do you feel they should be focusing their attention for maximum upside  ML  I m expecting a moderate upward movement in oil prices  but certainly not a boom  North American natural gas should move higher  Natural gas prices in Europe and China offer some pretty exceptional opportunities for companies selling into those markets  My three year outlook on uranium is way above the consensus  I actually see uranium trading this time next year at  65 lb  compared to the current spot price of  44 75 lb  Then I see it at  80 lb at the end of 2014  and  90 lb in 2015  all based on the supply and demand factors I mentioned earlier  TER  That would certainly bring life to a lot of these cheap uranium stocks  People are going to be all over uranium again if you get a double in the price  ML  A lot of people may think I m overly optimistic  but I would point out that when we first liked uranium at  10 lb in 2001  we thought there was some pretty good upside  I never expected it to go to  135  like it did in 2007  But  it does show you that when the uranium market starts to move  it usually moves fairly significantly and can create some definite investment opportunities  TER  So there s something that people certainly should focus on in the next few months to a year  We greatly appreciate your time and input today  Mark  ML  Thank you  Mark Lackey  executive vice president of CHF Investor Relations  Cavalcanti Hume

109704,331219,HMC,Nikkei falls more than 2 pct on Europe woes,news,"  Nikkei on target for fresh 2 1 2 year closing low
   Worries about possible Greek default fester
   Investors hope for ETF buying by BOJ

 By Lisa Twaronite	
 TOKYO  Sept 12  Reuters    The Nikkei skidded more than 2
percent and was on target for a fresh 2 1 2 year closing low on
concerns Europe s sovereign debt woes and U S  stock losses will
deepen 	
 Senior politicians in German Chancellor Angela
Merkel s centre right coalition started talking openly about the
possibility of a Greek default  raising concerns among investors
already spooked by the surprise resignation of a European
Central Bank board member last week   	
  It s Europe s turn to be in focus  but fears about the U S 
economy haven t gone away  and until other parts of the world
stabilize  we will continue to see investors taking money out of
stocks here and not putting it back in   Fumiyuki Nakanishi 
strategist at SMBC Friend Securities     	
 U S  stock futures also fell  raising fears that U S  stocks
will continue dropping after they tumbled more than 2 percent on
Friday on concern that the euro zone will be able to get its
debt crisis under control   	
 S P 500 E mini futures  0 ES   were last down 11 50 points
at 1146 50    	
 The benchmark Nikkei declined 2 3 percent to
8 540 54  dropping below last Tuesday s 8 588  That had been its
lowest intraday level since March 15 when stocks were sold off
after the earthquake and tsunami  	
 The broader Topix index shed 2 0 percent to 740 28 	
 On its way to a 2 4 percent weekly loss  the Nikkei closed
on Tuesday at its lowest level since 8 493 77 marked on April
28  2009  It could test that level this week  though traders
cited support around 8 500  	
Also supporting the Nikkei were hopes that Japan s
central bank would buy assets through its liquidity boosting
programme  as it typically has done on days of steep stock
losses 	
 For three days of Nikkei declines starting Sept  2  the Bank
of Japan bought exchange trade funds worth 66 9 billion yen  and
1 7 billion yen of REITs on Sept 9 	
  For the rest of the week  developments in euro zone debt
problems and movements in the euro will likely set the direction
of the market   said Yutaka Miura  a senior technical analyst at
Mizuho Securities     	
 Investors are also awaiting the U S  central bank s
policy setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept 
20 21 to see if it will adopt further accommodative steps to
stimulate the U S  economy  analysts added 	
  But Mizuho s Miura said that if U S  economic data such as
retail sales data  industrial production figures and the
consumer price index were better than expected  hopes for the
U S  central bank to introduce easing measures may weaken 	
 Shares in Sharp Corp fell 5 0 percent to 585 yen on
Monday after an analyst at Mizuho Securities cut his fair value
estimate on the stock to 630 yen from 750 yen   	
 Suzuki Motor Corp slipped 2 2 percent to 1 492 yen 
after Volkswagen  accused the Japanese automaker of
violating their near two year old partnership and gave it an
ultimatum of several weeks to fix the situation  	
 Honda Motor Co dropped 3 9 percent to 2 257 yen
after the car maker said it was recalling almost 347 000 Pilot
sport utility vehicles worldwide due to a potential problem with
their front seat belts  	
 Volume was thin  with 1 28 billion shares changing
hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange s main board  suggesting that
the day s volume will likely be lower than last week s average
of 1 82 billion shares

109705,331220,HMC,Rising Gas Prices Threaten Economy Again  Obama Needs To Thwart Evil,opinion,History of Bubble Creation Everyone on Wall Street are   paying off ratings agencies to rate garbage mortgage backed securities triple A  so they could resell them  pushing up worthless companies beyond ridiculous valuations like CROX and many others only to leave a trail of carnage on the downside  the tech bubble  apple stock  the various oil bubbles  the silver bubble  cotton  coffee  corn you name it and Wall Street will try to manipulate up far beyond the fundamentals  If you bought a car from Wall Street  they would juice it up to  200 000 for a Honda Civic  and you think you have a depreciating asset now  Gas Prices Going Higher Again Despite Abundant Supply Well gas prices are going up again due to those evil speculators even as the economy shows signs again of recovery  the economy is threatened once again by lowering disposable income in order to pay for exorbitant gas prices  This cycle just keeps on repeating itself over and over again  The economy starts to pick up  the evil speculators juice up gas prices  consumers can t afford these prices  the economy goes back near to recession levels as consumers and small businesses pull back discretionary spending  When are we ever going to learn in this country  and protect essential commodities from the evil speculators by instigating   Physical delivery will ensure that when the economy is strong enough to actually support a given price  demand will be there to support higher prices   But what we have is paper demand screwing consumers once again due to the over zealous evil speculators in the oil market  and not true demand  so this Wall Street Gas Tax  just throws the economy back into recession territory  The average American cannot afford to fill up there gas tank for  65 every week without taking money out of some other money basket items in their budget  They usually charge up their credit cards  cut back on eating out or entertainment options  and some much worse scenarios for meeting these out of whack fuel costs  Further Reading    Driver  1  Ben Bernanke   the Federal Reserve The drivers of the oil market for the evil speculators on Wall Street are several  one of them is supported by your own government in the branch of the Federal Reserve  When Ben Bernanke and the fed switched from concentrating on mortgages with their previous QE program which didn t give banks the extra juice for the commodity markets and equities  and then started again with another 45 billion per month of treasury purchases  well we have seen how that juices markets from past QE treasury buying  Buying mortgages doesn t juice up asset prices like buying treasuries that is clear as day  So the federal reserve is again helping those who have stocks in their portfolio  at the expense of the entire country who now has to pay higher gas prices than the fundamentals would dictate because 45 billion dollars is being injected into financial markets  and big banks are using this liquidity to juice up asset prices including oil and gas   Concentrate on mortgages Ben Bernanke I thought you finally learned something and were focusing on concentrating your liquidity programs where they could minimize the negatives of the easing program and still provide some overall positives to the economy  However  the fed slipped back to the old give on one hand  take on the other hand bi polar monetary policy which just does more harm than good to the overall economy  Further Reading     Driver  2  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe The other is good old Japan  and their new policy of bringing the country inflation at all costs  by considerably weakening the Yen  this has not only raised Japanese gas prices  but their currency is used as a major carry trade funding currency  So weakening the yen just provides juice to all financial markets  not just Japanese markets  Traders take this weak Yen  and fund their other trades  and you guessed it juice up risk assets like oil  which then juices up gas prices  So you can thank the new Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for your higher gas prices as well  Driver  3  Wall Street Levered to the Hilt once again Wall Street is again using leverage  with margin at its highest point in five years as all the banks and hedge funds are levering up for the bullish first quarter  and this increased leverage is juicing up all asset prices  including oil and gas  So as Wall Street banks and traders juice up their returns  again the American consumer is footing the bill via higher gasoline prices at the pump  Too bad they don t give consumers a cut of those big fat bonuses  But somebody has to pay  again the powerful take from the poor  Driver  4  Fear Mongering over  Potential  Supply Disruptions The other long standing trick on Wall Street is to use fear mongering to push up the oil markets  so any even remote pipeline leak  or incident in the Middle East is used to scare up the market  The latest is Algeria with a Natural Gas plant hostage situation  I know it doesn t matter if it is not even related to oil infrastructure  it doesn t matter  There has been no real supply disruption in the last 30 years with all kinds of flare ups in the Middle East  and requisite hype run ups in oil markets  Never one major supply disruption where actual supply in the oil markets was scarce over the past 30 years  Why because everybody needs money  and it doesn t matter if you re a terrorist  a dictator  an insurgent  you re going to sell oil because this is what supports the entire region  So whoever is in charge is going to protect the oil fields at all cost  and they are for the most part  the most secure assets in the world  Safer than your Gold in a safety deposit box  These incidents are used to hype markets and push up prices regardless of actual legitimate threats to supply disruptions where oil would actually be a scarce commodity  Strategic Petroleum Reserves is crucifix for Evil Speculators It s all a money game on Wall Street  and without a physical deliverable market  the only solution to thwarting these evil speculators in the oil markets is the tool of the SPR release  It worked last year as these speculators started pushing oil up  yeah it doesn t matter if supplies are booming right now  and President Obama threatened to and this turned around the market and sent it back down  You see this is highly effective as the speculators need to make money like crack addicts  so once they realize that the game is over to the upside  they get out of the market  and look for other markets they can juice up  This threat and actual release of the SPRs is the only thing that has thwarted the evil speculators in the oil markets the last two years  If it was left to their own devices we would all be paying for  150 oil  and 5 dollar gasoline  They don t care who they hurt in the process of getting their fat trading bonuses  So once again  as oil markets are rampant with excessive speculation  President Obama needs to bring out the old SPR Release Hammer and send these evil speculators back to juicing up penny stocks on the OTC markets or to  400 a share   Further Reading

109739,331254,HMC,Sid Rajeev  Stop Gambling And Find Stable Profits In Energy Investment ,opinion,Are junior resource stocks the investment equivalent of a game of blackjack  It depends on the investor as much as it does on the company  Sid Rajeev of Fundamental Research Corp  has come to expect stability from his picks  How  By using fair value metrics and a longer term timeline  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  learn how this pragmatic analyst plays a speculative market for reliable returns  The Energy Report  In your last interview with us  you talked about your firm s fair value metric philosophy for evaluating which stocks look like good investment candidates  How has that worked out over the past year and a half  Sid Rajeev  We are strong believers in fundamentals analysis  Short term price movements are typically controlled by speculation and a lot of hearsay  It s easier to identify good investment opportunities through fundamentals analysis  especially with a one year minimum investment time horizon  TER  How does the current global economic picture influence your decision making for resource investments into the foreseeable future  SR  We have seen a lot of good developments in the overall market in the past few months  First of all  the TSX Venture Index is up 10   Moody s rating agency decided to maintain its rating on Spain  The U S  economy continues to grow gradually  These are good developments that could result in a sentiment shift  We do see continued improvement  but it s going to be gradual  There are still a lot of extremely undervalued opportunities in this market that can provide high returns over the next 12 months  TER  Demand projections for China and other developing countries are shifting  How is this going to affect the fertilizer and potash markets  SR  Potash was trading above  800 ton in 2008  Prices then crashed to just over  300 ton in 2009  They picked up after and went above  500 t  Prices however dropped by about 10  in the past few months  Now  it s around  460 480 t  Our long term potash price since last year has been  425 t  While many analysts and investors had to reassess their potash targets  because they were valuing those targets at extremely high potash prices  we did not have to make any significant changes  We continue to be strongly bullish on the segment in the long term  especially because the rationale is very simple  Developing economies need more and better food  and most importantly  the supply of arable land has been stable or decreasing  creating a huge need for fertilizers like potash  We are bullish on the commodity and even more bullish on advanced junior North American potash companies  Remember that the potash segment is an oligopoly that is currently controlled by a few major producers  India and China are big consumers and need long term  stable supply at reasonable prices  We think that they would make a move to assure that they can control some advanced stage potash projects  which are now trading at extremely low levels  We expect to see some kind of joint venture or merger and acquisition  M A  activity in the advanced junior space in the next 6 12 months  TER  Which North American projects are looking good  SR  Two companies that we actually follow and like are Western Potash Corp   WPX TSX V  and Passport Potash Inc   PPI TSX V  PPRTF OTCQX   Western Potash has been a Top Pick for over 12 months  It s still one of our favorites  This company is one of the very few advanced stage projects in Saskatchewan that has yet to be acquired or form a JV  Most of the projects around it have already been acquired  The company is going to come out with a feasibility study by late November  Most of the neighboring projects that have been acquired in the past were all at post feasibility stage  So we think the next six months is going to be extremely exciting and crucial for the company because  if the feasibility study is positive  as we expect  it should open more doors to some kind of joint venture or M A activity  I think an ideal acquirer or JV partner would be a state owned fertilizer company in India or China  One of the largest Indian fertilizer companies  Rashtriya Chemicals   Fertilizers Ltd   is looking to invest close to  1 billion in potash projects in Canada  I think they have already talked to most of the potash players in the space  A positive feasibility study could trigger some developments for Western Potash Corp  TER  What s the story on Passport Potash  SR  Passport Potash is another interesting story  but a more early stage play  The project is in Arizona  Passport has dominant land acreage in the Holbrook basin  The company came out with an updated resource estimate last month  Its scoping study is expected in Q1 13  The main difference between Passport s project and Saskatchewan projects is that it is shallower  But size wise  it s going to be significantly smaller  It s still early and there is still a lot of exploration going on in the region  Passport also recently signed a Letter of Intent with the Hopi Indian Tribe  which has allowed the company to include the Hopi lands in the upcoming Preliminary Economic Assessment  PEA   Passport has quite a few catalysts coming up  including a scoping study  It is also in discussions for financing  so we could see some kind of activity with this company over the next few months  It s currently trading at  0 20  Our fair value is  0 81  TER  How does the uranium sector look to you  SR  We have a long term bullish outlook on uranium  Prices have dropped significantly over the last year to around  43 44 per pound  lb   Our long term outlook on uranium is  70 lb  There are a few good uranium stories we cover  One of our favorites is a company called Strathmore Minerals Corp   STM TSX  STHJF OTCQX   It has two advanced stage projects in the U S   one in New Mexico and one in Wyoming  The company recently signed a joint venture agreement with Korea Electric Power Corp   KEPCO  to help advance its Gas Hills project  It also announced a positive PEA on its Roca Honda project  TER  What about coal  SR  Coal is another commodity we are bullish on  There is a company called   which has five properties on Vancouver Island  It is focused on semi soft metallurgical  met  coal  Coal comes in two types  met coal and thermal coal  Met coal has a higher value than thermal coal  prices of met coal have not dropped as much as thermal coal  Compliance Energy is now working on its environmental processing  The neighboring community has been extremely vocal against having a mine in the neighborhood  but we have not come across any major concerns  Progress is going to be slow and it is hard to predict an outcome  but we believe it is a good time for investors to get in if they want to speculate on a positive outcome on the environmental assessment  Right now  shares are at  0 09  Our last valuation in July was  0 85  TER  That s a pretty wide spread  Are there any other interesting possibilities or developments out there that you want to mention  SR  During a slowdown  investors typically look for safer assets  The junior mining segment is a highly speculative market  Within that sector  the safe assets  we believe  are the companies that are near term producers or those that just started production with known exploration or production upside  We have been recommending such stories over the past year and most have done extremely well  The majority are in the precious metals sector  Names on our coverage list that have done extremely well in the last year include Anaconda Mining Inc   ANX TSX   Anaconda is a gold producer in Newfoundland  shares are up 56  YOY  The company has been extremely successful in ramping up production and cleaning up its balance sheet  The second one is SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVL TSX V  SVLC NYSE MKT   which is a silver producer in Mexico with significant exploration upside  SilverCrest shares are up 56  YOY as well  The third company is Diamcor Mining Inc   DMI TSX V  DMIFF OTCQX   This has been our best performer in the past year  shares are up 269   The company and its partner Tiffany   Co  have a diamond project in South Africa that it acquired from De Beers  commissioning and testing activities are ongoing  The last one is Banks Island Gold Ltd   BOZ TSX V   shares are up 14  since we initiated coverage last month  It has two advanced projects in British Columbia  Just to close  remember that the junior mining market has always been a highly speculative one  it s mostly seen as a way to gamble  Here at Fundamental  we think it s easier to identify winners if you do fundamental analysis  proper due diligence  question the management team  ask them hard questions and see if the company has catalysts coming up in the next 6 12 months  If you do that  then you have a better chance of finding a winner  TER  Thanks for

109759,331274,HMC,Popping The Rare Earths Bubble ,opinion,In recent decades financial bubbles have been plentiful  From the US housing to the global uranium markets  bubbles seem to be simply inevitable  and generally can not be prevented by regulation or other government interference   In fact bubbles occur even in simulated  experimental  markets  see   Most major asset classes experience a bubble periodically  The tech bubble of the late 90s for example has been one of the better known ones in the equity markets  Very few have been as spectacular as the one in the so called rare earth metals that are used to manufacture all sorts of equipment  including LEDs  smartphones  and motors  The rise in prices was triggered by China s policy of limiting exports  creating a perceived shortage  From there hoarding and speculation took hold  And as often happens in commodity markets  the bubble burst almost as violently as it inflated    Scott Barber   As prices soared  new mining projects made it on to the front burner  and some of these are likely to come onstream before the end of the year  including an expansion to Molycorp s  MCP N  California operations  China remains by far the world s largest producer of these materials  but as new supplies elsewhere hit the market while demand remains little changed  China itself also is changing its tune and has announced a higher export quota  To put the magnitude of this bubble in perspective  the chart below compares the price action of 3 rare earths with gold and silver  which have also appreciated materially over over the same period  And price declines are continuing  Nations and companies are simply figuring out how to reduce dependence on many of these materials   for example Dysprosium  a metal highly valued for its ability maintain magnetic properties under high temperatures  such as in motors   Japan in particular has been under pressure to adjust because of its loss of supply due to recent tensions with China  the largest producer    TDK Corp   which supplies magnets for motors  has developed a magnet where dysprosium is painted on its surface alone rather than being mixed into the entire magnet body  reducing dysprosium use by half  The company plans to start producing the magnet for automobiles in October   In February  Panasonic Corp  introduced equipment to extract magnets made of neodymium  another rare earth element  from used home electric appliances at its home appliance recycling plant in Kato  Hyogo Prefecture  The neodymium will be reused in air conditioner compressors and in motors for drum washers and other products  Panasonic officials said   Honda Motor Co  plans by year end to start extracting rare earths from nickel metal hydride  NiMH  batteries used in hybrid vehicles  The automaker s dealerships will collect NiMH batteries from disused hybrid vehicles  and a plant belonging to ferroalloy manufacturer Japan Metals and Chemicals Co  will dismantle them to extract rare earths  Honda will then use the collected material in new hybrid vehicles   The industry ministry estimates domestic demand for rare earths dropped from 31 000 tons in 2010 to 23 000 tons in 2011 ,2012-10-16,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/popping-the-rare-earths-bubble-139929,139929

   Australia dollar leaps to new record high after CPI
   US dollar hits 4 mth low vs yen
   Clock ticks on Washington s Aug 2 deadline on debt

  Updates prices 	
 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE  July 27  Reuters    Gold prices hit a record high
of more than  1 625 an ounce on Wednesday and Asian stock
markets were largely flat as news out of Washington indicated
politicians were making little progress in ending a deadlock
over raising the U S  debt ceiling 	
 Republicans had to delay bringing a plan to a vote in the
U S  House of Representatives because it was being rewritten 
while an analyst at Standard   Poor s told CNBC that
prioritising debt payments to avoid a default would be  deeply
disruptive  to the economy   	
 Debt and inflation were globally the main focuses of
investors    	
 The Australian dollar jumped to a post float high above
 1 1060 after second quarter inflation figures were higher than
forecast  squeezing investors who had recently increased bets
that the Australian central bank would cut rates this year 	
 The Australian dollar and other Asia Pacific currencies have
been rising as traders anticipate more policymaker action to
keep quickening inflation and capital inflows at bay 	
 The threat of a U S  default and a credit rating downgrade
loomed over equity markets and the dollar  which was sold across
the board on Tuesday  though a one notch cut may not have a
lasting impact on markets 	
  The impact of a credit downgrade on the financial markets
would be negative for growth  The induced shocks to the economy
could lower next quarter s real GDP growth to close to zero 
However  a likely rebound in Q4 growth  following a resolution
of the budget debacle  could leave growth in the second half
lower by 0 6 percent   said Michael Carey  North American chief
economist with Credit Agricole  in a note 	
 
 DEBT POLITICS 	
 The crisis over Washington s borrowing limit has not
triggered a persistent selloff in risky assets  especially since
many investors see few alternatives to the depth of the U S 
Treasury market and contrast the political nature of the U S 
crisis with the structural problems in the euro zone 
 	
 Most market watchers expect some sort of last minute deal in
Washington  But the standoff has made investors increasingly
hedge against an adverse outcome  particularly with the clock
ticking toward an Aug  2 deadline when the U S  Treasury said it
would not be able to borrow anymore 	
 Japan s Nikkei share average fell 0 5 percent   led
by Honda Motor Co shares  which ended the day down 1 7 percent
   	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
0 4 percent   though trading volume was low
throughout the region  suggesting many investors were choosing
to sit on the sidelines until the outlook becomes clearer 	
 The U S  dollar index   which gauges its value against
a basket of six other major currencies  was largely unchanged on
the day after earlier hitting a fresh 2 1 2 month low at 73 42  	
 The dollar hit a four month low against the yen  just below
77 70   though the march lower has been sluggish because
of fears that Japan may step into markets unilaterally to slow
its currency s gains 	
 Japanese policymakers are becoming alarmed at persistent yen
rises and considering solo currency intervention as an
increasingly viable option for the near term  sources with
knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday  	
 The yield on the benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note was at
2 97 percent   up around 2 basis points from late
Tuesday in New York  The yield has darted around 3 percent for
the past week  with traders highly uncertain about the near term
outlook   	
 Shorter term securities reflect more of the unease among
investors  with T bills maturing in August yielding 2 to 3 basis
points more than debt coming due in September  	
 In commodity markets  gold climbed to an all time high of
 1 625 24 an ounce   having risen more than 14 percent so
far this year  greatly exceeding the S P 500 index s 6 percent
gain so far  	
  The same arguments about potential government bond fallout
are still being made   said a Singapore based trader   but
people are on the sidelines ahead of the August deadline waiting
to see whether or not the U S  is going to avoid a technical
default    	
 U S  crude oil futures  fell 19 cents to  99 40 a
barrel  while Brent crude futures  were up 10 cents at
 118 40

109778,331293,HMC,Smart Grid Versus A New Blue Mustang,opinion,When smart grid was in its infancy the toy of choice was a smart meter  Like a stuffed animal in the crib every home had one  Now smart grid is reaching adolescence and the toys cost more  A lot more    The smart grid phenomenon is maturing and that is shifting the way the electric power industry addresses the changes  opportunities and risks it brings  Smart grid burst onto center stage stimulated by more than  3 billion in Federal stimulus money like a teenager with raging hormones  Instant gratification was provided by spending on flashy smart meters and pimped out communications systems used to collect the data the meters spit out    Yes there were growing pains  big data  too much data  worries over who had access to data and what they would do with it  These issues are largely being worked out without major hiccups even while a few locations still quarrel over the health  safety and other objections to going digital    A new study by Zpryme called  was released in July 2012 charting the forecast of smart grid growth around the world through 2020  The study says the current opportunity for smart grid vendors is expected to grow to nearly  34 billion by 2020 compared to about  6 billion today Holy Rate Hikes North America s global market share of that growth will shrink from 44  of today s market to about 28  as growth in Asia Pacific catches up  Even so that 28  of  34 billion represents about  9 5 billion of 2020 market opportunity in North America compared to about  2 6 billion today North America is expected to reach saturation in deployment of smart meters by 2014 that will be the easy part of the transition to smart grid  The tougher and longer to implement process of distribution automation and grid optimization  the evolution of the distributed energy strategies for the future and the transition in fuel use and technology mix will take longer to accomplish Optimizing the power grid is a slow process of upgrading and integrating new technologies to improve efficiency  make power flows and communications works seamlessly two ways instead of just from the utility to the user  Integrating renewable energy  combined heat and power  microgrids and thousands to new entrants as market participants democratizes the grid like never before but also dramatically increases the security risks and vulnerabilities Experiences like the recent storms in the Eastern interconnect which took down power lines and left millions in the dark for days sensitize both utilities and customers to the need for better grid reliability which we often take for granted  Distribution automation will never prevent a tree from falling on a power line but it might be able to isolate the outage  re route service from other sources  and even  self heal  some equipment malfunctions or restarts  but that will cost money big money   Making all these smart grid improvements is what is going to absorb the bulk of that investment that gets North America to a  9 5 billion smart grid market by 2020 While digital technologies have improved substantially  distribution automation is not a new idea  What jump started smart grid was the willingness of the Federal Government to spent  3 4 billion in Federal stimulus money on it  Now that money is spent and distribution automation is back where it started  To win approval from state public utility regulators in rate increases  DA must be able to produce benefits worth its costs  And since we are now going to be spending our own money not Uncle Sam s  WAIT   That is our money too   the burden of proof is higher Yes  your utility rate will go up  but you already knew that The question is whether it will be worth it when the smart grid is fully built out  The engineers estimates that smart grid improvements could reduce distribution losses by as much as 30   The U S  Energy Information Administration says that US electric distribution losses totaled 261 billion kWh in 2010 so clearly there is room for improvement  Worldwide the loss number is higher with average worldwide electricity losses averaging about 9  In 2005  the Electric Power Research Institute  EPRI  estimated the cost for integrating distribution substation automation to the grid infrastructure at about  10 billion and feeder automation at  70 billion  But those estimates are old and the cost is likely to be higher  much higher as new regulations for security  interoperability standards  regulations and other costs are added up And that remains the question ratepayers want answered  Will the benefits of smart grid be worth the cost   Should I give my kid the keys to my old Honda with lots of miles on it but still many miles left even if I have to fix it every so often  or buy the kid that new Mustang convertible he wants    As ratepayers we won t get that choice we will pay the equivalent of many new Mustangs in higher rates but you will never get to drive it and chances are your power is still going to go off when the wind takes down some tree ,2012-07-10,Gary

109783,331298,HMC,Taylor Asset Management CEO Busts The Peak Oil Myth,opinion,Peak oil   Baloney   says Stephen Taylor  However  significant price differentials make for a complicated global market  On that front  Taylor s message is simple  Watch the news to see where the wells are gushing  choose stocks with low operational costs and keep cash on hand for quick near term profits  Learn which companies are priced to buy in Taylor s exclusive interview with The Energy Report  The Energy Report  Let s start with a macro rundown  What s the Stephen Taylor take on oil and gas markets today  Stephen Taylor  It s like A Tale of Two Cities  The gas that sells for  3 per thousand cubic feet   3 mcf  in the Marcellus region would sell for  12 mcf in Europe or Japan  but nobody s found a quick and easy way to get it from one place to the other  A lot of new areas  like the Bakken in North Dakota  have surging production  but the infrastructure s taking time to get updated and adjusted  Big  interregional price differentials are a theme we ll keep seeing as long as we have these bottlenecks  but those will slowly abate over time  This means it s really going to be a stock picker s market  and a lot of the action will be location driven  TER  So it s location  location  location with asset valuations  ST  Absolutely  However  one thing we touched on back in my March interview is that the U S  may see a reemergence of the petrochemical industry  Huntsman Corp   HUN NYSE  had just announced a big project at that time  More recently  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE  announced a major project north of Pittsburgh that will probably create 10 000 jobs and use a lot of that Marcellus gas  I think that s a trend that s going to continue  with industry jobs moving back to the U S  to take advantage of some of this cheaper energy  TER  What about developing natural gas vehicles  Are we any closer to T  Boone Pickens  vision of widespread consumer adoption of natural gas vehicles  ST  I think Boone was met with some skepticism  initially  A lot of people just naturally distrust oilmen  But  he s a smart man and his plan makes a lot of sense  We re now starting to see more product offerings  such as vehicles with a natural gas option  like the new Honda Civic  And there are a lot more natural gas fueling stations around than people may realize  It continues to grow as a transportation fuel  and I think we ll find other uses for it  That emerging demand will keep the downside in natural gas prices not too far from where it is right now  Any surprises should be to the upside in the next two to three years  TER  Will still more improved drilling technologies alter the natural gas fundamentals  ST  New drilling technologies are beginning to lower the cost of some of these multi frack wells  That will allow the drilling boom to continue here in the U S  and in emerging plays around the world  TER  At this rate  it doesn t seem like projections about peak oil have much resonance  ST  Frankly I think peak oil is baloney  and you can quote me on that  The potential reserves  especially on the natural gas side  are just tremendous  I was just reading a report that even in a place like Argentina  shale gas reserves could be north of 700 trillion cubic feet  That could be another huge gas producing region  There s plenty out there  I don t buy peak oil or gas  TER  Oil prices are hanging in between  85 95 barrel  bbl   Do you see any significant moves higher in the near term  ST  Turmoil in the Middle East or perhaps an environmental issue like the BP spill could be a price driver  Meanwhile  governments around the world keep printing money  which will flow into hard assets  But disaster aside  I think we re stuck in a trading range between  75 95 bbl over the next 12 18 months  The easy money will support the price and the new supply in technology will cap the upside a little  TER  Which companies are already seeing a change in their bottom lines through new drilling technologies  ST  A name that I ve mentioned in the past is New Zealand Energy Corp   NZ TSX V  NZERF OTCQX   We continue to be a big fan of that stock and the management team  The company just completed a financing in March at  3 a share  The company is now able to aggressively pursue its development plans  It recently announced a strategic acquisition of some gas gathering and production assets  John Proust  its chairman  is a really good strategic thinker and this acquisition makes a lot of sense  One of the technologies or process innovations that New Zealand is taking advantage of is the move to pad drilling  where you build one pad and keep the rig in place to drill two to four wells  It saves a lot of money  He and his team are sharp guys and management owns 30  of the stock  The stock has backed off into the  1 60 range  I think there s little downside from here and a lot of upside over the next couple of years as John and his team implement their plan  It has a tremendous drilling pipeline with a couple million acres in onshore New Zealand  This recent acquisition brought an additional library of 3 D seismic over the main production fairway  It can drill as many wells as its checkbook allows  I think ultimately  New Zealand is a target for a larger international oil company to take out  New Zealand has pulled back and had a rough ride  But  I think now is a great time to be a buyer  We have been long time holders of this company and have participated before the public offering and continue to like it  I think the 50  pullback since March is a gift  I would also point out that the S P TSX Venture 30 Index is being reformulated and New Zealand Energy has been added to that index  That will be a good short term catalyst for the stock  TER  Are companies seeing better drilling success rates with new technologies  ST  Absolutely  If you look over the last 20 years  the success rates on wells have moved up nicely  There can still be problems  such as we saw recently with McMoRan Exploration Co  s  MMR NYSE  Davy Jones No  1 well  It s still a risky business make no mistake about that  But the technology is helping us get oil from places that we couldn t have before  There continues to be a lot of excitement over the ultra deep gas prospects in the Gulf  despite the hiccup McMoRan had with Davy Jones  Eventually  McMoRan will get its problems sorted out  and we continue to be very excited about that  TER  What other stocks catch your eye  ST  We also like a company that I ve mentioned in the past  Saratoga Resources Inc   SARA NYSE A   It recently completed a financing  which put a little pressure on the stock  but cashed up its treasury to continue doing some drilling  Its second quarter earnings release indicated that it is in the process of hedging a portion of its production  which I think is a very smart move and will be well received by the market  Another name that we like that is also being added to that index is Iona Energy Inc   INA TSX V   It s a producer focused on the North Sea off the coast of Britain and has a very experienced management team that came out of Ithaca Energy Inc   IAE TSX   We like that name as well  We participated in Iona s last financing at  0 50 and believe that it s a good entry point here  TER  Anyone else worth mentioning at this point  ST  I would probably mention Bengal Energy Ltd   BNG TSX   It s focused on Australia and India  It has huge land holdings in the Cooper Basin in Australia  It s had some good success recently at drilling wells to prove up that resource  We expect that it will eventually become a target for a larger energy company  TER  What have you done in your Taylor Fund to weather these market swings in the last couple of years  ST  We are a multi strategy fund with a broad investment mandate  While we have probably 35 40  of our fund in energy related investments and a similar amount in other resource investments  we ve recently begun focusing on the financial sector with small and midsize community banks in the U S  It s about as far away from energy as you can get  just to provide a little balance  This is probably a good entry point into that industry as well  TER  What are you expecting for the energy markets over the balance of the year  ST  This continues to be a stock picker s market with the location of the play and the application of technology being the big driver  along with mergers and acquisitions  I expect to continue seeing big oil and gas companies buy out smaller oil and gas companies  And if you can take the volatility  small is where you want to be  TER  How would you suggest investors play the markets at this point  ST  I think it s probably a good time to have a little bit more cash in reserve  There will be periods of volatility and company specific events that could create some short term buying opportunities and you want to make sure that you have a little dry powder to take advantage of those  as they may come along  TER  Any other thoughts you might want to leave with us  ST  One thing I haven t mentioned  and I think you ll continue to see is overseas buyers of energy related assets  I just came back from a trip to China and had a meeting with some representatives from CITIC Group  the big Chinese investment fund  They continue to be very hungry for energy and resource related investments around the world  They may bring some dry powder to the table too  TER  Thank you  Stephen  ST  Thanks for having me   is chairman and CEO of Taylor

   Greece cabinet shuffle  Merkel Sarkozy meeting coming up
   MSCI Asia Pacific ex Japan index down 8th week
   Tech sector tumbles  Samsung down 4 pct
   Investors are cautious about any Greece headlines

 By Kevin Plumberg	
 SINGAPORE  Jun 17  Reuters    The euro fell on Friday  with
investors still largely unconvinced that Greece can dodge a debt
default without more political stability in Athens  keeping
equity and commodity prices in a near term downtrend 	
 Greece  whose prime minister is struggling to form a
coalition government to push through unpopular austerity
reforms  has become a focal point for investors looking for
signals on whether to shed more risky assets and take defensive
positions over the next few months  	
 Olli Rehn  the European Union s top economic official  tried
to soothe markets overnight with expectations that the EU and
International Monetary Fund will disburse a 12 billion euro loan
in early July to Greece  but any benefits from his comments
quickly faded by the Asian session  where investors kept
reducing exposure to risks 	
 The euro steadily slid back toward  1 41  and shares of
Samsung Electronics   normally a favourite of foreign
investors  dropped 4 percent  while oil prices slid back to red 
heading fror their biggest weekly drop since early May 	
 After a steady feed of negative headlines on Greece 
investors were cautious ahead of a cabinet reshuffle in Athens
and a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy abot Greeek debt later on Friday 
Athens has a vote of confidence on the government scheduled for
Tuesday 	
  The wild card actually becomes the Greek political
situation  The Greek government has stood out from the other
troubled peripheral countries by surviving   Marc Chandler 
global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman 
said in a note 	
  A new cabinet will seek to push through the new austerity
measures as a vote of confidence  This will take place in the
coming days and before the IMF EU have to write a check to
Greece   	
  The Nikkei fell 0 6 percent  with weakness in
blue chip stocks such as Honda Motor Co dragging down
the index to the lowest since March 18 	
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan edged
down 0 5 percent   with the tech sector by and
far the biggest drag on the index  	
 Weighing on Asian stock markets  U S  equity futures flipped
to negative mid way through the Asian session  on Friday 
and it appeared for now that the U S  S P 500 index may test the
low for the year hit in March 	
 U S  stock investors have been consolidating their exposure
through ETFs  Inflows into the SPDR S P 500 ETF  a popular
exchange traded fund that tracks the benchmark U S  stock index 
soared to a three year high in the week ending June 15  but 
excluding ETFs  U S  equity funds had weekly outflows of  2 03
billion during the week  	
 The euro fell 0 5 percent to around  1 4135   Traders
will look for the euro to retest Thursday s low around  1 4070
later in the day and will probably add to short positions if the
currency gets near the lows 	
 The aversion to risk taking sucked down the Australian
dollar  which fell 0 5 percent to US 1 0514  	
 Brent oil futures fell 0 6 percent to  113 37 a barrel
  well off the six week high reached on Wednesday of
 121 47

109802,331317,HMC,Nikkei falls as Greece worries spur bank jitters,news,"  Worries Greece might default trouble investors
   Banks pare losses on view new regulation may not be so
stringent
   Carmakers gain on receding supply chain concerns
   Nikkei dips below 13 week moving average
   Takashimaya rises on bullish earning forecast

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO  June 27  Reuters    The Nikkei stock average dropped
one percent on Monday  as euro zone debt worries weighed on
markets before a crucial parliamentary vote in Greece this week 
with investors fretting over fallout from the debt crisis in the
banking system 	
 Bank shares came under pressure as their peers in Europe
were pummeled on worries they could suffer huge losses should
Greece default  though they pared some declines in late trade on
brokerage reports that a new capital requirement rule proposed
by an international watchdog may be less stringent than
previously thought 	
  You still have Greek worries and rising interest rates in
emerging markets seriously souring the mood in the markets  
said Mattia Ciancaleoni  director of equity sales at Citigroup 	
     This week is also heavy with lots of macroeconomic data
releases  and many players are also afraid to make big bets
ahead of the end of QE2 this week   said Ciancaleoni  referring
to the Federal Reserve s  600 billion bond buying programme due
to expire at the end of June 	
 The benchmark Nikkei fell 1 0 percent to 9 578 31 
while the broader Topix index shed 0 9 percent to
825 64 	
    Bank shares  which led initial falls  recouped some of their
earlier losses to outperform the overall market  helped by
reports from some brokerages  such as Goldman Sachs and Nomura 
that said a proposal by global regulators to impose an extra
capital charge on the world s biggest lenders would not be
negative for Japanese banks 	
  We view the release as incrementally positive for Japanese
banks which stand at the thinner end of global capital levels 
given a longer than expected lead time to build the requisite
buffers   said Philippa Rogers  a Goldman analyst  adding that
the move  reduces the worst case scenario of an up to 3 percent
buffer  which the market  had  expected  	
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ended flat
at 376 yen  while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group rose
0 2 percent to 2 404 yen 	
 They had fallen earlier in sympathy as European bank shares
marked multi year lows on worries that banks may be hit hard
should Greece default  even though Japanese banks  direct
exposure to Greece is limited 	
 
 HARSH AUSTERITY MEASURES	
 Market participants are thus still looking closely at
whether Greece can avoid becoming the first euro zone country to
default on its debt as it votes on a package of harsh austerity
measures due on Wednesday and Thursday  with members of the
public vehemently opposing any austerity
measures  	
    Advantest and some other chipmakers fell  with some
traders citing disappointing earnings from Oracle last
week as hurting the sector 	
 Some carmarkers edged up  however  bolstered after Nissan
 said last week it would boost sales by 9 9 percent to
4 6 million vehicles this year  despite disruption to production
from the March 11 earthquake  The firm said after the close on
Monday that it wants to raise its share of the global auto
market to 8 percent within six years  	
 Honda Motors added 0 7 percent to 3 020 yen with
investors saying they expected it to quickly catch up with
Nissan  whose share price has returned to pre quake levels 
Honda s share price is still more than 10 percent below
pre quake levels while Nissan s is 3 percent higher    
	
    Takashimaya Co bucked the trend and at one point 	
rose to its highest in more than six weeks  It added 1 1 percent
to 536 yen 	
    Japan s third largest department store operator on Friday
raised the operating profit forecast for its first half to Aug 
29 to 6 5 billion yen from an earlier prediction of a 1 5
billion yen loss  saying business had bounced back 
 	
 With the Nikkei having moved below its 13 week moving
average at 9 596  strong support is next seen between 9 514 and
9 498 where the benchmark s index s 25 day moving average and
the base of the Ichimoku cloud lie 	
    The Nikkei s drop was roughly in line with a one percent
fall in Asian stocks outside Japan   	
 Trade volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange s first section was
1 63 billion shares  below even last week s lacklustre average
of 1 73 billion  Decliners outnumbered advancers by 1 122 to
418

a 52 percent fall in quarterly operating profit and refrained
from providing an outlook for the new business year as it
struggles to measure the speed of its recovery after last
month s earthquake in Japan 	
 Japanese automakers have yet to figure out how fast all of
the parts makers affected by the magnitude 9 0 earthquake on
March 11 will fully recover  making it difficult to give an
earnings projection for the year to March 2012 	
 For the January March quarter  Honda s operating profit was
46 21 billion yen   562 million    compared with an
average estimate of 103 1 billion yen from 15 analysts 
Fourth quarter net profit  which includes profits made in China 
fell 38 percent to 44 55 billion yen 	
 A survey of 15 analysts put Honda s operating profit for the
full year to March 2012 at 394 billion yen  down from 569 8

109835,331350,HMC,On Student Loans  Accounting Gimmicks  Electric Cars  FX And A Note On SS,opinion,Student Loan BattleThere was a big fight in D C  this past week over student loans The issue is a scheduled increase in interest on new student loans from 3 4  to 6 4  set for July 1  Clearly this is a dumb plan  I don t see any political opposition to the idea that the summer of 2012 is a horrible time to double the cost of student loans  It will shock no one that the  solutions  being put forward by the politicos are the same ones they propose for every other problem The House Republicans have put forward a Bill to extend the 3 4  rate for a year  The cost  increased deficit  of the twelve month extension is  6B  The Republicans want to offset the  6B with  surprise   12B in reduced spending for the Affordable Care Act  The Republicans love to trade marbles for reduced Obamacare  They want a 2 1 reduction in medical spending versus education costs  Maybe the  Reds  have the chips to push this outcome  They might settle for a 1 1 deal  but the White House will hate this outcome The Senate Democrats want to raise taxes on those making over  250K to offset the cost of the one year deferral  Their argument is similar to the Buffett tax plan they tried a few weeks ago  Lacking support  it was so clear it wouldn t pass that it was never voted on  I would give the Senate legislation on student loans a zero chance in the House  It is D O A There will be the same ideological pissing match and the same result  We will get a one year extension  paid  for with  promised  reductions in expenses starting in 2017  Another kick of the can  and another big problem in 2013 This is what happens over a crummy  6B  On January 1  2013  there are cutbacks and higher taxes totaling  500B scheduled  The coming  Tax Armageddon  is supposed to be resolved in a lame duck session of Congress after the November election  There is a  zero  chance of that working out One in a HundredI have been following the evolution of new global lease accounting standards  At the heart of this issue is the recognition that a lease is just another form of debt  and that the debt should be put on the balance sheet of the lessor The big hitters in the US leasing business  and their accountants  have opposed the new standards  At this point 100 countries have signed on to the new accounting rules  but the adoption has been delayed by the good old USA At the G 20 meeting last week  finance ministers extended the deadline for the our rule makers to adopt the new rules till June  2013  That date is already 30 months late  My guess is that there will be another delay  and the source of the delay will be the powerful companies   think GE  that have a lot to lose if a lease is treated as debt  as it should be  The Foxes are the cops in this hen house  When it comes to accounting and full disclosure  nothing has changed On Electric CarsGE has dug itself deeper into the electric car business It s all well and good if GE wants to put its shareholders at risk on the future of electric cars  My concerns are that a great deal of money is being spent by D C  on this effort  and that GE s  Jeff Immelt  is the President s policy adviser  Jeff blows smoke in Obama s face and the government doles out billions to support  GE  Ford  Fisker  Tesla and others If I were running the show  I would have invested in the infrastructure for delivering natural gas as a fuel for vehicles  The US has an abundance of cheap natural gas  A fair bit of that energy is just being flared into the air these days It s not as if Natgas cars are some untested concept  Brazil has been using them for thirty years  Globally  there are about 15m Natgas powered vehicles  Of that amount only 300 000  2   are in the US So why is the government  the car manufactures and the energy companies avoiding this opportunity  The answer is that it is much more profitable to sell expensive gasoline to consumers than it is to sell cheap Natgas Note Honda makes a Natgas powered car  This vehicle was named Green Car of the year in 2011 as it gets 31 miles to the gallon with much lower emissions than gas powered cars  If there were a distribution system available  these cars would be more popular than electric cars  The cost of running cars on Natgas is about half of the cost of a gas car Why is the government supporting one technology over another  Why is it supporting the expensive alternative versus the cheaper one  Another example of the foxes being the cops On FXThere was very little net movement in the major currencies last week  I was surprised that the Euro did not weaken  The news is terrible  There is a very good chance that the French and Greek elections on May 6 will bring about political changes that will undermine the stability of the EU  If the French kick out Sarkozy  I think they will  then the chances of Spain getting a desperately needed rescue package will fall to zero  Without France standing shoulder to shoulder with Germany in support of the Euro  the whole experiment may fall into the crapper  Yet the Euro managed to eek out a small weekly gain against the buck Some are attributing the relative strength of the Euro to ongoing capital repatriation by the EU banks as they reduce their non Euro assets     Others are suggesting that large existing EURUSD short positions are the problem  Maybe  but I m catching a whiff of dollar weakness  I don t pay that much attention to the hourly trading action in FX  but I do watch how the USD trades when news comes out  When there has been  good news  the dollar has not traded higher  When there is  bad news   the weak GDP report  the dollar has traded lower I believe that the US is currently in 3rd place in the race to the bottom  The EU and Japan are leading this race  So this makes me  reluctantly  a dollar bull  I m not getting fat on this position  I m not even getting fed  so I cut some positions on Friday  I took a small loss on some recently acquired USDYEN and took a nice profit on an older  smaller  position on USDYEN that I picked up under 79 00  I took the net gains and bought one month puts on the EURUSD Note The EURCHF has been trading at less than 1 8th percent away from the intervention level of 1 2000 for over a month  This is an accident waiting to happen  It looks very quiet on the charts  but there is a steam kettle with a hot fire underneath this chart  If the French election goes against Sarkozy  I have to believe the kettle is going to blow a few rivets I have no exposure in the CHF crosses  but I m watching the action  If the Swiss National Bank is forced to support its peg over the next few weeks  it will send a bunch of other lighting bolts flying On Social Security I ve been trying to stir the pot on Social Security this week after the release of the annual report     I thought the report was ample evidence to stimulate a discussion of what changes are needed at SS  and by when  I was wrong  The terrible report and its terrible conclusions have been ignored The typical response I get from the Defenders of SS is  The Trust Fund behind SS was always scheduled to run out some day  that it s happening ahead of schedule does not matter at all   To those who do not see the fire burning here I point to the following slides from the 2008 and 2012 reports to Congress The base case assumption on the timing of the peak in the TF balance has changed dramatically over the past four years  Social Security is going to eat our lunch much faster than the public thinks  Those who think that this does not matter and that nothing should be done are dead wrong Note   I get a lot of flack about my focus on the Trust Fund  TF   I agree with those who say   There is no Trust Fund   The accounting on this is just a sham  But TF accounting is the reality in D C   and that is not going to change  So I push on the deteriorating status of the Trust Fund  that doesn t exist  in an effort to raise a red flag ,2012-04-30,Bruce

109884,331399,HMC,Ministry of Finance  All Bark  No Bite ,opinion,Japanese officials always make sure that we know that they re upset about the yen getting too strong  But do you think they re all bark and no bite  After all  we haven t actually seen the BOJ openly intervene in the markets since March 2011 when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit Japan Think again The Ministry of Finance  MoF  released a report which showed that the government intervened in the markets in the last quarter of 2011 Some of you are probably scratching your heads and asking yourselves   How the heck did I not know   Don t worry  I m pretty sure you re not the only one The MoF pulled off a stealth intervention which simply means that they sold the yen in smaller  but still significant  volumes without informing the public  To make sure it stays as a secret  private banks carry out the foreign exchange transactions in behalf of the MoF  Open intervention proved to be futile in the past and has earned Japan criticisms from other countries so the government opted to weaken the yen quietly Details of the report showed that the MoF sold 8 07 trillion JPY on October 31  2011  the largest monthly amount spent for intervention  when USD JPY dropped to its lowest level since World War II at 75 35  But after the pair rallied 397 pips and quickly pared part of its gains  it seemed that it still wasn t enough  So from November 1 to 4  2011  another 1 02 trillion JPY was again sold that consequently kept the pair trading above 78 00 Why is the BOJ trying to keep the yen from soaring anyway  Ahh  that s an excellent question  my dear reader  You see  a stronger yen would make Japan s exports relatively more expensive as its trade partners would have to shell out more of their local currency to buy Japanese products  As the yen keeps on appreciating  Japan s exports become even more expensive  eventually forcing its trade partners to look for cheaper alternatives  With that  demand for Japanese products would fall  putting a dent on Japan s manufacturing industries and overall economic performance Now that USD JPY is trading below 78 00  some Japanese companies are already taking a hit  Let s take a look at a few of them A few days ago  Sharp  Japan s largest manufacturer of LCD panels  announced that it is expecting to chalk up its worst annual loss ever since its inception nearly a century ago  Panasonic  Japan s biggest appliances company  is projecting a 780 billion JPY loss To top that off  Honda  Japan s third largest automobile manufacturer  estimated that it will lose 15 billion JPY for every one yen gain against the dollar  The car company also forecast that its 12 month net income will slip to its three year low of 215 billion JPY in March With that  the BOJ downgraded its growth forecast from its October estimate of 2 2  to just 2  for the next 12 months starting in April  Amidst these threats to economic growth  the MoF expressed its intention to keep fighting the yen s strength through various forms of intervention While their efforts  combined with improved risk appetite in the markets  seem to be doing the trick of capping the yen s gains for now  it seems that the Japanese government s efforts to keep the yen from appreciating are very limited  Despite that  traders remain cautious about buying the yen as the MoF could still have a bunch of new tricks up its sleeve ,2012-02-09,BabyPips.com,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/ministry-of-finance:-all-bark,-no-bite-113593",113593

109899,331414,HMC,Technical Analysis  EUR USD  GBP USD  USD JPY  and USD CAD,opinion,EUR USDEuropean leaders will take another run at fixing the debt crisis this week after the failure of their fourth rescue blueprint sparked intensified concern the 17 nation euro area was on the brink of unraveling  With a European Union summit in Brussels looming Dec  9  U S  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner arrives in Frankfurt tomorrow to prod political leaders and the European Central Bank holds a policy meeting Dec  8  Today  Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy will hold talks in Paris in an attempt to bridge differences on a crisis resolution  Safeguarding banks  limiting the damage to Italy and Spain and finding additional rescue funds may hinge on the response to Franco German demands for closer economic integration and tougher policing of fiscal rules  Markets climbed last week as investors looked toward the latest plan to rescue to the 17  nation euro  betting that a new regime of budget rules at the summit may clear the way for more intervention from the ECB   The door should swing open for the ECB to become more aggressive   Erik Nielsen  global chief economist at UniCredit   SpA  wrote in a note to clients yesterday  Stepped up bond purchases by the ECB will  restore a degree of sanity  The German and French leaders continue to differ on matters such as the role of the ECB and sanctions mechanisms for euro area states that violate deficit rules  Le Journal du Dimanche reported yesterday  The two nations are leading the push for closer economic ties among euro nations and locking in tougher enforcement of budget rules to counter the debt  Bank of England should expand stimulus by 50 billion pounds   78 billion  this week to bolster the economy rather than wait for its current round of bond purchases to end  the British Chambers of Commerce said  The London based BCC called on the central bank to increase the target for asset purchases after it was raised by 75 billion pounds to 275 billion pounds in October  The central bank s Monetary Policy Committee meets this week and will announce its decision at noon on Dec  8 in London   With the government persevering with its deficit cuts  and the problems in the euro zone creating worldwide banking risks  U K  monetary policy must be as expansionary as possible to protect our economy from any adverse effects   BCC Chief Economist David Kern said in an e mailed statement today  The Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility cut their growth forecasts last week  with the former saying risks from the euro crisis have increased  While policy makers said more stimulus may be needed in the future  they ve indicated they will wait until the current four month   program of bond purchases is completed in early February  The OBR sees growth of 0 7 percent next year  less than a third of the previously predicted 2 5 percent  Chairman Robert Chote said on Nov  29 the underlying momentum of the economy will weaken further in the current quarter and there will be little growth until the second half of next year  While many commentators expect the MPC to wait until January or February  we believe that an early announcement would strengthen confidence   Kern said  It would  help to counter the negative mood that has become apparent following the grim projections issued by the OBR     USD JPYHonda Motor Co  says replenished vehicle inventory and new Honda and Acura models planned for the next 24 months will spur a U S  sales rebound next year after natural disasters dashed its 2011 goals  Honda s loss of some North American output in October and November due to parts shortages caused by floods in Thailand led to it being the only large automaker to post a U S  sales decline last month as total sales jumped 14 percent  That came after six months of declines resulting from reduced auto inventory triggered by Japan s March earthquake and tsunami   I m going to the shrine to pray to avoid any more such disasters from Mother Nature   Tetsuo Iwamura  Honda s top North American executive  said in an interview on Dec  2 in Las Vegas   Next year

an overseas transfer to a JPMorgan Chase account in London but was told everything was approved by MF s back office Otherwise  Corzine has said   I simply do not know where the money is  and  I didn t intend to break the rules  when it comes to the missing  1 2 billion in customer funds But CME Group CEO  Terry Duffy  claims   Mr  Corzine was aware of the loans being made from segregated accounts

Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd  Richard Syron  ex CEO of Freddie Mac  and other executives of both for understating hundreds of billions of dollars in subprime loans held by the firms  According to one

deal to hold the government  and government appointed executives who have signed the same disclosures since my departure  blameless   so that it can sue individuals it fired years ago  The problem is both Mudd and Syron  in congressional testimony in April 2007  tremendously downplayed their firms  exposure to subprime loans  Mudd saying it was less than 2 5  of Fannie s book  while Syron said Freddie hadn t  been heavily involved in subprime all along    Morgan Stanley plans to cut about 1 600 jobs due to a drop in revenue from investment banking and trading  with the cuts coming in the

that would address Ryan s original Medicare proposal s flaw  that being its inability to keep pace with the rate of inflation  The new plan  which I m not even going to begin to explain in detail now  would give future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional federal plan or purchasing private insurance coverage  All I know is that the Republican presidential candidates in Thursday s debate

Samuelson from his Dec  4 op ed in the Washington Post  We Americans fool ourselves if we ignore the parallels between Europe s problems and our own  It s reassuring to think them separate  and the fixation on the euro   Europe s common currency   buttresses that mind set  But Europe s turmoil is more than a currency crisis and was inevitable  in some form  even if the euro had never been

 The modern welfare state has reached a historic reckoning  As a political institution  it hasn t adapted to change  Politics and economics are at loggerheads  Vast populations in Europe and America expect promised benefits and  understandably  resent any hint that they will be cut  Elected politicians respond accordingly  But the resulting inertia poses an economic threat  one already realized in Europe  As deficits or taxes rise  the risk is that economic instability will increase  growth will decline  or both  Paying promised benefits becomes harder  Or austerity becomes unavoidable  The paradox is that the welfare state  designed to improve security and dampen social conflict  now looms as an engine for insecurity  conflict and disappointment  Facing the hard questions of finding a sustainable balance between individual protections and better economic growth  the Europeans have spent years dawdling  The parallel with our situation is all too obvious  At least Ron Wyden and Paul Ryan have acted  while President Obama leads from behind   The worst drought in Texas history  which has caused an estimated  5 2 billion in losses to farmers and livestock producers  has led to the largest ever one year decline in the cow herd  600 000  or a 12  decline from the 5 million cows estimated at the beginning of the year  But while most folks talk about the impact this drop in the herd will have on beef prices  I say  boy  that s a lot of methane removed from the atmosphere  Texas  air quality has never been better   Speaking of climate change  Canada formally withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol  the first such nation to pull out  which led to criticism from the rest of the world  But  said Peter Kent  Canada s minister of the environment   Kyoto is in the past  and as such we are invoking our legal right to withdraw   Kent added that Kyoto would cost his country  13 6 billion  or   1 600 from every Canadian family that was the legacy of an incompetent Liberal government  Meanwhile  the recently concluded Durban Conference was deemed  absurd  by Globe and Mail opinion columnist Margaret Wente  who says climate change conferences are more about power and money and the opportunity for growing economies to  extract billions  from rich countries  as reported by the BBC Comedian commentator Dennis Miller says the Durban forum was primarily an event used by male delegates to pick up women  Aside from chasing the opposite sex  delegates reached agreement that a new climate change deal would be in place by 2015 and in force from 2020  plus it is to include top emitters China  the U S  and India  If I were a cow  I d begin to change my diet  Or take Beano    Good news California s unemployment rate dropped to 11 3  in November  the lowest since June 2009   Swiss Re AG estimates that natural disasters such as earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan  and floods in Thailand  let alone the severe storms in the U S   resulted in the highest ever catastrophic economic losses in a single year  Total losses in 2011  including insured and uninsured losses  are estimated at  350 billion  up from  226 billion in 2010 The loss for the insurance industry itself  however  is projected at  108 billion  primarily because Japan hadn t been fully insured  so on this basis it s the second most expensive year for the industry after 2005  which had massive loss generating storms like Katrina  Wilma and Rita   Anita Greil   Wall Street Journal   Commodities continued to take it on the chin this week  The story is really simple  irrespective of currency fluctuations  such as in a stronger dollar  As China goes  so goes the sector  China consumes 37  of the world s copper  for example  and accounts for 60  of growth in global oil demand  So in looking at 2012  if you were playing the CRB Index  it s about whether China will muddle through  have a hard landing  or see renewed growth  Today  I d be in the muddle through camp  7 5 8 0  growth    China s Shanghai Composite Index hit a new 33 month low before rallying 2  on Friday   The Economist had a piece on Macau and the excessive amount of money laundering taking place there  with wealthy Chinese evading China s strict limits on the amount of yuan that can be taken out of the country by laundering it through the gambling Mecca  When the wealthy cash out  they are paid in Hong Kong dollars  which they can then stash in Hong Kong or take elsewhere  Many point to this as a big reason for Macau s success  as 72  of its revenues come from high rollers   Atlantic City could use more money laundering  November revenues at its 11 casinos fell 6 3  from a year ago   The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa remains far and away the biggest in A C  in terms of revenue  by the way    McDonald s said November same store sales rose a strong 7 4   with the company citing breakfast items such as the seasonal addition of the peppermint mocha to the coffee menu  Sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 6 5  in both the U S  and Europe  and 8 1  in Asia Pacific  the Middle East and Africa This is nothing short of spectacular and McDonald s shares hit another all time high   One of the world s worst CEOs  Andrea Jung of Avon  was relieved of her command  though for some reason allowed to remain as chairman of the board   A USA TODAY analysis shows that electric bills have skyrocketed the last five years   a sharp reversal from a quarter century ago when Americans enjoyed stable power bills even as they used more electricity    Another hit for the middle class as wages continue to stagnate    When I was golfing the other day with Dr  W   we were talking about the situation in the U S  and two things that will help kill us  rising healthcare costs and tuition So while you all know about both  I did see a telling piece in the Los Angeles Times by George Skelton  talking about tuition hikes at the University of California  up 18  this year over last  which was 14  higher than 2009  which was 23  steeper than  08  Again  with wages stagnant over the same stretch  Plus  back in 1984  there were no academic fees  Today  it s  864  annually  assuming a full course load Plus  the average textbook now costs  104  2010   a 24  increase from five years before   Between 1986 and 2004  textbook prices rose 186   double the inflation rate  Students can expect to spend more than  1 100 a year on books    I can t say I ve purchased any Michael Kors apparel for significant others  or been in one of its outlets  but the IPO did well this week  up 21  in its debut on Thursday   The NFL reached agreement with its broadcast and cable networks that will see CBS  Fox and NBC pay a cumulative  3 billion a year  over nine years  starting in 2014  or more than 50  higher than their current deals   Fox will pony up  1 1 billion  CBS  1 billion  and NBC  950 million a year  Three months ago  ESPN agreed to pay  1 9 billion annually for eight years  Add in DirecTV  which pays  1 billion a year for its Sunday Ticket satellite package  and you ve got a lot of money to divvy up  The players  under the new collective bargaining agreement  get 55  of the TV haul   The late Liz Taylor s jewelry collection fetched a record setting  115 million at auction  including more than  8 8 million for a diamond ring given to her by Richard Burton  purchased by a private buyer from Asia   The U S  Mint is curtailing production of the  1 golden coin  The government has 1 4 billion of them in its vaults  demand is so low  Dollar coins have never caught on   Speaking of pocket change  ever notice how only women insist on searching for the exact change at checkout lines   Mused the editor  who has coffee cans full of change  probably about  1500 worth  in storage  This is what I ll cash in when I m homeless and riding the rails    Lastly  gotta love Barclays CEO Bob Diamond  who has imposed a  no jerks  policy for his U K  bank  Diamond said the rule applies to bankers considered to be prima donnas  too greedy  too ostentatious or failures as team players  Supposedly  he has encouraged 30 to 40 Barclays employees to find work elsewhere for violating the standard  Diamond cited an infamous 2002 episode  during which six Barclays bankers ran up a  68 940 alcohol tab at a London restaurant  as embarrassing and  the no jerk rule personified

 NEW YORK  April 7  Reuters    U S  stocks slipped on
Thursday after another powerful earthquake hit Japan  renewing
concerns about supply disruptions and the country s ongoing
nuclear issue  but markets were off their lows as a number of
retailers rallied on strong monthly sales 
 There were no reports of injuries in the quake  which had a
magnitude of 7 4 and triggered a tsunami warning  but investors
remain cautious on the region after the March 11 devastating
quake and tsunami 
 The iShares MSCI Japan Index ETF dropped 0 5 percent 
rebounding off earlier lows  while dollar denominated Nikkei
futures slid 1 2 percent  U S  listed shares of Sony Corp fell
0 9 percent  The CBOE Market volatility index spiked 2 8
percent after the news of the quake 
  Right now I m waiting to see the extent of the damage 
though I ve been picking through some stocks to see which could
be impacted by disruptions   said Tim Hartzell  who oversees
 300 million as chief investment officer for Houston based
Sequent Asset Management 
 Hartzell  whose fund invests in Japanese stocks through
exchange traded funds  said he might buy on weakness   I m
looking at auto manufacturers  and I m definitely looking to
buy Honda if it gets cheap enough   he said 
 Honda Motor Corp rose 0 2 percent on volume that neared its
50 day average 
 The March 11 quake has left an official toll of 12 554 dead
and another 15 000 missing 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 41 97 points  or

 Stocks had been mostly flat prior to the news of the quake 
with the S P 500 encountering strong technical resistance that
stymied gains after a larger than expected drop in weekly
jobless claims and March retail sales that topped
expectations 
  The consumer seems to be hanging in there despite higher

 NEW YORK  April 7  Reuters    Wall Street slipped on
Thursday after a major aftershock in Japan reignited fears
about nuclear crisis  but greater faith in the U S  economy s
steady path held losses in check 
 A rise in retail stocks after better than expected March
chain store sales limited broader market losses as the data
underpinned evidence of a sustained economic recovery 
 Investors sought protection against further market declines
following news of the magnitude 7 4 aftershock in Japan  but a
move to safer assets did not materialize 
  It made people think that this is an ongoing crisis that
could further hurt stocks  but one thing we didn t see is the
flight to safety   said John Canally  economist at LPL
Financial in Boston  Massachusetts 
 The CBOE Volatility Index VIX  Wall Street s so called fear
gauge  closed up 1 1 percent at 17 08  after rising more than 2
percent earlier 
 Chris McKhann  analyst at stock and options website
optionMonster com in Chicago  said the VIX had little reaction
to the earthquake news   further supporting the fact that
nothing seems to shake this market  
 Stocks had been mostly flat prior to the news of the quake 
The S P 500 encountered strong technical resistance that
stymied gains after a larger than expected drop in weekly U S 
jobless claims and the data on the surprisingly strong March
retail sales 
 Among retailers  Costco Wholesale Corp beat expectations 
and its shares gained 3 8 percent to  77 82  Macy s Inc rose
0 8 percent to  25 40 while Target Corp fell 2 6 percent to
 49 62 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 17 26 points  or
0 14 percent  at 12 409 49  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index was
down 2 03 points  or 0 15 percent  at 1 333 51  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was down 3 68 points  or 0 13 percent  at
2 796 14 
 Volume was 7 02 billion on the New York Stock Exchange 
NYSE Amex and Nasdaq  compared with last year s estimated daily
average of 8 47 billion 
 The aftershock in Japan did not cause a tsunami or any
detectable damage at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
plant 
 U S  Treasuries  the traditional safe haven asset  rose
only marginally after the earthquake 
 The iShares MSCI Japan Index ETF dropped 0 8 percent

 NEW YORK  April 7  Reuters    Wall Street slipped on
Thursday after a major aftershock in Japan reignited fears
about its nuclear power crisis  but greater faith in the U S 
economy s steady path held losses in check 
 A rise in retail stocks after better than expected March
chain store sales limited broader market declines as the data
added to evidence of a sustained economic recovery 
 Investors sought protection against further market declines
following the magnitude 7 4 aftershock in Japan  but a move to
safer assets did not materialize 
  It made people think that this is an ongoing crisis that
could further hurt stocks  but one thing we didn t see is the
flight to safety   said John Canally  economist at LPL
Financial in Boston  Massachusetts 
 The CBOE Volatility Index VIX   Wall Street s
so called fear gauge  closed up 1 2 percent at 17 11 after
rising more than 2 percent earlier 
 Chris McKhann  analyst at stock and options website
optionMonster com in Chicago  said the VIX had little reaction
to the earthquake news   further supporting the fact that
nothing seems to shake this market  
 Stocks had been mostly flat in early trading  The S P 500
encountered strong technical resistance that stymied gains
after a larger than expected drop in weekly initial U S 
jobless claims and data on the surprisingly strong March retail
sales   ID nN0784911 
 Among retailers  Costco Wholesale Corp  beat
expectations  and its shares gained 3 8 percent to  77 82 
Macy s Inc  rose 0 8 percent to  25 40  while Target Corp
 fell 2 6 percent to  49 62 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 17 26
points  or 0 14 percent  at 12 409 49  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was down 2 03 points  or 0 15 percent  at
1 333 51  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 3 68
points  or 0 13 percent  at 2 796 14 
 Volume was 7 06 billion shares on the New York Stock
Exchange  NYSE Amex and Nasdaq  compared with last year s
estimated daily average of 8 47 billion 
 Bed Bath and Beyond Inc  surged 10 5 percent to
 54 55 a day after it forecast full year earnings growth that
would beat Wall Street expectations   ID nN06160714 
 U S  listed shares of rare earth stocks gained sharply 
including Canada s Rare Element Resources   up 16 4
percent at  15 30 in New York  Shares of Avalon Rare Metals
 also of Canada  gained 9 6 percent to  9 52 
 The aftershock in Japan did not cause a tsunami or any
detectable damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant 
crippled from a massive March 11 quake  For details  see
 ID nL3E7F72Y2 
 U S  Treasuries  the traditional safe haven asset  rose
only marginally after the earthquake 
 The iShares MSCI Japan Index ETF  dropped 0 8
percent  rebounding off lows  while dollar denominated Nikkei
futures  slid 1 6 percent 
 New York traded shares of Japanese stocks fell  but some
strategists said they might buy on the weakness

 Honda Motor Corp  shares rose 0 1 percent to
 34 20 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
1 872 to 1 116  while on the Nasdaq  decliners beat advancers
by 1 658 to 935

London  extending this year s losses to 11 percent  The gauge slid every day last week  as surging borrowing costs for Italy and Spain spurred concern the debt crisis  in Europe is spreading  If bickering and incompetent politicians in Europe aren t bad enough  we also have the specter this week of the so called U S  super committee  an oxymoron if ever there was one  failing to come to an agreement on spending cuts on the U S  budget deficit  after the debt ceiling debacle a few months ago   said Michael Hewson  a markets analyst at CMC Markets  in London  In the U S   the deficit cutting congressional super committee will probably announce that it has failed to reach an agreement on federal budget savings  according to a Democratic aide in an e mail   USD JPYJapanese stocks

will focus on the stability of the U S  politically   said Tim  Schroeders  who helps manage  1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd  in Melbourne   People will probably sit on the sideline and wait for clarity  The value of shares traded on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to the second lowest this year  after the bourse today shortened the trading lunch break by half an

congressional gridlock was on the brink of failure   We are once again in a risk off environment   Jim Phoenix  a managing director at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Calgary  said in a telephone interview   Certainly the European story is still the overarching concern in the currency markets  As that situation unfolds  it puts upward pressure on the U S  dollar and downward pressure on the euro and the Canadian dollar  The loonie dropped 0 9 percent to C 1 0369 per U S  dollar at 3 33 p m  in Toronto  It touched C 1 0419  matching the Oct 7 low  One Canadian dollar buys 96 44 U S

109927,331442,HMC,Week in Review Part II  Street Bytes,opinion,Stocks had another miserable week with the Dow Jones losing 4 8  to close at 11231  down exactly 1 000 points in four weeks and now down 3 0  for the year  The S P 500 lost 4 7   while Nasdaq declined 5 1   its fourth straight weekly loss  Both the S P and Nasdaq are now down 8  in 2011  For very selfish reasons I wish the year ended now  I d be spot on with my yearend forecast of the major averages finishing down 5  to 7   Plus the CRB Index of 19 commodities is at 305 45  down from the 12 31 10 level of 332 80  so my prediction there is good But five weeks is an eternity these days and I wouldn t be the least bit surprised to see a big rally before yearend  No one said it has to be a rational one   U S  Treasury Yields6 mo  0 06  2 yr  0 27  10 yr  1 96  30 yr  2 92 The debate over deficit reduction didn t shake the Treasury market as Europe s turmoil led to a further flight to quality  at least the U S  being perceived as the best kid on a sleazy planet  Back on Aug  5  when S P downgraded the U S  credit rating  the benchmark 10 year Treasury was at 2 56   Today it sits at 1 96   after hitting 1 67  on Sept  23  and 1 87  on Nov  23   The Federal Reserve is putting the 31 largest banks  with assets over  50 billion  through another stress test  this one where GDP would decline 6 9  based on a euro recession  with 13  unemployment and locusts  the point being to measure capital levels in times of crisis I don t know if a stress test is necessary  I would just raise bank capital requirements above where they are now  almost to draconian levels  to kill any thought of excessive risk taking and return them to what they were supposed to be doing in the first place  Lend to businesses and homeowners  with a mandatory 20  down   Boring stuff  I love to be bored   Speaking of housing  October existing home sales were a little better than expected  but the median home price was down to  162 500  The July 2006 peak was  230 300  The Feb  2011 low was  156 000   Tokyo s Nikkei index is at its worst level since the March 2009 lows   It s staggering to think that AT T will have to take  4 billion in charges in the year s final quarter as a result of its seemingly failed  39 billion acquisition of T Mobile USA  as the Federal Communications Commission announced it would seek a trial like hearing on the merger  one that would cause countless delays  which then led AT T and T Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG to pull their application for FCC approval in order to focus on the Justice Department  which is also seeking to block the acquisition The two agencies say that a merger of the No  2 and No  4 wireless carriers would damage competition  AT T needs approval from both to proceed The thing is  AT T agreed to a breakup fee of  3 billion with Deutsche Telekom for the latter to go along with the deal and to turn over valuable spectrum if the deal wasn t approved  estimated cost another  1 billion   Obviously  AT T didn t anticipate such fierce opposition from the feds   An estimated 200 000 jobs have been lost this year in the financial services sector  worse than the 174 000 in 2009  as compiled by Bloomberg  This is more than just Wall Street s traditional cyclical moves  over hiring at the top  slashing too much at the bottom  It is indeed a permanent shrinking of the industry  An economist at Moody s predicted the Street wouldn t regain these jobs until 2023 So tell your kids that are in high school and about to go off to college to focus on engineering    The U K  s High Pay Commission has recommended that top executives be restricted to a basic salary plus a single performance element instead of three or four that are commonplace in order to halt the spiraling bonuses that are  corrosive  to the economy  and threaten to create the type of inequalities last seen in the Victorian era   as the Financial Times put it For example  John Varley  Barclay s top executive in 2010  earned 169 times the earnings of an average British worker  whereas in 1980 Barclays  top pay was just 13 times the average At BP   the boss earned 63 times the company s average  while the 1980 multiple was 16 5    Brian Groom FT   According to ComScore  online holiday shopping was up by 14  over last year in the first 20 days of November  The growth is owed to record numbers prowling the Internet on enhanced smartphones and tablet computers  even when they are in bricks and mortar stores  ComScore is expecting online sales to rise 15  for both November and December  In 2010  ecommerce grew by 12  over the previous year   What a mess  Kaja Whitehouse   New York Post  Folks who got stuck with bum checks from Jon Corzine s defunct brokerage firm MF Global are getting bounced a second time  This time  it s by the MF Global trustee s claims process   The  process  allows those with accounts to recover 60 percent of the  5 5 billion in MF s accounts frozen after it emerged that  1 2 billion  was missing from accounts that should have been segregated  and therefore safe  But folks who cashed out of their MF brokerage accounts leading up to the Wall Street firm s Halloween collapse   and received checks from MF for their account balance  only to see them bounce   are not addressed by the claims process  The Post has learned  Potentially hundreds of people with an estimated  50 million in claims are in this limbo   It was discovered this week that the shortfall in customer funds had doubled from previous estimates  Jon Corzine is slated to testify on Dec  15 before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  which might be the first time we finally see the guy  he having disappeared from sight  Maybe he s in Bimini   Further evidence of contagion from Europe as Australian banking officials say the sovereign debt crisis in the former is threatening to become a full fledged credit crisis impacting the Aussie housing market as banks stop lending to each other  Roughly a third of the funding for Australian mortgages comes from overseas bond markets  so that s a third of the big banks  sources of capital potentially drying up  which will lead to price drops  as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald   And further evidence of Ireland s housing crash  The Irish Independent used the example of a property in Dublin  where a father bought his ideal family home for 65 000 euro  The same three bedroom house was going for 380 000 when he first looked at it  The previous owner couldn t sell it during this time and finally went to auction The number of mortgages in arrears more than three months in Ireland has grown to 63 000 as of Sept  2011 from 26 200 at the end of Sept  2009  An Irish Central Bank study also found that four out of 10 households in mortgage arrears are actually behind by a year or more  As I told you from my last trip to Ireland in October  the anecdotal evidence I picked up is beyond scary  In all honesty  it s a topic I think of every day  knowing some of the folks in deep trouble  By the way  Canada is clamoring for Irish workers to fill needs in industries such as fisheries  mining  and oil and gas  Some 10 000 Irish have relocated to Canada in just the past two years  In turn  the Canadian government is increasing the quotas on work visas for the Irish    Sticking to the real estate theme  the Wall Street Journal reported that in my native New Jersey   100 000 homeowners are dealing with foreclosures that are stalled in court and another 48 000 are way behind on mortgage payments   This is going to be a drag on home prices for years to come  but  at the same time  these are people actually  saving  a ton of money and the impact on consumer spending cannot be discounted  Heck  I know a guy who hasn t made a mortgage payment in at least 18 months and he s spending at least as much as he always did  Part of the issue in his case is his mortgage kept being bounced around with all the bank mergers that took place during the peak of the crisis and with each merger  let alone the robo signing scandal  the clock on the foreclosure process and or workout would start anew   Automakers GM  Honda and Volkswagen expect China passenger car sales to rise as much as 10  next year  faster than China s current 6  pace for the first ten months of 2011  Well this kind of flies in the face of every other prediction on a slowing China due to the Euro crisis  The car folks  though  tout still extremely low ownership levels and rising incomes for their bullishness   According to the Labor Department  the jobless rate dropped in 36 states in October  while payrolls increased in 39  led by Illinois which added 30 000 jobs  and California with 25 700   Wisconsin lost 9 700  and New York  8 300     North Dakota continues to have the lowest unemployment rate  3 5   while Nevada still has the highest  13 4    Nokia Siemens Networks is cutting a whopping 17 000 employees worldwide as part of a massive restructuring to focus the telecom equipment maker on more profitable broadband operations  The 17 000 figure is almost a quarter of its 74 000 workforce   With the European Union in full crisis mode  I got a kick out of the European Parliament and Commission s request for a 5  hike in its budget next year  It had to settle for a 2  increase  They just don t get it The real problem  however  is that the EC has made financial commitments to its newer and poorer members that it may not be able to honor  such as farm subsidies and regional development funding   Ohhh Ca na daaa  I m packin  my bags for theeee You see  kids  Canada s debt to GDP ratio is but 35  vs  a Group of Seven average of 80   And the beer is all premium  Plus  in my case  I d become a hockey fan again after shunning the sport for about 15 years  And Tim Hortons is even better than Dunkin  Donuts  Only thing is you have to wear long underwear in Canada for up to 350 days a year   Oh to have been a shareholder of Pharmasset Inc   which was acquired by Gilead Sciences for  11 billion  or  137 in cash  this being a company with no products on the market and a stock that traded as low as  20 in the past year  But they have a pill in late stage testing that could be a treatment for hepatitis C  which analysts expect to become a bigger health problem due to the aging baby boomer population  seeing as it is spread by intravenous drug users  among other ways  and can take years to emerge once you have picked up the virus   Meg Whitman  Hewlett Packard s new CEO  had her first earnings report card and in the process lowered fiscal 2012 guidance to  4 per share vs   4 88 in the year just finished  Wall Street expectations were for  4 60  Whitman promised  No more surprises   but then said the company would no longer provide revenue guidance  just earnings  which was a surprise   People still send holiday cards  According to Hallmark  1 5 billion are mailed for Christmas  followed by Valentine s Day  144 million   Mother s Day  133 million  and Father s Day  94 million   It seems the greeting card industry has weathered the Internet storm and is making a comeback  Hallmark and American Greetings control 82  of the market  No word on Festivus sales   Shares in Groupon  the largest Internet daily deal site  closed the week at  16 75  or already below the IPO price of  20 on Nov  4  Of course anyone buying that first day paid substantially more than  20  like between  26 and  31  and is thus at a rather sizable loss already  Your editor said he wouldn t touch this one   We note the passing of legendary financier Ted Forstmann  He was 71  Forstmann was chairman of IMG Worldwide  the largest sports and entertainment management firm of its kind  but earned his fame and fortune as the founder of the modern leveraged buyout  or LBO  though what distinguished Forstmann was that he did his deals with as little debt as possible  blasting what would become a bubble in junk bond financed deals in the 1980s  Forstmann expressed his open contempt for Wall Street s hustlers at congressional hearings  telling the SEC that the investment banking heads of the day were like street walkers   They are the hookers who make  1 million a night  but pretty soon  what have you got  Eleven hookers  In Forstmann s fight with rival Henry Kravis over RJR Nabisco  Forstmann accurately predicted the junk bond debt would kill the company  coining the phrase  barbarians at the gate  Eventually  after making  15 billion in profits for his investors  he turned away from Wall Street and acquired IMG  which was struggling at the time  turning it back into a true powerhouse Forstmann was a big philanthropist  giving an estimated  440 million to help poor kids  and led the charge for school voucher programs in the 1990s   This story hit a week ago and I wasn t able to get it into the review  but 28 waiters at Smith   Wollensky  the Capital Grille and other New York area restaurants were charged with copying customers  credit cards and then passing them on to a crime ring  The crimes allegedly took place between April 2010 and this month and involved at least 50 American Express account holders  The crime ring bought luxury goods  including from Chanel  Bloomingdale s and Bergdorf Goodman  showing they had good tastes   So I get this envelope in the mail and it says  payment enclosed  and I m thinking  what s this  Found money  A relative I didn t know I had leaving me some funds for premium beer Nope  I received  53 86 for damages in a class action suit involving American Express and foreign transaction fees  So my extensive travel really paid off   My portfolio  I had dinner with my CFO friend of the China company in Fujian province  I m not expecting any miracles  though confident in what they are doing   I have no idea if their acquisition of the feedstock company for  13 million was a fair price or not  That would be a little arrogant of me to think I did     It s just all about the global  and China  economies  as well as the still dreadful sentiment towards China small caps  After the holidays I might hit the road with them for a day or two in the U S   depending on our schedules  I really can t say more at this time   Finally  a real Street Byte  the passing of Gregory Papalexis  the owner of the Sabrett hot dog trademark  He was 86 Ah yes  the Sabrett tube steak  Many was the day when I was starting out in the business world  working for an insurance brokerage firm in Manhattan  that I could only afford two Sabrett dogs for  2 at a local pushcart  They were are pretty nasty  but gotta hand it to Mr  Papalexis  who formed Marathon Enterprises in 1964 and acquired a number of competitors  including Sabrett Food Products later on  selling hot dogs and other items from a pushcart brand called House O  Weenies His daughter  a company executive   said her father gave great detail to the buns his company sold  insisting they be  light  airy and fluffy   His reasoning was simple  If customers filled up on the bun  they won t have room for a second hot dog  ,2011-11-29,Brian

   Slow infrastructure may mean not enough fuel cell car sales
   GS Yuasa could be partner for lithium ion batteries for EVs
   Dollar below 90 yen  too painful 
 By Chang Ran Kim and Yoshifumi Takemoto
 TOKYO  Oct 1  Reuters    Honda Motor is looking into
developing pure electric vehicles because slow progress in
setting up hydrogen fuelling stations could limit the sale of its
fuel cell vehicles  the head of Japan s No 2 automaker said 
 Honda has been a strong proponent of hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles as the most promising zero emission alternative to
today s combustion engine cars  dismissing plug in electric cars
as a short range option that uses too many expensive batteries 
 But in the strongest indication yet that Honda may be
changing its tune  Chief Executive Takanobu Ito said Honda may
need pure electric cars to meet California s regulations for
automakers to offer a certain ratio of zero emission cars in the
coming years 
  I don t doubt for a second that fuel cell vehicles are the
ultimate green car   Ito told Reuters in an interview on
Thursday  noting that such hydrogen fuelled vehicles achieved a
driving range similar to that of gasoline cars 
  But the infrastructure for hydrogen is moving slowly  and
there s a possibility we won t be able to get sufficient sales
volumes  in California   even if we tried  
 Ito stopped short of saying whether or when Honda would
actually launch a plug in electric vehicle  EV   Domestic rivals
Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co have announced plans to
offer EVs globally by 2012 
 If the need arose  Honda could work with battery partner GS
Yuasa Corp to develop lithium ion batteries for electric cars 
Ito said 
 Honda currently has a joint venture with GS Yuasa to produce
batteries specifically for hybrid vehicles  GS Yuasa has
separately partnered Mitsubishi Motors Corp and other Mitsubishi
firms for EV batteries 
 In the next 20 to 30 years  Ito said he expected virtually
all cars to be hybridised  while for the nearer  five  to 10 year
term  Honda would pour much of its efforts into improving fuel
economy on pure gasoline cars 
 Ito  who took his post in late June  said the remodelled Step
Wgn minivan  to be launched in Japan next week  was an example of
that  with a larger body but better mileage than its predecessor

sentiment in the United States fuelled concerns about how quickly
its economy will recover 
 Japan s economy grew 0 9 percent in April June from the

data showed before the start of trade

recession cannot be ruled out  especially if recovery is delayed
in the United States and other major economies 
  The headline figures were slightly weaker than expected but
the contents were not surprising   said Kyohei Morita  chief
economist at Barclays Capital Japan 
  But today s data was driven by stimulus steps in Japan and
overseas  and Japan s economy is far from self sustaining
growth  
 On Friday  the S P 500 Index fell 0 9 percent after data from
the Reuters University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers showed
consumer confidence fell more than expected in early August 
dropping to its lowest level since March

remains soft  denting hopes for a rebound that have fuelled the
rally in stocks

 HONG KONG  Aug 11  Reuters    Asian stocks struggled to eke
out gains on Tuesday as policymakers warned of lingering
economic uncertainty and data showed China s recovery may be
moderating 
 The yen climbed across the board and sterling hit a 13 year
low against the Aussie dollar  while oil topped  71 a barrel 
 Many Asian investors are pinning their hopes on China
leading a regional recovery as Western economies continue to
sputter  but Chinese data for July showed that although exports
rose from June  industrial output did not grow as much as
expected 
  This data argues for some moderation in growth in Q3
versus the big gains we saw in Q2  The recovery is still on
track  at least at the headline level   said Ben Simpfendorfer

 The Nikkei only managed a 0 6 percent gain  however  and
investors across the region were cautious as Japan  South Korea
and Singapore all indicated that the economic outlook was still
uncertain despite some signs of improvement 
 A firmer yen put pressure on shares of Japanese exporters 
pushing car giant Honda Motor down 2 8 percent 
 The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0 1

still in a difficult situation 
 South Korea s central bank also kept rates on hold  with
Governor Lee Seong tae saying it was still unclear the economy
was back on solid footing and warning that bond markets have
overpriced the chances of a rate rise 
 Lee s comments sparked a rally in government debt  pushing
five year treasury bond yields down 11 basis points to 4 88

economic data  notably against the Aussie and the New Zealand

 The market has begun to price in tightening by the Federal

although analysts are wary on the outlook

dollar at 50 9 UK pence in early Asian trade  after slumping in
overseas trade as investors fretted about the Bank of England s

deflationary pressures in the UK economy 
 The Aussie dollar is also benefiting from market
expectations for a rate hike before the end of the year

 NEW YORK  Aug 6  Reuters    Caution crept back into U S 
stock markets on Thursday a day ahead of the July unemployment
report and as a cautious outlook from technology bellwether
Cisco Systems cast a chill  but European shares rose on
soothing earnings results 
 A surprise move by the Bank of England to expand its bond
buying program by 50 billion pounds  a measure known as
quantitative easing  also supported European stocks  driving up
financial shares 
 The BoE s move  however  along with its decision to hold
interest rates at a record low 0 50 percent pushed down
sterling against the dollar by more than 1 percent 
 The dollar also rose off multi month lows against the euro
after the European Central Bank left its record low benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 1 0 percent 
 The stronger dollar contributed to losses in U S  crude oil
after it topped  72 a barrel  a one month high 
 A better than expected weekly U S  jobless claims report
pushed up stocks in early trade  but concerns about the July
jobs report ate away at investor resolve 
  Obviously  everyone looks at the employment number as

trepidation ahead of that report   said Todd Salamone  vice

likely to edge higher on Friday to try a 10 month high  with
carmakers such as Honda Motor Co strong  but gains will be
limited by nerves ahead of keenly awaited U S  jobs data 
 Wall Street slipped as investors turned cautious a day before
the July employment data and took profits in the wake of recent
strong gains  but Tokyo shares are likely to hold firm  analysts
said 
  Sentiment is fairly positive  with quarterly earnings having
been generally good and growing expectations that the next round
of earnings will be even better   said Nagayuki Yamagishi 
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities 
  But with the jobs data ahead of us it ll be difficult for
the Nikkei to break above 10 500 today  There s also a sense the
Nikkei has been overbought  
 Car and car parts makers are likely to extend gains on
growing expectations that the U S   cash for clunkers  sales
incentive will be extended 
 The U S  economy is expected to have lost 320 000 nonfarm
payroll jobs in July  a hefty number but still an improvement
over last month s drop of 467 000  while the unemployment rate is
expected to have risen to 9 6 percent 
 Analysts said the Nikkei s next targets are the
psychologically important 10 500 level  followed by 10 800 and
then 12 000    roughly where it was when U S  investment bank
Lehman Brothers collapsed last year 
 The benchmark Nikkei is likely to move between 10 250 and
10 500  analysts said  It closed at 10 388 09  a 10 month closing

 Honda  Japan s No 2 automaker  reported an unexpected profit

billion yen   491 million  boost from the financial services
business  which benefited partly from lower interest rates

the second half  than in the first   so that would result in a

 By Chang Ran Kim and Yoshifumi Takemoto
 TOKYO  Aug 5  Reuters    Honda Motor Co expects
improving sales to return its car business to profitability in
the second half even without the support of its robust financial
services division  a top executive said on Wednesday 
 Honda  Japan s No 2 automaker  posted an unexpected profit
for the April June first financial quarter last week thanks to a
46 8 billion yen   491 million  boost from its financial services
business  which benefited partly from lower interest rates 
  We re expecting to sell just short of 100 000 more cars in
the second half  than in the first   so that would result in a
profit   Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Hojo told Reuters in an
interview 
 Losses from a stronger yen assumed for the October March
second half would offset the absence of restructuring costs in
that period  but better vehicle sales would have a net positive
impact  he said 
 Last week Honda lifted its forecast for car sales in the
business year to next March by 85 000 vehicles to 3 295 million 
projecting better demand in Japan but weaker sales in Europe and
the United States  Globally  Honda is using about 80 percent of
its production capacity  Hojo said 
 Honda  also the world s top motorcycle maker  raised its
operating profit forecast to 70 billion yen from 10 billion yen 
 Honda now expects the overall U S  market to total 10 million
vehicles in 2009  down from its previous estimate of 10 5 million
despite an increasing likelihood that a  cash for clunkers  auto
sales incentive would be extended by another  2 billion 
  We just don t know how this is going to affect us  or how
long it will last   Hojo said  adding that the first  1 billion
in rebates mainly helped Ford Motor Co 
 Honda lowered its annual North American sales forecast by
50 000 to 1 30 million vehicles  without factoring in any sales
boost from the scrappage scheme 
 While the rebate programme could ultimately result in higher
U S  sales than Honda expects  Hojo said it could also negatively
affect profit margins if it forces manufacturers to offer their
own incentives to stay competitive 
 Honda now intends to spend about 30 billion yen   315
million  more in sales incentives in the United States than it
had planned three months ago  mainly to sell off 2009 model year
passenger cars such as the Civic and Accord 
 HONDAJETS TO BE DELAYED
 Government stimulus measures are also helping to mitigate a
freefall in Western European sales  but the outlook for demand is
still uncertain due to the economy s weakness  Hojo said 
 Separately  he said demand was similarly fragile in the
corporate jet business  leading to some cancellations recently
for Honda s first aircraft  the HondaJet light jet  Honda has
received orders for some 100 HondaJets to date  he said 
 The need to save on labour and other costs was also forcing
Honda to delay the timetable for delivery by one year to the end
of 2011  Hojo said

 TOKYO  July 29  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average edged
up 0 3 percent on Wednesday to a seven week closing high  buoyed
by high tech shares such as Tokyo Electron  but gains were capped
ahead of key company earnings 
 Nippon Steel fell 3 5 percent after the company said it swung
to a quarterly loss  widened its first half loss forecast by 10
percent  and said it would not pay a first half dividend 
 But trade was thin and investors were hesitant  after a
nine day rising streak was broken on Tuesday    the longest such
run in 21 years    and ahead of a slew of Japanese earnings this
week 
 Honda Motor and Nomura Holdings announced results after the
bell 
  There s over 700 companies still left to report earnings 
and when you add in a bit of fatigue after the recent winning
streak  people are reluctant to buy   said Noritsugu Hirakawa  a
strategist at Okasan Securities 
  Results in general have not been so bad  but in a lot of
cases this is a reflection of cost cutting  and that impact will
eventually wear off  The issue is whether there will be real
growth after this  and investors need to see this for
themselves  
Analysts said the downside was solid on buying by overseas
investors and some short covering  with buying of futures also
providing some support to the cash market 
 The benchmark Nikkei gained 25 98 points to 10 113 24  its
highest close since June 12  The broader Topix was flat at

 The Nikkei edged down 0 01 percent on Tuesday as investors
booked profits after it climbed 11 5 percent during a nine day
run to Monday  its longest stretch of gains since 1988 
  There are no real reasons to sell  but perhaps just a hint

 STEEL MIXED  HIGH TECH HEALTHY
Nippon Steel  the world s second biggest steelmaker  slipped
to 364 yen after its earnings came out 
 It widened its recurring loss forecast for the
April September first half by 10 billion yen to 110 billion yen 
but kept its full year outlook at nil  against a consensus
estimate of a 3 4 billion yen loss from 17 analysts polled by
Thomson Reuters 
 But rival JFE Holdings extended gains  jumping 4 2 percent
after it forecast a full year profit on Tuesday and after Goldman
Sachs raised its rating to  buy  from  sell  
 JFE  the world s fifth largest steelmaker  climbed to 3 700
yen after rising 7 percent on Tuesday on higher output and an
improved shipbuilding business 
 Its recurring loss for April June came to 67 3 billion yen 
compared with a profit of 112 10 billion yen a year earlier and
it forecast an annual recurring profit of 40 billion yen 
 High tech shares helped the Nikkei rise  with Advantest Corp 
a maker of chip testing equipment  up 3 3 percent to 1 982 yen 
Tokyo Electron rose 2 2 percent to 4 740 yen and Nikon Corp  a
maker of steppers  climbed 6 8 percent to 1 869 yen

expectations for a loss and lifted its forecast for the year 
  The fact that even in this tough situation they were able to
turn a profit shows that things are fundamentally pretty good  
said Hiroaki Osakabe  who termed the results a surprise 
 Nissan Notor Co posted an 86 percent fall in quarterly
operating profit  hit by a stronger yen and declining car sales

whether the gains were racing ahead of longer term economic
prospects 
 Japan s Nikkei share average posted its longest winning

Oil prices also climbed  rising to the highest since early
July  as investors took cues from equity markets

for an earnings recovery  while U S  equity futures rose 0 2

long oil s support would last 
  Oil s rally has again been supported by external factors 
such as positive macroeconomic data and rally in the equities
markets  and those factors  along with the U S  dollar  should
again set the tone for oil this week   said Toby Hassall  a
commodities analyst at Commodities Warrants Australia 
  But considering how actual demand in the U S is still
quite weak  I think there is a downside risk for oil prices  
 U S  oil for September delivery rose 1 percent to  68 75 a
barrel while Brent was up 1 1 percent to  71 07 
 The ICE Futures U S  dollar index lost ground as stocks in
Asia started to take off on Monday  It fell 0 2 percent 
closing in on a one month intraday low reached last Thursday 
 Though equity markets reflected few concerns among
investors about diving further into riskier assets  which
usually would weigh on the safe haven dollar  positioning may
be a factor preventing further short term weakness in the U S 
currency 
 Traders on the International Monetary Market doubled the
value of their net short term position to  16 6 billion in the
week to July 21 
 Such a quick buildup in bets against the dollar may mean
the market is vulnerable to bouts of profit taking 
 U S  Treasury yields ticked higher as stocks rose  The
benchmark yield on the 10 year note was at 3 69 percent having
bounced 37 basis points in the last two weeks as the global
equity rally accelerated 
 The market is expecting a record  115 billion in new supply
this week 
 Fear over the expected  2 trillion in supply this year
pushed up benchmark Treasury yields from historic lows in March
when the Federal Reserve announced its  300 billion Treasury
purchase program aimed at lowering interest rates and restoring
growth 
 Emerging market central banks and investors  so far  have
basically mopped up the new supply  keeping yields contained

   Banks advance  sector index up 130 percent since March low
   Energy shares track higher crude oil prices
 By Atul Prakash
 LONDON  July 27  Reuters    European share prices resumed
their upward march on Monday after retreating in the previous
session following nine straight days of gains  with soothing
earnings results boosting sentiment and helping banks and energy
shares 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0 8
percent at 914 53 points at 1111 GMT after touching 915 75  its
highest level since November last year 
 The benchmark  which slumped 45 percent in 2008 due to the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s 
has gained 41 percent since hitting a record low in early March 
 Financial shares were among the top gainers  with the DJ
STOXX European banking sector index rising 1 percent  giving a
rise of 130 percent from a low in March  Several other sectors
have also put on big gains  with the DJ STOXX basic resources
index advancing 85 percent in over four months and adding 1 4
percent on Monday 
 Lloyds  Royal Bank of Scotland  BNP Paribas  Societe
Generale and Credit Agricole were up 0 7 percent to 4 3 percent 
 Germany s Commerzbank jumped 6 percent after it  agreed to
sell the Swiss private banking unit of Dresdner Bank to
Liechtenstein based LGT Group 
 Analysts said that a slew of better than expected corporate
results revived hopes that the market has already seen its worst
phase and equities might be on a recovery path  but some experts
wanted to see more evidence 
  The second quarter is certainly not a disaster  On the
basis of what has been published so far we could still see the
market run up more but some doubts will certainly arise around
October when the third quarter results will be published   said
Luc Van Hecka  chief economist at KBC Securities 
  The market doesn t appear very cheap but don t forget that
earnings  assuming the economy is running at more or less normal
speed again  can easily go up 20 to 30 percent from the level
they are at right now  These multiples could again become quite
acceptable   he added 
 According to Thomson Reuters data  of the 184 companies in
the S P 500 that have reported earnings to date for the second
quarter of 2009  77 percent have reported earnings above
analysts  expectations 
 
 EYE ON ECONOMIC DATA
 Investors will keep an eye on more earnings results this
week from companies including Deutsche Bank  BP  Honeywell 
Verizon  Motorola  Exxon Mobil and Honda Motor 
  Corporate results this week will again be crucial  Although
the figures appear better or quite optimistic for some people 
what I am concerned about is sales figures are not so good  
said Justin Urquhart Stewart  director at Seven Investments 
  I think we need to be rather careful on how much further
this rally goes in the Western markets  
 Positive macroeconomic data also supported markets  with
German consumer sentiment at its highest level in over a year
going into August as easing inflation left shoppers more willing
to spend  according to the GfK market research group 
ID nLR190607
 The market awaited more figures later on Monday including
U S  new homes sales numbers  where the consensus forecast is
for a rise of 0 36 million  up from 0 342 million in May 
 Julius Baer  Switzerland s third biggest asset manager  also
helped in raising morale after it said first half outflows at
its GAM hedge funds arm slowed sharply as investor withdrawals

 Commodity shares tracked higher crude oil prices  which

   In talks with potential additional financial partners
 TOKYO  June 19  Reuters    Japan s Pioneer Corp said on
Friday it will delay issuing new shares to Honda Motor because it
is in talks with other potential additional financial partners 
 Pioneer  in its sixth straight year of annual loss  aims to
raise 40 billion yen   414 million  to shore up its financial
standing  and has also said it is preparing to apply for public
funds available to companies hit by the global financial crisis 
 The struggling maker of consumer electronics did not
elaborate on the talks  but it said Honda was still willing to
buy 2 5 billion yen worth of new shares 
 The issuance will be postponed to an unspecified time after
being originally scheduled for the end of this month 
 Honda agreed in April to buy the shares for 170 yen each in a
capital boost to help Pioneer focus on auto electronics 
 But Pioneer s shares have since risen along with a broad rise
in equities markets and they closed up 1 0 percent at 297 yen on
Friday 
 The April deal would have given Japan s second largest
automaker a 6 5 percent stake in Pioneer  making it the
second largest shareholder behind LCD TV and solar panel maker
Sharp Corp 
 Pioneer s home electronics operations have been hurt by
fierce competition with larger rivals such as Samsung
Electronics  and its car electronics division was hit by slumping
car sales amid the global financial crisis 
 Pioneer expects a net loss of 83 billion yen in the current
financial year to March 2010

  The Nikkei  as with other stock markets  is waiting for
signs about whether the recent rally has ended or whether it will
continue  
 Market players have said the market may be due for a breather
given the Nikkei s steep gains during its three month rally

eight month high on June 12  This may last until mid July  when

110458,331973,HMC,Nikkei likely to edge down as economic doubts reignited,news,"TOKYO  June 17  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average is
likely to edge lower on Wednesday after mixed U S  indicators
reignited doubts about how fast the recession is easing  with
exporters under pressure from a stronger yen 
 A rebound in U S  housing starts in May pointed to some
stabilisation in that sector  but industrial production fell 1 1
percent and capacity utilisation slumped to its lowest level on
records dating back to 1967 
 The benchmark Nikkei fell 2 9 percent on Tuesday for its
worst day in more than two months  and while market analysts said
further falls were likely there was little change in the overall
rebound trend 
  The economy is definitely improving    after all  the Nikkei
rose as far as 10 000 from just over 7 000 in March  which is
quite substantial   said Yoku Ihara  manager at the investment
information department of Retela Crea Securities 
  What we re seeing now is just the market taking a natural
break  
 Others noted that despite some worry about U S  indicators
and whether the recession is easing  financial institutions and
credit markets are in better shape than when global stock markets
slid to their lows earlier this year  and so no substantial falls
are expected 
 Market analysts said the Nikkei is expected to move between
9 600 and 9 800  with support from the 25 day moving average
around 9 560  It closed at 9 752 88 on Tuesday

 HONG KONG  June 16  Reuters    The U S  dollar slid on
Tuesday after Russia  before a meeting of the biggest emerging
market powers  said the world needs new reserve currencies 
while Asian stocks fell  as investors cut their holdings of
riskier assets and bought yen 
 A day after Russian finance minister Alexei Kudrin said the
dollar s status as the world s main reserve currency would
unlikely change in the near term  the country s president
called for new ones  confusing investors about Russia s
position 
 With volatility creeping higher and uncertainty rife 
investors as they did during the worst days of the financial
crisis  turned to the yen 
 Major European stocks opened slightly firmer  with the
pan European FTSEurofirst 300 gaining 0 27 percent 
 according to financial bookmakers  with dealers watching
resource related shares closely after oil briefly fell below
 70 a barrel  down for a third day after hitting the highest
since October last week 
 Japan s Nikkei share average closed 2 9 percent lower  the
biggest single day drop since March 30  led by a 4 percent
decline in shares of Honda Motor Co 
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell
1 8 percent  with losses in the energy and materials sectors
the biggest drag 
 Materials stocks have been driven by a rapid rise in metals
and other raw materials prices on hopes outperforming  large
economies such as China s would keep devouring commodities 
 Since the latest global equity rebound began on March 9 
the MSCI all country world index has risen 35 percent  but the
materials sector has gained about 49 percent 
 Hong Kong s Hang Seng index slid 2 8 percent 
Resource sensitive stocks were among the biggest drags on the
market  with Asia s largest oil and gas producer PetroChina
falling 4 2 percent

 The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index  better
known as the VIX  jumped 9 5 percent on Monday  the largest
single day rise since April 20 
 The index  which is based on prices of options on the S P
500  is used by global investors as a benchmark for risk
taking 
 The stronger indications of volatility ahead drove
investors to buy the yen  which was one of the biggest movers
in Asian trade  During the most violent days of the financial
crisis  the yen consistently strengthened  thanks to Japan s
relatively unscathed banking industry 
 The U S  dollar dropped 1 6 percent to 96 30 yen  while the
euro fell 1 1 percent to 133 45 yen 
 The euro rose 0 5 percent against the dollar to  1 3852
after earlier falling and testing a technical obstacle down
around  1 3750 
 The outlook for the euro darkened after an European Central
Bank report said euro zone banks may need to write down another
 283 billion  but equally potent were fears about how expensive
it would be for the U S  government to finance its growing
budget deficit 
  The themes of dollar debasement and a sick European
banking sector are powerful ones and depending on which theme
grows in intensity  the dollar could move decisively in either
direction  Right now  the mood is for downside in euro dollar

 Investors continued to find some value in late maturity
U S  Treasuries  The benchmark 10 year yield slipped to 3 70
percent from 3 73 percent late in New York on Monday 
 The 10 year yield is on its way to a fourth consecutive
decline after reaching 4 01 percent last Thursday  its highest
since mid October 
 Many debt securities  including mortgage loans  are

   Nippon Steel may cut output as Voestalpine trims outlook
 
  Adds Italy new car sales figures 
 By Jason Webb and Marcel Michelson
 MADRID PARIS  Feb 2  Reuters    Sales of new cars  for many
households the most expensive outlay after property  dropped
further in Asia and Europe in January as the savage downturn in
the industry left its mark on steelmakers on both continents 
 With consumers putting off big ticket buys  new car sales
fell by a fifth in Japan last month and South Korea s automakers
moved a third fewer cars 
 Sales also tumbled 41 6 percent in Spain  32 64 percent in
Italy and 8 percent in France 
 Consumers prefer to save their money because they fear for
their jobs and face tight credit markets 
 Many global carmakers have already cut production  idling
plants  laying off workers and delaying spending to cope with
weakening markets  Several have sought state aid to survive 
 As the crisis spreads to suppliers  Nippon Steel Corp said
it may cut its output further but would wait to see the output
plans of leading Japanese automakers for the April June quarter
before making any changes 
 Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine  which generated 25 percent
of its 2007 08 revenue from the auto sector  cut its 2008 09
forecast amid a  massive decline  in demand and said it could
not give an outlook for the following year 
 The decline in Spanish car sales left manufacturers there
desperately in need of aid similar to that announced in other
European countries  industry association ANFAC said on Monday 
 France s 7 9 percent January decline came after a 15 8
percent drop in December  auto industry body CCFA said  Sales of
French brands dropped 14 8 percent and took their combined
market share to 50 percent 
 In Italy  where the government has yet to come up with
incentives to encourage drivers to buy cars  sales tumbled 32 64
percent for the month 
 Fiat saw sales for its three main brands drop 31 3 percent 
leaving it with a 32 06 percent share of its home market 
 U S  data are also due later 
 Spain s rate of sales decline slowed from December s 49 9
percent drop  but in absolute terms  January s sales were
considerably worse than those of the preceding month as Spain s
recession mauled spending by heavily indebted consumers 
 ANFAC said government measures announced so far  including
loans for people who want to buy new cars to replace older  more
heavily polluting models  were insufficient 
  The industry urgently needs measures to boost demand     In
countries such as the United Kingdom and Sweden  which have
lower production than Spain  they have taken measures to support
the industry in the form of  loan  guarantees   ANFAC said 
 Spain s economy tipped into recession in the second half of
2008 and unemployment has almost doubled to nearly 14 percent 
 Automakers have announced a wave of job cuts in Spain  where
marques with factories include General Motors  Ford  Renault 
Nissan  PSA Peugeot Citroen and Volkswagen 
 
 U S  SALES SEEN DOWN
 The Dow Jones Stoxx auto index was down 1 52 percent  after
a fall of some 10 percent this year and a 45 percent slide in
2008 
 In an interview  Honda s chief financial officer Yoichi Hojo
said January sales in the United States  the world s biggest car
market  fell by a similar margin to a 35 percent drop in
December  and it would take several months to bring down high
inventory levels 
 Japan s No  2 automaker plans to operate its factories in
North America  Japan and Asia  excluding China  at just 60

110494,332009,HMC,TOPWRAP 1 Eyes turn to ECB  G20 for response to crisis,news,"  Eyes turn to ECB for rate cut  policy easing signs
   G20 leaders in London for key meeting
   Asia stocks rise on hopes U S  economy has bottomed out
   Glimmers of hope in U S   Asia data
 By David Ljunggren and Lesley Wroughton
 LONDON  April 2  Reuters    Sprinklings of positive data
suggested the first pieces of a recovery puzzle may be fitting
together for the global economy as investors looked to the
European Central Bank and the G20 summit for the next response
to the financial crisis 
 But the mood fell short of outright optimism  especially in
Europe where the leaders of the world s richest and biggest
developing economies were to meet on Thursday to address the
worst downturn since the 1930s amid signs of division between
the United States and a French and German bloc 
 The immediate focus in Europe was on whether the European
Central Bank  ECB  would cut interest rates again or if its
policymakers would follow U S  and British counterparts into
quantitative easing  effectively printimg more money to spur
economic growth 
 A Reuters poll of analysts found most saw the ECB cutting
its rates by another 50 basis points to a record low of 1 0
percent  hoping to draw funding into banks  and trimming its
overnight deposit rate by 25 points to just 0 25 percent 
 The quantitative easing argument was harder to pin down 
with a vast expansion of its balance sheet to buy government
bonds  harder to do in the 16 country euro zone than in a
single national context 
 Investors were keen to see what  if any  moves the ECB made
towards quantitative easing when its decision is announced at
1145 GMT  The euro inched up in quiet trade ahead of the ECB
and G20 meetings 
 As the G20 leaders gathered in London  there were plenty of
signs of how bad the global crisis had become  and growing
debate over whether the worst of the downturn has passed 
 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
said unemployment in the euro zone jumped 8 5 percent in
February and warned it could reach 12 percent in 2010 
 U S  private sector job losses also accelerated more than
expected in March  while in Japan a key survey on Wednesday
showed business confidence had hit an all time low in the
world s second largest economy 
 The International Monetary Fund predicted the global
economy could contract by between 0 5 percent and 1 percent
this year  but even then there was some glimmer of hope 
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss Kahn and the
Federal Reserve s Sandra Pianalto both saw signs of growth in
2010 
  I expect economic conditions to stabilize by the end of
the year and then begin to recover next year as the fiscal
stimulus boosts spending and as we work off excess
inventories   Pianalto  the Cleveland Fed president  said in a
speech in Ohio 
 BOTTOMED OUT 
 Data on Wednesday showed U S   euro zone and British
manufacturing had inched away from February s lows  even though
they remained negative 
 A U S  index of pending home sales rose more than expected 
and auto sales  while weak  were not as bad as expected  all of
which hinted at improvement 
  There are a few spots where we can have hope   said
Juergen Michels  an economist at Citigroup in London 
 Asian stocks climbed on hopes the U S  economy had bottomed
out  If recession weary U S  consumers and companies do not
start spending again  a global recovery is unlikely 
 Japan s Nikkei share average rose 3 percent  driven up by a
5 percent rise in top bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group on
growing signs that the global financial system is stabilising 
 Asian stocks outside Japan were up for a third straight
day  rising 3 6 percent 
 Hopes for an orderly end to U S  automaker General Motors 
troubles also pushed up Asian rivals  Honda Motor Co shares
rose 9 percent and Hyundai Motor was up 5 percent 
 While the news about GM and smaller rival Chrysler has been
almost universally bleak since U S  President Barack Obama
rejected their restructuring plans on Monday  U S  auto sales
in March contained a glimmer of hope 
 Although down 37 percent in March  their 17th straight
month of declines  sales in the world s largest car market had
at least not been as bad as expected 
 There were also positive signs in Australia  where
resilient resources exports helped to more than double the
trade surplus in February to A 2 11 billion in   1 5 billion  
  The basic stuff that Australia exports is perhaps not as
vulnerable as the sort of discretionary goods like cars and
computers that Japan or Korea produces   said Brian Redican  a
senior economist at Macquarie 
 South Korea provided another piece in the recovery puzzle 
Exports and factory production figures raised hopes the economy
was approaching bottom  although a senior finance ministry
official said there were no plans to change its forecast for
the economy to shrink 2 percent this year 
 South Korea s foreign reserves also rose in March by the
biggest amount in three years because of the U S  dollar s
global weakness  the central bank said 
 Obama said on the eve of the G20 summit there was  enormous
consensus  among leaders on their approach to the crisis
despite a combative tone set by French President Nicolas
Sarkozy  who said he would not back  false compromises  
 Obama wants governments to pump more money into economic
stimulus programmes in order to turn things around  while
France and Germany fear this will distract from the need to
regulate financial markets which brought on the crisis more
tightly

110498,332013,HMC,ANALYSIS Worry  but no panic as Japanese brace for GM s fate,news,"  Japanese automakers  concerns wane in last few months
   U S  govt support for suppliers eases some burden
   Main worry is impact on U S  economy  car demand
   Silver lining as slimmer GM leaves more share for rivals
 By Chang Ran Kim  Asia autos correspondent
 TOKYO  May 26  Reuters    As General Motors Corp creeps
towards bankruptcy  Japanese auto executives have grown less
worried about the turmoil in the supply chain and dealer
channels the demise of the No  1 U S  car maker would cause 
 Just six months ago  the prospect of a Chapter 11 filing in
Detroit had many rival automakers quaking in their boots on
fears it would drag crucial parts makers into bankruptcy and
further damage a battered U S  economy 
 But Chrysler s April 30 filing came and went without much
of a hitch  and Japanese automakers  which sell two out of five
cars in the United States  appear better prepared now for what
has become an increasingly likely bankruptcy at GM as well 
  It s not ideal  of course   Honda Motor Co CEO Takeo Fukui
said 
  There would be less damage to the market if  GM  could
continue its business outside a bankruptcy  but I also wonder
whether the market could get any worse than it already is   he
told Reuters recently 
 GM faces a government imposed June 1 deadline to
restructure its debt and operations  but is widely expected to
fail to get enough bondholders to agree to a debt swap that it
sees as key to surviving  GM has said a rejection    likely to
come on Wednesday    could force a Chapter 11 filing 
 Analysts and executives said the U S  government s pledge
in March to extend  5 billion in aid to affected suppliers had
eased some concern over a sudden stoppage of parts production 
  That s the biggest point of focus    the supplier body  
said Carlos Ghosn  head of Nissan Motor Co 
  Because everybody today is being prepared for this  GM s
bankruptcy  eventuality   I think a lot of preparation has been
made at the level of many suppliers to avoid any dramatic
consequence on the rest of the industry   he added 
 Automakers have also taken preemptive steps to avoid a
supply disruption  including by stocking extra components or
readying other channels of procurement 
 Honda said it is buying more molds from suppliers it deems
shaky so it can take the equipment elsewhere and have the
components built there  if it came to that 
  There are two scenarios under which you become unable to
procure parts  a bankruptcy or a natural disaster  In the
United States  the former is more common  so we ve been doing
this for a while now   said Honda Chief Financial Officer
Yoichi Hojo 
 SILVER LINING
 To be sure  these are costs that Japanese automakers   
already hurt by a strengthening yen and sinking global car
demand    could do without 
 But analysts said the silver lining was a bigger slice of
the U S  market down the line if GM succeeds in re emerging
with just four core brands    Chevrolet  Cadillac  Buick and
GMC 
  In the short term  there s going to be some turmoil  But
within two or three years  the U S  market will probably come
back and then there will be opportunities for Japanese
automakers   said Mitsuru Kurokawa  senior analyst at IHS
Global Insight 
  That s especially true because GM s Saturn brand will go 
and that brand was created specifically to challenge the
Japanese   he added 
 LIFE AFTER CHAPTER 11
 The biggest worry remains the indirect consequence of a GM
bankruptcy on the U S  economy  jobs  and ultimately  consumer
appetite to buy cars 
  Whatever happens to GM  the impact on the overall  U S  
economy is going to be huge and it s going to hurt demand  
Fuji Heavy Industries CEO Ikuo Mori said 
 Already  sales have fallen 37 percent so far this year 
unseating the United States as the world s biggest auto market
in favour of China 
 Still others saw light at the end of the Chapter 11 tunnel 
predicting ongoing ventures and relationships between
themselves and GM  in some form 
  It s not like they re suddenly going to stop building cars
and become real estate brokers   said Osamu Suzuki  CEO of
Suzuki Motor Corp  Suzuki has more than 10 joint projects with
GM  including Suzuki s supply of GM s European brand  Opel 
  I intend to carry on our various projects

 TOKYO  Dec 10  Reuters    The Nikkei average rose 0 3 percent
on Wednesday  helped by gains for exporters such as Tokyo
Electron as the yen softened  while investors found some comfort
in machinery orders data that was not as bad as feared 
 Sony Corp slipped more than 2 percent after the company said
it will cut 16 000 jobs  curb investment and pull out of some
businesses to save  1 1 billion a year as the financial crisis
ravages demand for its electronics products 
 The job cuts are the biggest announced by an Asian firm so
far in the crisis 
 However  Yoshinori Nagano  a chief strategist at Daiwa Asset
Management  said investors were buying recently sold off shares
and selling those that had been rising on expectations of global
stimulus efforts  rather than reacting to specific news 
  The machinery data also provided some relief as it was in
line with forecasts  though it wouldn t have been a surprise even
if it posted a two digit fall considering economic activities
almost stalled in September November after Lehman s failure  
 The benchmark Nikkei added 21 24 points to 8 417 11  after
opening slightly lower  The broader Topix was flat at 817 69 
 Japan s core machinery orders fell a bigger than expected 4 4
percent in October  underlining weakness in corporate capital
spending as the economy slides deeper into recession 
 In New York on Tuesday  the dollar shed 0 8 percent to 92 11
yen  above a session trough of 91 94 yen  Reuters data showed  It
was trading around 92 50 yen on Wednesday  giving a little relief
to Japanese exporters who repatriate profits 
 Shares of Tokyo Electron shot up 5 9 percent to 2 590 yen 
while Honda Motor Co added 2 9 percent to 1 898 yen 
 Takahiko Murai  general manager of equities at Nozomi
Securities  said he expects to see other companies follow suit
after Sony s restructuring plans 
  The news made investors reaffirm the dire outlooks for
corporate earnings  underscoring Japan s biggest problem  which
is the country depends on overseas demand for growth   he said

110512,332027,HMC,UPDATE 1 Thai govt cuts growth forecasts as crisis bites,news," Adds forecasts 
 By Trisanat Kongkhunthian
 BANGKOK  Dec 24  Reuters    Thailand s export driven
economy will shrink in the fourth quarter and barely grow in
2009  mainly due to a global economic slowdown that is likely
to get worse next year  the government said on Wednesday 
 The country s new finance minister  Korn Chatikavanij  told
reporters this year s growth was set to come in at 3 percent
and projected 2009 growth at between zero and 2 percent  the
worst in a decade 
 The ministry said the economy could contract in the first
quarter of 2009 as well  which would add Thailand to a growing
list of countries in recession  commonly defined as two
consecutive quarters of declining economic output 
 Analysts polled by Reuters two weeks ago projected growth
of 2 8 percent in 2009  down from 4 5 percent this year and 4 9
percent in 2007   ID nBKK388713  
 The double blow from the global slowdown and blockade of
Bangkok s airports by anti government protesters during the
peak tourist season has many economists drawing comparisons to
the 1997 98 Asian crisis when the Thai economy shrank 10 5
percent 
 Earlier this week  the Commerce Ministry said exports fell
18 6 percent from a year earlier in November  the first monthly
drop since 2002  due to falling global demand for the country s
goods and the crippling eight day airport blockade 
 Multinational companies that use Thailand as a base for
exporting everything from electronics to cars are making near
daily announcements of job or production cuts 
 On Wednesday  Japan s Honda Motor Co said it will
temporarily suspend 700 contract workers at its new plant in
Thailand next month due to a sharp drop in car sales

 In its latest update on the Thai economy  the Finance
Ministry said it had worsened considerably since September when
the ministry forecast 5 1 percent growth for 2008 
  The economy has performed much worse than expected  
Somchai Sajjapong  chief of the Finance Ministry s Fiscal
Policy Office  told a news conference to announce its revised
growth forecast of 3 percent for this year 
 He said the economy would likely shrink by 2 3 percent in
the fourth quarter and could contract further in the first
three months of next year 
  The global slowdown has had a clear impact on Thailand 
judging from the sharp drop in exports which account for 50 60
percent of GDP   he said 
 Somchai also blamed Thailand s intractable political crisis
which has seen five prime ministers in just over two years and
paralysed government policymaking 
 The shaky multi party coalition government led by Prime
Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has made reviving the economy its
top priority  but analysts say he has little room to manoeuvre 
 Details of a 200 billion baht   5 8 billion  stimulus
package will be announced after Abhisit s maiden speech to
parliament on Dec  29 and will likely be implemented early next
year 
 Korn gave a preview of the package of Wednesday  saying it
would include tax breaks to spur the property market 
  The government needs to boost demand for property because
this sector is crucial for several businesses such as building
and materials  We have to do it quickly   Korn told reporters

 The dollar fell to a 13 year low near 90 90 yen in late
October  as worries of a global recession triggered the unwinding
of carry trades  which use low yielding currencies to buy
higher yielding currencies and assets 
 The dollar stood at around 97 80 yen on Thursday 
 The stronger yen  which erodes the value of earnings made
overseas  has prompted most Japanese automakers to lower their
profit forecasts for the business year ending in March 
 Honda  Japan s No 2 automaker  cut its annual operating
profit forecast to 550 billion yen from 630 billion yen for this
year  but that is based on average dollar and euro rates of 100
yen and 135 yen for the second half    more favourable than
current levels
