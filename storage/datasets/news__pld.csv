14694,236209,PLD,This CEF Soared 51 9  In 2019  Time To Sell ,opinion,"If you ve been holding the Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  RQI  a fund I wrote about a lot in 2019 you ve done very well indeed  RQI has dominated  with its market price return surging 51 9   including gains and dividends  since the start of 2019 
So today we re going to take a closer look at this superstar fund to see what lies ahead  and whether it s still worthy of your cash  even with its big 2019 gains 

If you re not familiar with RQI  it owns   such as cell tower owners Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI  and American Tower  NYSE AMT   warehouse landlord  Prologis   NYSE PLD  and data center REIT Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX  
To be sure  there are downsides to putting cash in RQI now  such as a dividend yield that s been whittled down as the fund s price has risen  RQI yields 6 5  today  behind the 7 1  average for all REIT funds and well below the 9 3  this fund yielded at the start of 2019 
What s more  with a 50   return under its belt  it s fair to wonder if RQI can deliver another big gain in 2020 or if it might give some of its 2019 win back 
Top Notch Management Team Wins Again
Before we get into what might lie ahead for this superstar REIT fund  let s talk about RQI s wonderful 2019 
The big market price rise is just part of the story  We also need to look at the fund s total NAV return  or the performance of its underlying portfolio  including dividends  for 2019  because that tells us how RQI s fund managers performed with their picks  Did this beat the index  and does it come close to RQI s market returns 
On the first issue  there s just no question 
RQI s Picks Crush the REIT Sector







With a 34  total NAV return  RQI s managers easily beat the broader REIT market  tracked above by the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF  NYSE RWR   which itself actually underperformed the S P 500  a rarity  as REITs tend to outperform the broader stock market   That RQI both beat the REIT index fund and the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  is a testament to how good RQI s managers are  and how well they ve leveraged their skills into a great return 






RQI s return has also trounced the REIT CEF competition  although it s less impressive  compared to its performance versus the index  on this front 
As I ve written before  REITs are the kind of market where an active manager with an in depth knowledge of real estate can easily crush an index fund like RWR  which uses an algorithm to make selections  As a result  all of the well managed REIT CEFs have posted average returns above the index by a wide margin  yet RQI has beaten them all by a fair bit 
There s just one problem  as you can see from the bars on the right side of the chart above  investors have amply rewarded RQI for its huge returns  As a result  RQI s premium to NAV is near a 10 year high 
A Sudden Premium Appears






RQI consistently traded at a discount over the last decade until earlier in 2019  although its premium briefly disappeared as investors balked at this sudden change of fortune  If RQI s performance dips in 2020  they could balk again 
REITs in 2020  A Look Ahead
Of course  whether RQI s performance dips in 2020 or not depends a lot on what happens to REITs as a whole 
REITs  Solid 2019






As you can see above  even though RWR slightly underperformed the S P 500 in 2019  it still posted a very strong return  You can also see that this huge return is an extreme outlier  which would seem to make a reversion to the mean more likely in 2020 
But there s a big catch  there was a very good reason for 2019 s tremendous return  and it s something we should consider  as well  the Federal Reserve 
At the end of 2018  REITs were particularly hard hit by the Fed s continued interest rate hikes  which went far beyond the market s expectations and hurt many REITs  as investors worried this would raise their borrowing costs 
As a result  they overreacted to the downside  creating a real opportunity to snap up REITs at great prices when the Fed reversed course and said it would start cutting rates  Several cuts later  and REITs have returned to their long term trend of about 7  to 8  annualized returns 
If the Fed doesn t cut rates further in 2020  or cuts just once  like the market expects  then we could see an in line trend of about 7  or 8  gains for REITs as a whole   And I expect the discounted REIT CEFs in our  to do even better than that   If RQI s NAV returns beat that  expect investors to stay pretty happy  and for RQI s market price to follow along those lines 
4 Picks to Beat RQI in 2020  and pay you 35  more income  too  
So what s the bottom line  Simple  RQI is a good pick if you want to match the market in 2020  Heck  you might even beat it by a little bit 
But we can do better with the 4 CEF picks I have   These funds yield far more than RQI right now an outsized 8 4  dividend  on average and trade at much bigger discounts  too 
How big 
I m forecasting 20   price upside from each of these rock solid picks in 2020  That s in addition to their huge 8 4  dividends 
So you could be looking at a 30  total return in just one year here 
And because you re diversifying across 4 funds here  which hold REITs  bonds  US and overseas stocks   you re getting an extra margin of safety compared to an all in wager on RQI  thanks to the diversification in this 4 fund  mini portfolio  
That  plus these funds  wide discounts  nicely position you for big gains if 2020 is another boom year and help shield your nest egg if the market takes a header

14696,236211,PLD,Key Factors To Impact Prologis  PLD  This Earnings Season,opinion,Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD   is slated to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings on Jan 22  before the opening bell  The company s quarterly performance is likely to reflect growth in both revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this industrial real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 4 3  in terms of FFO per share  The company witnessed rent growth in the quarter  but period end occupancy moderated slightly as the company prioritized rent over occupancy Over the preceding four quarters  Prologis surpassed the FFO per share estimates on all occasions  the average beat being 2 07   This is depicted in the graph below Prologis  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   For full year 2019  Prologis guided core FFO per share in the range of  3 30  3 32  year end occupancy at 96 5 97 0   and same store net operating income  NOI    cash  Prologis share  of 4 75 5 0  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter FFO per share is 84 cents and for the full year is  3 30 Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate asset category has grabbed headlines and continues to play a pivotal role in a rising e commerce market  transforming the way how consumers shop and receive their goods  Sophisticated technologies are now being employed by Industrial REITs at their logistics centers for achieving efficiency in trans shipment and delivery process Services like same day delivery are gaining traction and last mile properties in high income urban areas are witnessing solid pricing  occupancy and growth in rentals  Furthermore  demand for distribution space has been rising  as e commerce continues to expand to sectors like grocery and furniture  Also  apart from e retail  companies are making strategic moves to improve their supply chain efficiencies  propelling demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks Per a  from Newmark Knight Frank  the robust demand has continued to push pricing higher  while the vacancy rate hovers near the cyclical low  Particularly  at fourth quarter 2019  average industrial asking rent across the U S  measured  7 41 per square feet  denoting 4 5  year over year as well as the highest quarterly average recorded this cycle  Vacancy rate too remains low at 5 2  at the end of 2019  however  expanded 10 basis points from the prior quarter and 30 basis points  year on year  Nevertheless  vacancy has been very tight in a number of key markets As for Prologis  the company is well poised to benefit from its capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in fill locations  Its large number of build to suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of its land bank  as well as demand from multi site customers  many of whom are focused on e commerce In the to be reported quarter  the company is likely to have continued to prioritize rent over occupancy  Therefore  rent growth is likely to have been comparatively remarkable  Though any robust occupancy growth is unlikely  the level is still expected to be high   Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter revenues is currently pegged at nearly  726 7 million   indicating 7  increase from the prior year quarter s reported tally   which is encouraging Prologis is also actively banking on its growth opportunities through opportunistic acquisitions and developments  This apart  Prologis has decent balance sheet strength to back its growth endeavors  Being a market leader  the company has the ability to raise capital at favorable rates Particularly  the fourth quarter was notable in terms of announcement of acquisition deals  In October  the company announced the acquisition deal of Liberty Property Trust   NYSE LPT   in an all stock transaction  valued at  12 6 billion  including the assumption of debt  The acquisition  which is anticipated to close in the current quarter  will cement Prologis  presence in target regions such as Chicago  Lehigh Valley  New Jersey  Houston  Central PA  and Southern  NYSE SO  California  Moreover  this industrial REIT opted for expansion of its development venture in China  The company raised its development capacity to more than  3 5 billion Nonetheless  recovery in the industrial market has continued for long and a whole lot of new buildings are becoming available in the market  leading to higher supply  Also  there have been concerns about the global economy and the trade war with China Amid these  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the December end quarter remained unchanged at 84 cents  over the past 30 days  Nevertheless  the figure denotes a projected year over year increase of around 5  For the full year  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share marginally moved south to  3 30 over the past month  Nevertheless  the figure indicates an 8 9  increase year on year Here is what our quantitative model predicts Prologis does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive

169618,391134,PLD,Prologis Just Built the Warehouse of the Future,news,"Real estate investment trust  REIT  Prologis  NYSE PLD  owns warehouses  If you aren t familiar with the industry  that might sound pretty boring  but it s anything but  In fact  the growth in online shopping has turned warehouses into a hot commodity  The thing is  owning big empty boxes isn t the wave of the future  and that s why Prologis  long a leader in the warehouse sector  has built what you might call the warehouse of the future in Seattle  Here s why this project is important to Prologis  the warehouse industry  and the growth of e commerce    and why you should take the opportunity here with a grain of salt   
The point of a warehouse
Simply put  a warehouse is nothing more than a place to store lots of stuff before it gets sent on to customers  These buildings are a vital link in the supply chain that allow companies to properly serve their end markets  both individual customers and businesses  Although simplistically speaking they are just large structures with ample interior space  there is a lot more going on here than meets the eye  

For example  one of the key strengths at Prologis is its global diversification  It has around 3 800 assets spread across 19 countries serving more than 5 000 customers  Thus  the company can serve one customer s needs in multiple areas around the world  Moreover  it is focused on the highest demand markets  where supply is typically constrained  Rent growth in such markets  as you might expect  tends to be on the high side relative to markets that have ample supply  The REIT expects factors like these to support funds from operations growth of 8  to 9  a year through 2022  As Prologis looks to support that future  it is hoping to exploit what the company calls  last touch  assets     
A  last touch  property is basically one in a densely populated area that facilitates rapid delivery  Such properties support Amazon s aggressive push for speed  two day and same day delivery   which its peers have had little choice but to emulate  A leader in the warehouse space  Prologis is one of the biggest players in the  last touch  market   
The warehouse of the future 
Delivering a product within one day means that the product has to be located very close to a customer  In large population centers  where the most concentrated demand is going to be  it can be hard to find affordable property for any type of building  let alone a big box to store stuff  This is problem number one  
However  once you ve actually identified a location  you come upon problem number two    the old warehouse model doesn t work so well in densely populated areas  The typical warehouse is a massive one level structure with a huge array of shipping docks and parking areas  That s just not practical in a city  
That s why Prologis  Georgetown Crossroads asset in Seattle is so interesting and  perhaps  revolutionary  Located just outside downtown Seattle  one of the largest cities in the United States  this warehouse breaks the domestic mold  For example  the REIT claims that the asset is within five minutes of Seattle and 15 minutes of nearby Bellevue  It is near three major highways and five minutes from a local port  It s also near two airports and major ground transportation hubs  So the location is great  but the big difference here is that Georgetown Crossroads is a three story structure    
Arguably  with great locations hard to find in space constrained markets  the only option for expansion is to build up  Levels one and two at the property are both typical warehouse structures  only they are built on top of each other  That allows Prologis to materially increase the square footage of the facility without expanding the footprint  The third floor adds space that can be used for offices or light industrial work and is easily accessible from the lower levels via elevators and a small loading area  The building is basically two warehouses on top of each other and then topped off with an office industrial building on the roof    

Data source  Prologis 
To be fair  this isn t a first of its kind asset  Countries like Japan and Singapore have had multilevel warehouse properties for years  But Prologis  Georgetown facility is the first of its kind in the United States  If the asset performs as Prologis expects  there will likely be more such buildings in the future for the company and  perhaps  for the entire warehouse industry  On that score  Amazon has reportedly agreed to lease out 500 000 square feet  with Home Depot taking nearly 100 000 square feet  which would mean that the nearly 600 000 square foot facility is already fully occupied     
So far this looks like a win for Prologis  But there are risks to consider  For example  property prices in dense cities tend to be high  That increases the cost of a project  Building a multistory warehouse is logistically more difficult than building a single story structure  That increases costs on both the construction and design sides  To put some numbers on this  according to The Wall Street Journal  Prologis paid around  260 per square foot to build Georgetown Crossroads  versus costs of around  125 per square foot for more traditional single story structures in the same general area    
Basically  rent will need to be relatively high compared to more traditional warehouse properties to support a building like this one  And that will put pressure on the profitability of Prologis  lessees  Realistically  there are only so many markets in the United States that can support such facilities  so the big picture opportunity here may not be all that large  And  interestingly  some companies inside the shipping industry believe that being so close to an end market isn t actually that important  
For example  industry watcher FreightWaves reported in 2018 that an executive at shipping and logistics company C H  Robinson Worldwide has suggested that the  last touch  idea is  in fact  overrated  According to this executive  fulfillment in such markets can be handled quickly enough out of more traditional warehouse facilities located an hour or two away  Truthfully  that just sounds like common sense and a far more cost effective way to operate  This view hints that there may be just a small number of customers willing to spend the money to occupy a multilevel  last touch  asset like Georgetown    
Watch the  last touch 
Prologis seems to have scored a big win with its three story warehouse in Seattle  That said  investors should keep a close eye on what happens from here at the REIT and within the warehouse industry  Prologis is planning to focus heavily on the  last touch  niche  and it wouldn t be surprising to see more multilevel warehouses in its future  The problem is finding the right markets where the costs are worthwhile for Proglogis and its customers  That may not be as easy as it sounds  And if other warehouse owners jump into the multilevel warehouse space  too  it could even put downward pressure on rents for these types of assets  Although this is just one piece of a much bigger puzzle  Prologis shareholders should monitor the Georgetown property and ensure that the REIT doesn t push the multistory warehouse idea too far as it looks to capitalize on the still emerging  last touch  concept ",2020-01-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pditx,2052384

outlook  and also with us today    for today s call are Hamid Moghadam  Gary Anderson  Chris Caton  Mike Curless  Colleen McKeown  Ed Nekritz and Gene Reilly With that  I ll turn the call over to Tom  We ll get started Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Tracy  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today  The fourth quarter closed out another excellent year  Core FFO was  0 84 per share for the quarter   3 31 per share for the year  The full year includes a record for net promotes of  0 18 per share  Core FFO excluding promotes grew 10  for the year and was more than 2  above our initial guidance As we enter 2020  market conditions are very good and we ve seen no meaningful impact on our business from trade or retailer bankruptcies  Supply chains are increasingly mission critical to our customers  businesses  which is generating demand as they undergo structural changes to deliver high service levels  We see increased requirements  across markets and product categories as more customers seek to strengthen their fulfillment capabilities  Our proprietary customer metrics reflect healthy activity showings deal gestation and conversion rates are consistent with the third quarter US market fundamentals remain excellent  I d like to share Prologis  assessment of supply and demand as data providers use a variety of methodologies  resulting in a range of estimates  Completions in 2019 were 275 million square feet  flat compared with 2018  higher replacement cost  land scarcity  the elongated permitting remain governors to supply  Net absorption was 240 million square feet  but limited by historic low market vacancy  which ended the year at 4 6   up 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points from last year  Market rents in our US portfolio increased by 8  in 2019 We have no new additions to our watch list this quarter  but here us some color on two markets that remain on the list  In Houston  while demand is strong vacancy is 6 7  and expected to remain elevated  which will constrain near term rent growth  We have a low roll in the IPT and LPT Houston portfolios in 2020  Our near term outlook for Pennsylvania is more positive  specifically core Lehigh Valley  where demand has accelerated  the supply pipeline has decreased and vacancy declined 140 basis points to 3 2  at year end In Europe  activity remains healthy  Rent growth on the continent in 2019 was more than 6   the highest on record  Fundamentals in Japan continue to improve  with vacancy in Tokyo and Osaka at their lowest points in five years and rent growth is accelerating Turning to operations for the quarter  We leased nearly 38 million square feet  with an average term of 73 month  Quarter end occupancy was flat sequentially at 96 5   while the US ticked down 30 basis points as our team is focused on pushing rate and term  Rent change on rollover was just under 30  and led by the US at 34   Our share of cash same store NOI growth was 4 6  and was impacted by a 60 basis point reduction in average occupancy  again consistent with our strategy to maximize long term lease economics  Globally  our in place to market rent spread increased once again and is now over 15 5  or more than  450 million in annual NOI Moving to strategic capital  2019 was a record breaking year  We raised  6 5 billion of equity from 75 new and existing investors and grew our third party AUM to  38 billion  Our strategic capital business delivers a durable revenue stream with 90  of fees coming from long term or perpetual vehicles  a critical differentiator that is often overlooked and undervalued For deployment  we had a record year for development starts and stabilization  We started  2 9 billion in new projects  43  of which were build to suits  Stabilizations were  2 5 billion  with an estimated margin of 37  and value creation of  911 million  Additionally  we realized  468 million in development gains in 2019 We continue to have significant investment capacity to self fund our run rate deployment for the foreseeable future  With over  11 billion of liquidity and potential fund sell downs as well as an incremental  4 5 billion of third party investment capacity in our ventures today For 2020  Given we just held our Investor Forum in November  our guidance remains consistent and includes the acquisition of IPT  which closed on January 8 and Liberty  which we expect to close on February 4  Here are the highlights on our share basis  but for complete detail refer to page 5 of our supplemental  Our cash same store NOI growth range is unchanged at 4 25  to 5 25   And I d like to highlight two points  first  we are increasing our 2020 global market rent forecast by 120 basis points to 4 8   This increase will have a minimal impact on same store this year  given our lease expirations  but importantly will increase our mark to market and future NOI growth  And second  the first quarter of 2020 will be up against the tough comp from Q1 of 2019  which benefited from 80 basis point occupancy uplift  As a result  we expect same store NOI growth to be lower in the first quarter  but then accelerate in the back half of the year  For strategic capital  we expect revenue  excluding promotes of  350 million to  360 million and net promote income of  115 million The IPT integration is largely complete and the Liberty closing preparations are on track  We are confident about hitting our Liberty synergy targets on day one  For dispositions  we now expect a range of  1 3 billion to  1 5 billion  which includes approximately  1 billion of sales from the IPT and Liberty portfolios When we announced the IPT and Liberty acquisition  we identified approximately  3 8 billion of combined non strategic sales on share basis  Of this balance   350 million has already closed or is under contract  And with the sale of an additional  1 billion in 2020  we will have approximately  2 4 billion dollars of non strategic assets remaining at the end of the year  representing just 2  of our asset base  These are good assets  we will work through these portfolios in due time and we don t see a need to hurry  Given our low leverage at 18   we will dispose of the non strategic assets at a pace that allows us to match sales proceeds with deployment opportunities For net G A  we re forecasting a range between  275 million and  285 million  which includes  6 million to  8 million of one time transition and wind down costs related to Liberty  Excluding these costs annual G A growth at the midpoint of 2 4  while managing 15  more real estate  We expect 2020 core FFO to range between  3 67 and  3 75 per share  including  0 15 of net promote income  Year over year growth  excluding promotes is approximately 14  at the midpoint To wrap up  we expect 2020 to be another exceptional year of growth  We look forward to adding Liberty s high quality assets to our portfolio and welcoming 35 of their employees to the Prologis team With that  I ll turn it back to Julianne for your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Jeremy Metz from BMO  Your line is open Jeremy Metz    BMO    AnalystHey  good morning  Just in terms of the    the rent side of the house  you obviously continue to see very healthy spread I think you had previously indicated some of the second half uplift was going to come from a higher percentage of coastal leases rolling here in the US  And so as you look at the US here in 2020  is there anything notable in terms of geographic breakdown or just box size break down that s creating maybe an outsized opportunity from a rent side and from the increase to the global mark to market  the 120 basis points that you mentioned  Tom  how much of that is US  Indecipherable  you driven  Thanks Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerI ll take the second part of that Jeremy  the increase    the majority of the increase of 120 basis points related to the US  Europe  Continental Europe was about flat  And from a mix standpoint  nothing really stands out  I mean things can move a little quarter to quarter  but given the size of our portfolio we are very well distributed across space  sizes and geographies Yeah  in terms of markets  I mean you guys can see this reflected in brokerage stance  the vacancy rates will give you a pretty good idea of where things are healthy and things aren t  I would say  we saw a bit of a slowdown in big box activity during the year in  19  but    that actually picked up in that segment later in the year  So if there s anything really new  it is that the demand is strengthening a little bit in big box OperatorYour next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank  Your line is open Derek Johnston    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi  everybody  Good morning  thank you  Just to follow on  do you feel this big box demand could be due to any delta that we ve seen with the Phase 1 trade deal completed or Brexit visibility  And how is 2020 leasing velocity feeling to you guys and shaping up from your vantage due to these two events  Thank you Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I don t think that the pickup in big box has anything to do with the two geopolitical items you mentioned  And the year is starting off pretty good  we re early in the year  but I d say we feel little better than we did a quarter ago  So things are starting off well OperatorYour next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc  Your line is open Craig Mailman    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHi everyone  Just quickly on the clarification  Tom  it sounds like nothing in the underlying assumptions changed broadly in guidance  but does the improved market rent growth assumption change at all the accretion estimates for IPT or LPT And then just separately  I know you guys have been aggressively trying to kind of push rents over occupancy  but as you think about kind of revenue management here  is there a lower bound to how far you d want occupancy to fall here just given kind of the timing it takes to recoup the loss revenues from downtime Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerHi Craig  I ll take the first part of that  On the accretion from higher rent growth given the relatively low remaining role for IPT and the LPT portfolios post acquisition  similar to the  Indecipherable  portfolio  you won t see much  it s pretty minimal impact for 2020  But again  as you point out  the important thing is that it s going to build our in place to market and drive our same store growth even more in the out years  And I ll let Gene respond to revenue management Eugene F  Reilly    Chief Investment OfficerYeah  I d hesitate to put a lower bound on that  but I would say that in general this was a good opportunity for us to introduce  We ve been 97  range and as you can see  particularly in the US where we have the strongest market opportunities  we re ticking down and we re very comfortable with that in the sort of mid 96 range  Historically 95  is sort of been a rule of thumb in this business  I think that may be changing  So rather than get specific  I would just say  there is some room to go  We re comfortable pushing hard at it The markets that have higher demand as a percentage of base can tolerate to lower occupancy because it represents fewer periods of lease up and markets that have lower percentage of growth compared to base  We need to be more full to have the same equivalent pricing power OperatorYour next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank  Your line is open Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystThanks  I just wanted to hear a little bit more about kind of what drove the increase in development guidance and I know you gave the mix on some of the spec versus build to suit  but how are you thinking about increase in development right now  And particularly  which markets  do you think it s really attractive Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so let me let me at least start with that  So if you look at the health in the markets as defined by vacancy rates  as I said earlier  that s a good start  We want to focus on markets that are constrained more in the US  that s New Jersey  that s Southern California  that s the Bay Area  but it also includes some submarkets places like Dallas or Chicago  In Continental Europe  there are several places we like to be doing more development  but there you re seeing constraints on supply more    more significant than really anywhere else in the world Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerThe reason the number of starts went up  is that we have more visibility into    into this year as we get closer to this year  We were a couple of months earlier  So some of the things that we weren t sure were going to happen  happened in a positive way  so the numbers are up  But you know just like for many years I ve commented on acquisition volume being highly predictable  The spec portion of the development volume is also have some volatility associated with it  We are not compelled to start spec development and those are really dependent on minute by minute market conditions and supply demand dynamics in those markets  The build to suits were built because we re pretty sharp of the demand obviously there  but 60  of the start to spec and if the market is better we ll do more and if the market is not as good we ll do less OperatorYour next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Securities  Your line is open Jamie Feldman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  thank you  I was hoping you could take kind of a big picture view or provide a big picture view maybe reading from    from the holiday season and just kind of the conversations you re having with tenants  where does it seem like people still need to get their supply chains right  where does it seem like they are still  things are not going so well  just as we  we ve been at this for several years now  Just how should people think about the runway ahead Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerRetail sales and the online category grew at 18  and in the bricks and mortar category  It s shrunk in real terms so that tells you where kind of demand is on the margin  and that demand has gone up  I mean Amazon is a big chunk of it and they are probably more active every year  Certainly going forward  we see them being more active than before  but they are 40 some percent of the market  The other    the other people are catching up and we are seeing a broadening of demand for e commerce facilities as we move further into this category  So e commerce is very strong  And I would say on the margin  the autos are probably a little weaker than they have been historically  And that s sort of a global thing and probably housing is likely to be stronger at that on the margin than we saw last year OperatorYour next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust  Your line is open Ki Bin Kim    SunTrust    AnalystThanks  good morning out there  So if 2019 was the first year where national supply of 1 6  growth outstrips demand of about 1 1   And there is probably a good degree of nuance in those statistics  for example in LA probably doesn t contribute much because of national demand growth numbers because you can t absorb what s not available  So when you kind of dig into the numbers  what do you think PLDs exposure is to unfavorable markets where real supply is kind of eating away at the demand Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerWell  I mean if you take our US market that are in the soft side  I would say  Atlanta  Houston and Pennsylvania would be the three markets  Dallas has come off the list  Dallas has just had an incredible run in terms of demand  much better than we expected  And those markets  those three markets represent    the leasing that remains to be done in those markets this year is about 14  of our total leasing  And once you add IPT and LPT interestingly  that number goes down to 12  of the remaining leasing that we have to do this year  And the global portfolio also is 12   So there is no over concentration if you will  in the weaker markets  They are exactly in line with our    with our overall markets and they re actually    the percentage is coming down as a result of these two acquisitions  I meant Central Valley  Central PA if I said something different  These guys are giving me  Indecipherable  anyway  so the weaker markets are proportional to all our other leasing and we re basically not concerned about it OperatorYour next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo  Your line is open Blaine Heck    Wells Fargo    AnalystGreat  thanks good morning out there  Maybe I can go at the development starts guidance question from a different angle  2019 starts came in at  2 9 billion  and your share which was over  1 billion more than you had guided to at the beginning of 2019  yet for 2020 and despite the IPT and LPT acquisitions  you re looking at start guidance that s  2 2 billion at your share  So I guess I m just wondering how much conservatism is built into that start number and what are the chances we could end up closer to  3 billion  again this year Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerThat would be a good question for you to ask us next year just like you pointed out this year  I don t know  I mean you know we don t feel compelled to do any development other than places where there is customer demand  And I think to try to predict something is actually irresponsible because it then gets the organization to drive to a number and we don t need to drive to a number  I mean that    nobody gets paid for driving to a number or anything like that  we all get paid as the company does well and we ll do whatever we can to make sure that the market stay in balance and that our developments lease up appropriately and that we have good margins  So it s all dependent  Remember a year ago when we were sitting right here  we have just seen the stock market decline significantly  we have ratcheted down our business plan and the world just looked very different than the way it ended up playing out  And by the way  we weren t the only people who were conservative in our outlook  That was the responsible thing to do  but as the year unfolded and we saw demand being better we obviously scaled up our activity  We have the land to do it  we have the talent to do it  but we don t feel compelled to do it unless there is demand Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerWe will always tell you exactly what we think in a moment in time  but particularly with spec development we will ratchet that down or up as the market tells us  And remember that our development program is 200 roughly speaking 200 bets across 65 different markets  So it s big and it s going to be dynamic over time OperatorYour next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG  Your line is open Tom Catherwood    BTIG    AnalystThank you very much  Following up on Blaine s question on the developments  obviously huge start quarter in the fourth quarter and back at the Investor Day  Hamid you had mentioned how the development timeline is extended from 9 months to 12 months to kind of 18 months  plus  just given the complexity  Due to that and the starts  does that mean you need to carry more land on your books to continue to feed the development pipeline  And if that s the case  kind of where you looking from a complexity standpoint or a risk standpoint  as far as kind of how far out you re willing to go to take risk on land right now Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  if that were and Tom  if that were the only variable that would be the right conclusion to draw  But remember  there are two other variables that are going on  One is that we are generally trying to reduce land as a percentage of our total assets around the company  We are almost to our goal  not quite and there are actually some markets where we are thin on land and other markets where we are balanced  So that s one headwind going the other way  And also we re controlling a lot of land via options and other things that don t show up on the balance sheet  So that s how we re kind of dealing with the need for more land without taking on more balance sheet exposure  Mike  you want to say anything about that anymore    anymore about that Michael S  Curless    Chief Customer OfficerYeah  in terms of our land exposure I think we re in pretty good shape  We manage that very effectively last year and I think we ll be picking land in our strategic spots going forward in the major markets where our customers are migrating to and I think we re in good shape there Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerThe expansion and the development  I m sorry  the expansion and the development cycle is mostly on the front end and on the entitlement side  I mean it s not taking us any longer to physically build buildings and certainly our lease up assumptions to get them stabilized has not been extended  So really it s on the front end of the entitlement OperatorYour next question comes from David Rodgers from Baird  Your line is open David B  Rodgers    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystYeah  Hey  everyone  Tom  you did a good job at the beginning of the call I think laying out some of the supply demand fundamentals that you guys track and we all use different numbers  but I think one of the things that had been a little concerning was just kind of no matter what source you use kind of net absorption  before the impact of construction has been kind of trailing a little bit lower  I guess maybe through a couple of questions at that one  are you guys seeing that as well and can you kind of denote where that s coming from maybe outside of a global auto  And then to maybe Hamid  on your comment about Amazon being 40  of the market  Can you just clarify  was that 40  of e commerce or the embedded base and just of what you re getting out of that comments  Thanks Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerYeah they are actually 45  of e commerce sales I think is the latest number  I might be a point or two off  but it is in the percentage of e commerce and I think e commerce is like 12  of the overall market  So they re like 4 5  of overall retail sales  I think this came up earlier  but maybe I can emphasize it  The demand is not uniform around the country and some of the markets where there is exceptional demand  the supply is just so tight that a lot of that demand just doesn t show up  I don t know what that number is  but I can tell you it s a positive number and God after 10 years of supply falling short of demand  we ve all been predicting this year where supply exceeds demand for the last 5 years  and we ve got it now  So    but I don t  I mean it s a big market  it s 15 billion square feet of base and we got 30 million feet of difference between supply and demand and that doesn t even take into account all the real estate  all the investor real estate that s being scraped for higher and better uses and is becoming obsolete  So I m not losing any sleep over that Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerHey David  Just on the specific numbers  we have net absorption in 240 in 2019  The four year average is 250 million square feet  So pretty consistent with the four year average and really at work there is the 4 6  vacancy rate  That just made it more difficult to absorb stock  And you saw some of that growth more in price than in net absorption  So rents were up 7   8  in the US last year  When we look at the demand trends late in the year as Gene discussed  whether it s really good momentum in the fourth quarter or whether it s a proprietary indicators like the IBM  Phonetic   which is at 61 makes us feel like growth will improve in 2020 Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  the picture going into 2019 was much more negative than    I mean or less positive  I mean it was positive  but it was less positive than it is today  Market feels a lot better  right now than it did on the call a year ago OperatorYour next question comes from Jason Green from Evercore  Your line is open Jason Green    Evercore    AnalystJust a question on development yields in total  You re developing assets now to 120 basis point spread for the supplemental  I guess at what point do spreads become too narrow to continue developing assets Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerWhen we stop developing  Chicken or the egg  I m not    I mean 120 basis points is a pretty healthy margin win cap rates as low as they are  but you know we re really margin focused and if we can really get going in and pretty say 15  on spec and maybe low teens on build to suit  we just won t do it  I guess we ll do a build to suit at about a 10  margin for a great tenant with a great credit that we can easily do and sell or something like that  but I mean that s the range of it  The only problem is in the last  however many years  10 years we had double or triple those margins  So someday we ll have lower than those margins for sure  The market goes through cycles  but there is definitely an arrow up of margins from where we pro forma these deals  And I would say  nine out of 10 deals  at least maybe even more  maybe 19 out of 20 of them that we do a recap on  we do a recap on every deal that we do when it stabilized and we look at what it costs  what the yields were and sort of grade our performance on that  I would say there are very few of them that have any reds  Phonetic  on them  I mean  all of them have big green numbers on them  So far so good and I expect that to continue for at least the foreseeable future OperatorYour next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors  Your line is open Eric Frankel    Green Street Advisors    AnalystThank you  I sincerely apologize for asking another development question  but can you    this is based on your 4Q starts and a little bit higher development volume in  20  Can you talk about whether you think that overall supply is bound to increase more than it has last couple of years and how does that reflect on market rent growth generally And then second  and it certainly it seems like you guys are a lot more active in buying assets of different types in the New York City boroughs  but we also noted that Walmart    Walmart is not going to be using that Bronx facility you guys acquired a couple of years    on lease to them  So maybe you could just talk about your experiences there  Thank you Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the experience in Bronx has nothing to do with the real estate  It has to do with the Walmart s decision not to pursue a strategy that they were going to pursue  We actually think the releasing market for that building is an upside from where that building is leased  So and obviously we have Walmart credit on it  So we re not    I don t think it means anything other than a change in strategy of the company And with respect to the supply picture  I think we re feeling better about supply right now than we did a quarter or two ago  Gene  what do you think Eugene F  Reilly    Chief Investment OfficerYes  I think in    for sure  a quarter ago  we felt a little bit worse about supply  And Eric  if you look at the last couple of years  what s happened is that the development engine in the US  the industry wasn t able to hit Chris  estimate for supply  So I d expect that next year  it s the same thing  And it s    the explanation is pretty simple  It is very difficult and more difficult every day to develop the space  So I would probably say there is a down arrow Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerLook  if you    we re all looking for things to worry about  I would be more worried about a recession because of something like totally out of left field like this virus thing or something globally that can affect something more on the demand side than on the supply side  Supply may be 10 million  20 million  30 million feet one way or another  But that  at the end of the day  doesn t move the vacancy rate or the pricing power  but if demand falls off the clip because of some unknown thing or war or some bad thing like that  that is the thing that I worry more about  Supply  one way or another  it s going to be pretty close to what we think  Certainly a year out  you have pretty good visibility into what supply is  because two thirds  maybe three quarters of stuff that s going to be supply should be under construction right now  So we know kind of what that number is  So really the wiggle room is on the last 25   30  of supply OperatorYour next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel  Your line is open John Guinee    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystGreat  Very  very impressive 14  year over year growth  but probably even more impressive is issuing 110 million shares that looks like about 25 times forward multiple and a 3 6 implied cap  If you re at liberty to talk about it  can you talk about    because of FAS 141 accounting  you re probably bringing both the IPT and the Liberty Portfolio and at a much higher GAAP cap rate than a cash cap rate  Are you at liberty to talk about the GAAP cap rate that these assets are coming in and also your thoughts on FAD growth and dividend growth for 2020 Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Can t talk about the first component  but you can guestimate it pretty well  I mean average lease is six years and an average built in rent growth in these leases call it  3   So you can kind of do the math  three years of 3   that s how much the gap is higher than    by the way  the reason I m not going to get in trouble  because I don t actually know what the number is  But the math on it should be pretty damn close to my guestimate Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerAnd John  I ll point you back to the presentation we gave when we announced the transaction  We had  25 million in fair value lease adjustments  but that also includes straight line rent adjustments  And that s a net number  because you back out the straight line rent that s embedded in the IPT and Liberty portfolios  but more to come on that  To your point about FAD ultimately getting to the dividend  as we ve said in the past  we    our dividend levels are going to need to increase pretty consistently with what you see our FAD and AFFO growth  because we re    we ll pay out as close as we can to the minimum threshold at which    where we re staying  So that s a consistent theme you re seeing here OperatorYour next question comes from Michael Mueller from J P  Morgan  Your line is open Michael Mueller    J P  Morgan    AnalystYeah  hi  You talked about I think a pickup in demand that you were seeing in Lehigh Valley  I was just wondering if you can give us a little more color on what you see driving that Eugene F  Reilly    Chief Investment OfficerYes  Your question was a little bit low  but I think your question is about recent activity in Lehigh Valley  And Lehigh Valley has over the past year experienced a little bit overbuilding  but news in the last six months is pretty good  So demand there is strong  I would say that is contrasted with Central Pennsylvania  where demand is still a little bit weak right now Michael S  Curless    Chief Customer OfficerYeah Gene  I think driving that is a combination of both general supply chain modernization  So we see some customers who are feeding their store network and also a fair amount of e commerce also wanting to serve the greater region and in particular New York  And probably record low vacancy in New Jersey Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Southern New Jersey  there s virtually no product Michael S  Curless    Chief Customer OfficerSo a key message there would be the prioritization of proximity and the proximity of core Lehigh Valley to New Jersey and in particular New York  That s driving that demand OperatorOur next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors  Your line is open Eric Frankel    Green Street Advisors    AnalystThank you  I guess  I d    I guess I also have a few more thoughts from earnings this quarter  But one quick question  housekeeping item  Of the  1 billion of sales from IPT and Liberty  how much of that is office And then second  I think Walmart  just speaking to them  they debut an automation product they re going to be using in their stores to distribute product just directly to consumers via pickup  Can you talk about automation and how that s impacting supply chains obviously  Amazon is always trying to reinvent how they re utilizing the fulfillment centers  And maybe you could touch upon how your other customers are thinking about it Eugene F  Reilly    Chief Investment OfficerWell  I m going to pitch this to Chris  because he spent a lot of time together with Will O Donnell on the topic of automation and its impact generally on logistics demand  And one of these days  you may see a paper coming out on that  that s pretty extensive and detailed  But we don t think that it is a    we think automation is a way of making employees more productive  because it s so hard to get employees to do this kind of work  I mean that s really the impetus for automation And the downside of automation is that unless you have very standardized products the state of the industry is not such that you can have special purpose automation or general purpose automation installed that can handle a lot of different goods  sizes  shapes  etc  etc  We re marching in that direction  but we re quite some time away  And also what we re hearing from our customers    the majority of our customers  particularly the three PLs is that the capital needs of automation are just way beyond their ability to be able to do that  So    and in order to implement automation  they need to have longer term contracts with their customers and be able to amortize those investments over a longer period of time  Chris Chris Caton    Senior Vice President  Global Head of ResearchYes  spot on  Underlying the variety of operations that are going in our customer space  and that translates to two things  One is an adoption rate of automation within logistics facility that is low and rising at a moderate pace and two  the ROIs on some of these investments are still pretty low  given the complexity and the complex nature  Another point I d make relates to productivity enhancing equipment  That s what this really is  That s been around for a long time  whether you look back 40 years at forklifts  And so we ve seen a constant effort to improve employee productivity within our facilities and this is no different As it relates to specific reference you make  kind of in store automation as well  something we have seen in the marketplace are more requirements not just to serve e com  but also to serve store fleets that are needing to handle this buy online and pick up in store  There s more activity to also think about the existing supply chains to support that activity in store Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerI ll respond to your first question relative to the split out of the  1 billion in sales for IPT and LPT  I would say this  it s going to be fluid  but the office component that remains is quite small  But as we said  we re going to match fund disposition proceeds with opportunities to redeploy them  And so I would say it would be fluid  but again  the office is a small piece that s left out of that Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerYes  the non Comcast office  I would expect to    we re through that  So really office comes down to Comcast  And that is as you know pretty liquid  pretty straightforward type of position  And it s only a matter of what s the ideal time to do that and the dynamics with the customer which is a very important customer anyway over time what happens  but that s kind of    there s not a lot of wiggle room on the economics of that deal  We know it s 100  leased and we know what the economics are  So office is gone  We re not in a big hurry on the industrial  We ve just kind of match funded  I mean we re 18  leased    18  levered  So why would we want to do more than match funds  We re not in a hurry  It s a good market OperatorYour next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Vikram Malhotra    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  thanks for taking the questions  two quick ones  On Slide 15 of the slide deck  you gave the occupancy broken out by its size  Could you give us the rent spreads using that same breakout Thomas S  Olinger    Chief Financial OfficerYes  Vikram  this is Tom  The rent spreads were pretty consistent this quarter across all the different size categories  I think the small space under 100 probably picked up a little bit  a little higher than normal  but this quarter  very consistent across all three sizes Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerI would say small space recovered a bit    small space was way ahead of big space  maybe a year  year and half ago  Then it went the other way and softened and now it s coming back a little bit  Most recently  the big space is recovering more in the last couple of quarters  So they re all even  but they re coming to even from different directions OperatorYour next question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi  Your line is open Michael Bilerman    Citi    AnalystHey  it s Michael Bilerman here with Manny  Hamid  I had a question for you just sort of about the sort of acquisition market overall  And we clearly know there s an insatiable desire by private capital to put capital to work really on a global basis in industrial  right it s a favorite asset class  it s been that way for the last few years  And I wanted to get your sort of thoughts on  Indecipherable  comment that he made earlier this year that the market is paying full price even for assets with works on them and that their focus is on development and granted it was self serving  But he made a comment about the acquisition market and I sort of wanted to get your feel about what you see on a global basis about how investors are pricing assets and differentiating assets and how that may play into your disposition plans as well Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean we ve basically been saying the same thing  more or less  with a slightly different accent  I mean the acquisition market in Europe  which is remember that s what they re talking about is pretty expensive  And if you have a good land bank and you are an active developer  like they are and we are obviously the best use of capital is to put your land bank to work and the incremental returns on those investments are quite high  But there are still opportunities here and there that are priced below replacement cost  For example  short term income in Europe is discounted  So if you have a building that has a two year lease on it or something  maybe a perfectly good building  but you could buy that below replacement cost  that kind of thing we d be interested in but you can buy  1 billion of it  I mean I don t know where you would go to buy  1 billion of that kind of stuff in Europe The rest of the world is a different story  I mean there are places where    I mean like in Mexico  if an acquisition opportunity were to come up  cap rates  for the very best product  are around seven  but you can buy some things that are eight or nine  And if you look at their treasuries  the goal on their treasuries  there s a big spread there in that market  So the global picture is a little different  but I would generally agree with their commentary for Europe  Gene Eugene F  Reilly    Chief Investment OfficerYes  I wouldn t add much to that  And Europe  while expensive on a relative basis  look at risk free yields in Europe  I mean  you get negative rates and the best economies  there s got to be four countries in negative rates  So I m not frankly sure that cap rate environment today in Europe is all that expensive Hamid R  Moghadam    Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive OfficerThe other thing I would say about Europe  Europe has    it will be interesting to do the math on this  We haven t  but this is a guess  There are a lot of institutional investors in Europe that are focused in Europe  and the size of the industrial asset class in Europe it s still a relatively new industry and institutional quality products proportionately is a lot smaller than it is in the US  So you ve got a lot of institutional private capital focused on a market with fewer opportunities and I think that s pushing on yields in Europe pretty hard  So development is preferred to acquisitions in all these markets anyway I think that was the last question  Thank you for joining our call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter  if not sooner  Take care Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  47 minutesCall participants Tracy

170106,391622,PLD,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  PLD  SLG And BXP,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 5  2020   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Equity REIT  including Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD    SL Green Realty Corporation   NYSE SLG   and Boston Properties   NYSE BXP   Industry  Equity REITLink  Near Term Outlook Bleak for Equity REIT StocksThe Zacks  industry is a diversified group  comprising REIT stocks from diverse asset classes  such as industrial  office  lodging  healthcare  self storage  data centers and others Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Technological evolution has been transforming the real estate market dynamics and substantially driving demand in a number of asset categories  The e commerce boom  in particular  has significantly fueled demand for logistics facilities  besides backing cell towers and data centers  Further  rapid growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure are spurring demand for data center REITs  Also  5G network deployment has been benefiting tower REITs  Data analytics expertise of self storage REITs too are offering a competitive advantage  Apart from these  biopharma drug development growth opportunities amid increasing longevity of the aging U S  population are boosting the institutional life science and medical market fundamentals Strength in economy and job market plays a key role in determining REITs  performance  These factors determine the capacity of rent that can be shelled out  Resilient economic activity and healthy job market environment are translating into elevated demand for real estate  leading to high occupancy levels and landlords  greater power to command higher rents  For office REITs  the Sunbelt markets are likely to benefit from relocations of corporates and job growth  Moreover  easier capital availability and comparatively lower levels of interest rates keep the momentum upbeat for REITs  given their substantial dependence on debt and their consideration as a bond substitute for a high dividend paying nature  Further  specialty sectors   self storage  data centers  medical office  life sciences facilities and seniors housing   have made headlines in recent years  with investments in these alternative asset classes rising steadily  The aged population or the silver tsunami is shaping up healthcare REITs  future  as this group has the largest customer base of healthcare services  spending more on such services than the average population  spurring demand for seniors housing assets  skilled nursing facilities and others Nevertheless  despite a decent economy and a healthy job market environment  rising delivery of new units in several asset categories  such as industrial  office  senior housing and self storage  has kept REITs on tenterhooks  Rising construction activities with increased completions is moderating landlords  ability to demand higher rents and boost occupancy levels  as well as resulting in high concessions  In the self storage industry  growth might be limited thanks to the development boom in several markets  along with elevated marketing expenses and property taxes  Healthcare REITs too keep witnessing softness in seniors housing fundamentals as supply has shot up rapidly  of late  in this asset category  while labor costs are flaring up  In fact  with excess labor inflation amid tight labor market  margins are likely to be under pressure  Meanwhile  aggressive pricing pressure and substantial debt burden might limit data center REITs  growth tempo Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  171  which places it at the bottom 33  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bleak near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative funds from operations  FFO  per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s FFO per share estimate for 2019 and 2020 moved down 4 7  and 13 2   respectively Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Mixed on Stock Market PerformanceThe REIT and Equity Trust   Other Industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector but lagged the Zacks S P 500 composite in a year s time The industry has rallied 12 3  during this period compared with the S P 500 s rise of 17 5   During the same time frame  the broader Finance sector has gained 6 3  Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to FFO  funds from operations  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing REIT   Others  we see that the industry is currently trading at 18 13X compared to the S P 500 s forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  of 18 5X  The industry is trading above the Finance sector s forward 12 month P E of 14 49X  This is shown in the chart below Forward 12 Month Price to FFO  P FFO  RatioOver the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 18 85X  as low as 14 29X  with a median of 16 10X Bottom LineIn a nutshell  despite job market growth  favorable demographics  technological developments and lifestyle transformations  the delivery boom in certain asset classes in the near  to mid term might strain rental rates and result in high concessions  Furthermore  chances of robust performances are bleak in the absence of any solid catalyst  after the decent outperformance of the REIT   Other industry in the prior years Nonetheless  REITs have reduced their exposure to rate hikes and used the low rate environment to make their financials more flexible  which is encouraging for operational efficiencies  And despite the overall industry s gloomy outlook  REITs catering to certain asset categories have prospects to excel  Therefore  we present three stocks from the industry with a favorable Zacks Rank that investors may consider adding to their portfolios amid global uncertainties and slowdown as well as the U S  presidential election San Francisco  CA based Prologis  Inc  is a leading industrial REIT that acquires  develops  operates and manages industrial properties in the United States and across the globe  The company is poised to excel as the industrial real estate market is witnessing improving fundamentals amid e commerce boom and supply chain strategy transformations  This Zacks  2  Buy  Ranked stock has been a decent performer  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and meeting in the other  the average positive surprise being 1 75   In the fourth quarter  the company registered net effective rent growth  Reflecting positive sentiments  the stock s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year FFO per share moved nearly 1 6  north to  3 72 over the past month You can see  SL Green Realty Corporationprimarily engaged in the acquisition  development  ownership  management and operation of commercial real estate properties  mainly office properties  in the New York metropolitan area  especially in Manhattan  This Zacks Rank  2 company came up with positive surprises in terms of FFO per share in three of the preceding four quarters  the average beat being 1 15   The company s fourth quarter results reflected strong leasing activity in the Manhattan portfolio  Also  the trend is estimate revisions indicates an upbeat outlook as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ongoing year FFO per share moved nearly 2  north over the past month Boston Propertiesdevelops  manages  operates  acquires and owns a diverse portfolio of mainly Class A office space in the United States  The company s properties are primarily concentrated in five markets   Boston  Los Angeles  New York  San Francisco and Washington  DC  It holds a Zacks Rank of 2  at present  This REIT is a decent performer having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate with respect to FFO per share in each of the last four quarters  the average beat being 2 06   In the recently reported quarter  greater than projected portfolio performance  backed by higher occupancy  buoyed results  Additionally  Boston Properties  Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2020 FFO per share increased marginally to  7 56 in a week s time Note  Funds from operations  FFO  is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations  FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30

170182,391698,PLD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  OMV AG  Prologis And Global Payments,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 10  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  OMV AG   Prologis   NYSE PLD   and Global Payments   NYSE GPN   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Plenty of Macro Policy Boulders to Hit  Global Week AheadThis Global Week Ahead has major macro policy boulders  rising amidst the stock ticker tape stream On Wednesday  we have a standard Fed meeting  We get to hear about the goofy mid meeting re start of  QE  a few weeks ago Yes   no Fed Funds rate change will happen  Who needs antiques like the Fed Funds rate  when the Repo market is begging for daily doses of direct Fed liquidity  Powell will get a fair share of questions on that phenomenon at his presser  It is held at 2 pm ET On Thursday  the U K  votes in its general election  Welcome back Brexit  Get back to the trader s mainstream  once again  It s only been 3 years of this However  former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow will be in the studio TV booth for this round  No more  Orrrder   His memoir is set to be out in February  He calls Brexit the U K  s  biggest blunder  in 70 years  I can t disagree with that  Let s see what new political theater develops over there Also on Thursday  emerging market central bankers step up to the plate  They wait until after the Fed makes its decisions  So too will Christine LaGarde  operating at the helm of her first ECB meeting in Europe If you don t understand global central bank liquidity supports stock prices everywhere  there is no hope for you at this point Then  the major macro policy events are really not over A Sunday  December 15th deadline for self imposed tariffs  for 15  U S  producer paid import taxes on  160B of new consumer goods  on the way from China to the USA  hits That s right   it s set up for next weekend  One can expect traders to be nervous about this final major macro move  in advance  all week long Next are Reuters  five world market themes  reordered by importance to equity traders  1  Self Imposed U S  Tariff Increase Deadline    Next Sunday  December 15thThe Dec  15 deadline for the next round of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods is fast approaching  and that s keeping markets yo yo ing between despair and euphoria Signs of trade war damage have started showing up in U S  data  We will now get the next dose of Chinese numbers on the ebb and flow of cash and goods  Sunday brings trade balance figures and  possibly  some lending stats  They will be the last set of numbers to land before policymakers hunker down at Beijing s army run Jingxi Hotel to decide 2020 economic targets  They will be hoping to see a rise in exports for the first time in four months  Loan making too should rebound from the 22 month lows of October  a seasonally slow month full of holidays But pressure is building for more fiscal and monetary policy measures  Consumer demand is soft  meaning the data may reveal falling imports  It might all hinge on what happens in the run up to Dec  15  authorities will be looking for assurances from Washington on either holding off the tariff hikes or rolling back existing ones  So far there is no sign of either  2  A Fed Meeting on Dec  10 and 11th  No Chance for a Rate MoveThere seems little likelihood the Fed will move the Fed Funds target rate at its Dec  10 11 meeting  after all  it cut rates for the third time this year in October and signaled it would stand pat for a while to monitor the economy Jerome Powell s post meeting press conference may yield more interesting headlines  He could address tightness in the short term interbank lending markets that sent repo rates briefly to 10  in September  Since then  the Fed has been stabilizing repo markets by offering to buy securities nearly every day  But given traders  fears of another spike at year end  the central bank is considering a standing repo facility that would allow banks to borrow as needed instead of queuing up in daily operations Reporters may also seek cues from Powell on mooted changes to the Fed s monetary policy framework  especially after Fed Governor Lael Brainard s recent comments endorsing a move to targeting average inflation  from the current 2 0  upper limit  The question is all the more likely because it will come hours after the release of the November Consumer Price Index  Core CPI is running above 2  but the Fed s preferred gauge   the core Personal Consumption Expenditure   is undershooting  3  Emerging Market Central Banks Will Follow the Fed with DecisionsIt s shaping up to be a busy week in emerging markets  Firstly  the blizzard of interest rate cuts is set to resume  with Russia slicing another 25 basis points off its 6 5  benchmark rate and Turkey expected to slash another 100 bps from its 14  rate  Brazil s real recently hit record lows but that may not deter authorities from plans to cut the 5  interest rate by 50 bps Then  there are the emerging market trouble spots  Alberto Fernandez formally takes over as Argentina s new president on Tuesday  Investors will hope to get an inkling of his plans to yank the economy out of crisis and get the ball rolling on restructuring sovereign debt Lebanon  also seemingly skidding towards default  is preparing to play one of its last cards  Caretaker Prime Minister Saad al Hariri will jet to Paris on Wednesday to try a mobilize international support  Deep pocketed Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are among those expected to be invited to a meeting  4  The U K  General Election Happens on Thursday  December 12thMore than three years after Britons narrowly voted to leave the European Union  the Dec  12th general election will effectively offer them another vote on how they want Brexit to proceed  and if they still think it should go ahead Opinion polls showing the Conservative Party with a big lead have fueled a scintillating pound rally and  short  sterling positions have been cut to seven month lows  the belief is the Conservatives will quickly implement Brexit and end the uncertainty that s weighed on the economy since 2016 Polls  patchy track record worries some people though  and that s evident in derivative markets where two week risk reversals   an indicator of bullish to bearish bets   are at two month highs  And while currency volatility everywhere is at record lows  sterling vol is approaching this year s highs What are the risks  One  that the polls have got it wrong and Britain will get another hung parliament  Second  if a Conservative win is already priced in  traders may be tempted to take profits  pushing sterling lower And focus will shift to the 11 month window for Britain to sign trade deals with the European Union  That prospect will likely keep the economy and markets jittery  5  LaGarde Begins Her Job at the Head of the European Central Bank  ECB On Thursday  Christine Lagarde will hold her first meeting and news conference as European Central Bank president  She faces no immediate pressure to take any policy action   ECB stimulus announced in September and some stabilization in indicators such as Germany s Ifo sentiment survey mean markets don t really expect an interest rate cut through 2020 Some of the extreme pessimism in bond markets has also abated  lifting German 10 year yields more than 40 basis points off record lows Yet Lagarde s every word will be studied for her thoughts on the monetary policy outlook  the economy and an upcoming strategy review  And after eight years of the straight talking Mario Draghi  expect the new ECB chief s communication style to also fall under scrutiny Top Zacks  1 Rank Stocks  1  OMV AG This is an Oil   Gas

170184,391700,PLD,Host Hotels  HST  Announces Special Dividend  Time To Hold ,opinion,Host Hotels   Resorts   NYSE HST   recently announced a special dividend of 5 cents per share  This is in addition to the fourth quarter cash dividend of 20 cents per share  reaching the total dividend figure for the year to 85 cents  The dividend will be paid on Jan 15  2020  to stockholders of record on Dec 31  2019 Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U S  law requires these companies to distribute 90  of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders  Moreover  special dividends are usually paid by REITs on capital gains from the sale of assets to avoid paying taxes Host Hotels  diversified portfolio of iconic properties in key cities as well as an unmatched scale and operating platform position it to perform well over the long term  The company undertakes a strategic capital recycling program to improve portfolio quality and strengthen its position in the United States  where it has a greater scale and competitive advantage  Since 2018  the company has acquired high quality properties worth  1 6 billion  which have scope for long term growth Additionally  Host Hotels projects capital expenditures of  550  590 million for 2019  This comprises  315  335 million in return on investment  ROI  projects  and  235  255 million in renewal and replacement projects  Such investments are likely to help the company improve its portfolio quality and bolster revenues Furthermore  the company is making moves to enhance its portfolio quality through strategic dispositions of properties  aimed at lowering international and New York exposure  Since 2018 through October 2019  the company has completed  3 3 billion in asset sale  marking its exit from low growth markets Particularly  in September  Host Hotels announced that it has completed the previously announced sale of all six non core hotels for a combined price of roughly  415 million  The six properties consist of Scottsdale Marriott Suites Old Town  Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountains  The Westin Indianapolis  Costa Mesa Marriott  Atlanta Marriott Suites Midtown and Chicago Marriott Suites O Hare  The transactions were completed this August The lucrative transaction market has likely enabled Host Hotels to opportunistically monetize the low revenue per available room  RevPAR  assets at attractive valuations  Further  since these properties entailed high capital expenditure needs  the move has reduced the company s capex requirements Host Hotels also has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity  The company exited third quarter 2019 with  2 billion of unrestricted cash  not including  1 5 billion of available balance under its credit facility s revolver  and  184 million in the FF E escrow reserve In addition  as of Sep 30  2019  the company s debt had a weighted average maturity of 5 7 years  Also  the company has no significant debt maturities until 2023  Therefore  in addition to disposition proceeds  this provides the company ample scope for deploying capital for long term growth opportunities and at the same time  carrying out redevelopment initiatives However  supply growth in some of its markets is affecting the company s occupancy rates  Further  amid weaker lodging demand  overall RevPAR growth of Host Hotels  portfolio is likely to be muted in the near term Host Hotels currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   In the past three months  shares of this REIT have gained 4 1   as against its  s decline

170282,391798,PLD,Prologis  PLD  Q3 FFO Tops Estimates On Rent Growth  View Up,opinion,Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD   reported third quarter 2019 core funds from operations  FFO  per share of 97 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents  Results also compare favorably with the year ago figure of 72 cents  Notably  the company had net promote income of 18 cents in the just reported quarter  while no promotes were earned in the year ago period The company witnessed rent growth in the third quarter  but period end occupancy moderated slightly as the company prioritized rent over occupancy  Moreover  results reflect substantial earnings from the company s strategic capital business  The industrial real estate investment trust  REIT  also raised its guidance for 2019 core FFO per share Prologis generated rental revenues of  710 5 million  which registered 16 7  growth from the prior year quarter  However  the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  713 2 million Quarter in DetailAt the end of the reported quarter  occupancy level in the company s owned and managed portfolio was 96 5   down 100 basis points year over year  indicating the company s strategy of prioritizing rent over occupancy  However  during the quarter  38 million square feet of leases commenced in the company s owned and managed portfolio  up from 37 million square feet in the year ago period   Prologis  share of net effective rent change was 37  in the July September quarter compared with 22 6  recorded a year ago  This was driven by the United States at 41 7   Cash rent change was 21 4   as against 11 6  recorded in the year earlier quarter  However  cash same store net operating income  NOI  registered 4 3  growth compared with the 5 9  increase reported in the comparable period last year  with the company emphasizing on rent over occupancy In third quarter 2019  Prologis  share of building acquisitions amounted to  191 million  with a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 4 3   Development stabilization aggregated  658 million  while development starts totaled  577 million  with 63 6  being build to suit  Furthermore  the company s total dispositions and contributions came in at  498 million  with weighted average stabilized cap rate  excluding land and other real estate  of 4 8  LiquidityThe company exited the September end quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 02 billion  up from the  401 2 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter  Prologis ended the quarter with leverage of 18 4  on a market capitalization basis and debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3 9x and  4 9 billion of liquidity Notably  during the reported quarter  the company and its co investment ventures issued  2 8 billion of debt  mainly in euros  This was done at a weighted average fixed interest rate of less than 1  and a weighted average term of more than 14 years Outlook RaisedPrologis raised its core FFO per share outlook for full year 2019  The company projects core FFO per share of  3 30  3 32  up from the  3 26  3 30 estimated earlier  The guidance is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 27 The company forecasts year end occupancy of 96 5 97 0  against the prior projection of 96 5 97 5   and cash same store NOI  Prologis share  of 4 75 5 0  compared with the prior projection of 4 5 5  Our TakeWe are encouraged with Prologis  better than expected performance in terms of FFO per share in the third quarter  In a rising e commerce market  the industrial real estate asset category has grabbed headlines and continues to play a pivotal role  transforming the way how consumers shop and receive their goods  Services like same day delivery are gaining traction and last mile properties in high income urban areas are witnessing solid pricing  occupancy and growth in rentals Amid this environment  Prologis remains well poised to grow  backed by its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management  The company s financing activities in the latest reported quarter has helped it lower total weighted average interest rate and lengthen weighted average maturity Nevertheless  recovery in the industrial market has continued for long and a whole lot of new buildings are becoming available in the market  leading to higher supply and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth  Additionally  any protectionist trade policies will have an adverse impact on economic growth  as well as the company s business over the long haul Prologis currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Prologis  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    We now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like SL Green Realty Corp    NYSE SLG    Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI

170353,391869,PLD,5 REIT Stocks To Add As Federal Reserve Keeps Rate Unchanged,opinion,Drop in inflation expectations  global economic growth concerns and prevalent trade tensions are compelling investors to look for safer havens  particularly toward the security of the government bonds  pushing up debt prices and resulting in the fall of bond yields  Also  for the first time since late 2016  the 10 year treasury yields slipped below 2  after Fed chairman Powell held interest rates steady  but kept its options open for any cuts later this year President Trump has been keeping the central bank under persistent pressure for lowering of interest rates  However  this time  the Fed kept the benchmark rate unchanged  and dropped the word  patient  in discussing its attitude toward policy  instead  The central bank also pointed out that while on an average  job gains have been solid  economic activity is increasing at a moderate pace Moreover  though household spending seems to have picked up pace in recent months compared to the beginning of the year  business fixed investment indicators have been  soft   Additionally  with inflation still lagging behind the Fed s target level  the committee has decided to closely monitor the economic situation and make prudent moves for economic expansion Further  the argument in favor of an accommodative policy has gathered steam  This is indicated by eight of the 17 members preferring a rate cut this year  while an equal number voting in favor of retaining it  and the other member preferring a hike The current scenario brings back interest sensitive REITs to the limelight  as these are often treated as bond substitutes for their high dividend paying nature  Particularly  government regulations mandate REITs to disburse at least 90  of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders each year  In addition  dependence of REITs on debt for their business keeps investors optimistic about their performance in case of a rate cut These apart  underlying fundamentals of a number of asset categories in the REIT sector have been displaying strength  The occupancy levels of properties are hovering near the record high marks   indicating solid demand as well as scope for generating steady revenues Stocks to ConsiderTherefore  backtracking to the REITs and scouting for stocks with better fundamentals and

Though the figure was encouraging  investors should note that it was because 500 000 Americans left the labor force  which include both people working and looking for jobs  Then again  Midwest snowstorms were likely to   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  estimated  Absent this headwind  the U S  economy would have come up with a more stellar jobs data 
In April  average hourly earnings increased 6 cents to  27 77  In a year  average hourly earnings have grown by 3 2     Average hourly earnings of private sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose 7 cents to  23 31 in April 
However  tepid wage gains give cues of softer inflation  which in turn should keep the Fed dovish for a few more days  If this happens  the stock market will continue to be charged up 
Winning Sector ETFs

170421,391937,PLD,Liberty Property  LPT  Acquires Third Building In Redlands,opinion,"Liberty Property Trust   NYSE LPT   is making efforts to grow its industrial portfolio  The company recently announced the expansion of its Southern  NYSE SO  California portfolio  with the purchase of new fully leased building in Redlands 
This is the third building that Liberty Property acquired in Redlands  The building comprises 289 683 square feet  This industrial property is likely to experience a decent demand as it is located near the San Bernardino Airport and has proximity to I 10  I 210  and I 215 
Liberty already has strong presence in Southern California and its portfolio includes more than five million square feet of industrial space  which is now 93 7  leased  Further it is marketing its newly acquired property in 520 E  Orange Show Road property  San Bernadino

Recently  Liberty Property also leased its LEED certified 2000 W  Baseline Rd  property in Rialto  which was acquired in 2018  This 176 000 square foot property was leased to Global Commerce Solutions Enterprises  LLC 
Admittedly  the expansion of the industrial real estate portfolio is a strategic fit for Liberty Property  In fact  this asset category grabbed attention because of high demand for space amid improving economy  job market gains  high consumer spending and e commerce boom 
This led to strong rent growth  high occupancy and development opportunities for industrial REITs   including Liberty Property  Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD    Duke Realty   NYSE DRE   and Terreno Realty   NYSE TRNO   
Liberty Property is also likely to benefit from the rising demand for industrial real estate and therefore it is focusing more on acquiring such properties  However  in the process  the company is continuously divesting its office properties  This is likely to affect its earnings in the near term  Further  there is rising supply of industrial real estate space and this might partly dampen the robust growth momentum in rents  Trade tensions and any rate hike add to REITs  woes as well

170501,392017,PLD,REITs Outperform Broader Market In May  Bet On 4 Solid Picks,opinion,A solid jobs report for the month of May has triggered chances of a rate hike this month by the Federal Reserve  However  investors in the REIT space can shrug off such issues  This is because even though REITs have traditionally depended on debt for their business and were considered as bond substitutes for the high and consistent dividend paying nature making their short term returns susceptible to rate moves  this time around  these companies seem to be better poised to brave the rising rate environment In fact  over the years  REITs have shored up capital and made concerted efforts to reduce leverage  These have resorted to equity capital rather than brooding too much on debt capital to finance their portfolio and carry on their business  Moreover  the healthy economy serves as a positive catalyst for demand for many of the asset categories Also  the returns for May indicate the abating of the rate hike concerns  In fact  REITs delivered an encouraging performance in the month  as well as outperformed the broader market in the month  Per the  from REIT com  total returns of the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index logged in a gain of 3 5  in the month  while the S P 500 rose 2 4  Lodging REITs ruled the market in May  with returns from this sector shooting up to 11 9   Obviously  the news of Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group LP s plan to acquire LaSalle Hotel Properties   NYSE LHO    in a  4 8 billion all cash deal  served as a tailwind and pulled in the attention of investors to this sector  Also  healthcare REITs gained 7 5   while freestanding retail REIT reported 6 7  increase in returns  as earnings were comparatively better than what was apprehended Notably  after lackluster performance in the first two months of 2018  the U S  REIT industry has been gaining solid ground  Returns rebounded in March and were in the positive territory in April as well  In fact  the mojo seems to be back in the market  following the steady performance of REITs in Q1 Per the latest NAREIT   the Q1 scorecard revealed that funds from operations  FFO  totaled  15 3 billion  denoting a 3 6  increase on a sequential basis and growth of 6   year over year  Same store net operating income  NOI  increased 2 5  year over year  Occupancy rates for all Equity REITs were high at 93 6  and managed growth of 18 basis points on a year over year basis  but witnessed a marginal sequential slip Admittedly  high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains have been fueling consumption levels  In fact  with one eventually requiring  real space  for economic activities  prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels Further  valuation wise  several REIT stocks seem attractive  while encouraging performance by a number of REITs in Q1  as well as an increase in merger and acquisition activities in the industry  point at the prevailing favorable environment and re instill confidence Thus  the time is now apt to bet on some REIT stocks that have a favorable rank and solid scopes for growth in a recovering economy  As a bonus point  these companies have enjoyed positive estimate revisions from analysts  reflecting their bullish sentiments Here are the four picks   Bethesda  MD based Pebblebrook Hotel Trust   NYSE PEB   is a hotel REIT engaged in the acquisition and investment of hotel properties mainly in upper upscale  full service hotels situated in urban markets in major gateway cities  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a long term growth rate of 5   It is a steady performer  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate

that it has entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust   NYSE DCT   to acquire the latter in an  8 4 billion stock for stock deal  The combined portfolio will enable the company to realize significant synergies and strengthen its position in key markets  Reflecting positive sentiments  the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised 2 4  upward in two months  time West Palm Beach  FL based Chatham Lodging Trust   NYSE CLDT   is focused mainly on investing in premium branded upscale extended stay and select service hotels  It has a

170521,392037,PLD,Why This Is The Best Time To Buy Host Hotels  HST  Stock,opinion,Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc    NYSE HST   is likely to gain from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across markets with potential  Furthermore  the company s strategic capital recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for its long term growth  Moreover  Host Hotels is anticipated to improve the revenues per available room backed by its value enhancement initiatives Nonetheless  elevated supply in the company s key markets is expected to reduce its pricing power  Further  geographical concentration of assets in upscale markets exposes it to the economic doldrums prevailing in the region Earlier this month  the company reported first quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations  FFO  of 43 cents per share  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents  Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity Also  Host Hotels has raised its outlook for full year 2018  The company now expects 2018 adjusted FFO per share in the range of  1 67  1 73  denoting 5 cents increase at the midpoint from the earlier guidance of  1 60  1 70 Notably  Host Hotels undertakes a strategic capital recycling program to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen its position over vibrant global markets  Furthermore  the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D C  and lowering its exposure in New York During first quarter 2018  Host Hotels completed the acquisition of 301 room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort  668 room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454 room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for  1 billion  Moreover  during the reported quarter  the company s capital expenditures were around  115 million    29 million was

This comprises  185  220 million in ROI projects and  290  330 million in the renewal and replacement projects  Such investments are likely to help the company improve its portfolio quality and bolster revenues Further  Host Hotels has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity  The company exited first quarter 2018 with around  323 million of unrestricted cash and  511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility  Notably  the company has no debt maturities until 2020  This provides it ample scope for deploying capital for long term growth opportunities while carrying out redevelopment initiatives Though supply growth has been tepid in the past  it has gathered momentum in recent times  In fact  supply growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018 as well as 2019  particularly in markets where the company has exposure As the majority of Host Hotels  properties are concentrated in the luxury and upper upscale segments  during any economic downturn  these segments bear the brunt as unfavorable macroeconomic conditions compel customers to reduce discretionary spending and choose lower priced brands over the company s premium ones  Also  the hotel industry is cyclical in nature and heavily dependent on the overall health of economies in which it operates Though an economic slowdown has an immediate impact on the company s revenues  many of the expense categories associated with owning and operating hotels  such as debt service payments  property taxes  insurance  utilities  and employee wages and benefits  remain

Fed Hikes Rate Third Time  Industrial REITs Set to Grow

	If the rate hike in June  the third since Dec 2016  has made investors jittery about their investments in the REIT stocks  then this is the apt time to think again  It is because individual market dynamics end up playing a major role in the performance of REITs  and there are favorable conditions  as well as ample chances of growth in some of the asset categories 

	For example  take the industrial real estate market where demand for space has been high for several quarters  Admittedly  this asset class is witnessing an improvement in fundamentals amid an economic recovery  growth of e commerce and U S  based manufacturing  This is driving demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms 
	Particularly  amid economic expansion  e commerce boom and heightened urbanization  companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same day delivery and other such options  propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities  Also  according to a  from Prologis Inc   NYSE           for a given level of revenue  online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers 
	On the other hand  though supply is increasing  market vacancy levels are still lower and amid positive net absorption  rental rates are growing in several markets  This is creating scope for industrial REITs like Prologis DCT Industrial Trust Inc   NYSE           STAG Industrial  Inc   NYSE          and Liberty Property Trust  NYSE          to flourish 
	In fact  during first quarter 2017  Prologis enjoyed high occupancy levels  Demand for the company s facilities was propelled by growth in the housing  construction and e commerce businesses  Moreover  market conditions in Europe continued to improve 
	Additionally  in a recent video interview at  2017  NAREIT s Investor Forum at the New York Hilton Midtown  DCT Industrial s CEO  Phil Hawkins   that  Demand is really as positive as people read about   He noted that solid demand for space has been indicating consistent growth in rent in the industrial sector  while supply of space  according to him  is  rational  
	Further  STAG Industrial s CEO   Ben Butcher   joined REIT com for a video interview at  and stated that the company s pace of acquisition is likely to accelerate  It has already purchased 11 properties in the first quarter and targets acquisition of around 25 properties in the second quarter 
	Also  Liberty Property s industrial portfolio  spanning 91 7 million square feet  was leased 96 6  at the end of first quarter 2017  Further  industrial distribution rents escalated 17 8  on renewal and replacement leases during the quarter 
	Against such a favorable backdrop  in first quarter 2017  the overall U S  industrial real estate market remained upbeat despite increased supply  In fact  per a NAREIT    Industrial REITs delivered solid same store NOI growth of 5 9  in the first quarter  Considering the improving economy and healthy fundamentals of the industrial sector  this trend is likely to continue The Best   Worst of Zacks
