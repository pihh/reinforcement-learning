126129,347644,BMRN,Express Scripts staking out million dollar gene therapies,news,"By Caroline Humer and Deena Beasley  Reuters    Express Scripts Holding Co  O ESRX  built a multi billion enterprise pressuring drug companies to lower their prices for U S  patients  Now it is quietly building a side business  getting paid to help drug companies dispense a new generation of high priced drugs  Express Scripts is in talks with biotechnology companies Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc  O BMRN    Spark Therapeutics Inc   O ONCE  and Bluebird Bio Inc  O BLUE  to have its specialty pharmaceutical business exclusively distribute their new hemophilia therapies when they are expected to become available in 2019 and 2020  Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller told Reuters in an interview   Biomarin  Spark and Bluebird confirmed to Reuters that they were speaking to a payers   a group generally defined as pharmacy benefit managers  health plans and government agencies    about pricing models for future therapies  Analysts project those drugs could top  1 million to  1 5 million in price  Rather than rail against the drugs  expected high prices  Miller echoes the familiar drug company argument that the potentially curative therapies will likely be worth the high cost if they supplant the hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual medical costs to treat ailments such as hemophilia  which affects about 20 000 people in the United States alone   Even if they charge  1 million  that s a great deal   Miller said   So there are going to be some gene therapies where it is very clear that everyone who has that disease should get it    By working closely with biotech companies  Miller says it can help their expensive therapies succeed commercially  To manage any potential conflicts of interest  he said Express Scripts separates its benefits management and specialty pharmacy businesses   The move into hemophilia builds on exclusive rights Express Scripts already has to distribute Spark s Luxturna   an  850 000 treatment for a rare genetic disorder that  left untreated  causes children to go blind  It has a similar deal with Biogen Inc  O BIIB  on Spinraza  he told Reuters  The drug costs  750 000 the first year and treats the rare condition spinal muscular atrophy that often kills babies within months of their birth  Spark and Biogen confirmed the agreements   The company also helps manage one of the most expensive gene based cancer treatments on the market  the  475 000  Novartis  AG  S NOVN  gene based cancer therapy Kymriah   a personalized treatment that requires a long hospital stay  Novartis confirmed the arrangement to Reuters   Those deals put Express Scripts in a vastly different role than its traditional business managing prescription drug claims for the employees of its corporate and government clients  a business  Cigna Corp   N CI  found so valuable that it agreed in March to acquire Express Scripts for  52 billion  Patients usually know Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs  as the name on the insurance card they present at the pharmacy counter when picking up a prescription  That card activates discounts the benefits managers have negotiated with drug companies to lower prices  usually through rebates  PBMs make money by taking a cut of the rebates  and the rest goes to their clients  Express Scripts  which negotiates the prescription payments for 80 million people in the United States  competes with UnitedHealth Group Inc s  N UNH  Optum and CVS Health Corp  N CVS    These companies are usually among the most vocal critics of the pharmaceutical industry s pricing practices  publicly calling out companies and specific products for their high cost  But the pharmacy benefits businesses themselves are facing growing criticism from U S  regulators  lawmakers  drugmakers  and President Trump  who say they act as unnecessary middlemen and end up helping drive up prices for payers  Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn mounted a proxy campaign to stop the deal on expectations the Trump Administration would end the rebates it relies on for profits  But he abandoned his efforts after two shareholder advisory groups came out in favor of the deal  GROWTH vs CONFLICTS  As the PBM fight plays out publicly  Express Scripts has been expanding its low profile specialty pharmacy business   which dispenses drugs that usually aren t sold through drugstores because they require special handling  By using its own pharmacy instead of outsiders  Express Scripts is able to hold onto more of the profits along the drug distribution chain  Specialty pharmacy is one of Express Script s fastest growing businesses and accounts for about a third of its sales and profits  ISI Evercore analyst Ross Muken said  The company earned  4 1 billion last year on total revenue of more than  100 billion   it does not break out financial information for specialty pharmacy  Many of the newest  most advanced medicines   including gene based therapies and personalized cancer treatments   will be dispensed through specialty pharmacies  and Express Scripts is pitching biotech companies for exclusive arrangements  By working as both the manufacturer s partner who gets paid for each sale  and the pharmacy benefit manager responsible for negotiating the best price for its traditional corporate and government clients  Express Scripts is open to questions about being conflicted  industry sources and experts say   One could view this role as being a wonderfully catalytic  that they can help balance the views and interests of all the parties by being in this middle facilitating role  Or one could view that they have created a situation where internally they have multiple conflicts of interest  and can they manage them properly   said Mark Trusheim  strategic director of a group of international payers and providers formed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study gene therapy pricing models  Express Scripts says it saves money for payers on Luxturna by cutting out the hospital pharmacy mark up  which is 6 percent for the government Medicare program and more for commercial business   or at least  60 000 on a  1 million drug  Miller said the company has a firewall between its specialty pharmacy business  which serves the drugmakers  and its businesses negotiating on behalf of his clients  the payers    Our PBM treats our specialty pharmacy as they treat any other pharmacy in our pharmacy network   he said   So they are not privy to their acquisition prices or anything else  and the specialty pharmacy is not privy to the contracts that the PBM has with their payer clients or anything else    Beyond potential conflict concerns  there is risk in whether the gene therapies will ever make it to the public   
Spark on Aug  7 said two patients in a small trial had an adverse immune response to an experimental hemophilia gene therapy and its shares lost more than a quarter of their value  And last month  U S  regulators put Biogen s gene therapy program for spinal muscular atrophy on hold  but no details were disclosed ",2018-08-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/express-scripts-staking-out-million-dollar-gene-therapies-1574600,1574600

126133,347648,BMRN,BioMarin sets stage early for hemophilia cure off Broadway,news, This version of the November 21st story has been refiled to show in paragraph 23 that Sangamo Therapeutics has six people in clinical trials  By Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc  O BMRN  is turning to the theater to establish its name with hemophilia patients  long before its experimental cure for the bleeding disorder could reach the market  Earlier this month  BioMarin hosted 25 teenagers and their chaperones for an all expenses paid trip to New York City  where they performed a Broadway style musical based on their own experiences with bleeding disorders  Some came from as far away as Hawaii to work with a professional theater crew  have their headshots taken and meet members of the show Hamilton   During breaks  some stopped to infuse the blood clotting medications  with a nurse on hand to attend to any health needs  Well beyond a feel good philanthropic effort  BioMarin s business strategy here is to build a long term relationship with hemophilia patients who it wants to one day use its gene therapy  If approved  it is expected to be one of the most expensive on the market at well over  1 million per person   BioMarin s sponsorship of  Hemophilia  The Musical    conceived more than a year ago while its own experimental hemophilia gene therapy will not reach the market until at least mid 2020   stands out in a drug industry known for pulling out all the stops to convince doctors and patients to use their medicines  U S  regulations allow companies to discuss diseases and care with patients  but they cannot advertise products before they are accepted by health regulators  BioMarin s long term strategy is geared to take market share from  Bayer AG   DE BAYGn    Shire  Plc  L SHP  and  Novo Nordisk   CO NOVOb   who dominate the  10 billion market for blood clotting treatments  These players have also provided hemophilia patients with summer camps and other events such as a kayak trip in Washington State s Puget Sound from Switzerland s Octapharma AG   Another likely rival is Roche Holding AG  S ROG   whose Hemlibra treatment helps hard to treat hemophilia patients keep their condition under control and requires fewer infusions   What the hemophilia community has said to us is   Who is BioMarin  Gene therapy  that looks interesting  but who is BioMarin  We ve got to get to know BioMarin  We need to know you and trust you before your product shows up   BioMarin Chief Commercial Officer Jeff Ajer said in an interview  With that in mind  BioMarin turned to Patrick James Lynch  who runs the Los Angeles based marketing and production agency Believe Ltd that specializes in bleeding disorders  Lynch  who has hemophilia  recruited the applicants  managed the details and led the group   in matching black jackets with Hemophilia the Musical and BioMarin logos   to Times Square  NYSE SQ    For Porus Pavri  14  the three day weekend represented a rare opportunity to kick back with teenagers who understand his daily challenges  Acting  he said in the play  was like his life at home   It is one of the only activities I can do where I can go all out without worrying about my health   Concerns he will be hurt has put activities such as sports  or even the school marching band  off limits to Porus  who has coped with an especially severe form of hemophilia for most of his life     At one point I had lost full faith in the American medical system  That faith  with a lot of difficulty  has been restored   Yasmin Pavri  Porus  mother  said    Earlier this year  Porus switched to Roche s Hemlibra  which has reduced the bleeding and pain  Without it  he could not have participated in the musical  Pavri said  An earlier experience in switching medications made her reluctant to consider the Roche therapy  She would like to see several years of data on a gene therapy  whose effects are likely irreversible  before contemplating it for her son   But after the weekend workshop  she said she felt more comfortable with BioMarin above the other companies working on gene therapies  Unlike most countries  the United States allows drug companies to market their FDA approved products directly to consumers  In recent years  new laws have curbed drugmaker gifts to doctors  based on studies showing that even small items  such as a pen  can influence behavior   The relationships that pharma companies have with patients are  potentially problematic  because their influence may not align with the effectiveness of a treatment  said Alyssa Burgart  a clinical ethicist at the Lucile Packard Children s Hospital at Stanford University   This is planting a very early seed for adolescents  given that the drug is still in trials  she said  BioMarin disagreed with her assessment  and said that the project aimed to create an environment for teens with bleeding disorders to connect art and wellness  and is consistent with the company s history in expanding care for people with rare genetic diseases   When we first started working with Believe Limited  we shared a strong principle that this should not be a marketing effort   spokeswoman Debra Charlesworth said   NORTH OF  1 MILLION  There are about 20 000 U S  patients with hemophilia  16 000 of which suffer from hemophilia A which BioMarin and others are targeting  The current standard therapy requires patients to infuse factor proteins into their bloodstream several times a week for life  costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year  Some develop an immune response  like Porus  and their costs rise to more than  1 million per year  making hemophilia patients among some of the most expensive for the U S  healthcare system   BioMarin sees that price tag as an opening for its own experimental gene therapy   which if successful will cure the disorder in patients and justify the price   We haven t decided what we are going to price it at  but it s going to be for sure north of  1 million   BioMarin CEO Jean Jacques Bienaime he said in an interview   We are not trying to introduce a new therapy that is going to cost substantially more per year   he said  adding that it would allow a deferred payment plan over two to five years if needed   Other drugmakers see the market potential for hemophilia gene therapies  but have a longer road ahead   Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  has licensing agreements with  Spark Therapeutics Inc   O ONCE   which began enrolling patients in clinical trial in July  and Sangamo Therapeutics Inc  O SGMO   which currently has 6 patients in hemophilia A clinical trials   BioMarin is aiming to submit the therapy to regulators in the fourth quarter of 2019  and has the capacity to produce 4 000 gene therapy doses a year at its Navato  California factory  DIFFERENT APPROACH  BioMarin s approach differs from Roche  which launched Hemlibra for difficult to treat hemophilia patients in late 2017 and more broadly in October  The drug s price is about  492 000 per year for a 140 pound person  Roche has made donations to sponsor patient advocacy organizations  and provided information to physicians and others about Hemlibra  Roche spokeswoman Ulrike Engels Lange said  It has not directly sponsored an event   By contrast BioMarin executives  including the head of research and development and a hemophilia business head  attended a parents breakfast during the New York weekend  BioMarin s Charlesworth said  Its general counsel gave introductory remarks at the musical and at the end of the production  Charlesworth enlisted caregivers give each teenager a small Tony Award like trophy in areas such as  Biggest Heart  and  Unbreakable Spirit   She encouraged participants to fill out a survey to help the company decide on the program s future and for longer term research around the connection between art and health that BioMarin plans to fund    I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship   she said ,2018-11-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/biomarin-sets-stage-early-for-hemophilia-cure-offbroadway-1696191,1696191

126382,347897,BMRN,Catalyst s Fridapse Gets Priority Review By FDA  Shares Up,opinion,"Shares of Catalyst Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ CPRX   rose almost 8 2   after the company announced that the FDA has accepted the new drug application  NDA  for its lead pipeline candidate  Firdapse  and granted Priority Review to the same  The FDA has set an action date of Nov 28  2018 
Firdapse has been developed for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome   LEMS    The NDA submission addressed the two issues raised in the 2016 Refusal to File letter during the previous Firdapse NDA submission and included all additional information requested by the FDA 
Priority Review designation from the FDA is generally granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment  prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease  
Year to date  Catalyst s shares have declined 2  against the  s increase of 0 8  

Firdapse is currently approved in the European Union  EU  for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS in adults  However  the drug is not yet approved in the United States   In January 2017  it held a Type C meeting with the FDA  wherein Catalyst was advised  based on the briefing documents  that the company s proposed NDA should be sufficient for resubmission  In November 2017  the company announced positive top line results from its second phase III study of Firdapse in patients with LEMS 
Catalyst also announced its decision of not including in this FDA submission those limited types of congenital myasthenic syndromes   CMS   that are considered mechanistically similar to LEMS  Catalyst decided not to overcomplicate the review of its NDA submission for LEMS with this second indication 
The company is currently conducting a phase III study evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of CMS and expects to complete enrollment before the end of 2018 and report top line results from this study in the first quarter of 2019  If the results of the trial are successful  the company plans to add the CMS indication to its labeling for Firdapse  
Catalyst had in licensed rights to Firdapse from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN   in 2012 for the development and commercialization of the product in the United States  Also  Firdapse enjoys Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy status in the United States for the treatment of LEMS  Firdapse received Orphan Drug status in the United States for the treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes   CMS   and myasthenia gravis   MG   
LEMS is an ultra rare disease even though several drugs and treatment therapies like steroids  azathioprine  other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin are currently in use  Guanidine HCl tablets are approved for the treatment of LEMS  However  due to significant side effects  the drug is not viewed as an effective treatment  This  in turn  has created ample space for introducing new therapies for LEMS 
Therefore  approval of Firdapse in these indications will be a huge boost for the company  given its commercial potential in the target markets

Catalyst also announced its decision not to include in this FDA submission those limited types of congenital myasthenic syndromes   CMS   that are considered mechanistically similar to LEMS  Catalyst decided not to overcomplicate the review of its NDA submission for LEMS with this second indication 
The company is currently conducting a phase III study evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of CMS and expects to complete enrollment before the end of 2018 and report top line results from this study in the first quarter of 2019  If the results of the trial are successful  the company plans to add the CMS indication to its labeling for Firdapse  
Shares of the company have been moving up the chart after this data readout 
Catalyst had in licensed rights to Firdapse from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN   in 2012 for the development and commercialization of the product in the United States  Also  Firdapse enjoys Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy status in the United States for the treatment of LEMS  Firdapse received Orphan Drug status in the United States for the treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes   CMS   and myasthenia gravis   MG   
LEMS is an ultra rare disease and though several drugs and treatments therapies like steroids  azathioprine  other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin are currently in use  Guanidine HCl tablets are approved for the treatment of LEMS  However  due to significant side effects  the drug is not viewed as an effective treatment  This  in turn  has created ample space for introducing new therapies for LEMS 
Therefore  approval of Firdapse in these indications will be a huge boost for the company given its commercial potential in the target markets Catalyst Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price

126446,347961,BMRN,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Acorda Therapeutics  BioMarin Pharmaceutical  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Teva Pharmaceuticals And Sanofi,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 19  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Pharmaceuticals  Part 3  including Acorda Therapeutics  Nasdaq   NASDAQ ACOR        BioMarin Pharmaceutical  Nasdaq   NASDAQ BMRN        Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  NYSE   NYSE VRX        Teva Pharmaceuticals  NYSE   NYSE TEVA       and Sanofi  PA SASY   NYSE   NYSE SNY       Industry  Pharmaceuticals  Part 3Link  While the drug pricing issue no longer remains a major headwind for pharma and biotech stocks  it will nevertheless remain a headline risk until the Trump administration comes out with a policy for controlling drug prices  The sector  previously a Wall Street favorite  was hit hard by political rhetoric and increasing media and public focus on the high prices of drugs  With the drug pricing controversy gaining steam since September 2015  companies like Valeant saw their share prices plunging as they found themselves in the midst of the controversy According to the April 2017 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  six in ten Americans believe affordability of prescription drugs should be a top priority for the President and Congress   focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices Some of the options favored by the public for drug price control include getting drug companies to reduce prices for medications for people on Medicare  making it easier for generics to enter the market  and requiring drug companies to provide information on how drug prices are set Although the pharma and biotech sectors have rebounded in 2017  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market Biosimilars a Key HeadwindAnother challenge being faced by the sector is the recent entry of biosimilar competition in the United States  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative with several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus slated to lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments According to research released by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics last year  increasing acceptance of biosimilars across different therapeutic areas plus an active pipeline of 56 candidates are expected to lead to total savings of about  110 billion to health systems across Europe and the United States through 2020  The report further says that by 2020  biosimilars will start competing with biologics that have annual sales of  50 billion Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies  Although there is still low visibility on how well biosimilars will perform or how much of the market they will be able to capture  the focus on making expensive drugs more affordable and formulary coverage for biosimilars could very well make it challenging for innovator companies to hold on to market share for their blockbuster drugs Generics Pose a ThreatQuite a few of the big players in the drug industry are looking at loss of patent protection for major blockbuster drugs  With generics and biosimilars breathing down their necks  many of these companies are looking towards new products to pick up pace and make up for lost sales  However  products like Repatha and Praluent are yet to ramp up significantly  With efforts on to control drug prices  the FDA is focusing on speeding up the generic drug approval process especially for third  fourth  or fifth generics which leads to rapid erosion of branded drug sales Slowdown in Sales of Mature Products Many companies like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  are facing a slowdown in sales of mature products in their portfolios  At the same time  new product sales are yet to pick up significantly  Many of these companies are also facing loss of patent protection  which means generics or biosimilars  as the case may be  could enter the market soon and lead to price erosion Pricing Pressure to Hit SalesWhile concerns regarding the drug pricing issue may have taken a backseat for the time being  pharma and biotech companies remain wary of increasing scrutiny of drug prices  Moreover  with increasing competition in the market and the entry of innovative treatments  pricing pressure is expected to hit sales Regulatory SetbacksAlthough the FDA has already surpassed last year s tally of new drug approvals  there were a few companies that failed to gain approval for their drugs this year and were issued complete response letters  CRLs  by the agency  A CRL is issued by the FDA to inform the company that its application will not be approved in its present form  There could be several reasons for the same including insufficient data to support approval as well as manufacturing issues Some of the companies that are facing a delay in getting their drugs approved include Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   biosimilar version of Amgen s Neulasta   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   sirukumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis   Valeant  Vesneo   eye drug   and Amgen and UCB  Evenity for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis  Stocks to AvoidAs concerns regarding pricing pressure  slowdown in legacy product sales and biosimilar competition continue to keep the sector volatile  it

126447,347962,BMRN,Ultragenyx s RhGUS Gets FDA Nod For Rare Genetic Disease,opinion,"Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ RARE   announced that the FDA has approved its genetic disorder drug  vestronidase alfa or rhGUS  for treatment of children and adults with mucopolysaccharidosis VII  MPS VII  also known as Sly syndrome   It is approved under the trade name  MEPSEVII 
Notably  mucopolysaccharidosis VII is a progressive and debilitating rare genetic disorder  While rhGUS is the first approved drug for treating this disease 
Shares of Ultragenyx have increased more than 1  in after hours trading on Nov 16  However  shares of the company have underperformed the  so far this year  The stock has lost 31 4  in contrast to the broader industry s increase of 1 7  during the period 

 
It is important to note that the approval was supported by data from a phase III study  designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rhGUS in patients  n 12  aged between 5 and 35 years for MPS 7  a rare lysosomal storage disease  In July 2016  the company announced positive top line data from the study  Treatment emergent adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity 
We remind investors that Ultragenyx submitted a biologics license application   BLA   to the FDA and a marketing authorization application   MAA   to the EU earlier in May  Subsequently  the FDA had accepted the company s BLA on a priority review basis and the company s MAA was also accepted by the EU  Additionally  an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  is awaited in the first half of 2018 
We note that MPS VII represents an underserved market with no approved therapies yet available to treat the disease  Almost 200 patients across the world are afflicted with this disease  one of the rarest forms of MPS  Hence  the approval and successful commercialization of MEPSE VII will thus be a major boost to the company 
Drugs approved for curing other MPS disorders include BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc  s   NASDAQ BMRN   Aldurazyme  MPS I   Naglazyme  MPS VI  and Vimizim  Morquio A Syndrome  MPS IVA  and Shire plc s   NASDAQ SHPG   Elaprase  Hunter syndrome  also called MPS II  Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc  Price

126471,347986,BMRN,BioMarin Says FDA Not Planning An AdCom For Pegvaliase BLA,opinion,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN   announced that the FDA is currently not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting  AdCom  to discuss the Biologics License Application  BLA  for pipeline candidate  pegvaliase 
The company is looking to get pegvaliase approved for lowering blood phenylalanine  Phe  levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria  PKU   a rare genetic enzyme deficiency disorder  having uncontrolled blood Phe levels with existing treatment options 
Notably  the FDA responded to the company s BLA through a Day 74 filing letter  communicating potential review issues  However  we are positive on the FDA s current decision as it indicates the agency s comfort with the safety and efficacy data of pegvaliase submitted from completed clinical studies  Also  the preliminary evaluation of the FDA is in line with the company s expectations 
Additionally  an application in the EU for pegvaliase is expected to be filed by the end of this year 
BioMarin s shares are up 11  so far this year  comparing unfavorably with the 15 5  rally of the  during the period 

We remind investors that in August  the FDA accepted the BLA for pegvaliase under priority review  However  the regulatory body requested additional information on chemistry  manufacturing and controls related to pegvaliase  The company expects submission of this information to the FDA to be classified as a major amendment that will extend the review process by three months  As of now  a decision is expected on Feb 28  2018 
BioMarin is hoping that pegvaliase  if approved  will supplement the company s phenylketonuria portfolio  also including Kuvan  A potential approval will strengthen the company s commercial leadership in the treatment of PKU with potential to drive the company s revenues  going forward 
However  Kuvan is set to face generic competition from 2020 onward  The approval of pegvaliase will help BioMarin offset any loss of revenues from Kuvan in the long term 
Per the company provided information  approximately 50 000 individuals in the developed countries are diagnosed with PKU  representing a significant need for such therapies 
We remind investors that in January last year  BioMarin acquired all global rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase from Merck  NYSE MRK  Serono  Previously  the company had exclusive rights to Kuvan in the United States as well as Canada and to pegvaliase in the United States plus Japan 
With this transaction  BioMarin has gained exclusive worldwide rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase with the exception of Kuvan in Japan  The acquisition of PKU rights in these markets represents a significant opportunity for BioMarin to establish commercial leadership for treatment of PKU  first with Kuvan and then with pegvaliase  upon regulatory developments BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc  Price

126535,348050,BMRN,The Week Ahead  Will Markets Finally Get Some Clarity ,opinion,"We have a light week for data  but plenty of other big news  Earnings season continues  There will be plenty of FedSpeak  and most importantly the results of the U S  elections  I expect everyone to be asking 
Will the election results provide clarity for financial markets  
Personal Note
I know that some readers will not like my conclusions this week  Please read them as investment advice  not voting advice 
Thanks also to readers for the interest and early comments for my latest paper  The Top Twelve Investor Pitfalls   and How to Avoid Them  Readers of WTWA can get a copy by sending an email to info at newarc dot com  We will not share your address with anyone 
Last Week
Last week s economic news was all good  despite the modest negative reaction in stocks  The election story is the culprit 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  two weeks ago   I predicted a focus on the trading range  and whether it would soon be broken  Breaking election news attracted most of the attention with earnings playing a secondary role  Since then  we have experienced a 40 year flood  so to speak  The nine consecutive days of market declines are the most for 36 years  And still counting  Whether the range has been broken remains open to question  but I was wrong about the key theme 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short  Some sources said the market was in the  grip of the worst decline since the financial crisis   Doug notes that the nine days of decline amounted only to 3 09   By comparison  the nine day streak from 36 years ago represented 9 37   Even single day declines can be more than this  including the  3 59  on June 24th of this year  Doug s analysis helps to put the recent trading in perspective 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
The Good 
Personal income and spending were up 0 3  and 0 5  respectively  These results were better than the prior month  and in line with expectations 
ISM manufacturing index registered 51 9 beating the prior month and most expectations  This is roughly consistent with recent GDP readings 
GDP for Q3 increased 2 9   the highest rate in two years  James Hamilton notes that this is still slightly below the long term trend  but good enough to reduce the recession odds of his model to 12 3  

Some skeptics have claimed that the good report is  full of beans  in the words of Dr  Ed Yardeni  While the one time effect of soybean imports was important  he cites several other factors that suggest future strength 
Earnings strength continues  Despite the importance of this story  it has not gotten much attention  The earnings recession is over  as I concluded from our first rate sources a few weeks ago   has some key points in their update 
71  of S P 500 companies have reported earnings above the mean estimate and 54  of S P 500 companies have reported sales above the mean estimate 
For Q3 2016  the blended earnings growth rate for the S P 500 is 2 7   If the index reports growth in earnings for the quarter  it will mark the first time the index has seen year over year growth in earnings since Q1 2015  0 5   

Corporate narrative agrees   tracks hundreds of earnings calls  Their helpful summary includes quotations from the calls  organized into topics  Here is the encouraging list of topic headings for the U S  macro section  There is supporting evidence for each of the points below 

The environment has stayed slow and steady


The economy is fully healed even if it s not setting new records


Conditions are still pretty difficult for industrial companies  but turning up


Still  there s a pervasive sense of uncertainty


CEOs are waiting to see what happens in the election


Companies are setting strategic plans that assume weakness


The consumer has been slowing


But energy and currency are moving from a headwind to a tailwind


Inventories are much leaner than they have been


And pricing pressures are building

Employment 
Non farm payrolls increased by 161 000 and the prior month was revised upward by 35 000 
ADP private employment growth was 147K  23 000 less than expected  but the prior month was revised up by 48 000 
Unemployment decreased slightly to 4 9  
Hourly earnings increased 2 8  on a year over year basis  
One slight negative was initial jobless claims edging higher by 7000  but still historically low at 265K 

The Bad 
ISM non manufacturing registered at 54 8  down from 57 1 in September and missing expectations   has the story  highlighting a comment in the report about the effect of uncertainty from the Presidential election 

The Ugly 
The last days of a very personal and negative election campaign   called for a  mulligan    For non golfers  a complete do over   I would probably just slice another drive into the rough  If you want to change outcomes  you must be willing to reform the process and go to work on your swing  In such a long election season  campaign managers finally resort to techniques that are proven to influence the undecided and the faithful  You and I might be turned off  but we are not the target market 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s winner is Bill McBride of Calculated Risk  Debunking recession calls is not popular  It is not the way to get page views  Please read  to see the full story about the endless parade of recession calls  Here are some of the key points 

Note  I ve made one recession call since starting this blog  One of my  was a recession would start as a result of the housing bust  made it by one month   the recession started in December 2007   That prediction was  for 2007 and  at the time   a  recession is no longer a serious concern   Ouch 
For the last 6  years  now 7  years   there have been an endless parade of incorrect recession calls  The most reported was probably the multiple recession calls from ECRI in 2011 and 2012 
In May of  2015   ECRI finally acknowledged their incorrect call  and here is their admission   


In line with the old adage   never say never    ECRI s  September 2011 U S  recession forecast did turn out to be a false alarm 


I disagreed with that call in 2011  I wasn t even on recession watch 
And here is another call  last December  via CNBC  


Raoul Pal  the publisher of The Global Macro Investor  reiterated his bearishness    The economic situation is deteriorating fast      The ISM report   is showing that the U S  economy is almost at stall speed now   Pal said   It gives us a 65 percent chance of a recession in the U S  
The manufacturing sector has been weak  and contracted in the US in November due to a combination of weakness in the oil sector  the strong dollar and some global weakness  But this doesn t mean the US will enter a recession 
The last time the index contracted was in 2012  no recession   and has shown contraction a number of times outside of a recession 

Bill cites this chart 

Bob Dieli also made both of those calls in real time  as he has been doing for a few decades  His work goes mostly to private clients  It helps all of us to monitor objective sources like this  They benefit only from being right 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have a light week for economic data  but some important earnings reports for retail stocks  I watch everything on the calendar  so you do not need to  Check out WTWA to focus on what is important   and ignore the noise 
The  A  List 
JOLTs report  M   Few understand  but the main use is labor market structure 
Michigan Sentiment  F   Has been weaker than the Conference Board version  An important indicator 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Wholesale inventories  W   Volatile and challenging to interpret  Rebound expected 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
More important than the economic data will be continuing earnings news  We also have almost daily Fedspeak and plenty of international events and speeches  And most important of all   the election 
Next Week s Theme 
With increasing uncertainty about the election outcome and resulting policies  markets pushed the trading range lower over the last two weeks   describes this as an extended period of small lower moves  Each of the daily declines has been less than 0 7   During the same period  the economy has been showing signs of acceleration  Eddy provides a helpful chart 

Earnings have also been solid in the face of the longest market losing streak in 36 years  I expect discussion of the election and the implications of the results to be the key market question 
Will we finally get some clarity  
The possible election results are not binary  There is a wide range of possible outcomes  listed below from bearish to bullish  Please note that I am not opining about who I want to win or how you should vote  I am reporting how the market will probably react under differing circumstances  with some references for you to start your own research 
No clear result  We might think it s over when it s over  but that might not be the case    
Some states might require recounts  either automatic by state law or after a challenge 
A third party candidate might win the electoral votes of one state in a close split between the major parties  That is the explicit objective of candidate Evan McMullin 
Trump and  or supporters might challenge the outcome  possibly with some legal basis  Most people will remember the Bush Gore controversy and the infamous    
The Supreme Court decided that dispute  splitting along partisan lines  Right now  that would be a 4 4 vote  placing emphasis on how states and lower courts decided 

A Trump victory  Estimates are that the market would decline by 5 7   mostly because of increased uncertainty  Many market participants believe that Trump economic and regulatory policies would be market friendly    
A Democratic sweep with a majority in both houses of Congress  The perception  possibly not accurate  is that this would allow a much more aggressive legislative agenda  This is probably not accurate because of the filibuster potential in the Senate  Cloture currently requires 60  out of 100  votes  This serves to block nearly everything that does not have solid overall support  Making it more complicated is the idea of the  nuclear option  where the cloture requirement would be reduced    
Divided control   a Clinton Presidential victory with Republicans maintaining control of one or both houses of Congress  Markets have generally liked a deadlocked government    
Which of these will happen  Join in the comments with your thoughts about the election implications  As always  I ll have a few ideas of my own in the conclusion

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Ben Carlson s post  This is a concern that you see often  because many people equate a high level of the index with  expensive   It is also true that declines begin from a peak  Forgotten in this is that most peaks lead to new peaks  Here is a key table 

And a key quotation 

Here s also another way to think about this   since nearly 7  of all days since 1950 have been an all time high that means that more than 93  of the time the stock market is in a drawdown state from a previous peak  So 9 times out of 10 you are going to be beating yourself up for not selling at the previous high  This is what makes the markets so interesting and excruciating all at the same time  Most of the time you re in a state of regret 

Stock Ideas 
Many people are mystified by the PEG ratio  Chuck Carnevale does a deep dive on the derivation and provides examples to show when and how it should be applied  If you invest in growth stocks  this is a must read article with many ideas 
 draws upon the changes in earnings estimates to highlight attractive sectors for Q416  This is extremely helpful work  and worth a close read  Hint  Technology and Financials 
Is health care a sector to avoid or to embrace   on the decline in the group since July  2015 

Our trading model  Holmes  has joined our other models in a weekly market discussion  Each one has a different  personality  and I get to be the human doing fundamental analysis  We have an enjoyable discussion every week  with four or five specific ideas that we are also buying  This week Holmes likes Biomarin  NASDAQ BMRN   Check out the post  link above  for my own reaction  and more information about the Holmes method 

While we cannot verify the suitability of specific stocks for everyone who is a reader  the ideas have worked well so far  My hope is that it will be a good starting point for your own research  Holmes may exit a position at any time  If you want more information about the exits  just sign up via holmes at newarc dot com  You will get an email update whenever we sell an announced position 

How about housing   has a great post highlighting the big best on housing by one of those who called the decline and has now switched sides  fund manager Donald Mullen  The entire post is worth reading  but here is the key argument 

Given how wary some people are of  why should we be thinking about demand strengthening  Here are a few possibilities 

 seem to be moving out of their parents  basements  and forming households 
Mortgage rates are starting to rise  and the potential for further rate increases could lead potential buyers to getting off the fence 
 constrains inventory  that drives up rental demand as well as prices 
The  and even expand 
Unemployment has been about 5 percent for about a year  and wage increases are finally beginning 



All of these add up to an increase in the number of households  including renters   many of whom go on to become  

This is also what we see from the   consistently higher but with room to run

Final Thoughts 
The election outcomes that the market sees as most distressing are extremely unlikely  The best sources I follow suggest a Clinton victory  a toss up in the Senate  and the GOP retaining the House  These are not partisan pollsters  but those who benefit only from accurate interpretation of data  Here are the key sources and a starting link  The message changes with new information  as we would expect  Barring any fresh news  the outcome has a high probability 
 of the University of Virginia Center for Politics 
  a numbers guru with respect from the Political Science community 
  Their method of median based probability estimation is interesting and plausible 
The resulting gridlock will be perceived as positive  That will be true only if our leaders learn to compromise  There are decisions ahead that require action 
The first market reaction will be positive  if only because the worst cases were avoided and the uncertainty ended  Hedge fund managers who have lagged the market and are hoping to catch up via big short positions will need to cover  Based upon trader commentary and performance reports  this is a large group 
The second reaction will be sector and stock specific  and it will take time  Most of the financial punditry does not realize the limitations on Presidential power  I expect changes in drug pricing policies  for example  but not a sweep against an entire sector  The targets will be the most egregious excesses

126605,348120,BMRN,What s In Store For BioMarin  BMRN  This Earnings Season ,opinion,BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN   is scheduled to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 27  after the market closes  In the last reported quarter  the company had posted a positive surprise of 78 00   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors Influencing This QuarterKey drugs  Vimizim and Kuvan  which drove BioMarin s top line in the second quarter of 2016  should continue the strong momentum this quarter too  Encouraged by the robust performance of Vimizim and Kuvan in the second quarter  BioMarin raised its revenue guidance for 2016  The company now expects revenues in the range of  1 10 billion to  1 15 billion  old guidance   1 05  1 10 billion  On the second quarter 2016 call  BioMarin noted that Vimizim s quarterly sales were driven by solid patient growth and to some extent  by the timing of large orders from Latin America and the Middle East  The company has also benefited from penetration into additional markets  Due to increased patient penetration and contributions from new smaller markets  BioMarin raised the 2016 Vimizim sales guidance to the range of  340 million to  360 million  old guidance   315  340 million   Meanwhile  the product should continue to perform decently with the existing and new patient referrals converting to commercial therapy Kuvan s North American sales continue to be propelled by growth in new patients and high levels of adherence  Internationally  the acquisition of the drug s global rights has opened a stream of orders directly from the majority of the top markets to the company  Driven by new patient additions and contributions from international markets  BioMarin raised its 2016 Kuvan sales guidance to the range of  340 million to  360 million  old guidance   320  350 million  Meanwhile  Naglazyme revenues vary on a quarterly basis primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America  Nevertheless  the drug continued to witness steady patient growth in the second quarter and should do the same in third quarter 2016 On the pipeline front  BioMarin received a regulatory setback during the quarter in the form of an extension of the review period for Brineura  cerliponase alfa  by three months following the submission of additional data from an ongoing extension study  per the FDA s request  The regulatory agency will announce its decision by Apr 27  2017  instead of the previous date of Jan 27  2017 On the positive side  Brineura was accepted for review in the EU  where a decision should be out in the third quarter of 2017  The company is looking to get Brineura approved for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease  a form of Batten disease Operating expenses are expected to be up sequentially On the third quarter call  focus will be on BioMarin s overall performance as well as that of its marketed products  Investors are also expected to keenly await updates on the company s pipeline Surprise HistoryBioMarin s track record has been decent so far  with the company beating estimates in three of the last four quarters  However  over the trailing four quarters  the company has recorded an average negative surprise of 2 60  BIOMARIN PHARMA Price and EPS Surprise    What Our Model EstimatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to likely surpass estimates  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is pegged at  17 95  Zacks Rank  BioMarin currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Although a favorable Zacks Rank enhances the predictive power of the ESP  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative

126606,348121,BMRN,Alexion Graft Versus Host Disease Drug Wins Orphan Status,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation  ODD  to its pipeline candidate  ALXN1007  for the treatment of acute graft versus host disease  GVHD  
The FDA  through its Office of Orphan Products Development  grants this status to candidates that are being developed to treat  prevent or diagnose rare diseases or disorders affecting less than 200 000 people in the U S  This status makes ALXN1007 eligible for certain benefits and incentives including a period of marketing exclusivity in the U S   following an approval for GVHD 
We note that ALXN1007 is a novel anti inflammatory monoclonal antibody that targets complement protein C5a  It is currently being evaluated in a phase II study for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed acute GVHD of the lower gastrointestinal tract  GI GVHD   Moreover it was granted ODD in the EU for the same indication in Aug 2016 
We are encouraged by the FDA granting ODD to ALXN1007  Per Alexion s press release  GI GVHD affects roughly 10  of patients who receive an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant  Patients with severe  acute GI GVHD have a 30 40  mortality rate within the first six months of transplant 
Considering that there are limited treatment options for acute GI GVHD  there exists significant unmet need for treatments targeting this severe and life threatening rare autoimmune disease

126639,348154,BMRN,Alexion Presents New Long Term Phase III Data On Kanuma,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   announced that new long term data from an ongoing  open label extension of the pivotal phase III ARISE study on Kanuma  in children and adults suffering from lysosomal acid lipase deficiency  LAL D   were presented at the World Congress of Pediatric Gastroenterology  Hepatology and Nutrition 
Data demonstrated that marked and sustained improvements in disease related lipid and liver abnormalities were observed in patients with LAL D when treated with Kanuma  In addition  continued treatment with the drug led to a rapid and sustained reduction in alanine aminotransferase  ALT  a marker of liver injury  in 97  of patients  including higher proportion of the same achieving ALT normalization at 52 weeks compared with the initial 20 week period  Moreover  safety profile of Kanuma during the extended open label period was found to be consistent with that observed in the double blind period 
Updated data from the ongoing  open label  phase II III VITAL study on Kanuma in infants were also presented  Results showed that five out of nine infants  when treated with the drug   survived beyond three years of age  with the oldest patient now more than five years old  All five patients continue to receive treatment 
Alexion also intends to present data from the first global LAL D registry  We note that the registry collects long term  real world data on the epidemiology of LAL D  as well as patient outcomes data 
The reported long term data are encouraging and continue to highlight the benefits of ongoing treatment with Kanuma  Per the company s press release  LAL D is a genetic  chronic and progressive ultra rare metabolic disease that can lead to life threatening consequences  including cirrhosis and severe dyslipidemia 
ALEXION PHARMA Price   We note that Kanuma is the first and only approved treatment for patients with LAL D  It is approved in the U S   EU and Japan 
Kanuma was launched in the U S  early in the first quarter of 2016  Meanwhile  the company expects launches outside Germany in the second half of the year with additional launches to follow in 2017  Geographical expansion would boost the drug s commercial potential 
We remind investors that Kanuma became part of Alexion s portfolio following the Jun 2015 acquisition of Synageva BioPharma  We expect investor focus to remain on the commercialization and sales ramp up of Kanuma 
Other companies that focus on the development of treatments for rare and ultra rare diseases include Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG    BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN   and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ RARE

126674,348189,BMRN,Conatus  CNAT  May Surprise In Q2 Earnings  Stock To Gain ,opinion,"Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ CNAT   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 3  after the market closes  Conatus  performance so far has been mixed with the company surpassing expectations on two occasions  while posting in line results in the other two  Overall  the company has posted an average beat of 9 72  In the last reported quarter  Conatus  results came in line with the expectations  Let s see how things are shaping up for the second quarter of 2016 
Emricasan in FocusConatus  a development stage biotech company  is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments targeting liver disease  The company s lead candidate  emricasan  a first in class  orally active pan caspase protease inhibitor  is being developed for the treatment of patients suffering from chronic liver disease Currently  two phase II studies on emricasan are underway  This includes the POLT HCV SVR study  phase IIb  evaluating potential improvements in Ishak fibrosis score in post orthotropic liver transplant  POLT  recipients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis post transplant caused by recurrent hepatitis C virus  HCV  infection in those who have successfully achieved a sustained viral response  SVR  following HCV antiviral therapy and the ENCORE NF study  phase IIb  evaluating potential improvements in fibrosis and steatohepatitis in patients with non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  fibrosis During the quarter  May 2016   Conatus announced positive top line data from the three month  open label  second stage of the phase II liver cirrhosis study on emricasan  The company intends to discuss these results with regulatory authorities in the second half of 2016 and thereafter plans to commence the ENCORE LF study in patients with NASH cirrhosis Conatus also plans to initiate other additional studies on emricasan  Meanwhile  operating expenses at the company are expected to rise  particularly research and development expenses  due to continued investment toward the development of emricasan With no approved product in Conatus  portfolio at the moment  investor focus is expected to remain on the company s progress with emricasan 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
For the second quarter of 2016  our proven model shows that Conatus is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  5 41   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise for the shares 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  and  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates  However  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of Conatus  Zacks Rank  3 and  5 41  ESP makes us reasonably confident of a beat this season CONATUS PHARMA Price and EPS Surprise   Other Stocks That Warrant a Look
Conatus is not the only company looking up this earnings season  Here are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

126675,348190,BMRN,Will AVEO  AVEO  Pull A Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AVEO   is expected to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 8  AVEO has an impressive track record over the last four reported quarters  While the company has beaten estimates on three occasions  it met expectations in one  Overall  the company has posted an average positive surprise of 64 73  
In the last reported quarter  AVEO s results were in line with expectations  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
AVEO  a development stage biopharmaceutical company  is focused on the development of treatments targeting cancer and other areas of unmet medical need  The company has an interesting pipeline with the most advanced candidate being tivozanib  Regulatory applications seeking approval for tivozanib for the first line treatment of renal cell carcinoma  RCC  are currently under review in Europe and Russia  We note that these applications were submitted by AVEO s partners  EUSA Pharma and Pharmstandard  in their respective territories 
During the quarter  AVEO announced the dosing of the first patient in a randomized  controlled  multi center  open label pivotal phase III study  TIVO 3  comparing tivozanib to Nexavar for the treatment of refractory advanced RCC  Top line data from the study is anticipated in the first quarter of 2018  Results from the TIVO 3 study  along with the previously completed TIVO 1 study on tivozanib for the first line treatment of RCC  are expected to support a first  and third line indication for tivozanib in the U S 
Apart from tivozanib  AVEO has several early  and mid stage candidates in its pipeline including ficlatuzumab  phase II   non small cell lung cancer  and AV 203  phase I completed   advanced solid tumors  among others  AVEO has collaborations with several companies for the development of its pipeline candidates 
With no approved product in AVEO s portfolio at the moment  the company depends entirely on license fees  collaboration revenues  and milestone and other payments for its top line  Therefore  the top line may vary on a quarterly basis depending mainly on the timing of these payments 
Investor focus should remain on tivozanib s progress and other pipeline related updates 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that AVEO is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is pegged at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 14 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  Though AVEO has a favorable Zacks Rank  2  an ESP of 0 00  makes a surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions AVEO PHARMACEUT Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks That Warrant a Look

126709,348224,BMRN,Pfizer  PFE  Likely To Beat Earnings In Q2 Again,opinion,"Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 2  before the opening bell  The company has been seen to consistently beat earnings expectations  The company s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 12 80  
In the last reported quarter  Pfizer posted a positive earnings surprise of 21 82   Will this pharma giant be able to beat estimates this time around as well  Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors Driving Q2 Results   New Products   More
At the time of announcing first quarter 2016 results  Pfizer raised both the earnings and revenue outlook for 2016 reflecting strong performance  For 2016  Pfizer expects earnings in the range of  2 38 to  2 48 per share on revenues of  51 billion and  53 billion  Previously  the company guided toward earnings of  2 20  2 30 per share on revenues of  49 billion  51 billion in 2016 
While new products like Eliquis  Xalkori  Xeljanz  Ibrance and Prevnar 13 should contribute to the top line meaningfully  the bottom line should be driven by cost savings and share buybacks 
Ibrance has already earned broad patient and physician acceptance with an encouraging feedback while Eliquis continues to perform well due to market penetration and market share gains in the U S  and Japan  Prevnar 13 uptake continues to be strong among adults reflecting the success of commercial programs  as well as the timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication 
Meanwhile  the Hospira acquisition should be an important growth driver as well with sterile injectables  biosimilars  and infusion system segments performing well  With the integration efforts currently on  Pfizer expects to achieve approximately  1 billion in annual cost savings by 2018  up from an original synergy target of  800 million 
However  Pfizer will continue to face headwinds in the form of genericization and the expiration of a few co promotion agreements  which will continue to hamper top line growth  On the first quarter call the company mentioned that it expects the loss of exclusivity impact from Lyrica  Rebif and Enbrel to be more pronounced in the remaining quarters of the year as compared to the first quarter  Moreover  new product launch expenses and R D investments are also phased higher for the remainder of the year 
On the second quarter call  investor focus is expected to remain on the company s performance along with the performance of new products and the company s pipeline progress including biosimilars and immuno oncology  The company s business development plans will be another area of focus as its decision regarding the splitting of its business is expected by year end  We note that Pfizer acquired Anacor for approximately  5 2 billion in Jun 2016 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
For the second quarter of 2016  our proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 61   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the shares 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  However  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of Pfizer s Zacks Rank  3 and  1 61  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season PFIZER INC Price and EPS Surprise   Other Stocks That Warrant a Look
Pfizer is not the only company looking up this earnings season  Here are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

126710,348225,BMRN,BioMarin  BMRN  May Beat In Q2 Earnings  Stock To Gain ,opinion,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 4  after the market closes  BioMarin s track record has been so far decent with the company beating estimates in three of the last four quarters  Yet  the company has recorded an average negative miss of 7 48  over the trailing four quarters 
In the last reported quarter  the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 58 82   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter Factors to Consider This quarterKey drugs  Vimizim and Kuvan  which drove BioMarin s top line in the first quarter of 2016  should continue to boost the company s performance this quarter as well On the first quarter call  BioMarin noted that Vimizim s sales performance was particularly strong in the EMEA region  as clinical trial patients in the UK converted to commercial therapy  The company has also benefited from penetration in additional markets  Due to increased patient penetration as well as contribution from new smaller markets  BioMarin raised the 2016 Vimizim sales guidance to  315  340 million  old guidance   300  330 million  at the time of announcing first quarter 2016 results  Meanwhile  the product should continue to perform well with existing and new patient referrals converting to commercial therapy While Kuvan s North American sales continued to benefit from growth in new patients coupled with high levels of adherence  the company has started receiving orders directly from the majority of top international markets across the world following the drug s global acquisition rights On the flip side  Naglazyme revenues vary on a quarterly basis primarily due to the timing of central government orders from Latin America  Nevertheless  the drug s patient growth increased 8 5  year over year in the first quarter of 2016 and is expected to demonstrate steady growth Operating expenses at the company are expected to rise sequentially During the quarter  BioMarin announced that it has decided to discontinue the clinical and regulatory development of Kyndrisa for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon 51 skipping  The decision followed the company s discussions with the European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  which hinted at the issuance of a negative opinion  The FDA had also issued a complete response letter for Kyndrisa in Jan 2016 On the second quarter call  focus will be on the company s performance along with that of the marketed products  Updates regarding the company s pipeline will be another area of key focus 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
For the second quarter of 2016  our proven model shows that BioMarin is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  4 00   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise for the shares 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  and  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates  However  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

Factors to Impact Q1 Results
Glaxo expects double digit core earnings growth  at constant exchange rate  in 2016 
As far as the business segments are concerned  the company expects the Pharmaceuticals segment to return to growth this year driven by new products   Anoro Ellipta  Nucala  Tanzeum Eperzan and others   as well as HIV products   Tivicay and Triumeq  This will likely more than offset the declines in Seretide Advair  established products and Avodart  While Seretide Advair sales are expected to continue declining due to pricing and competitive pressures  Avodart went generic in the U S  at the start of fourth quarter 2015 
However  challenges in the form of capacity constraints and economic conditions in emerging markets could hurt the segment s performance  Biennial price cuts in Japan in April  expected in the 5 7  range  will negatively impact the whole year  especially the first quarter  Moreover  returning the rights of Prolia to Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   last December may hurt the segment s performance in Europe 
The Vaccines segment is expected to remain volatile on a quarterly basis  particularly in emerging markets  due to factors like the timing of government tenders  Though it is expected to benefit from the continued uptake of meningitis vaccines  Bexsero and Menveo  acquired from Novartis AG   NYSE NVS     Bexsero could be hit by supply constraints in the first half of the year  especially in the first quarter 
Lastly  growth of Consumer Healthcare business is expected to be sluggish in the first quarter due to the year over year comparison in Flonase s performance 
Notably  currency movement is expected to provide tailwinds and boost first quarter sales by around 2 3  Meanwhile  Glaxo is on track to deliver annual cost saving benefits of  3 billion from its restructuring program  which is largely expected to be complete by 2017 end  In 2016  Glaxo expects the program to deliver  800 million in annual savings On the first quarter call  focus will be on the company s performance  sales ramp up of newly launched drugs and pipeline updates Surprise History

126744,348259,BMRN,Bristol Myers  BMY  Q1 Earnings  Can the Stock Surprise ,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   is scheduled to report first quarter 2016 results on Apr 28  Last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 35 71   Will Bristol Myers be able to beat estimates this time around as well  Let us see how things have shaped up for this quarter Factors Likely to Impact Q1 ResultsBristol Myers  high profile immuno oncology drug  Opdivo  should continue to contribute to top line growth on the back of label as well as geographical expansions  Pricing and reimbursement in additional EU countries should further aid revenues  Other oncology drugs like Yervoy and Sprycel should also continue to perform well in the first quarter of 2016 Apart from oncology drugs  anticoagulant Eliquis  performance should continue to accelerate growth across the key markets where its uptake has been strong  while rheumatoid arthritis drug  Orencia  contributes significantly to revenues 
However  the top line could be under pressure due to the transfer of North American rights for Erbitux and the expiration of commercialization rights of Abilify in the U S  and the EU  Moreover  the company s HIV and HCV businesses are expected to remain under competitive pressure 
We note that Bristol Myers divested its HIV pipeline to ViiV Healthcare  an HIV focused company  in Feb 2016  Meanwhile  unfavorable currency movement will continue to hurt both top  and bottom line growth 
During the first quarter  Bristol Myers continued to actively build its partnership portfolio and pursue strategic acquisitions  In a bid to strengthen and accelerate the development of its immunoscience pipeline  last month  the company announced its intention to acquire a privately held MA based biotech company  Padlock Therapeutics  Inc  The acquisition  which was completed early this month  gave Bristol Myers the rights to Padlock s protein peptidyl arginine deiminase  PAD  inhibitor discovery program focused on autoimmune diseases 
But it s not just immunoscience  the company plans to continue striking acquisitions deals in other therapeutic areas such as oncology  fibrosis and genetically defined diseases 
On the first quarter call  investor focus is expected to be on the performance of recently launched multiple myeloma drug  Empliciti  along with that of other marketed products 
Surprise History
Bristol Myers has an impressive track record  with earnings  The company s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters  with average positive surprise of 35 14  

 
Earnings Whispers
For the first quarter  our proven model does not conclusively show that Bristol Myers is likely to beat estimates  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Bristol Myers is 0 00  since the Most Accurate estimate stands in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents 
Zacks Rank  Bristol Myers carries a Zacks Rank  2  Though this increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

126769,348284,BMRN,Lack Of Liquidity Affects Most Markets,opinion,"We have become accustomed to low volume  low volatility markets  On certain days you can just feel the intensity and flow potential from the start  Markets gap up and hit morning highs  rest and then run hard to finish the day    and all the bulls rejoice  A runaway gap down and followthrough has everyone stumped and waiting for a snapback rally  which may not occur  bids disappear and prices run hard to finish the days on their lows  This has been the mantra so far in 2015 and we just have to get used to it  Sentiment  mostly bullish with the support of the Fed has started to crack a bit  Perhaps stocks are not the only game in town  as bonds continue to attract dollars  So that brings us to a discussion about liquidity  a lack thereof  I mostly trade in the equity option markets  and I have found a disturbing trend  Even the most liquid names with multiple market makers are not interested in providing a fair market  Often times we see very wide bid ask spreads  often nobody on the other side of the trade unless you take a horrible price  It s frustrating when it feels we are getting ripped off  The game of markets is tough enough trying to get on the right side of the trade  but the  games played  make it that much more difficult 
Take BioMarin  NASDAQ BMRN  for example  This is an upstart biotech firm that is near alltime highs  has had decent stock volume and fair open interest  Certain strikes have good open interest and enough activity where the bid ask should be reasonably close  This being January  many stocks have enormous liquidity due to the expiration of LEAP options  The Jan 100 BMRN call this week  just barely out of the money was sporting a bid ask spread of  35 x 1 20  This is preposterous for some egregious market maker  If you re not going make an honest market  then don t be in the issue The options market is not the only one affected by a lack of liquidity  The futures market  where we see big S P 500 contracts trade along with e minis  one of the most liquid of them all   often show wide bid ask spreads as well and tumbling prices at certain points of the day  see my  dirty bombs  chart below for a recent example   Where we have heard algorithmic and and high frequency traders who claim to provide liquidity  they suddenly disappear when the balance is tipped  I m quite surprised there have not been more wide scale flash crashes due to the  games  that are played  and I suspect there have been instances where an event of this magnitude was very close 
Commodities are a different beast than options or futures  but we see some of the same problems  The drop in crude oil over the past seven months has been simply amazing  We have seen  CBOE Crude Oil Volatility  rise sharply  nearly 200  from September 2014  The oil decline has clearly been one sided  certainly helped by the continued supply from OPEC nations  Yet  in futures contracts there have been few  true  bids to balance the market  something not unexpected when a stock commodity is in free fall  I certainly doubt the price of crude will head straight to zero  there will be a fair price to bring buyers to market  but that may be far off  From a chart perspective any attempt at buying since the break in the low 80 s has been trying to catch a falling knife As investors there is a trust that there will be someone on the other side of the trade to provide liquidity  even in the most dire situations  During the 2008 09 financial crisis we saw central banks intervene  stepping up to provide the needed liquidity to keep markets in motion  But there are limitations and moral hazard issues there  Fairness  liquidity and market making should come from the public markets or the trust and belief in our system will be in doubt ",2015-01-18,Bob Lang,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lack-of-liquidity-affects-most-markets-238826,238826

Abbott Laboratories   ABT 


Abbott Laboratories  ABT  moved higher off of the October dip to a broad consolidation range  Currently it is testing the top of the range  and falling trend resistance  The RSI is moving higher and on the edge of a move into the bullish zone over 60 with a MACD moving higher  supporting more upside price action 

BioMarin Pharmaceutical   NASDAQ BMRN 


BioMarin Pharmaceutical  BMRN  has been trending higher since moving up off of a  W V  pattern  Since January it has consolidated under resistance at the round number  Last week saw a move up off of the 50 day SMA to that resistance again  As it rises the RSI is also rising and in the bullish zone with a MACD about to give a buy signal on a cross up 

Cheniere   ARCA LNG 

Cheniere  LNG  had a long run higher before pulling back on a touch at 85  Since October that pullback has started to consolidate in a tightening symmetrical triangle  Friday left it near the top with a RSI tapping on the bullish zone over 60 while the MACD is crossed up and rising 

Rockwell Automation   ROK 

Rockwell Automation  ROK  finally filled the gap from July as it ran up to resistance Friday  As it moves higher this time both the RSI and MACD are rising  supporting a break higher  The Bollinger Bands  are rising as well  giving it room to run

Elsewhere look for gold to lower in the short term in the longer consolidation while Crude Oil consolidates  and may be ready to reverse higher  The US dollar Index looks to continue in a consolidation range while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to pullback in the uptrend and Emerging Markets look to hold in the bear flag  and might prove it a reversal higher 
Volatility looks to remain subdued and now drifting lower  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY IWM and QQQ  Their charts all look strong on both the daily and weekly time frames  If you had to pick a weakness then the gaps in the QQQ chart and move out of the Bollinger Bands  may signal short term exhaustion not seen in the SPY and IWM  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

126771,348286,BMRN,J P  Morgan s 3 Biotechnology Picks,opinion,"By Sarah Roden 
Following the annual J P  Morgan Biotech Napa Forum  analyst offered commentary on a handful on biotechnology stocks  From a macro point of view  Kasimov found that other investors  presentations at the forum were  quite constructive and focused on specific ideas  despite recent volatility in the sector  Although the media continues to highlight the biotech  bubble   the consensus of the analysts  seemed to be that the notion is generally misplaced   Here are the primary takeaways Kasimov offered on his top three near term ideas 
Bluebird bio Inc  NASDAQ BLUE  As one of Kasimov s three top near term ideas  the analyst focused on the future of BLUE s LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease  Bluebird is currently sponsoring a Phase 1 2 clinical trial for the drug in France as well as initiating a separate study in the United States  Last year  BLUE presented data supporting the safety and efficacy of the drug  After meeting with Bluebird executives  Kasimov noted that the date of the  highly anticipated  sickle cell disease treatment update remains unknown  Going forward with testing   the impact on blood transfusions will also be important to monitor  but investors must understand that the process of treating  sickle cell disease  can meaningfully differ from a B Thal   which has already been proven to help 
Cory Kasimov currently has an Overweight rating on Bluebird bio  He has rated the company 3 times since July 2013  earning a success rate of 67  and a  18 7  average return per BLUE rating 
On average  the top analyst consensus for BLUE on is Strong Buy BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc  NASDAQ BMRN  Biomarin is also one of Kasimov s three top picks because he considers the stock to be  uniquely positioned in biotech with an established and growing commercial portfolio  a broad and compelling late stage pipeline  and an orphan disease focus   Kasimov s meeting with executives focused on BMN 111 and drisapersen for muscular dystrophy  BMN 111 is a therapy for achondroplasia  the most common form of dwarfism  The therapy is currently in Phase 2 testing and data should be available later this quarter  Separately from BMN 111  drisapersen should be filed in the U S  this quarter  in which case there will be a new review timeline for the drug  Kasimov added   Despite equivocal Phase 3 data   management  remains optimistic  about drisapersen  given the high unmet need  mechanistic rationale  favorable long term ambulation data from multiple trials  and regulatory precedent in orphan indications  
Cory Kasimov currently has an Overweight rating on BioMarin  He has rated the stock 2 times since February 2015  earning a 100  success rate recommending it with a  21 8  average return per BMRN recommendation 
On average  the top analyst consensus for BMRN on is Moderate Buy Clovis Oncology Inc  NASDAQ CLVS  Kasimov highlighted Clovis as one of his top three picks  as the only company of its size with two  wholly owned  late stage  products with  break through designation    Management was  clearly optimistic  about both rociletinib and rucaparib  Rociletinib  currently being tested for treatment of non small cell lung cancer  was granted break through therapy designation by the FDA  For rociletinib  Kasimov noted   there will be substantially more patients in the  American Society of Clinical Oncology  data  relative to the fall update   but it s hard to think that anything will change too much from prior presentations   There has also been a recent interest in rucaparib  a treatment in testing for tumors in ovarian and pancreatic cancer 
Cory Kasimov currently has an Overweight rating on Clovis Oncology  He has rate the stock 3 times since June 2013  earning a 67  success rate recommending it with an 11 6  average loss per CLVS recommendation 
On average  the top analyst consensus for CLVS on TipRanks is Moderate Buy Overall  Cory Kasimov has a 61  success rate recommending stocks and a  12 6  average return per recommendation To see more rating by Cory Kasimov  visit TipRanks today Sarah Roden writes about stock market news  She can be reached at Sarah tipranks com  ",2015-04-14,Sarah Roden,https://www.investing.com/analysis/j.p.-morgan’s-3-biotechnology-picks-248387,248387
126772,348287,BMRN,5 Stocks To Watch  ADBE  BMRN  EBAY  FBHS  TIF,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Adobe Systems  O ADBE 
Adobe Systems  ADBE  has had a strong climb higher since the August low  It is currently consolidating under 89 in that move but extended from the trend line higher  The RSI is bullish but flat while the MACD is about to cross down  It may be time to pullback and digest some of the gains  Look for both the break out and the failure 
BioMarin Pharmaceutical  O BMRN 
BioMarin Pharmaceutical  BMRN  reported earnings last Thursday after the close and printed a bullish engulfing candle higher Friday  This pushed the stock over the top of an ascending triangle  and it now has a target to the upside of 135  about the top of the previous consolidation range  The RSI is rising and bullish with the MACD rising as well 
eBay  O EBAY 
eBay  EBAY  had been in a falling channel until it reported earnings October 21st after the close  It then launched higher  and is now consolidating  The consolidation is happening in a bull flag in the range of the prior top from July  The RSI is bullish but rolling lower while the MACD is leveling  Look for both the break out and the failure 
Fortune Brands Home   Security  N FBHS 
Fortune Brands Home   Security  FBHS  started higher when it broke a descending triangle in July to the upside  It met the target of 50 50 quickly and kept going to 52 85  It fell hard with the market from there and then moved to resistance again  Another fall back has shown that the 100 and 200 day SMA s are acting as support now  a long term bullish signal  Since late September it has made a higher low and a higher high  the definition of an uptrend  but printed a bearish candle Friday with a long upper shadow  Look for both the break out and the failure 
Tiffany  N TIF 
Tiffany  TIF  fell from an expanding wedge consolidation zone in the low 90 s to an eventual bottom at 75  Since then it has pushed higher and has found resistance at 82 50  The rounded bottom has given a higher low and a Measured Move to 86 60  near the 100 and 200 day SMA s  The RSI is rising and bullish with the bullish and rising MACD 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into November  sees the equity markets have regained a lot of ground lost over the summer but remain mixed 
Elsewhere look for gold to move lower while crude oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US Dollar Index is biased to the upside in consolidation  while US Treasuries look to mark time sideways  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue consolidation around 3400 with an upward bias while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts are mixed though  The QQQ remains the strongest and within a day s move to new all time highs  while the SPY seems extended and may need to consolidate or pullback first  The IWM continues to lag and is mired in consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
