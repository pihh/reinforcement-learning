3682,225197,EW,Edwards Lifesciences  EW  Upgraded To Strong Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Edwards Lifesciences  EW  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Edwards Lifesciences basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Edwards Lifesciences  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Edwards Lifesciences
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this medical device maker is expected to earn  5 60 per share  which is a change of 19 2  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Edwards Lifesciences  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Edwards Lifesciences to a Zacks Rank  1 positions it in the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/edwards-lifesciences-ew-upgraded-to-strong-buy-heres-why-200493859,200493859

138953,360468,EW,Here s Why Edwards Lifesciences Stock Rose 52 3  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW  soared over 52  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  The company  which specializes in medical devices used to address structural heart disease  delivered impressive revenue gains and steadily improved full year 2019 guidance with each quarterly update  That allowed the growth stock to easily beat the 28 8  rise of the S P 500 in 2019 
Management believes growth should continue for the foreseeable future  As of December  Edwards Lifesciences expected to reach the top end of its full year 2019 revenue guidance range of  4 billion to  4 3 billion  The company sees revenue increasing 10  to 12  in 2020  

So what
In the first nine months of 2019  Edwards Lifesciences grew revenue 15 6  compared to the year ago period  Operating income rose only 10  in that span  primarily due to a 22  increase in research and development expenses  The company is investing heavily in the future as it races to capture an expected  10 billion opportunity in transcatheter valve therapy by 2024  
So far  so good  Edwards Lifesciences generated  700 million in revenue from its transcatheter aortic valve replacement  TAVR  portfolio in Q3 of 2019  which represented 64  of total revenue during the period and marked a 26  increase compared to the year ago quarter  
Now what
Edwards Lifesciences is now valued at  49 billion    nearly double its market valuation from the beginning of 2018  On the one hand  the business operates in a high margin niche with relatively large obstacles to entry  On the other hand  the stock is valued at 38 times forward earnings  While the S P 500 is trading at a historic premium as well  investors might not be too surprised to see shares cool off if the broader economy slows ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgh5x,2056987
138954,360469,EW,Edwards Lifesciences  Q4 Update  Results Were Mixed  but Guidance Was Great,news,"Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW  delivered stellar third quarter earnings results in October  Those results helped power the stock to a whopping 52  gain last year 
But Edwards  momentum stalled somewhat during January  That could change  though  after the company reported its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year results after the market closed on Thursday  Here are the highlights from Edwards  Q4 update 

By the numbers
Edwards Lifesciences announced Q4 revenue of  1 2 billion  a 20  increase from the  977 7 million reported in the same quarter of the previous year  This result topped the average analysts  revenue estimate of  1 14 billion  
The company reported net income in the fourth quarter of  280 2 million  or  1 32 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   Edwards  bottom line reflected significant improvement from the GAAP earnings of  7 million  or  0 03 per share  recorded in the prior year period 
Edwards  adjusted non GAAP earnings in Q4 came in at  1 46 per share  up nicely from the  1 17 per share posted in the same quarter of 2018  However  this figure fell below the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate of  1 49 per share 
Behind the numbers
The big story for Edwards Lifesciences in Q4 was the tremendous performance from its transcatheter aortic valve replacement  TAVR  business  TAVR sales soared 30  year over year to  763 million  with the U S  market driving much of that growth 
Edwards  critical care unit also performed well  with sales jumping 12  year over year to  199 million  The company attributed this growth to strong demand for its HemoSphere advance monitoring platform as well as continued customer adoption of its Smart Recovery products 
It was a different picture for Edwards  transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies  TMTT  business  The company reported Q4 TMTT sales of only  7 million  Sales were weighed down by Edwards  voluntary field corrective action for its PASCAL system 
Edwards also experienced some headwinds with its surgical structural heart products  Sales fell 1  year over year to  205 million  The company said that this decline resulted from lower surgical aortic valve procedures performed in the U S  as adoption of its TAVR products increased 
Looking ahead

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  26 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 15 billion  up 17 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 55  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Edwards Lifesciences 
For Edwards Lifesciences  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Edwards Lifesciences will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Edwards Lifesciences would post earnings of  1 22 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 41  delivering a surprise of  15 57  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Edwards Lifesciences doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/edwards-lifesciences-ew-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200501136,200501136

This medical device maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9 67  
For the most recent quarter  Edwards Lifesciences was expected to post earnings of  1 22 per share  but it reported  1 41 per share instead  representing a surprise of 15 57   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 33 per share  while it actually produced  1 38 per share  a surprise of 3 76  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Edwards Lifesciences lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Edwards Lifesciences currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 48   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 30  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

139423,360938,EW,NuVasive  NUVA  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Shares of NuVasive  NUVA  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 3 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  74 1 in the previous session  NuVasive has gained 48 9  since the start of the year compared to the 7 3  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 15 2  return for the Zacks Medical   Products industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 30  2019  NuVasive reported EPS of  0 59 versus consensus estimate of  0 54 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 54  
For the current fiscal year  NuVasive is expected to post earnings of  2 37 per share on  1 16 billion in revenues  This represents a 6 28  change in EPS on a 5 56  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 6 per share on  1 23 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 38  and 5 81   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
NuVasive may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
NuVasive has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 31 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 2X versus its peer group s average of 19 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 44  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  NuVasive currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if NuVasive passes the test  Thus  it seems as though NuVasive shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does NuVasive Stack Up to the Competition

impacts of foreign exchange rates and product mix were offset by spending in support of the new European device regulations and manufacturing variances SG A expenses rose 13 6  year over year to  306 2 million  induced primarily by increased transcatheter structural heart field personnel related expenses  including the expansion of the transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapy field organization

139622,361137,EW,What Makes Edwards Lifesciences  EW  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Edwards Lifesciences  EW   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Edwards Lifesciences basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Edwards Lifesciences imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Edwards Lifesciences
This medical device maker is expected to earn  5 34 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 13 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Edwards Lifesciences  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

139624,361139,EW,Will Edwards Lifesciences  EW  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Edwards Lifesciences  EW   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Instruments industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This medical device maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 54  
For the last reported quarter  Edwards Lifesciences came out with earnings of  1 38 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 33 per share  representing a surprise of 3 76   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 23 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 32 per share  delivering a surprise of 7 32  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Edwards Lifesciences  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Edwards Lifesciences has an Earnings ESP of  0 07  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-edwards-lifesciences-ew-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200470748,200470748

139646,361161,EW,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Edwards Lifesciences  EW  Now,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Edwards Lifesciences  EW  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this medical device maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Edwards Lifesciences is 26 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 13 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 13 2  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Edwards Lifesciences is 20   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 3  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 20 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Edwards Lifesciences  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 9  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Edwards Lifesciences a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

139647,361162,EW,HMS Holdings  HMSY  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of HMS Holdings  HMSY   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 19 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  39 96 in the previous session  HMS Holdings has gained 42  since the start of the year compared to the 3 8  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 23  return for the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 2  2019  HMS Holdings reported EPS of  0 34 versus consensus estimate of  0 26 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5 52  
For the current fiscal year  HMS Holdings is expected to post earnings of  1 3 per share on  643 66 million in revenues  This represents a 25  change in EPS on a 7 58  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 34 per share on  692 97 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 2 99  and 7 66   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
HMS Holdings may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
HMS Holdings has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 30 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 22 1X versus its peer group s average of 15 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 79  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  HMS Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if HMS Holdings meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though HMS Holdings shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does HMS Holdings Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of HMS Holdings have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including INC Research Holdings  SYNH   SARTORIUS  SARTF   and Edwards Lifesciences  EW   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 44  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for HMS Holdings  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-08-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hms-holdings-hmsy-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200455120,200455120

139672,361187,EW,Bull Of The Day  Penumbra  PEN ,opinion,Penumbra  PEN  is a  4 3 billion medical device company focused on minimally invasive instruments for neurovascular and peripheral vascular diseases  The company leverages its expertise in catheter based technology to develop access devices for treating strokes  aneurysms  deep vein thrombosis  pulmonary embolism  and other patient events caused by blood clots  The company takes its name from the shadow like effect in pathology and anatomy where the area surrounding an ischemic event such as thrombotic or embolic stroke can become dark  Immediately following the event  blood flow and therefore oxygen transport is reduced locally  leading to hypoxia of the cells near the location of the original insult  Penumbra technologies use proprietary aspiration catheters  tubes and other instruments to essentially vacuum blood clots out of the brain  in the case of stroke  Based in Alameda  CA  Penumbra sells its products to hospitals and clinics primarily through its direct sales organization in the United States  most of Europe  Canada and Australia  and through distributors in select international markets  Strong Q1 Results Affirm the Growth Story On May 7  Penumbra delivered a 77  earnings beat for Q1 2019 with non GAAP EPS of  0 23 per share vs  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 13 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 06 per share a year ago   The company also beat on the topline with Q1 revenue of  128 4 million vs  the consensus of  123 million  This represented a year over year increase of 25 1   or 27 2  on a constant currency basis  Revenues were split 64  for the US and 36  international for the quarter  Neuro products sales grew to  81 5 million  an increase of 14 1   or 16 5  on a constant currency basis from the year ago quarter  Vascular products sales grew to  47 0 million  an increase of 50 2   or 51 8  on a constant currency basis  Gross profit was  83 9 million  or 65 3  of total revenue  compared to  66 6 million  or 64 8  of total revenue  for Q1 2018  Total operating expenses were  72 8 million  or 56 6  of total revenue  This compares to total operating expenses of  62 5 million  or 60 9  of total revenue  for Q1 2018  PEN management also guided to the high end of their revenue range of  525 to  535 million for 2019  Here s a look at Penumbra s sales growth for the past 3 full years since the company s 2015 IPO     And here s what I wrote about PEN last September after the stock came off of new highs near  160    Growth Catches Up with the Valuation The company made a strong swing to sustainable profitability this year on the back of projected 27 5  sales growth from last year s  333 million to over  425 million in revenue  The profit surge    from last year s loss of 1 cent to a current estimate of   0 34    caught analysts way off guard  We know this because in the last two quarters  the company delivered consecutive 400  EPS beats  And that s why the stock is a Zacks  1 Rank as analysts scrambled to raise full year 2018 EPS estimates 70   since the early August quarterly report  from  0 20 to  0 34  Additionally  2019 top line estimates are currently looking for over 20  growth to a record  500 million  giving Penumbra a 10X price to sales ratio  This sales advance is expected to translate to the bottom line next year with 72  EPS growth to  0 59  At  150 per share  that would put the forward P E multiple under 300X  That s still rich  but characteristic of med tech companies with key patents and strong sales growth  PEN Valuation Update  Trading 7X Sales and 100X EPS  As Penumbra continues to deliver strong growth  valuations are getting much more tolerable for investors  Here s the Zacks Detailed Estimates page so you can see the analyst consensus projections for this year and next     Another excerpt from my September article will shine some light on the bigger players who may be interested in Penumbra s technologies    Med Tech in Spotlight After Cardio Conference Today is the last day of the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutic conference in San Diego  CA  Monday saw a good bit of positive reaction for other  med tech   medical technology  companies like Edwards Lifesciences  EW  whose shares surged 7 5  on positive data in their transcatheter mitral heart valve technology  an offshoot of their tremendous success and market leadership in aortic valve replacement using catheters instead of dangerous open heart surgery  But that rally to new highs above  165  which began with a new weekly closing high Friday above  153  got a boost from a Barron s article by Bill Alpert published Monday morning which used a September 16 Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  research report to suggest that EW could be an M A target for Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ   Lots of speculation there  but Alpert shared important insights by analyst Larry Biegelsen as med tech device M A heats up following last week s fold in of spinal surgery outfit Mazor Robotics  MZOR  by Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT   which already owned about 20  of the company  for  1 64 billion       Mergers among device makers will also probably continue  Lately   Biegelsen  writes  J J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky has called out the increasing innovation and friendlier regulation of devices  compared with some other products   In the afternoon  Allison Gatlin writing for Investors Business Daily made this astute observation   Also helping Edwards on Monday  Abbott  ABT  announced positive results from a study of its MitraClip device in patients with leaky heart valves  The study showed that using the MitraClip plus traditional medical therapy in these patients is superior to medical therapy alone    What About Penumbra  I went through all this M A action and reaction in med tech for a good reason  If you have trouble wrapping your head around PEN s P E of 100X  next year s  1 35 EPS into  135 share   then you have to focus on the growth rates  the TAM  total addressable market   and the M A competition  You may not want to pay 100X  but plenty of large growth investors will when they look at these dynamics  The Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen cited in the Barron s article about EW and BAX is also the lone voice with the highest  aspirations  for Penumbra  with a  180 PT  On August 9 he put out a note title  JET ENGINE Ready for Take Off   as he described the company s new technologies for aspiration procedures in treating stroke  where a deep vacuum suction is sometimes used to aspirate the clot      While new competitors have entered the aspiration market this year with approved devices  we believe that PEN will continue to lead the field with its innovative technology with the new ENGINE pump that launched recently and the JET catheter that is pending FDA approval    Then on August 17  the FDA cleared PEN s Jet 7 aspiration catheter for stroke  Following earnings last week  the Wells Fargo analyst reiterated his  180 PT and noted   While competition in the aspiration stroke market has increased  we believe that PEN has and will continue to stay ahead of the curve  We expect new product launches  including upgrades to the JET ENGINE aspiration system  as well as other innovations that will highlight PEN s growing revenue diversification and growth potential beyond 2019   The PEN is Mightier Than the Scalpel If I learned one thing from my long term investing in med tech companies like Edwards Lifesciences  we originally bought EW in 2017 under  100  it s that technology innovation with catheter based solutions creates less invasive emergency surgical procedures that save lives without putting patients at greater risk  In the case of EW  the ability for a heart specialist to install a new valve in an older patient who would be too high risk for open heart surgery has been a tremendous godsend for many thousands of heart patients and their families  With Penumbra s innovations in neuro procedures  including differentiated solutions for access  stroke revascularization  and embolization for use in the neurovasculature  they are offering brain specialists new avenues for treating and saving patients with severe neuro vascular events  And the innovation pathways for PEN are expanding in other exciting ways too  On September 4  the company closed on the  20 million acquisition of a controlling interest in its joint venture  MVI Health  which was created to be a leader in virtual reality software and tracking solutions for healthcare applications  The possibilities of advanced surgical and catheter based procedures using virtual and augmented reality must have even the robot surgeons jazzed  Disclosure  I own shares of PEN  JNJ and EW for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio  Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the

139673,361188,EW,HOLX Vs  EW  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical   Instruments sector might want to consider either Hologic  HOLX  or Edwards Lifesciences  EW   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Hologic has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that HOLX s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
HOLX currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 54  while EW has a forward P E of 32 81  We also note that HOLX has a PEG ratio of 2 07  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  EW currently has a PEG ratio of 2 22 
Another notable valuation metric for HOLX is its P B ratio of 5 57  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  EW has a P B of 10 47 
These metrics  and several others  help HOLX earn a Value grade of B  while EW has been given a Value grade of D 
HOLX has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than EW  so it seems like value investors will conclude that HOLX is the superior option right now ",2019-05-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/holx-vs-ew-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200423019,200423019

139699,361214,EW,Edwards Lifesciences  EW  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Edwards Lifesciences  EW  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 23 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 8  
Revenues are expected to be  988 88 million  up 10 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Edwards Lifesciences 
For Edwards Lifesciences  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 60  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Edwards Lifesciences will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Edwards Lifesciences would post earnings of  1 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Edwards Lifesciences doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/edwards-lifesciences-ew-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200407305,200407305
139700,361215,EW,So Far  So Good For Earnings Season ,opinion,"The first full week of earnings season is in the books  and its been OK for the most part 
	That s not exactly a glowing review  especially when compared to previous seasons  Nonetheless  its pretty encouraging after months of estimate cuts and recession concerns  
	According to the latest Earnings Preview from Sheraz Mian  nearly 80  of S P companies that have reported so far have beaten EPS estimates  And a little more than 54  have topped revenue expectations  This is hardly a celebratory showing  but it isn t doom and gloom either   said Mian  
	We knew this earnings season was going to be softer than usual  but we hoped that these lowered expectations would make it easier for stocks to outperform  So far  so good  However  its still really early with a majority of companies left to report  
	The major indices ended this low volume  holiday shortened week with gains  which continued the pattern of bouncing between slight advances and slight declines  Stocks were sluggish in the morning  but climbed to the plus side by the close due to the decent start to earnings season along with a solid retail sales report for March   1 6   and the successful IPOs of Pinterest  NYSE PINS  and Zoom  ZM

	It s been a boring week  Two of the major indices barely moved  But we ll take it  It s much better than the earnings recession that we ve been hearing about

When looking at the last two reports  this medical device maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 7 84   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Edwards Lifesciences was expected to post earnings of  1 01 per share  but it reported  1 07 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 94   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 13 per share  while it actually produced  1 24 per share  a surprise of 9 73  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Edwards Lifesciences lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Edwards Lifesciences has an Earnings ESP of  0 86  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 31  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-edwards-lifesciences-ew-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200373705,200373705
139748,361263,EW,Edwards Lifesciences  EW  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Edwards Lifesciences  EW  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 17 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 5  
Revenues are expected to be  973 72 million  up 9 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 16  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP

For Edwards Lifesciences  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 86  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Edwards Lifesciences will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Edwards Lifesciences would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 07  delivering a surprise of  5 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Edwards Lifesciences appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/edwards-lifesciences-ew-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378949,200378949

Let s delve deeper into the numbers Pacific Biosciences of California  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Product Revenues in Focus
Pacific Biosciences  flagship platform   the Sequel system   has been fortifying the company s footprint worldwide  In fiscal 2017  product revenues accounted for a whopping 87 6  of the company s net revenues  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  the segment posted revenues worth  21 8 million  up 5 9  year over year 
It is encouraging to note that for the current quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s revenues is fixed at  21 8 million  up 2 6  on year over year basis 
Consumable revenues in the fourth quarter were  12 7 million  up 70  on a year over year basis  marking the metric s eighth consecutive quarter of growth on continued consumable sales momentum  This upside was driven by an increased utilization of the company s growing installed base of sequel systems  also known as the PacBio Sequel system 
However  instrument revenues dipped 29 8  to  9 2 million  on year over year basis 
Other Factors at Play
PacBio Sequel System Drives Growth
Per management  Sequel generated revenues grew more than eight fold in the fourth quarter  representing a whopping 80  of fourth quarter revenues  Additionally  BGI China ordered 10 Sequel Systems  making it one of the primary growth drivers of Pacific Biosciences 
Since the past year  a number of studies have been using or planning to use the PacBio whole genome sequencing with a goal to increase cure rates of genetic diseases  These studies include Stanford University School of Medicine  the European Solve RD Consortium  performing a 500 individual rare disease study  and Novogene  which has announced plans to sequence 1 000 Chinese genomes 
The platform has also witnessed a series of developments lately  The flagship PacBio Sequel is currently being used by the Alabama based HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology  to support the goal of dramatically increasing the diagnostic success rate in challenging pediatric clinical cases  Moreover  Beijing based Annoroad Gene Technology has recently placed a purchase order of 10 PacBio Sequel Systems  which is expected to increase Annoroad s large scale genomic service capabilities across various fields 
View Mixed
For the first quarter of 2018  revenues are expected to be slightly lower than the reported count in fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to seasonality  Banking on a better than expected fourth quarter show  Pacific Biosciences expects its 2018 revenues to grow 20  from the year ago figure  translating to approximately  112 million in total revenues 
Shrinking Service Revenues   Margins
In the last reported quarter  revenues in the Service and Other segment fell 18 3  on a year over year basis to almost  21 8 million  For full year of fiscal 2017  revenues in the segment deteriorated 4 3  compared to full year 2016 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s revenues in the first quarter is fixed at  3 31 million  down 8 6  year over year 
On the other hand  gross margin in the quarter was 38 1   down 610 basis points year over year  while the company incurred an operating loss of  20 5 million  wider than a loss of  17 8 million in the year ago quarter

139776,361291,EW,How To Play The New Hawkish Fed ,opinion,"The FOMC is poised to raise the Fed funds target rate by a quarter point in about an hour  And this is with over 95  certainty as this morning s PPI inflation data came in hotter than expected 
But what market players will be most focused on is the  dot plot  of the pace of future hikes  Will they show that two more rate increases are more likely this year 
Or will they show that some committee members think the economic growth and inflation data warrant 3 more hikes 
In the video that accompanies this article  I go over the market psychology of large investors and why any fear driven stock market sell off about the Fed s views should be seized as a buying opportunity 
In addition to explaining the things that investors are worried about  like a flattening yield curve and rising inflation data  I give my 3 probability weighted scenarios for the stock market s reaction 
I also share some wisdom from one of my favorite economists  Brian Wesbury of First Trust 
While I have been an astute Fed watcher for a couple of decades  I m leaning on Brian here to help us navigate what level of interest rates this economy can handle and still support expansion and investor optimism 
I come away completely confident in my conclusion to buy whatever sell off unfolds over the coming days  or weeks 
And some of my favorite stock targets will be Alibaba   NYSE BABA    Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX    Centene   NYSE CNC    and Edwards Lifesciences   NYSE EW    the latter two which have been making great new all time highs this month

 What are 2 sure things I would tell retail investors they could buy right now that would put their money to work at incredible levels  let them sleep at night during the volatility  and make them very happy 5 years from now  My two no brainer choices were my favorite baskets of innovation and long term growth  the Technology SPDR ETF  XLK  and the Nasdaq Biotech Index  IBB  The Technology play was probably obvious to anyone who had just bought a smartphone or new car full of semiconductors  But the Biotech one might still seem risky to some How could I be so confident it was a  sure thing   Because I started identifying the key  megatrends  that made the frontiers of the life sciences and medical R D so promising for decades to come You can read my latest description of those growth drivers in this report   In 2013  I ran a trading portfolio at Zacks that racked up a 66  return primarily on the back of Biotech stocks in that strong bull run they had  2014 and 2015 proved much more difficult with big corrections and then a peak But my  megatrends  proved profoundly resilient  And they inspired us to start a new long term portfolio at Zacks focused directly on them We called it  and launched in April of 2017 Since then  some of the gains have been fantastic   Sangamo Therapeutics  SGMO   155 61   closed trade bluebird bio  BLUE   138 17   still holding after JUNO buyout Editas Medicine  EDIT   115 33   still holding on gene editing innovation Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT   106 84   still holding as leading company in Duchenne muscular dystrophy Juno Therapeutics  JUNO   98 06   sold after Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  acquisition Note  BLUE  EDIT  and SRPT are still open trades showing these gains as of Thursday morning on 3 8 2018 That JUNO closed trade was following the buyout by Celgene  CELG  in January  And we had already executed and closed a big swing trade in JUNO for 70  gains in 2017 And for a wonderful and profitable  fat tail  event  the same day JUNO was acquired  our Bioverativ  BIVV  was purchased by the French pharma giant Sanofi  PA SASY  for a big premium which handed us a 75  winner

139854,361369,EW,3 Stocks To Gain As Trump Pulls Plug On Infamous MedTech Tax ,opinion,"The U S  Medical Device industry has been riding high on optimism  courtesy of the Senate s latest decision to postpone an industry wide excise tax for another two years  known as the  Medical Device  tax 
Notably  the tax will be effective from on Jan 1  2020  The bill also delays the so called Cadillac tax  a 40  tax on employer insurance  until 2022 
The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9 000 America based medical device manufacturers  instilling investor s optimism in them 
The Medical Device Tax 
 This is a tax on innovation  a tax on jobs and a tax on the health and well being of millions of American patients     Scott Whitaker  president and CEO of the Advanced Medical Technology Association 
The Medical Device taxes were originally implemented in 2013 as part of the Obamacare  The taxes imposed a 2 3  excise tax on MedTech manufacturers  reducing the research and development  R D  prospects 
Considering the headwinds  the senate placed a temporary suspension on these taxes from January 2016 to December 2017  Per data provided by the medical device trade group  in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller   the partial two year repeal of the MedTech tax resulted in around 83  rise in R D investments by MedTech players 
However  the taxes were again brought back on Jan 1  2018  But on Jan 22  the Fed came with its new law of respite with a  31 billion bill of tax cuts 
Why is the MedTech Fraternity Happy  
Revamps R D Stature
MedTech companies will now be able to reinvest profits  tax savings  and enhance the R D stature  launch new products  reduce capital depreciation  invest in early stage med tech companies  execute clinical trials and  fuel the next generation of life changing technologies for patients  
A report by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation suggests that big shots like Boston Scientific   NYSE BSX   expressed concern in an email statement regarding lesser investments in innovative projects with leading medical facilities if the taxes were back  
Employment
The tax repeal is likely to reinforce domestic production  increase hiring of skilled professionals and lower the nation s overdependence on offshore productions  Reports suggest that a complete repeal could generate more than 53 000 jobs very soon and increase wages 
Per a report by Modern Healthcare  reports suggest that 28 000 jobs were lost nationally in three years in which the tax was in effect  If the taxes were reestablished  the nation might have suffered cumulative loss of 25 000 jobs by 2021 
Let s take a quick look on three major MedTech companies that are going to make the best out of the recent Tax Repeal upheaval 
3 Stocks to Ride High on the Trends
There are hardly any evidences of MedTech companies witnessing strong R D growth and margin expansion because of the tax repeal in 2016  However  the market expects the recent tax repeal to have a favorable impact on R D and margin in the upcoming quarters  If that happens  the following three companies would be the leading ones 
We have taken the help of the  to select favorable stocks  To shortlist the stocks from the vast universe of medical devices  we have picked the ones that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Surmodics  Inc    NASDAQ SRDX    The stock sports a Zacks Rank  1  In the past year  the stock has returned 39 1   higher than the industry s return of 16 9  
Surmodics  efforts to improve research and development stature have been a key growth driver  The company s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus based below the knee DCB  Drug Coated Balloon  program deserve a mention  Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed  014 DCB balloon platform
In the non drug delivery R D pipeline  Surmodics received the FDA clearance for its Telemark support microcatheter  The Telemark support microcatheter offers superior crossability for complex coronary and peripheral lesions  This microcatheter combined Surmodics  extreme composite shaft technology with a high performance pristine hydrophilic coating  that together provide exceptional deliverability  kink resistance and complex lesion crossing 
First quarter of fiscal 2018  R D expenses were 46  of net sales  up from 33 6  of net sales in the year ago quarter 

 
Edwards Lifesciences Corp    NYSE EW    The stock has a Zacks Rank  2  In the past year  the stock has returned 49 1   higher than the industry s return of 24 7 
In December 2017  Edwards Lifesciences announced a strategic framework  The outlook indicates the company s long term growth strategy and recent progress in technology pipeline  In THV  Transcatheter Heart Valves   Edwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership in the global TAVR market through increased focus on expanding patient access 
On the margin front  the company anticipates moderate expansion in gross margin on an improving mix  partially offset by capacity investments  More specifically  in terms of capacity investments  heavy investments are going into facilities and expanding the capacity in the United States and outside  Edwards Lifesciences also expects the global TAVR opportunity to exceed  5 billion by 2021 

 
Haemonetics Corporation   NYSE HAE   The stock sports a Zacks Rank  1  In the past year  the stock has returned 57 7   higher than its industry s return of 15 
Continued momentums in new business generation and geographical expansion have helped the company deliver strong results in the quarter  The company s strong cash position boosts investors  confidence  The expansion in gross and operating margin buoys optimism  The raised fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings guidance is also impressive 

 
The Paradox
Not to forget  the brunt of this tax relief is huge

 Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Alibaba   NYSE BABA    NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA    Edwards Lifesciences   NYSE EW    Sangamo Therapeutics   NASDAQ SGMO   and bluebird bio   NASDAQ BLUE   Recession Is Coming  NotThe big headline this week for market players was from the chief of the biggest hedge fund in the world  Ray Dalio of Bridgewater  which has AUM  assets under management  north of  150 billion  From Reuters   Head of world s largest hedge fund says U S  in a  pre bubble phase  with a 70  chance of recession I think we are in a pre bubble stage that could go into a bubble stage   the hedge fund manager said during a Harvard Kennedy School s Institute of Politics on Wednesday Okay  that sounds pretty good for stock investors who know how to play the game  As I ve said for years  we ain t near  euphoria  nor  irrational exuberance  yet  so buying the dip in strong growth companies is still the game plan But then he throws in the  70  chance of recession  analysis in the same breath What Dalio actually said was that he is estimating the probability of a recession by the 2020 presidential election at 70  He is also quoted as saying recently  the risks of a recession in the next 18 24 months are rising  Okay  that also makes more sense  A lot can happen in 2 years  Inflation could spike  sending interest rates higher and inverting the yield curve  one of the classic harbingers of economic recession Any reasonable economist or investment asset manager could be modeling a 50  probability of recession in the next 18 months as a  look out  for unknown unknowns  i e    black swans  Feeling Stupid  or Savvy But Dalio is also the same guy who last month told global investors at Davos that  if you re holding cash  you re going to feel pretty stupid  as the stock market was due to rocket to fresh heights The next week  the  flash correction  began  I decided I would feel stupid if I didn t have cash for that dip  So we sold some stuff near the highs and bought the lows aggressively  That  with lots of stock charts So what do we do with these big warnings from a hugely successful asset manager I believe you need to stay focused on the fundamentals which argue for continued fund flows into equities over the next 18 months On October 9  I wrote a special report for Zacks Confidential titled   Here was a good summary of my  better than gold  investment thesis   If you follow my portfolios  media appearances  or other investment commentary  you know the primary macro themes that have made me stay aggressively long growth and technology stocks this year In case you ve lost track  I will list a few of them that are extremely relevant   1  Global economic momentum  however slow   steady it appears2  Interest rates on our side  as investors in any asset class3  Technological innovation unleashed in so many industries that the exponential results are staggering4  Consumer worker adaptations to rapid change and innovation are astoundingly positive for corps5  While automation threatens the need for that dastardly concept of Universal Basic Income  tech science entrepreneurs across the planet continue to create and build wealth for more people around the globe end of Zacks Confidential excerpt In that report  after giving a detailed explanation    including inflation  interest rate  and US dollar dynamics    of why gold was not a favorable choice for our investment capital  I picked 3 growth stocks for Zacks members from Retail  Technology  and Healthcare that I believed would outperform gold over the next 12 18 months They wereAlibaba  NVIDIA and Edwards Lifesciences After making new all time highs above  200  Alibaba has fallen back in line with gold and the S P 500 Meanwhile NVDA and EW are stealing the show  as strong growth franchises like to do And I m sticking with all 3 names this year  But I have a boatload more ideas that I either own or I m tracking every week For instance  if you believe that this  has more room to run  then you d be a buyer of Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  And if you like picking Biotech ponies  you might have joined me in our recent 155  gain in Sangamo Therapeutics  Meanwhile we still own bluebird bio from  95 and a handful of other promising Healthcare Innovators Bottom line Let s say Dalio is only half right about all his bold predictions  That means we can bank on stocks continuing to  bubble up  over the next year and we need only keep a vigilant eye on the inflation rates picture and economic data for early signs of trouble  of which I

ReleaseChicago  IL   September 25  2017    highlights Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE   NYSE EW      as the Bull of the Day  Bed Bath   Beyond  Nasdaq   NASDAQ BBBY      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Annaly Capital Management  Inc   NYSE   NYSE NLY        AGNC Investment Corp   Nasdaq   NASDAQ AGNC       and ARMOUR Residential REIT  Inc   NYSE   NYSE ARR       Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE       the  24 billion global leader in structural heart disease innovations  is still a Zacks  1 Rank Strong Buy after reporting strong Q2 results and improved guidance for Q3 that prompted analysts to raise EPS estimates The solid jump in estimates for this year and next is what has kept EW a Zacks  1 for over 7 weeks Edwards Lifesciences  second quarter sales grew 10 9  to  841 8 million  beating the consensus  Underlying sales increased 15 3   including the impact of German customers stocking shelves for additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation Revenues were driven by considerable growth in the company s primary solution  the transcatheter aortic valve replacement  TAVR  device  which  as the name implies  is a specialized collapsible valve that can be inserted into a patients heart via a catheter  thus eliminating the need for major invasive surgery This innovation is especially welcome for older or at risk heart patients whose doctors are concerned about the dangers of surgery In 2011  the FDA approved the Sapien valve invented by Edwards as the first approved transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis By the end of 2015  nearly 55 000 procedures had been performed Hydraulic Pump Engineer Creates First Successful Heart ValveEdwards Lifesciences  roots date to 1958  when Miles  Lowell  Edwards set out to build the first artificial heart Edwards was a 60 year old  recently retired engineer holding 63 patents in an array of industries  with an entrepreneurial spirit and a dream of helping patients with heart disease  His fascination with healing the heart was sparked in his teens  when he suffered two bouts of rheumatic fever  which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail With a background in hydraulics and fuel pump operations  Edwards believed the human heart could be mechanized  He presented the concept to Dr  Albert Starr  a young surgeon at the University of Oregon Medical School  who thought the idea was too complex  Instead  Starr encouraged Edwards to focus first on developing an artificial heart valve  for which there was an immediate need After just two years  the first Starr Edwards mitral valve was designed  developed  tested  and successfully placed in a patient  Newspapers around the world reported on what they termed a  miraculous  heart surgery This innovation spawned a company  Edwards Laboratories  which set up shop in Santa Ana  California   not far from where Edwards Lifesciences  corporate headquarters is located today It also spawned decades more of further innovation in heart valve replacement technology  with the non surgical catheter procedures being the most remarkable  as they give new hope to older or other at risk patients who may not be able to withstand surgery  Bed Bath   Beyond  Nasdaq      reported a second straight quarter of lower than expected results in its Q2 fiscal 2017 report last week  Not only did the company miss consensus expectations on both the top and bottom lines  but these results fell on a year over year basis as well Results continued to be hurt by sluggish store traffic and escalated costs  somewhat compensated by continued strength witnessed across the company s customer facing digital network  Moreover  Hurricane Harvey also had an unfavorable impact on the results this quarter My colleague Neena Mishra wrote about BBBY as Bear of the Day in late June after their Q1 report when the stock was still trading above  30 and she concluded then    In addition to disappointing foot traffic in malls  the retail space is going through a shift toward online shopping  particularly from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   With tightening labor markets  wage pressure has also started hurting retailers  BBBY stock is down about 25  year to date but a rebound any time soon does not appear likely  Q2 in DetailThe company s quarterly adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share declined 32 4  year over year  coming well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents  Results were hurt by about 2 cents from expenses related to Hurricane Harvey and 1 cent from the adoption of new accounting standards  The bottom line was also hit by costs related to investments in improved customer experience Management recently revealed plans to speed up the process of realigning its store management organization as part of its efforts to enhance omni channel operations and focus on customers  On including the 8 cents impact from restructuring costs related to the aforementioned plans  earnings plunged 39 6  to 67 cents per share Further  the home furnishing retailer s net sales dipped 1 7  to  2 936 4 million  which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 006 1 million  Sales were primarily hurt by soft comparable store sales  comps   somewhat compensated by gains from a 0 9  rise in non comp sales including PMall  One Kings Lane and new stores Comps in the quarter under review dropped 2 6   resulting from lower transactions in stores  somewhat offset by greater average transaction amount  While comps from customer facing digital networks improved over 20  for the 13th time in a row  comps at stores fell at a mid single digit rate Bed  Bath   Beyond s gross profit declined 4 3  to  1 068 6 million in the quarter with gross profit margin contracting 100 basis points  bps  to 36 4   The fall in gross margin stemmed from higher direct to customer shipping expenses  lower merchandise margin and a rise in coupon expense on account of increased redemptions  This could be only partly offset by lower average coupon amount The decline in gross profit  along with a rise in SG A expenses led the operating profit to deteriorate nearly 40  to  168 8 million  Likewise  the operating profit margin contracted about 360 bps from the prior year quarter to 5 8  Bottom line  The death of brick and mortar retail may be premature and overexaggerated  but until the EPS estimates for BBBY stop going down and start going back up  I d shop for retail investments elsewhere Additional content What the Recent Fed Meeting Means for Mortgage REITsAt the end of the two day meeting on Wednesday  the Federal Reserve noted that it will commence its balance sheet normalization program this October  However  the central bank refrained from raising the benchmark interest rates for now The central bank will downsize its  4 5 trillion bond portfolio by allowing maturity of up to  10 billion of mortgage backed securities and Treasury bonds every month  without reinvesting the proceeds  The monthly cap will gradually increase until it reaches  50 million Since an outright sale could cause major turbulence in the bond market  the Fed has resorted to the above mentioned steady and gradual run off process  This action is anticipated to put upward pressure on the long end of the yield curve Moreover  the Fed s decision to keep the short term interest rates unchanged will help steepen the yield curve This is a sign of relief for mortgage real estate investment trusts  mREITs   which typically borrow significant amount of short term debt and invest in longer term real estate debts  like mortgage backed securities  MBS  and mortgages  It will also enable these companies to earn higher yield spread Further  the prospects of a steepening yield curve will result in capital rotation from stocks to safe haven bond markets  This is primarily because these markets will provide attractive returns at lower risks  This too can improve the performance of mREITs That being said  year to date  the  has

Medtronic PLC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Segment Details
The company currently generates revenues from four major groups  viz  Cardiac   Vascular Group  CVG   Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  MITG   Restorative Therapies Group  RTG  and Diabetes Group 
CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure  CRHF   Coronary   Structural Heart  CSH  and Aortic   Peripheral Vascular divisions  APV   MITG includes both the Surgical Solutions and the Patient Monitoring   Recovery  PMR  divisions  RTG includes the Spine  Brain Therapies  Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments  while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management  IIM   Non Intensive Diabetes Therapies  NDT   and Diabetes Service   Solutions  DSS  divisions 
Revenues at CVG improved 6  at CER  or up 5  as reported  to  2 65 billion  driven by strong  balanced growth across all three divisions 
CRHF sales were  1 39 billion with 5  year over year at CER  up 4  as reported   This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER  amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system  strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope and continued worldwide customer demand for the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitor  This apart  the HeartWare International acquisition drove growth in the Heart Failure division 
CSH revenues were up 8  at CER  7  as reported  to  817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe 
APV revenues registered 5  growth at CER  up 4  as reported  to  439 million  driven by the continued adoption of the Endurant IIs aortic stent graft and remarkable strength of the Heli FX EndoAnchor System  Peripheral was driven by low double digit growth in both atherectomy and drug coated balloons 
In MITG  worldwide sales reached  2 49 billion  marking a 3  year over year increase at CER  same as reported  on mid single digit growth in Surgical Solutions and low single digit growth in PMR 
In RTG  worldwide revenues of  1 81 billion were up 2  year over year at CER  same as reported  on high single digit growth in Brain Therapies  mid single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low single digit growth in Spine  thus mitigating a decline in Pain Therapies  However  revenues from the Diabetes group decreased 1  at CER  same as reported  to  449 million 
Margins
Gross margin during the reported quarter contracted 20 basis points  bps  to 68 2  despite a 2 8  increase in gross profit to  5 04 billion  Adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 26 3   This was owing to a 1 4  decline in research and development expenses  to  548 million  which was offset by a 2 3  rise in selling  general and administrative expenses  to  2 49 billion   Other expenses in the reported quarter were  66 million as compared with  39 million in the year ago period 
Guidance
Medtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant currency revenue and EPS guidance  The company still expects full year revenue growth in the range of 4 5  at CER  However  the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation  which is now projected to have a positive  380  480 million impact in the fiscal year compared to an expected positive impact of  75  175 million stated previously  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at  30 72 billion for fiscal 2018 
Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9 10  at CER  Currency translation is now expected to have an adverse impact of 3 cents to a positive impact of 1 cent compared with the earlier expectation of negative impact of approximately 5 10 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at  4 89 
Moreover for the second quarter of fiscal 2018  Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of  25  75 million on revenues  Currency translation is expected to have a favorable impact of 0 2 cents on second quarter earnings per share 
Our Take
Medtronic s exited the fiscal fourth quarter on a mixed note with earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the reported revenues failing to meet the estimates  While the company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER  escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on bottom line  Unfavorable currency translation acted as a dampener to the company s quarterly performance  However  the fiscal guidance represents chances of respite 
On a positive note  three major business groups contributed to solid top line growth at CER  which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions  in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets  We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend  successfully continuing in the U S  as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies  Apart from product innovation  the company is currently focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses

Accuray Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Segment AnalysisProduct Revenues  Revenues at the segment increased 38  to  60 6 million  System order conversions of backlog to revenue in the Americas and APAC regions buoyed growth in the segment  Solid performances in the CyberKnife  TomoTherapy Systems and Radixact platforms are the key highlights of the segment Service Revenues  Revenues at the segment saw a modest year over year increase of 1  to  51 5 million  Per management  lackluster performance at the segment was primarily due to lower installations Gross Order Update  In the reported quarter  gross product orders totaled  85 7 million  increasing 5  on a year over year basis  At the end of the quarter  product backlog was  452 8 million  approximately 12  higher year over year  Gross order performance was favorably impacted by the company s flagship Radixact System and the CyberKnife System with the InCise Multileaf Collimator Other HighlightsRadixact Platform Drove Sales  The company s new TomoTherapy product platform  also known as Radixact  continued to contribute to the company s top line  Radixact represented majority of Accuray s TomoTherapy order mix in the reported quarter  up 25  on a sequential basis from the third quarter APAC and Japan witnessed stellar performances at the Radixact and TomoTherapy platforms  Radixact orders in Japan have been extremely positive to date The Precision System  Accuray also announced its new precision treatment planning system recently  The system leverages on the company s flagship Radixact and CyberKnife system platforms  The company also plans to build on this technology with Precision 2 0 upgrade by fiscal 2018  This will provide significant improvements in treatment speed and overall throughput of the already existing CyberKnife system IBMS Data Management System for TomoTherapy  Accuray also announced 510 k  clearance for the new IBMS data management system for TomoTherapy  It is a centralized database that shares and makes data accessible between multiple accurate systems adding flexibility and improving workflow efficiency in the radiation therapy department Margin DetailsGross margin  as a percentage of net revenues  contracted 80 basis points  bps  in the fourth quarter to 36 4   This was primarily due to reduced product gross margins  Product gross margins decreased due to unfavorable product and channel mix Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were  40 4 million  almost flat with  40 3 million in the year ago period GuidanceAccuray issued guidance for fiscal 2018 The company projects full year revenues in the band of  390 million to  400 million  This represents growth in the band of approximately 2  and 4  on a year over year basis  Furthermore  product revenues are expected to increase in the band of 5  to 10  year over year and service revenues are likely to remain flat with fiscal 2017 The company expects a 5  increase in gross orders in fiscal 2018  The product system backlog is expected in the band of  445 million to  460 million Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2017 is anticipated in the range of  25 million to  30 million  up 23  to 47  year over year Our TakeAccuray reported wider than expected loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  primarily due to lackluster performance in the service revenue segment  The company issued solid fiscal 2018 guidance  Of the recent developments  orders for the newly unveiled Radixact System  solid revenue performance in APAC and Japanese regulatory approval for Radixact are key positives in our view  However  unfavorable product mix  declining service revenues  sluggish macro economic conditions and pricing headwinds are major concerns  Notably  China and Europe saw sluggish revenues in the fourth quarter  Accuray s significant international presence helps broaden its customer base  However  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  particularly with a strong dollar  will continue to adversely impact the company s

140118,361633,EW,Edwards Lifesciences  QIWI  Lowe s  The Home Depot And Amazon com Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 24  2017   Zacks Equity Research highlights Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE   NYSE EW      as the Bull of the Day QIWI plc  NASDAQ   NASDAQ QIWI     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Shares of Lowe s  NYSE   NYSE LOW       The Home Depot  Inc   NYSE   NYSE HD      and Amazon com  NASDAQ   NASDAQ AMZN       Here is a synopsis of all three stocks   Edwards Lifesciences NYSE       the  24 billion global leader in structural heart disease innovations  is once again a Zacks  1 Rank Strong Buy after reporting strong Q2 results and improved guidance for Q3 that prompted analysts to raise EPS estimates   Edwards Lifesciences  second quarter sales grew 10 9  to  841 8 million  beating the consensus  Underlying sales increased 15 3   including the impact of German customers stocking shelves for additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation Revenues were driven by considerable growth in the company s primary solution  the transcatheter aortic valve replacement  TAVR  device  which  as the name implies  is a specialized collapsible valve that can be inserted into a patient s heart via a catheter  thus eliminating the need for major invasive surgery This innovation is especially welcome for older or at risk heart patients whose doctors are concerned about the dangers of open heart surgery In 2011  the FDA approved the Sapien valve invented by Edwards as the first approved transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis By the end of 2015  nearly 55 000 procedures had been performed Bear QIWI plc  NASDAQ      is an  800 million provider of next generation payment services primarily in Russia  The company has an integrated network that enables payment services across physical  online and mobile channels The QIWI network enables merchants to accept cash and electronic payments from virtual wallets  and operates cash collecting terminals and kiosks  QIWI plc is based in Moscow and went public in 2013 The reason that QIWI is in the cellar of the Zacks Rank is that EPS estimates recently took a hit after a resurgence in the first half of the year In July  analysts began lowering estimates when the stock was still trading above  20  And that was when QIWI became a Zacks  4 Rank Sell In Q2  QIWI was a Zacks  1 Rank Strong Buy as the estimates moved up  If you had followed the Rank then  you would have caught the move in the stock from  17 to  25 And last month  the Rank identified what many would have thought was a buying opportunity on the pullback to  20 as really a new sell signal  The new consensus EPS for 2017 of  1 11 represents negative  growth  of  13   even while revenue estimates still reflect 19  growth to  198 million And while next year s EPS forecast of  1 44 would be 30  growth  investors should wait and watch for the estimates to turn back up before investing in QIWI The Zacks Rank will let you know Additional

results Lowe s reported adjusted earnings of  1 57 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 62  The company also reported revenue of  19 495 billion  missing our estimate of  19 523 billion  although the company still grew 6 76  year over year   Lowe s poor earnings contrast sharply with their rival The Home Depot  Inc   NYSE       Home Depot has been one of the  that had a great earnings report this fiscal quarter  The company beat our earnings estimates while its comparable store sales were up about 6 3  year over year  In comparison  Lowe s said their comparable sales rose only 4 5  In order to improve sales  Lowe s plans to increase the number of hours their employees work in order to provide additional customer service face to face   We believe this is the right strategy to more fully capitalize on strong traffic trends in what we believe is a supportive macroeconomic backdrop for home improvement   said Robert Niblock  Lowe s CEO However  because workers will need to be paid more  the company s bottom line will take a hit  Lowe s has lowered its guidance for the full fiscal year to  4 20 to  4 30 a share  well below our estimate of  4 62 per share This strategy could pay off in the long run  though  Customer service remains a large incentive for customers to choose Lowe s over online retailers  like Amazon com  NASDAQ       in order to get assistance on home improvements   This is one category in retail where service really matters   Brian Nagel  an analyst for Oppenheimer   Co   told CNBC this morning Lowe s remains a Zacks Rank  3

140296,361811,EW,Bet On Momentum With These ETFs   Stocks ,opinion,The stock market has been on a stellar run this year thanks to strong corporate earnings  still lower interest rates  and improving health of economies around the world  Even the ongoing turmoil in Washington  geopolitical tensions  North Korean nuclear missile tests and stretched valuations failed to block the road In fact  Dow Jones crossed the another milestone of 22 000 for the first time in yesterday s trading session after hitting the 20 000 and 21 000 marks earlier this year and the S P 500 is less than 1  shy of its major threshold of 2 500  The bullish trend is likely to continue at least in the near term This is especially true  as the economy has been on a solid growth path buoyed by an impressive labor market  increase in wages  and increasing consumer spending  U S  GDP growth expanded 2 6  annually in the second quarter  which is double the first quarter growth of 1 2  and represents the fastest growth since the third quarter of last year when the economy grew 2 8   Notably  this 96 month growth confirms the eight year expansion since mid 2009   the third longest economic winning streak in American history behind March 1991 to March 2001  120 months  and February 1961 to December 1969  106 months  Additionally  consumers now appear to be more optimistic as we enter into the second half of the year  The Consumer Confidence Index  as indicated by the Conference Board  surged to a 16 year high of 121 1 in July from the revised 117 3 in June and is much above the expected 116 5  Further  a weaker dollar helped blue chip companies  most of whose revenues came from international markets  to surge higher  read        Amid bullish sentiments  momentum investing would be a winning strategy

140379,361894,EW,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Teleflex  Medtronic  Johnson   Johnson  Hologic And Wright Medical,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   July 10  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  MedTech  Part 2  including Teleflex Inc   NYSE         Medtronic  NYSE MDT   NYSE         Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   NYSE         Hologic  Inc   NASDAQ        and Wright Medical  NASDAQ        

	Industry  MedTech  Part 2

	Link  

	It s been more than six months since President Trump s election and the medical device industry  which was earlier hopeful about the change of power in White House  is currently fussing over the inability of Republicans to come up with any healthcare policy  As of now  any reform in this respect seems a far cry  Per the latest New Republic article   The Republican push to repeal and replace Obamacare is currently stalled in the Senate  where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has delayed a vote until after the July 4 recess because his bill doesn t have the necessary GOP support  

	Given the current lack of clarity  let s concentrate on some powerful long term tailwinds of the medical device industry like mergers   acquisitions  M A   emerging market expansion  positive demographic trends and new product innovation  These have been driving the sector s impressive performance despite severe socio economic and political instability 

	Also worth mentioning are the recent changes in consumer demand and market dynamics  which have led to a dramatic transformation in the healthcare system  This is evident from the growing number of minimally invasive surgeries  rising demand for liquid biopsy tests  use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care  and the shift of the payment system to a value based model among others 

	Let s elaborate some of the major long term drivers of the MedTech sector 

Major M As 

	The year has started off with two MedTech mammoths joining forces  We are talking about Abbott s colossal  25 billion consolidation with St  Jude Medical in January  The consolidated is currently on track to form a leader in high growth cardiovascular markets  including atrial fibrillation  structural heart and heart failure as well as earn a leading position in the high growth neuromodulation market 

	The same month  another big merger took place  that of the acquisition of Israel based Valtech Cardio by Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW  for a total deal value of  690 million  The acquisition allows Edwards Lifesciences to expand its services in the huge heart valve repair and replacement market in the emerging geographical regions 

	A  1 billion merger deal was executed in February  through which Teleflex Inc   NYSE       acquired Vascular Solutions that develops clinical solutions for minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures  The combination is expected to meaningfully accelerate the growth of Teleflex s vascular and interventional businesses 

	It seems that the  43 billion Medtronic  NYSE        Covidien merger and the subsequent reports of how the consolidated company knocked off Johnson   Johnson  NYSE        from its indisputable position as the top firm in the medical devices space  inspired other industry leaders to come forward with mega M A deals 

Divestments 

	Medical device majors continue to offload their non core business lines  specifically to focus on the main segments and to divest assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers  These divestures have been mandated by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and other international anti trust regulators  This restricts chances of monopoly in the market 

	Let s take a look at some of the significant divestments in recent times 

	In order to focus on a portfolio that delivers on global strategic priorities  Medtronic decided to divest part of its PMR  patient monitoring and recovery  division within MITG  Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  business to Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  for a deal value of  6 1 billion 

	Following the announcement of its two major buyouts  Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics to Johnson   Johnson for about  4 33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines  The AMO product lines have joined JNJ s ACUVUE Brand Contact Lenses business  and the combined organization will operate under the brand name Johnson   Johnson Vision 

	A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems  Cynosure  recently sold itself to Hologic  Inc   NASDAQ         Notably  Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately  1 65 billion 

	Wright Medical s  NASDAQ        recent divestiture of its large joints  hip knee  business to Corin Orthopaedics is an example of the focus that the former puts on its core businesses 

Emerging Market Openings

	According to a report by Visiongain  the global medical devices market will reach  398 billion in 2017 from  321 billion in 2012  This trend will continue to grow stronger through 2023 

	The traditional market remains plagued by growing regulatory scrutiny  pricing pressure and no sign of a turnaround in the emerging markets of Latin America and Eastern Europe as per recent data from Euromonitor International  So  it s the Asia Pacific region on which all the bets are being placed this year 

	China and India s healthcare service revenues are expected to grow at a massive rate  resulting in a large number of new hospital construction projects and soaring demand for medical and surgical equipment 

	Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50  of sales from this region  In recent quarters  sales in key emerging markets climbed in double digits driven by growth in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America  including Colombia  Mexico  Peru and Argentina 

	At Medtronic  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  business in China  Latin America and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength  growing by strong double digits  Eastern Europe on the other hand grew high single digits 

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

The company currently generates revenues from four major groups  viz  Cardiac   Vascular Group  CVG   Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  MITG   Restorative Therapies Group  RTG  and Diabetes Group 
CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure  CRHF   Coronary   Structural Heart  CSH   and Aortic   Peripheral Vascular divisions  APV   MITG includes both the Surgical Solutions division and the Patient Monitoring   Recovery  PMR  division  RTG includes the Spine  Brain Therapies  Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments  while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management  IIM   Non Intensive Diabetes Therapies  NDT   and Diabetes Service   Solutions  DSS  divisions 
Revenues from CVG improved 5  at CER  or up 4  as reported  to  2 85 billion  driven by strong  balanced growth across all three divisions 
CRHF sales were  1 54 billion with 4  year over year growth at CER  up 3  as reported   This came on the back of growth in mid single digit in Arrhythmia Management at CER  This apart  the HeartWare International acquisition drove growth in Heart Failure division 
CSH revenues were up 4  at CER  same on a reported basis  to  847 million on the back of mid thirties constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer adoption of the CoreValve Evolut R platform 
APV revenues registered 6  growth at CER  up 5  as reported  to  457 million  driven by mid single digit growth in Aortic and high single digit growth in Peripheral 
In MITG  worldwide sales reached  2 61 billion  marking a 6  year over year increase at CER on high single digit growth in Surgical Solutions and mid single digit growth in PMR

Gross margin during the reported quarter expanded 45 basis points  bps  to 69 2  on 5 3  increase in gross profit to  5 48 billion  Adjusted operating margin improved 6 bps year over year to 30 3   This was owing to a 5  rise in selling  general and administrative expenses  to  2 48 billion  which was offset by a 3 8  decline in research and development expenses  to  553 million   Other expenses in the reported quarter was  48 million as compared to Other income of  21 million in the year ago period 
Guidance
Medtronic has also provided its initial fiscal 2018 revenues and EPS guidance  The company expects full year revenues to grow in the range of 4 5  at CER  Foreign currency fluctuation this time is expected to have a positive  75  175 million impact for the fiscal year  However for the first quarter of fiscal 2018  currency translation will adversely impact to the tune of  10  60 million on revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues remains at  30 72 billion for fiscal 2018 
Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 9 10  at CER  Currency translation will negatively impact the full year earnings number by approximately 5 10 cents  including the 3 5 cents  impact in the first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  4 93 per share 
Our Take
Medtronic s posted better than expected fiscal fourth quarter results with both earnings and revenues ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  While the company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER basis  escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on bottom line  Also  unfavorable foreign exchange rate continues to remain a major headwind and the fiscal guidance fails to indicate any chances of respite 
On a positive note  all four major business groups contributed to solid top line growth at CER  which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions  in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets  We are also encouraged by the solid growth trend  successfully continuing in the U S  as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies  Apart from product innovation  the company is currently focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses

ou can see 
Chevron started 2017 on a bullish note  It not only swung to a Q1 profit from a year ago loss  but results handily beat estimates on the back of rebounding commodity prices  lower expenses and an improved U S  refining environment  Following outperformance in 3 of the last 4 quarters  the stock has performed about in line with the Zacks Integrated Oil Industry over the past year  up about  7    but handily outperformed ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  which saw its stock go down  8 6  over the same time period  However  with oil testing the psychologically critical  50 threshold again  the near to medium term revenue outlook for Chevron   one of the most oil weighted majors   remains cloudy  Moreover  Chevron is still outspending its cash flow  making it dependent on asset sales  Hence  the Zacks analyst thinks investors should wait for a better entry point before buying shares in America s second largest oil company   You can      
Altria shares have lagged the Zacks Tobacco industry in the year to date period  with the stock up  6 5  vs  the peer group s  15 8  gain  The company s weaker than expected Q1 quarterly results have added to its under performance  Altria  the U S  based entity whose international sibling is Phillips Morris International  PM   is operating in a mature and heavily regulated market that has been undergoing consistent volume declines over the last many years  But the strength of Marlboro brand and a solid portfolio or low risk smokeless tobacco products positions it to profitably navigate this market  Further  the recent takeover of SABMiller  LON SAB  by Anheuser Busch InBev s helped Altria maximize the value of its SABMiller investment  An attractive dividend  currently yielding 3 4   is a notable part of this story as well   You can      
Kraft Heinz shares remained relatively subdued this year  gaining only  3 4  year to date  Kraft Heinz s first quarter earnings and revenues fell short of expectations  Notably  the company s sales have now declined in four of the past five quarters  The Zacks analyst stresses that Kraft Heinz has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food  That said  strong brand portfolio  cost savings initiatives  innovation and marketing efforts raise growth prospects for the company   You can      
Time Warner share have handily outperformed the broader market as well as the media space  the stock is up more than  35 4  over the last one year  on greater appreciation for the company s proactive strategic initiatives in response to the evolving media landscape  This trend is also borne out by its positive earnings surprise streak for more than 20 straight quarters  Investments in video content and technology continued to show results  Further  Time Warner s significant international presence has helped broaden client base and product portfolio  Additionally  investments in programming  production and marketing  along with focus on operating and capital efficiencies augur well  However  decline in overall advertising spending and currency headwinds may adversely impact performance  On the other hand  AT T  NYSE T  has agreed to acquire Time Warner in an  85 4 billion deal  which is expected to be concluded by the end of the year   You can

140517,362032,EW,   by The Skin Of The S P s Teeth,opinion,"With the S P surpassing 2400 yesterday by only a little more than two points  you wouldn t think the index could afford to move lower on Tuesday and still stay above that mark  However  this market has a knack for lethargy  so it managed to retain the milestone by the slimmest of margins  The S P was down only 0 07  in the session  or 1 65 points  to end at 2400 7 
Similarly  the Dow was off by 0 01  to 20 979 8  The NASDAQ  though  kept its winning ways going with an advance of 0 33  to yet another new record of 6169 9  I feel like I haven t seen anything like this in my career  and it turns out I haven t   said Jeremy in Counterstrike   Before today  during the past 15 trading days  the S P 500 has moved w in a range of 1 02   the least volatile 15 days in history  WOW

Surprise Trader  There are still some big companies that have yet to report this earnings season and Eric added two of them on Tuesday  One of the new buys was retailing giant Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   which is enjoying an  incredible turnaround  from the slump of 2014 2015  It has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for six straight quarters now  and has a positive Earnings ESP for its scheduled report on Thursday before the bell 
The other buy was Deere   Company  NYSE DE   which has amassed an average surprise of 60  over the past four quarterly reports  This Zacks Rank  2 farm equipment giant hasn t missed since November 2012 and has an Earnings ESP of 4 3  for its next report on Friday before the bell  Eric also likes that DE is part of a space in the top 6  of the Zacks Industry Rank  WMT and DE each received allocations of 12 5   The full write up has a lot more TAZR Trader  The portfolio added some diversification on Tuesday with 7  allocations in Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW  and MasTech  MTZ   EW has finally made it to Goldman s  Conviction Buy  list and may NEVER go below  110 again  Meanwhile  MTZ is a construction services company that has already been a winner for TAZR  but the editor sees even more opportunity and value in the low  40s  Learn a lot more about these new buys in the full write up Zacks Short List  There were four swaps this week  The stocks that were short covered and left the portfolio are

Stocks Under  10  Guidance Software  GUID   a leader in digital investigative solutions  has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate eight times in the last nine quarters  But what Brian Bolan really appreciated was that quarterly earnings estimates have been trending to the positive for several months  The same has been true for 2017 and 2018 expectations  Now  GUID is expected to generate earnings growth of 118  this year and 57  next  Learn a lot more about this new buy in the full write up Reitmeister Trading Alert   After the Housing Starts and Industrial Production reports Tuesday the Atlanta Fed calculated that Q2 GDP is looking like  4 1   Yes  I know that seems a bit too robust which is why I then checked the Blue Chip Economists panel where they are expecting still impressive  3 1  growth 
 Either way  it appears that GDP is taking a big leap forward from the tame  0 7  pace for Q1  Thus  there is little wonder why stocks closed above 2400 for the second straight day  This increases the odds that a breakout is under way with more stock gains soon to roll in 
 Investors should grab the reigns of this bull and ride it to new heights      Steve Reitmeister

140555,362070,EW,Why Is Edwards  EW  Up 4 1  Since The Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Edwards Lifesciences Corporation   NYSE EW    Shares have added about 4 1  in that time frame  underperforming the market 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts 
Recent EarningsEdwards Lifesciences reported fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  0 75  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 6   Adjusted earnings also improved 17 1  year over year  primarily driven by strong sales growth Full year 2016 adjusted EPS came in at  2 89  up 24 5  year over year  The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 3  Per management  strong sales of transcatheter valves drove the bottom line Excluding one time items  net income in the fourth quarter improved 12 6  or 14 1  year over year to  158 5 million or  0 73 per share  respectively For full year 2016  net income improved 15 1  or 16  year over year to  569 5 million or  2 61 per share  respectively Sales DetailsEdwards Lifesciences  fourth quarter sales rose 14 4  to  767 7 million  The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  759 million  Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve  THV  sales as well as strong performance by the Critical Care segment Full year 2016 revenues totaled  2 96 billion  which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 7  In the fourth quarter  underlying sales increased 15   excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the THV sales return reserve   In the U S   sales rose 20 7  year over year to  421 5 million on an underlying basis  In the international market  underlying sales grew 8 8  to  346 2 million MarginsIn the fourth quarter  gross margin contracted 157 basis points  bps  to 72 2  owing to reduced year over year benefit from foreign exchange hedge contracts and manufacturing expenses associated with capacity expansion  This was however partially offset by a profitable product mix SG A expenses rose 5 1  year over year to  233 6 million on account of sales and personnel related expenses  primarily in the Transcatheter Valve  THV  segment  partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax  On the other hand  R D expenditures increased 17  year over year to  114 9 million  owing to continued investments in the company s transcatheter mitral valve and mitral valve programs including expenditure on clinical trials  Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 81 bps to 26 8  as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expenses Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited fiscal 2016 with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  1 27 billion  up from  1 22 billion at the end of 2015  Long term debt for full year 2016 was  822 3 million compared with  596 9 million at the end of the prior year Cash flow from operating activities was  201 1 million in the fourth quarter  Excluding capital spending of  63 2 million  free cash flow was  137 9 million  During the fourth quarter  management repurchased approximately 2 7 million shares for  246 million  largely to offset dilution associated with its Valtech Cardio acquisition  which closed on Jan 23   Average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter were 218 million 2017 GuidanceEdwards Lifesciences issued guidance for 2017  For full year 2017  the company expects sales in the range of  3 0  3 4 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year revenue is  3 22 billion  which is above the guided range  Adjusted EPS is expected at around  3 30  3 45  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year adjusted EPS is  3 38  within the company s guided range For the first quarter of 2017  the company projects sales between  760 million and  800 million and adjusted earnings per share between  0 79 and  0 89  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 85 is within the guided range

140592,362107,EW,4 Med Instrument Stocks For Q3 Earnings Amid Election Chaos,opinion,"The Q3 earnings season has kick started and following the heated second Presidential debate a week ago  the entire nation s eyes are set on how one of the most contentious sectors of the U S  economy   healthcare   has performed this time  and what will be its future with or without Obamacare  
It is quite difficult for the nation to get into the crux of the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act  ACA   especially on the basis of the starkly different views presented by the two strongest candidates from among the Democrats and the Republicans  Yet  a fact checking of the debate may give some idea about the imminent prospects and downsides of the healthcare sector Gist of ACA Related Claims   Counter Claims 
Donald Trump has always pointed out Obamacare as one of the top problems he wants to address after being elected  This debate was no exception to that  According to him   When I watch the deals being made and watch what s happening with horrible things like Obamacare  where your health insurance and health care are going up by numbers that are astronomical  By 68   59  and 71      In addition  he strongly apprehends Hillary Clinton post winning the vote to broaden the Obamacare with the single payer system which after being implemented will close the door on choosing from a variety of private payers  According to Trump  this implies giving major controlling authority to the government 
Clinton on the other hand  has failed to accept Obamacare as a complete letdown  She has actually praised the fact that it has provided health insurance a new set of 20 million of uninsured people  This indeed has been treated as a huge success due to the fact that currently  more than 90  of Americans have health insurance coverage  the highest in the nation s history 
Also  in terms of Trump s allegation regarding the looming chance of Clinton s implementation of single payer system  we note this view was pitched by Bernie Sanders through his  Medicare for All  proposal which Clinton strongly opposed 
According to a latest CNN report  Trump s claim that Clinton wants a single payer system is false on the basis that she has always talked about broadening Obamacare through enhanced tax credits to make coverage affordable  efforts to bring down the cost of prescription drugs  increased competition between insurers  and an aggressive campaign to increase outreach and enrollment  Additionally  she always talked about efforts needed to ensure the availability of a public option choice in every state  and let Americans over 55 buy in to Medicare What s in Store 
This highly conflicting face off between the candidates  however  points to the fact that no matter who wins the race  Obamacare will be altered  Only time will tell  whether there will be a full repeal or just a reform of the ACA  If Trump wins  beyond the repeal of Obamacare  it s also worth noting that the Republican Policy Platform will call for significant restructuring of Medicare from a defined benefit type program to a defined contribution plan  resultshealthcare com    overall a drastic and histrionic change  Clinton on the other hand  through her expansionary Obamacare plan  is expected to bring gradual and evolutionary changes to the healthcare sector Beaming Medical Device Space
Apart from election related ambiguity  let us take a sneak peek at what the Q3 earnings season is expected to bring forth  Per the latest  report  post a sluggish Q2  there will be modest improvements in the overall earnings picture in Q3  While this quarter is expected to represent the sixth quarter in a row of earnings declines for the S P 500 index  the scenario is improving 
Medical device within the broader healthcare accordingly lends a lot of optimism at this moment  This comes as no surprise even in the face of severe economic instability  fierce competition  and increasing cost related hazards leading to regulatory complexities  This is because the medical device industry continues to remain healthy on successful execution of some top strategic priorities  including R D and product development  strategic M A and alliances  and focus on emerging market expansion 
A recent EvaluateMedTech World Preview claims that this space within medical device is positioned for impressive growth in the near term  At a glance  worldwide  medical device sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4 1  to  477 5 billion by 2020 
Apart from these catalysts  other remarkable breakthroughs include information technology  utilization of smart devices cloud connectivity and personalized medicines which have continued to remain as the major growth drivers in the medical instrument subsector Making the Right Choice
With numerous stocks in the medical device sector that almost always muddle up one s stock picking prowess  the Zacks methodology could offer some relief  One can narrow down choices by focusing specifically on the  medical instruments  stocks  a specialized chunk under the medical device subcategory   that sport the desirable combination of a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  
Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70

Edwards will report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 25 after the market closes  We believe the company is poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate given its Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  2 94  Penumbra  Inc    
Penumbra  a global interventional therapies company that went public on Sep 17 2015  is expected to report its third quarter 2016 financial numbers on Nov 10  The steadily increasing demand for treatment options in the heart diseases market reflects the high growth potential for the company in this category  Lucrative growth opportunities exist in the ischemic stroke market as well as in more established markets like hemorrhagic stroke and peripheral vascular  Consequently  Penumbra s strategy to focus on impactful product development across a varied portfolio will justify investors  confidence in the stock

140595,362110,EW,Edwards Lifesciences  EW  Q3 Earnings In Line  Sales Miss,opinion,Edwards Lifesciences Corp    NYSE EW   reported third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 68 cents  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  adjusted earnings improved 25 9  year over year  primarily driven by strong sales growth Unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and increased selling  general and administrative  SG A  along with research and development  R D  expenses partially stemmed this growth  Further  the bottom line results were at the upper end of Edwards Lifesciences  guidance of 62 68 cents Excluding one time items  net income in the third quarter improved 19 7  or 20 4  year over year to  141 4 million or 65 cents per share  respectively Sales DetailsEdwards Lifesciences  third quarter sales improved 20 1  to  739 4 million  The top line  however  failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  748 million  However  it managed to reach the midpoint of the company s guidance of  720  760 million  Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve  THV  sales as well as strong performance of the Critical Care segment In the third quarter  underlying sales increased 18 4   excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the THV sales return reserve   In the U S   sales improved 28 6  year over year to  417 1 million on an underlying basis  In the international market  underlying sales grew 7 4  to  322 3 million EDWARDS LIFESCI Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Sales by Product GroupsIn the third quarter  sales from the surgical heart valve therapy product group edged up 1 6  year over year to  190 9 million  flat on an underlying basis   Globally  mitral valve sales grew slightly  offset by a modest decline in aortic valve sales The THV product group s sales grew 38 5  to  410 1 million  up 37 3  on an underlying basis   primarily on the back of continued strong therapy adoption across all geographies  with notable strength in the U S  and Japan  THV sales rose 54 8  on an underlying basis in the U S   driven by continued strong procedure growth in both large and small TAVR programs Critical Care product group sales improved 5 2  to  138 4 million  up 2 5    Global growth in this product group was driven primarily by double digit growth witnessed in Edwards Lifesciences  core products and its Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program across most regions Propelled by THV s strong momentum  Edwards Lifesciences reiterated its guidance for sales from THV products in the range of  1 5  1 7 billion for full year 2016  reflecting more than 30  growth on an underlying basis  Also  management continues to anticipate underlying sales growth in the range of 0  2  for Surgical Heart Valves and 5  7  for Critical Care MarginsIn the third quarter  gross margin contracted 340 basis points  bps  to 72 8   in line with management s expectation  This decline can be attributed to the unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations that had negatively impacted the company s gross margins in the first half of 2016  Edwards expect this to continue through the fourth quarter SG A expenses rose 8 3  year over year to  229 6 million  on account of sales and personnel related expenses  primarily in THV  partially offset by the suspension of the medical device excise tax  On the other hand  R D expenditures grew 11 9  year over year to  113 million  owing to continued investments in the company s transcatheter mitral valve and aortic valve programs  Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 110 bps to 26 4  as the rise in revenues outweighed the increase in operating expense   Cash PositionEdwards Lifesciences exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  1 2 billion  compared with  1 1 billion at the end of second quarter 2016  Long term debt was  600 6 million compared with  602 5 million at the end of the prior quarter Cash flow from operating activities was  205 9 million in the third quarter  Excluding capital spending of  48 million  free cash flow was  158 million  Year to date  Edwards Lifesciences repurchased 4 6 million shares of its common stock for  415 7 million GuidanceEdwards Lifesciences reiterated its full year 2016 revenue guidance  Management continues to expect total sales at the high end of its previous guidance range of  2 70  3 billion However  the company raised its 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance to the range of  2 82  2 92 from the earlier view of  2 78  2 88  as a result of an upward revision in estimates for sales Management reiterated its expectation to deliver 2016 free cash flow in the range of  500  600 million For third quarter 2016  at current foreign exchange rates  adjusted EPS is projected within 67 77 cents on revenues of  750  790 million Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences ended the third quarter  with its earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues lagging the same  While we are concerned about the 2016 sales guidance reiteration by the company  the upward revision in EPS expectations raises investor optimism about the stock  We are currently looking forward to the continued strong global adoption of the company s SAPIEN 3 platform  which remains on track to generate over  300 million additional in sales during 2016 However  the company continued to perform poorly on its gross margin front  On the other hand  although Edwards Lifesciences  higher operating expenses might have made investors anxious  it is a relief to know that the higher expenses were on account of advanced initiatives adopted by the company to improve its overall sales growth Nevertheless  management expects to gain traction in the ever expanding TAVR market  based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidences  leading to strong adoption of its THV therapy Zacks Rank   Key

Pump Engineer Designs Cardiac Replacement Parts

It all began with the vision of the founder inventor  a hydraulic engineer named Miles  Lowell  Edwards  who in 1958 set out to build the first artificial heart  By dialing down his dream a bit  was able to create an important life saving industry  Here s the official story from the company website   

Edwards was a 60 year old  recently retired engineer holding 63 patents in an array of industries  with an entrepreneurial spirit and a dream of helping patients with heart disease  His fascination with healing the heart was sparked in his teens  when he suffered two bouts of rheumatic fever  which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail 

With a background in hydraulics and fuel pump operations  Edwards believed the human heart could be mechanized  He presented the concept to Dr  Albert Starr  a young surgeon at the University of Oregon Medical School  who thought the idea was too complex  Instead  Starr encouraged Edwards to focus first on developing an artificial heart valve  for which there was an immediate need 

After just two years  the first Starr Edwards mitral valve was designed  developed  tested  and successfully placed in a patient  Newspapers around the world reported on what they termed a  miraculous  heart surgery 

From there  the company built an impressive pedigree for R D in heart devices and minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures  In 1966  Edwards Laboratories was purchased by American Hospital Supply Corporation and became American Edwards Laboratories  Then  in 1985  American Edwards was acquired by Baxter International  NYSE BAX   In early 2000  the company was spun off as an independent  publicly held corporation and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol EW 

The TAVR Alternative to Open Heart Surgery

TAVR stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement  It is sometimes also called transcatheter aortic valve implantation  TAVI  

This minimally invasive surgical procedure repairs the aortic valve without removing the old  damaged valve  Instead  it wedges a replacement valve into the aortic valve s place 

A  valve within valve  this approach works somewhat similar to a stent placed in an artery  as TAVR delivers a fully collapsible replacement valve to the valve site through a catheter 

Once the new valve is expanded  it pushes the old valve leaflets out of the way and the tissue in the replacement valve takes over the job of regulating blood flow 

In early March  the company announced they had recently won the approval of the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare  MHLW  to market its Sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve  THV  in the country  They plan to fully launch Sapien 3 by the end of 2016 in Japan 

News of this approval surfaced merely a couple of weeks after the company received the FDA nod for expanded use of its Sapien XT THV for pulmonic valve replacement procedures in the U S  The Japanese clearance is expected to accelerate Edwards  revenues from its THV business segment  which witnessed 38  underlying growth in 2015 

Current market leaders in TAVR include EW   the first valve approved in the U S    and Medtronic  NYSE MDT   which roughly splits the EU market with EW and was approved in the U S  in inoperable patients in January 2014 

July Earnings Beat and Raised Estimates

On July 26  Edwards delivered an 8  EPS beat and analysts immediately responded to the company outlook by raising estimates 

Full year 2016 consensus EPS projections climbed from  2 75 to  2 86  representing 25  growth  while top line estimates of  3 billion in sales represents just over 20  growth 

Full year 2017 consensus EPS rose from  3 26 to  3 39 for 18 6  growth  Revenues are projected to hit  3 38 billion next year for 12 5  growth 

The stock trades richly at nearly 40X forward EPS estimates  But as the leader in a growing field  investors seem willing to pay that much  especially as more international markets open up 

Expanded Indication In Europe

On September 19  Edwards received approval from European medical authorities for expanded indications for the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve for the treatment of patients suffering from severe  symptomatic aortic stenosis who are at intermediate risk for open heart surgery  

 This expanded intermediate risk indication allows for the treatment of even more patients whose only previous option was an open heart surgical procedure   said Prof  Helge M llmann  Director  Clinic for Internal Medicine  Cardiology  at St  Johannes Hospital  Dortmund  Germany   I am encouraged by the adoption of the position paper of the German Cardiac Society that recommends the use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation  TAVI  in intermediate risk patients based on growing clinical evidence  

According to the company press release   for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at intermediate risk for an open heart surgical procedure  TAVI using the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve has been shown1 to demonstrate outcomes that are superior to surgery at one year on a composite primary endpoint of mortality  stroke and moderate or severe aortic regurgitation

140620,362135,EW,Edwards Lifesciences  DaVita HealthCare Partners  Corcept Therapeutics And CryoLife Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   September 22  2016    highlights Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW     as the Bull of the Day and  DaVita HealthCare Partners    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysisCorcept Therapeutics Inc    and  CryoLife Inc    

	Here is a synopsis of all four stocks 

  

	The growth of Edwards Lifesciences    into a  25 billion provider of cutting edge heart surgery alternatives is an amazing success story of American ingenuity and medical business innovation 

	I last wrote about the company as a Zacks  1 Rank stock in April when I owned it and shares leapt from  90 to new all time highs above  105 on the company s latest data proving superiority  or at least equivalency  of its Sapien 3 valve replacement procedure to open heart surgery 

Pump Engineer Designs Cardiac Replacement Parts

	It all began with the vision of the founder inventor  a hydraulic engineer named Miles  Lowell  Edwards  who in 1958 set out to build the first artificial heart  By dialing down his dream a bit  was able to create an important life saving industry  Here s the official story from the company website   

Edwards was a 60 year old  recently retired engineer holding 63 patents in an array of industries  with an entrepreneurial spirit and a dream of helping patients with heart disease  His fascination with healing the heart was sparked in his teens  when he suffered two bouts of rheumatic fever  which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail  

With a background in hydraulics and fuel pump operations  Edwards believed the human heart could be mechanized  He presented the concept to Dr  Albert Starr  a young surgeon at the University of Oregon Medical School  who thought the idea was too complex  Instead  Starr encouraged Edwards to focus first on developing an artificial heart valve  for which there was an immediate need  

After just two years  the first Starr Edwards mitral valve was designed  developed  tested  and successfully placed in a patient  Newspapers around the world reported on what they termed a  miraculous  heart surgery  

	From there  the company built an impressive pedigree for R D in heart devices and minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures  In 1966  Edwards Laboratories was purchased by American Hospital Supply Corporation and became American Edwards Laboratories  Then  in 1985  American Edwards was acquired by Baxter International  NYSE BAX   In early 2000  the company was spun off as an independent  publicly held corporation and began trading on the NYSE under the symbol EW 

 

	I last wrote about DaVita HealthCare Partners    as the Bear of the Day in mid August when shares were trading above  68 

	I wanted to revisit this story now because while we don t have any upward EPS estimate revisions to get the stock out of the Zacks Rank cellar  we did get a ratings upgrade from a respected firm that may soon mark the beginning of a turnaround for this important business 

	Before I share details of that upgrade news  let s recap what has happened  DVA became a Zacks  4 Rank Sell in mid July as analysts began lowering estimates before the company s Q2 report 

	On August 8 the company delivered a 3  EPS beat but disappointed with lowered guidance for the year due to difficulties with a recent acquisition 

	Since the earnings report  shares tumbled 13  up to August 16  the date of my first article  as most analysts have moved their estimates down again  Then from August 17 on  DVA dropped further but found support near  63  just above the 52 week lows of February at  61 36 

The Business of Dialysis

	DaVita HealthCare Partners is the second largest US provider of dialysis services to patients with chronic kidney failure and end stage renal disease  They serve roughly 180 000 patients through a network of 2 179 owned and managed dialysis facilities 

	The company offers outpatient  home based  and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services  ESRD laboratory services and provides management and administrative services to outpatient dialysis centers 

	DaVita had revenues of  13 78 billion in 2015 and trailing 12 month  TTM  sales are at  14 36 billion as of June 30  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc   formerly known as DaVita Inc   is headquartered in Denver  Colorado  With the acquisition of HealthCare Partners  HCP   the company became the largest operator of medical groups and physician networks in the US 

The Quarter Analysts Saw Coming    Mostly

	Total revenue increased 8 8  year over year to approximately  3 72 billion and narrowly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 2   The year over year improvement was mainly attributable to a rise in patient service revenues 

	Analysts knew that the HealthCare Partners acquisition was not going according to management s plans  That s why they were lowering estimates in July  But they weren t expecting a  70 million drop in segment guidance 

	Here s how analysts at Raymond James broke down the news   

	Drivers behind HCP s lowered 2016 guidance include  1  fee for service revenue growth of 3  vs  management 6  target  2  an overestimation of Medicare Advantage reconciliation payments  3  Medicare Advantage mentorship growth lower than expected and  4  an acceleration in the re branding of HCP to the DaVita Medical Group    5  10 million more than expected 

	And here was the fallout for EPS estimates   

	In the last 30 days  the 2016 full year consensus fell from  3 95 to  3 77  representing negative annual growth of  1 7  

	2017 consensus profit projections dropped from  4 42 to  4 18  for 11  growth if all goes well 

The Upgrade from RJ

	On September 20  analysts at Raymond James talked again about concerns in the market over DaVita s exposure to the ACA exchanges  noting that as the dust settled the risks appeared to be lower than they initially estimated in August 

	And finding shares attractively valued after the sell off  they felt compelled to move their rating on DVA shares from Market Perform to Outperform  They also issued a new  75 price target 

	DaVita is a strong business and clear leader in its industry  But until the estimates picture turns around  it s probably best to stay on the sidelines  If the move by this investment bank becomes a new trend  and estimates head back up  then the turnaround could be in motion 

	The Zacks Rank warned you in July before the drop and it will let you know when it s safe again

140645,362160,EW,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Edwards Lifesciences  Medtronic And Johnson   Johnson,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   July 12  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Medical Technologies  MedTech   including  Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW      Medtronic  NYSE MDT       and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ     

Industry  Medical Technologies  MedTech 

Link  

Two full quarters of 2016 are behind us and  while we await second quarter results over the coming weeks  we hardly expect a change in trend in the bullish MedTech sector  This comes as no surprise  even in the face of severe economic instability  fierce competition and increasing cost related hazards leading to regulatory complexities  This is because the medical device industry remains healthy on successful execution of some top strategic priorities  two of which are R D and product development 

According to a survey by KPMG  the number of medical device companies that expect to spend more than 6  of revenue on R D innovation is rising and is fast exceeding the number of companies spending on R Ds in other manufacturing industries  These innovations and breakthroughs can be of various forms   new products or surgical techniques or cost effective products targeting the emerging markets  These innovations  however  have one thing in common  they are meant to transform the way MedTech reaches the consumer 

Edwards Lifesciences     SAPIEN or its competitive product Medtronic s    CoreValvetranscatheter heart valve or surgical aortic valves are good examples of such breakthrough innovations  As the global heart valves market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14 28  during the period 2016 2020  according to the latest Market Research Report   it is needless to say how impactful these breakthroughs are for the MedTech market to remain on its growth trajectory 

Other remarkable breakthroughs include 3D printing  minimally invasive surgical procedures involving both robotics and 3D visual systems  new materials like the preventive premature failure of hip implant coatings  and so forth  Information technology  utilization of smart devices cloud connectivity and personalized medicine are newfound fields which are pushing the medical device industry toward rapid and sustainable growth 

Impressive Prospects Ahead

R D and product development are just the tip of the iceberg  The future of MedTech lies in other catalysts as well  According to economists  strategic partnerships and M As are in fact the driving force behind breakthrough innovations compared to the singlehanded contribution of in house efforts 

They asserted that strategic consolidations are very often seen as the gateway for new business models apt for a highly competitive and specialized industry leading to all new levels of R D investments 

Let us now deliberate on what investors might gain from the MedTech world  a sector that is generally not in the limelight from an investment perspective  The primary fact which compels us to bet on MedTech  especially in this extremely volatile world market  is its fundamentally defensive nature  Products of this sector are mostly essential and hence less sensitive to business cycle fluctuations 

And we ve found some pretty impressive data in this respect 

A recent EvaluateMedTech World Preview claims that the MedTech space is positioned for impressive growth in the near term  At a glance  MedTech sales worldwide are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4 1  to  477 5 billion by 2020 

Steering ahead of Cardiology and Diagnostics  In Vitro Diagnostics  IVD  is expected to emerge as the sector leader in 2020  Neurology  meanwhile  holds promise as the fastest growing division among the top 15 segments by 2020  On the other hand  Orthopedics  which is already on shaky legs  may prove to be one of the slowest growing segments in 2020 with a CAGR of 3 2  per year 

While Johnson   Johnson    was the largest device maker of 2014 with MedTech sales of  27 5 billion  the honor may go to Medtronic by 2020 with its business consolidated by the Covidien acquisition  Medtronic is expected to reach the top with revenues mounting to  34 9 billion in 2020 

While Medtronic s growing Cardiac and Vascular portfolio lends it a sharp competitive edge  J J s forte lies in its orthopedic capability  which unfortunately is not gaining much traction among investors  CAGR of 2 4  between 2014 and 2020  lower than the expected market growth rate  

Zacks Industry Rank

Within the Zacks Industry classification  Medical Device is grouped under the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded level  med instruments  med products  med dental supp and medical info systems 

We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit

The Zacks Industry Rank for medical info systems is  20  med instruments and med products both being  88  while the med dental supp is  34  Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments  it is obvious that the outlook for all these four medical device industries is positive 

Earnings Trend of the Sector

Of the S P 500 members  the Medical companies have yet to report their second quarter results as of July 8  In the second quarter of 2016  only 6 among all the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to report positive year over year earnings growth  Medical being one of them  increase of 0 5    With respect to the quarter s revenues  year over year growth is expected to remain strong at 7 7  for Medical

140697,362212,EW,Top Trade Ideas  Week Of September 8  2015,opinion,"Anthem  NYSE ANTM 
Anthem has pulled back from a high over 170 over the last 3 months  The recent consolidation in a tight range sets up an opportunity for a trade  With the RSI moving back higher and the MACD crossing up  it suggest to look for a break to the upside  But it could also break to the downside and provide a good trade  Let it tell you which direction to take 
Callon Petroleum  NYSE CPE 
Callon Petroleum was on watch for a major break down two weeks ago  The 50 day SMA held as support though and it moved back higher  Last week it triggered an Inverse head and Shoulders as it moved back to resistance from April  The RSI is firmly in the bullish zone and the MACD is rising  both supporting further upside toward the Head and Shoulders price objective 
Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW 
Edwards Lifesciences is a large cap heart care company that had a strong run higher from may through mid July  From that point  the stock started a pullback that has erased  25 and seems to be settling  What makes it interesting is the RSI turning lower with the MACD falling  and the strong support lower at 125 
Vonage Holdings  NYSE VG 
Vonage Holdings rose out of a consolidation that lasted 5 months at the end of July  The jump higher on strong volume quickly pulled back though  Now it has retraced 61 8  of the leg higher and is settling  keeping a gap open below  over the 50 day SMA  The RSI is trying to turn higher while the MACD slows its decline  Look for a move over 5 65 for a trade higher with a natural stop below 
Zillow Group  NASDAQ Z 
Zillow Group has been declining since mid February  but then found a bottom to start August  The bounce from there is now consolidating at resistance under the falling 100 day SMA  resembling an ascending triangle  The RSI is trending over the mid line while the MACD is rising  Watch for a break of resistance higher to enter 
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the holiday shortened week the equity markets have seen consolidation following the damage of the prior week  and traders lining up on both sides looking for a break 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower while crude oil has a short term bias to the upside  The US dollar index continues in consolidation with an upward bias  while US Treasuries are also biased higher in the short term  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside  Volatility looks to remain elevated  keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETFs NYSE SPY  NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ into next week 
Their charts all show short term consolidation in a tightening range as all correlations go toward 1 0 in a crisis or panic  The longer charts show the damage to be limited so far though  The QQQ looks the strongest with the IWM at support and the SPY most vulnerable  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

140728,362243,EW,Gold In Last 1 5 Years Of 34 Year Cycle,opinion,The Gold Bull market started during the first quarter of 2001  and has now been in play for approximately 11 1 2 years  Commodity cycles tend to have 13 year bull markets and 21 year bear markets  This completes a 34 year cycle and for the moment gold appears to be in the last 1 1 1 2 years of this cycle Fortunately for us traders  this tends to be the most explosive part of the cycle  In the actual economy gold really does not serve as a commodity but as a currency  If this were not the case why do central banks accumulate or hold gold as reserves  The yellow metal is truly the currency of last resort We have been counting gold as a large impulse  but if one looks at the 1967 1980 bull market the count was certainly corrective  Furthermore no currency or commodity market moves with a long term impulse  The two other major precious metals  platinum and silver  do not have long term impulses  so with that in mind  the gold count was changed to reflect a long term corrective count  This does not change the long term targets  but only seeks to try and represent gold s true Elliott Wave  EW  nature Before moving down to the daily charts let s take a look at two basic details in the weekly chart  When looking at waves for EW it is critical to remember the impulse numbers  5  9  13  17  21  25  etc   First notice that Major a Primary A completed with 17 waves up  and Major c Primary A completed with 13 waves up  It would seem that Major c Primary A  cycled  down one wave set  If this were to occur for Primary C we should expect 9 waves up for the final Major c  The second detail is just some basic Fibonacci projections  Major a   Primary A  2001 2004    69 Major c   Primary A  2004 2008    178 Major a   Primary C  2008 2011    183 Each of the major waves have approximately a 2 618 extension to the first major wave in the bull market  This leads to a rather simple bull market top projection  69     2580   180     4 270   As mentioned above these targets should be hit in the next 1   1 1 2 years  After this it may not be very wise to be long gold Medium TermThe current uptrend began in late June and ended an   8 1 2 month correction from  1923    1526  21    From the truncated low of  1547  gold has risen 16  to  1790  Notice there are two resistance pivots at  1793 and  1804  This area should prove to be an issue for gold over the next few weeks Currently  gold has a significant negative divergence and looks like we could get a bearish MACD cross  We should expect Minor 4 to correct anywhere between  35    65  and the uptrend should then resume  Gold could potentially make a new high during this uptrend  but the  1800    1830 level should provide stiff resistance  First target for Intermediate i    1820    1830 and second target new bull market highs   1920  1950   Short TermThe shorter term charts tend to offer many more probabilities  so let s try to view this time frame in the proper prospective  This impulse wave can be counted in a few different ways  but we try to stick to the most obvious count  The GLD recently ran into resistance at the March 2012 and November 2011 highs  and for the moment it appears Minor 4 started on Friday last week  Minor 4 should find support around the  1690  1660 level in GLD Alternate CountThe truncated wave in late June causes technicians a minor problem  Was it really a truncated wave or a true uptrend  For the moment the best answer is that we can t be 100  sure either way  For this reason an alternate count will be included on the GPX chart This count would mean gold is most likely in Minor 1 up of a potentially extending Intermediate iii wave  The next correction will give us some clues as to whether or not this alternate count is viable  Enjoy the rest of this gold bull market  since late next year will most likely end up marking the end of what has been a very nice bull run for the yellow metal ,2012-09-27,Tony Caldaro,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-in-last-1.5-years-of-34-year-cycle-137897,137897
