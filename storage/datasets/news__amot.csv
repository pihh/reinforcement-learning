19673,241188,AMOT,Woodward Focuses On Diversifying Revenue Source  Risks Stay,opinion,On Dec 28  we issued an updated research report on Woodward  Inc    NASDAQ WWD   The control solutions provider for the aerospace and industrial market has been investing significantly in technologies to secure new businesses  It is spending on manufacturing units and automation equipment to perk up efficiency as the company intends to accelerate production  Woodward is focusing on diversifying its revenue stream  Its plan to become a systems integrator has increased contract flow substantially  enabling it to capture a larger market share in the wide body commercial aircraft field The commercial aerospace market is expanding  driven by record passenger  cargo traffic and elevated load factors  Increased production in this space has been observed as aircraft operators continue to take delivery of new aircraft models that are more fuel efficient  The company is also witnessing growth in defense sales  driven by strong demand for smart weapons due to global uncertainty resulting in increased global defense spending Woodward s Aerospace business continues to perform well with production increases in the Airbus A320neo and Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX driving significant growth in commercial OEM sales  Momentum within its defense OEM business also remains strong  supported by guided weapon sales as well as fixed wing  rotorcraft and ground programs  The company believes that  in Aerospace business  TRAS systems for the Airbus A320neo  A330neo  Boeing 777X and fuel system for the GE9x are key program investments among others that will drive future growth  In Industrial segment  China VI compliant natural gas engine systems  new emission compliant diesel engine systems and new power converters on next generation wind turbines are also expected to fuel growth Further  to expand its footprint in the OEM market  the company acquired L Orange   a supplier of fuel injection systems for industrial diesel  heavy fuel oil and dual fuel   in June 2018  The buyout has enhanced Woodward s product portfolio as well as extended its presence in key end markets  It has proven to be a strong fit within the company s Industrial segment with solid technology platform and large installed base  The buyout is also likely to be significantly accretive to its fiscal 2019 results On the back of well execution of strategic plans  the company expects total net sales of  2 65  2 8 billion for fiscal 2019 with 10  and 30  rise in Aerospace and Industrial sales  respectively  year over year  While adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between  4 40 and  4 70  based on nearly 65 million outstanding shares  free cash flow is expected to be around  300 million The stock has gained 42 7  compared with 14 9  growth recorded by the  in the past three years RisksWithin power generation market  Woodward is witnessing demand related challenges in the industrial gas and turbine market as well as a drop in volume tied to renewables penetration and greater energy efficiency  The weakness in the company s renewables business is due to the short term unfavorable impact of platform transitions by some of its customers  With no notable improvement expected in these aspects before 2020  Woodward is expected to perform poorly in the power generation front Woodward has significant presence in the commercial aerospace market  which is cyclical in nature  It faces intense competition from a number of major players in the United States and abroad  Changes in competitive conditions  including factors like the availability of new products and services  introduction of new channels of distribution and changes in OEM and aftermarket pricing will likely hamper its association with clients and affect sales  Woodward caters to fewer customers than many companies with similar sales volumes  Any loss of its significant customer will have a material impact on the company s operational performance Nevertheless  we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks in the broader industry worth considering are Allied Motion Technologies Inc    NASDAQ AMOT    Badger Meter  Inc    NYSE BMI   and Arista Networks  Inc    NYSE ANET    each sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see           Allied Motion has a long term earnings growth expectation of 10  Badger Meter has a long term earnings growth expectation of 9  Arista has a long term earnings growth expectation of 21 7

19689,241204,AMOT,Watts Water  WTS  To Grow On Segmental Growth  Costs Ail,opinion,On May 23  we issued an updated research report on Watts Water Technologies  Inc    NYSE WTS    This maker of water safety and flow control products is anticipated to benefit from higher volume and pricing actions as well as restructuring actions  However  material cost inflation  incremental investments and product rationalization costs will weigh on margins in the near term  Let s illustrate these growth factors in detail  Segments Well Poised for Organic Sales Growth In the Americas segment  organic revenue growth is now expected at the higher end of its previous guidance of 3 5  in 2018  backed by solid first quarter performance with robust growth across most of its key products as well as platforms along with the impact of recently announced price increases  In the Americas  much of the non residential construction data remains positive while in residential new construction  repair and replacement indicators remain healthy  Overall  the residential market should continue to grow at a moderate pace for the year  The company projects organic sales growth in the range of 1 3  in Europe segment for the full year  In the Asia Pacific segment  Watts Water projects organic sales to grow between 7  and 10  for the year  with strong growth both inside and outside of China  All segments are anticipated to show operating margin improvement compared with 2017  The company anticipates its overall organic sales to increase approximately 3  in 2018  Higher Volume to Boost Operating Margin Watts Water estimates its consolidated operating margin to expand in the band of 50 70 basis points in 2018 on the back of higher volume and continued productivity increment efforts  including restructuring savings  The company continues to reinvest a portion of productivity savings in selling and marketing  R D and IT systems to fund near term growth  The company believes Asia Pacific segment s margin will expand primarily driven by higher volume  Further  operating margin in the Americas segment will expand on volume leverage and productivity initiatives  Watts Water anticipates that its pricing actions should also help to partly mitigate commodity inflation  Consequently  the company s pricing actions and restructuring benefits will drive margin performance in 2018  Product Innovation Will Prove Beneficial Watts Water strives to invest in product innovation  Over the past couple of years  the company invested in sales and marketing  and R D to roll out fresh products  It witnessed success in 2017 in underpenetrated regions like Korea and Latin America  on the back of products like IntelliStation  SmartSense and Benchmark Platinum  These have originated from the company s product development initiatives which will stoke growth  Cost Woes Material cost inflation due to the recent imposition of tariffs is expected to affect margins in the near term  Further  transportation costs are rising owing to oil cost increases and labor shortages  Though the company has implemented price increases  it will become effective in July  Consequently  second quarter margins will be impacted  Moreover  in case the company is unable to pass on increases in raw material to its customers in the future  its margins will be affected  Increased internal investments might impact margin expansion in the near term  The company plans incremental investments of  3  4 million in the second quarter  approximately  2 million in Americas   1 million in Europe and approximately  0 5 million in Asia Pacific  Product rationalization cost should be around  2 5 million in the second quarter comprising  1 5 million in Europe and  1 million in Asia Pacific  This will be a hindrance to Europe and Asia Pacific margins in the quarter  Share Price Performance  Watts Water has outperformed its  with respect to price performance over the past year  The stock has appreciated around 25   while the industry has recorded growth of 23   Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider Watts Water carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the same sector include

19756,241271,AMOT,What s In Store For KLA Tencor  KLAC  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"KLA Tencor Corporation   NASDAQ KLAC   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jul 28  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 15 00  
Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement KLA TENCOR CORP Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors to Consider
While uncertainties about the timing of capital equipment purchases remain for this leading provider of process control equipment  its acquisition by Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  is a positive for investors 
With reference to the proposed acquisition between the two companies  the United States Department of Justice  DOJ  has requested for additional information and documentary material  Moreover  to arrive at the terms of a consent decree  executives from both the companies are working with the staff of the DOJ  Both the companies remain optimistic on securing necessary regulatory approvals and expect the transaction to close in the third calendar quarter 
At present  both the companies have clearance from competition authorities in Germany  Ireland  Israel and Taiwan and are in talks with regulators in other jurisdictions 
Given the expected increase in 3D NAND deployments this year and Lam s strength in the area  which can lead to synergies  FinFET transition at foundries is a positive 
KLA Tencor s management is upbeat about a relatively strong performance in the to be reported quarter given the company s market leadership  new line of products  growing service revenues and a leaner cost structure 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  KLA expects shipments of  775  855 million and revenues in the range of  810  870 million  Non GAAP EPS is expected in the range of  1 30 to  1 50 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that KLA Tencor will beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  1 43  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  KLA Tencor carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions
