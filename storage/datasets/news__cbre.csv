payrolls and fall in unemployment rate in November  Also  consumer sentiment remains high and spending continues to be resilient  Household formation remains good  which will likely support the industry s growth   Moreover  easy availability of capital and comparatively lowers levels of interest rates keep the momentum upbeat Favorable Demographic Growth and Technology Embrace Demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent  In fact  a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life cycle events are getting delayed  This  again  is leading to an extension of the average age of first time homeownership  While millennials will continue to move into homeownership  affordability issues are likely to temper the pace  In fact  with high home ownership costs in several markets hindering transition from renter to homeowner  demand for rental housing units is likely to be decent  Further  residential REITs are embracing new technology  aimed at improving operating margins and customer experiences  which is encouraging  These apart  the student housing sector  which is part of the residential REIT industry  has been witnessing decent demand and pre leasing velocity despite more newer student beds Elevated Deliveries of New Units and Rent Control However  the struggle to lure renters is feared to continue into the near term  as supply volumes might remain aggressive  According to a CBRE Group  discussing 2020 multi family outlook  permits and starts will likely drop in 2020  but not deliveries  CBRE Group projects multi family completions to aggregate 280 000 units  nearly same as 2019 s estimated 281 000 units  Although rental housing demand has been robust in recent times  this high supply volume is a concern because it generally curbs residential landlords  ability to command more rents  and affect occupancy and concession levels  Moreover  new rent control regulations have been introduced in some of the major markets this year  while a number of other markets are being considered for establishing such regulations in future  This is likely to curb any significant growth in the top line Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Better ProspectsThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust   Residential industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  83  which places it at the top 33  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive funds from operations  FFO  per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group s growth potential  Over the past eight months  the industry s FFO per share estimate for the current year moved 1 3  north Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceThe REIT And Equity Trust   Residential Industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector  as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite so far in the year The industry has rallied 27  during this period compared with the S P

stable economy  a healthy job market with low unemployment level  and job gains and household formations Currently  there is no stock in the industry sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   However  there is a stock carrying a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   which seems a strategic one for addition to the portfolio as well as two other picks for considerations You can see  Sun Communities  Inc   This

12977,234492,CBRE,Acquisitions   Occupier Outsourcing Fuel CBRE Group s Growth,opinion,Shares of CBRE Group Inc    NYSE CBRE   have gained 20 7  in the past six months compared with its  16 2  growth  Earlier this month  the company delivered a better than expected third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share  indicating stellar revenue growth  Particularly  global occupier outsourcing  U S  property sales and commercial mortgage origination business lines were strong  though a lighter quarter of development asset sales partly muted its growth tempo The fundamentals appear solid for this commercial real estate service firm  with adequate scope for stock price appreciation in the long run CBRE Group has a robust scale as the largest commercial real estate services and investment firm  based on 2018 revenues   It is among the few companies offering a full suite of services to multi national clients  Moreover  the company has grown organically and banked on strategic in fill acquisitions to boost service offerings and geographic reach  Its market leading position and strategic reinvestment in business  specifically on the digital and technology front  is likely to give it a competitive edge in capitalizing on commercial real estate industry tailwinds The company has opted for a better balanced and more resilient business model  and in pursuit of this  has shifted the revenue mix toward more contractual sources and leasing  Contractual revenues and leasing  largely recurring over time  constituted 75  of total fee revenues in third quarter 2019 compared with the 61  recorded in 2006  This makes the company resilient to market disruptions and positions it well to achieve both top  and bottom line growth amid capital market headwinds  Notably  CBRE Group s projected sales growth is 11 1  for 2019  well ahead of the break even estimate for the industry Further  the company s Global Workplace Solutions segment  which provides a broad suite of integrated  contractually based services to occupiers of real estate  including facilities management  project management  transaction management and management consulting  is well poised to grow  Occupiers of real estate are increasingly opting for outsourcing and depending on the expertise of third party real estate specialists for better execution and efficiency  As a result  CBRE Group is witnessing continued momentum from both new and existing customers CBRE Group also enjoys liquidity of around  3 2 billion as of Sep 30  2019  and has a low leverage level  These provide the company a solid platform for growth  Its balance sheet is robust  with net leverage of about 0 65 terms of adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter  The company s solid business momentum  credit profile and growth in recurring revenues are likely to ensure steady cash flow in the upcoming period Furthermore  the recent trend in estimate revisions of 2019 earnings indicates a favorable outlook for the company  In fact  the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings per share been revised 1 4  upward over the past month  Therefore  given the improvement on fundamentals and positive estimate revisions  there is decent upside potential to the stock  Also  the company s long term growth is projected at 11   ahead of the industry s average of 8 6  However  investment volumes are expected to remain soft following a record 2018 as investors adopt a cautious approach  Also  trade tensions  political uncertainties and volatile equity markets are anticipated to increase woes  affecting transaction levels  In addition  though leasing demand is expected to remain robust in the rest of the year  the pace of growth is likely to be slower than the record year ago levels CBRE Group currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks to ConsiderColliers International Group Inc  s   TSX CIGI   Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 remained unchanged at  4 54 in a month s

12978,234493,CBRE,Is CBRE Group  CBRE  A Profitable Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBRE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CBRE Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 08  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 38  If we focus on the long term PE trend  CBRE Group s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 69  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that CBRE Group has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 24  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for CBRE Group stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  CBRE Group has a P S ratio of about 0 86  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  CBRE is in the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  CBRE Group currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CBRE Group a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the P CF ratio comes in at 1 39  which is lower than the industry average of 1 95  Clearly  CBRE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall    Though CBRE Group might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives CBRE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower while the full year 2020 estimate has seen three upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period      This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has increased by 1 4  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has improved by 3 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CBRE Group  Inc  Price and Consensus
 
   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  CBRE Group is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front   A strong industry rank  among top 36  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence However  over the past two years  the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for TodayExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of  24 6  per year These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout ",2019-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-cbre-group-cbre-a-profitable-stock-for-value-investors-200490755,200490755
12979,234494,CBRE,Top Research Reports For Disney  Wells Fargo   Vale,opinion,"Thursday  November 14  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Walt Disney Company  NYSE DIS   DIS   Wells Fargo  WFC  and Vale  VALE   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Disney s shares have underperformed the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry year to date  35 7  vs  38 2    The Zacks analyst believes that Disney will benefit from its solid slate of theatrical releases in the near term 
Disney reported impressive fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  driven by a solid top line performance in the Studio Entertainment and DTC businesses  However  higher operating losses in the DTC segment and Media Networks  operating income decline hurt profitability 
Moreover  Disney  has gained more than 10 million subscribers within 24 hours of its launch  making it a key catalyst for the company s prospects  However  the company anticipates higher operating losses in the DTC   International segment due to the ongoing investments  Moreover  increasing operating expenses related to domestic parks and resorts are expected to negatively impact profitability 
 You can  
Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 16 3  in the past six months against Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s rise of 15 2   The Zacks analyst believes that the company s third quarter earnings reflected lower net interest income  along with escalated costs and provisions  partly offset by high fee income 
Wells Fargo s earnings surprise history remains impressive  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  Though the company s investment in the businesses to enhance compliance and risk management capability seems impressive  Wells Fargo has been slapped with several sanctions  including a cap on asset growth  which continues on the CFPB s dissatisfaction with the bank s progress on fixing risk management issues 
Also  rising costs curb bottom line expansion  Recently  Wells Fargo appointed Charles W  Scharf as its second CEO post public and political outrage concerning the sales scam in 2016 
 You can  
Vale s shares have gained 2 3  over the past three months against the Zacks Basic Materials sector s rise of 6 6   The Zacks analyst believes that the company is likely to incur significant expenses for remediation actions following the dam failure 
Vale s third quarter 2019 earnings and revenues both improved from the prior year quarter but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts  The company trimmed 2019 iron ore and pellets sales guidance to 307 312 Mt  Lower commodity prices owing to a slowing global economy and trade dispute remain headwinds  Revenues in fiscal 2019 will be lower thanks to suspended operations following the Brumadinho disaster 
Nevertheless  Vale strives to deliver the highest possible margins by focusing on product line  improving productivity  controlling costs  better price realization  to name a few  Vale is also likely to gain from investment in projects  lower debt  efforts to ramp up coal business and transforming base metals business

12982,234497,CBRE,3 Office REIT Stocks To Grab As Labor Market Shows Resilience,opinion,After three interest rate cuts this year  with the latest in October  it is less likely that the Federal Reserve will announce another in its two day policy meeting on Wednesday The rate cuts were implemented  earlier this year  to provide a boost to the U S economy amid global economic slowdown  recession fears and the long standing U S  Sino trade war  The unexpected solid November job report and strong consumer sentiment suggest that the rate cuts have been effective so far and no more cuts are required for the time being Particularly  last Friday  the Labor Department reported that non farm payrolls surged 266 000  considerably beating the consensus forecast of 187 000  Moreover  the unemployment rate is back to this year s low of 3 5  compared with October s 3 6   This is also in line with the lowest unemployment rate since 1969  Further  average hourly earnings were up 3 1  year on year The Fed s neutral stance might not provide impetus to the REIT sector  However  companies in the sector have reduced sensitivity to interest rates by prudently managing their balance sheet and improving leverage levels  In addition  the recent volatility in the stock market induced by the political uncertainties and trade disputes indicates that the real estate sector will keep providing a relatively decent value to investors And given the resilience in the job market  encouraging macro economic conditions and stable fundamentals  office REITs are anticipated to hold up well in the near  to mid term  Further  it takes around six to 12 months for a change in office using employment growth to affect the total office real estate occupancy level Fundamentals to Remain SteadyWith the nation witnessing a historic economic expansion  the July September period marked the 30th consecutive quarter of positive office absorption and the 40th consecutive quarter of office using employment growth  This trend is expected to continue in the next year as well In fact  per the CBRE Group  Inc  s   NYSE CBRE   2020  for the U S  real estate market  office using employment is projected to be up 0 3  or 45 700 jobs next year  Hence  continued job creation in the office using sectors will boost leasing activities and absorptions  stoking office real estate sector growth in the upcoming period Technology Industry to Fuel Leasing ActivityThe tech industry continues to be a major tenant of office landlords  Per the outlook  tech tenants accounted for 21 6  of the overall leasing activity in first half 2019  Furthermore  as of mid 2019  nearly 4 000 tenants were looking for large blocks of office spaces  with tech tenants representing the highest percentage Looking ahead  the technical workforce is to shoot up 13 2  from 2016 through 2026  Thus  tech tenants will likely impact office demand significantly in the days ahead Emerging U S  Office Markets to Witness High Demand Additionally  the emerging U S  office markets have become an attractive alternative to primary markets for large tenants  owing to relatively lower rental rates  high levels of modern office space as well as talented and educated workforce  And banking on this  a number of tech and finance companies have been expanding in emerging markets  This will propel strong positive net absorption and offer

12983,234498,CBRE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  CBRE  Cousins Properties  Kilroy Realty And Piedmont Office,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  December 11  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBRE    Cousins Properties Inc    NYSE CUZ    Kilroy Realty Corp    NYSE KRC   and Piedmont Office Realty Trust  Inc    NYSE PDM   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 3 Office REIT Stocks to Grab as Labor Market Shows ResilienceAfter three interest rate cuts this year  with the latest in October  it is less likely that the Federal Reserve will announce another in its two day policy meeting on Wednesday The rate cuts were implemented  earlier this year  to provide a boost to the U S economy amid global economic slowdown  recession fears and the long standing U S  Sino trade war  The unexpected solid November job report and strong consumer sentiment suggest that the rate cuts have been effective so far and no more cuts are required for the time being Particularly  last Friday  the Labor Department reported that non farm payrolls surged 266 000  considerably beating the consensus forecast of 187 000  Moreover  the unemployment rate is back to this year s low of 3 5  compared with October s 3 6   This is also in line with the lowest unemployment rate since 1969  Further  average hourly earnings were up 3 1  year on year The Fed s neutral stance might not provide impetus to the REIT sector  However  companies in the sector have reduced sensitivity to interest rates by prudently managing their balance sheet and improving leverage levels  In addition  the recent volatility in the stock market induced by the political uncertainties and trade disputes indicates that the real estate sector will keep providing a relatively decent value to investors And given the resilience in the job market  encouraging macro economic conditions and stable fundamentals  office REITs are anticipated to hold up well in the near  to mid term  Further  it takes around six to 12 months for a change in office using employment growth to affect the total office real estate occupancy level Fundamentals to Remain SteadyWith the nation witnessing a historic economic expansion  the July September period marked the 30th consecutive quarter of positive office absorption and the 40th consecutive quarter of office using employment growth  This trend is expected to continue in the next year as well In fact  per the CBRE Group  Inc  s 2020  for the U S  real estate market  office using employment is projected to be up 0 3  or 45 700 jobs next year  Hence  continued job creation in the office using sectors will boost leasing activities and absorptions  stoking office real estate sector growth in the upcoming period Technology Industry to Fuel Leasing ActivityThe tech industry continues to be a major tenant of office landlords  Per the outlook  tech tenants accounted for 21 6  of the overall leasing activity in first half 2019  Furthermore  as of mid 2019  nearly 4 000 tenants were looking for large blocks of office spaces  with tech tenants representing the highest percentage Looking ahead  the technical workforce is to shoot up 13 2  from 2016 through 2026  Thus  tech tenants will likely impact office demand significantly in the days ahead Emerging U S  Office Markets to Witness High Demand Additionally  the emerging U S  office markets have become an attractive alternative to primary markets for large tenants  owing to relatively lower rental rates  high levels of modern office space as well as talented and educated workforce  And banking on this  a number of tech and finance companies have been expanding in emerging markets  This will propel strong positive net absorption and offer opportunities for new Class A developments or renovations of well situated Class B office spaces Our Key PicksGiven the factors discussed above  we believe it is an appropriate time to invest in some fundamentally

12993,234508,CBRE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  CBRE  Colliers International  Jones Lang LaSalle And Newmark,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 13  2019   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Real Estate Operations  including CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE    Colliers International Group Inc    TSX CIGI    Jones Lang LaSalle Inc    NYSE JLL   and Newmark Group  Inc    NASDAQ NMRK   Link   Zacks Real Estate Operations industry comprises companies that provide leasing  property management  investment management  valuation  development services  facilities management  project management  transaction and consulting services  among others  Nonetheless  real estate investment trusts or REITs are excluded from this group The industry had been on a steady run  post the financial crisis  Commercial real estate markets enjoyed elevated demand for space  high occupancy  rising absorptions and escalating rents  A recovering economy and job market gains have  undoubtedly  aided this growth  However  low cost credit availability  as well as rising institutional capital inflows toward commercial real estate provided a decent impetus  aiding the industry to excel and helping prominent player  like CBRE Group  register decent gains Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Steady economy  capital availability and technology investments A stable economic progression in the United States  together with steady employment growth  is likely to support the industry s expansion  Moreover  easy availability of capital and comparatively lower levels of interest rates are anticipated to keep the momentum upbeat  These apart  investments in strategic acquisitions  human capital and technology will likely keep being the key focus for this industry s constituent companies  These efforts offer significant competitive edge  help in market share gains  and aid in differentiating from peers Outsourcing of real estate needs Occupiers of real estate  such as corporations  public sector entities  health care providers and others  are increasingly opting for outsourcing of real estate needs  and depending on the expertise of third party real estate specialists for execution and efficiency improvement  This trend is likely to continue in the upcoming period  opening up scope for constituents of the real estate operations industry  Particularly  the large players are banking on this trend  with both existing as well as new client wins Maturing cycle  global economic and geopolitical uncertainty Nevertheless  the industry seems to be entering the later stages of its growth cycle  Investment volumes are expected to remain soft  given investors  cautious stance  although there is ample availability of relatively low cost financing  Furthermore  trade tensions  rising geopolitical uncertainties and slowing regional economies in the Asia Pacific are anticipated to add to the woes  affecting transaction levels  In addition  though leasing demand is expected to remain robust through the remaining of the year  growth pace might be slower than the record year ago levels Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Real Estate Operations industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  51  which places it at the top 20  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s Zacks Industry Rank  which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings per share estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group s growth potential  Over the past year  the industry s earnings per share estimate for 2019 moved up 8 4  Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks Real Estate Operations industry has outperformed both the broader Zacks Finance sector  and the Zacks S P 500 composite in a year s time The industry has rallied 20 9  during this period compared with the S P 500 s rise of 12 8   During the same time frame  the broader Finance sector has appreciated 6 8  Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to EPS ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Real Estate Operations stocks  we see that the industry is currently trading at 20 00X compared to the S P 500 s forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  of 17 82X  The industry is also trading above the Finance sector s forward 12 month P E of 14 56X  This is shown in the chart below Forward 12 Month Price To Earnings RatioOver the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 23 11X  as low as 14 03X  with a median of 19 45X Bottom LineIn a nutshell  amid stable economic growth and steady employment gains  occupancy levels are high and rents decent  Interest rate levels are still low and there is decent availability of capital in the market  Along with these  the rising trend of outsourcing of real estate needs by companies will provide ample scope for growth to the real estate operations industry Here we present three stocks from the industry with

12997,234512,CBRE,Analysts Estimate CBRE Group  CBRE  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of real estate investment management services is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 78 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 73 billion  up 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 25  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CBRE 
For CBRE  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CBRE will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CBRE would post earnings of  0 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 81  delivering a surprise of  3 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CBRE doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-cbre-group-cbre-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200480141,200480141
12998,234513,CBRE,Top Stock Reports For Amazon  Boeing   Micron,opinion,"Wednesday  October 30  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Amazon com  Inc   NASDAQ AMZN   The Boeing Company  NYSE BA  and Micron Technology  Inc   NASDAQ MU   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Amazon s shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry on a year to date basis   17 7  vs   18 9    The Zacks analyst believes that rising transportation cost related to its free one day shipping service remains an overhang and is likely to escalate further  Amazon also expects foreign exchange headwinds to continue impacting the top line 
However  the company did benefit from solid Prime momentum owing to robust grocery services and strong content portfolio  Moreover  Prime Free One Day service helped Amazon in gaining traction across customers  Improving Alexa skills and features remain a major positive  while expanding smart home products offerings remain tailwinds 
 You can  
Boeing s shares have underperformed the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry so far this year   8 0  vs   21 3    The Zacks analyst believes that Boeing s commercial business has suffering due to lower 737 deliveries  following 737 Max product line s grounding and subsequent costs associated with it  Consequently  its revenues  earnings and cash flow position were affected significantly 
However  Boeing still remains the largest aircraft manufacturer globally in terms of revenues  orders and deliveries  and one of the major aerospace and defense contractors  Its proposed joint venture with Embraer is expected to strengthen its commercial business significantly 
 You can  
Micron s shares have underperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry on a year to date basis   50 6  vs   51 6    The Zacks analyst believes that higher mix of NAND  which has lower gross margin  falling memory prices and a slow decline in manufacturing cost  is likely to keep Micron s margins under pressure 
But  Micron is still well poised to benefit from the resurgence in DRAM demand  backed by a progress in customer inventory adjustments in the cloud  graphics and the PC markets  Moreover  its focus on increasing the mix of high value solutions in its portfolio is a boon

13001,234516,CBRE,CBRE Group  CBRE  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 79 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 78 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 79 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 28   A quarter ago  it was expected that this provider of real estate investment management services would post earnings of  0 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 81  delivering a surprise of 3 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
CBRE  which belongs to the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry  posted revenues of  5 93 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 36   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 26 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CBRE shares have added about 38 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 22 7  
What s Next for CBRE 
While CBRE has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CBRE was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 36 on  6 76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 75 on  23 34 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

13002,234517,CBRE,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love CBRE  CBRE ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this provider of real estate investment management services a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for CBRE is 17 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 14 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 7  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for CBRE is 20 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 10  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for CBRE have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made CBRE a Zacks Rank  1 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions CBRE well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-cbre-cbre-200479411,200479411
13015,234530,CBRE,Duke Realty  DRE  Gears Up For Q3 Earnings  What To Expect,opinion,Duke Realty Corp    NYSE DRE   is scheduled to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 30  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in its funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues In the last reported quarter  this industrial real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 2 86   Results indicated overall improved operations as well as increased investments in new industrial properties Over the preceding four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and met estimates in the other  the average beat being 2 23   The graph below depicts this surprise history Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things have shaped up Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate asset category has grabbed headlines in a rising e commerce market and continues to play a pivotal role  transforming the way how consumers shop and receive their goods  Nevertheless  rising supply as well as a slowdown in global growth  together with trade disputes  have been raising concerns  of late  about this industry s growth prospects Per a  by the commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE     with an increase in completion  the U S  industrial   logistics sector witnessed a 10 basis point uptick in vacancy rate to 4 4  in the third quarter  However  net asking rents inched up 1 3  quarter on quarter to  7 57 per square feet   representing the highest level since CBRE started tracking the metric in 1989  Moreover  rents have climbed 5 7  year over year and this also indicates more than 2 percentage points above the average annual growth rate since 2012 Notably  e commerce  food   beverage and home improvement companies have been driving leasing activities  In fact  resilient consumer sentiment  low unemployment level and rising wages are playing key roles in keeping up the industrial and logistics sector s healthy performance  Services like same day delivery are gaining traction and last mile properties in high income urban areas are witnessing solid pricing  occupancy and growth in rentals As for Duke Realty  its solid capacity to bank on this favorable trend will likely have helped the company witness active leasing and healthy rent levels across a number of properties during the July September period  The company focuses on having facilities in major MSAs  and key trucking  rail  air cargo and shipping corridors  Such locations help generate solid demand from e commerce and traditional distribution customers for its industrial properties Particularly  the company inked three leases at Greenfield North Business Park  located at Garner  NC in the third quarter  The deals include a renewal and expansion at Greenfield North 900 as well as new leases at Greenfield North 800 and Greenfield North 900 Moreover  Duke Realty signed five leases aggregating 860 296 square feet in September for four of its properties  The transactions include two full building leases at the company s recently delivered spec properties  a new lease and renewal that enabled another property to achieve full occupancy  as well as another new lease in another building Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s revenues is currently pinned at  215 9 million  indicating a 9 7  increase from the prior year quarter s reported tally However  recovery in the industrial market has continued for long and a whole lot of new buildings became available in the market during the quarter under consideration  leading to higher supply  and lesser scope for any robust rent and occupancy growth The company s activities during the September end quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Therefore  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter 2019 FFO per share remained unchanged at 37 cents  over the last 30 days  However  the figure indicates projected year over year growth of 5 7  Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Duke Realty this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of a FFO beat  But that s not the case here  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Although Duke Realty carries a Zacks Rank of 3  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter Stag Industrial  Inc    NYSE STAG    scheduled to release earnings on Oct 30  has an Earnings ESP of  1 10  and currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3  You can see  Digital Realty Trust  Inc    NYSE DLR

13020,234535,CBRE,Add These 5 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest coverage ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screening Skechers U S A   Inc    NYSE SKX    which designs  develops  markets  and distributes footwear  has a VGM Score of B  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 15  for 3 5 years  You can see  Amedisys  Inc    NASDAQ AMED    which provides healthcare services  has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 16 3  for 3 5

growth rate of 15  for 3 5 years Rush Enterprises  Inc    NASDAQ RUSHA    which operates as an integrated retailer of commercial vehicles and related services  has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS

13041,234556,CBRE,Better Than Last Monday  But Still Down Over 1 ,opinion,"The weekend didn t improve the market s recent trade jitters  as the major indices returned to work on Monday and slumped more than 1   
	The Dow dropped 1 48   or nearly 390 points  to 25 897 71  The S P slipped 1 22  to 2883 09 and the NASDAQ was off 1 25  or about 95 points  to 7863 41  
	Stocks managed to come off their lows late in the session  
	We had a MUCH better Monday than last week  which was the worst day of 2019 so far  The indices plunged around 3  or more on China allowing the yuan to devalue against the dollar  The market did a great job at paring those losses to about a half percent by Friday  
	It looks like we ll be playing from behind again this week  though with a much slimmer deficit  
	Stocks have been volatile since the beginning of the month when President Trump threatened an additional 10  tariff on  300 billion worth of Chinese goods  It reiterated just how far the two sides are from any kind of trade deal  and the worsening Hong Kong protests could further complicate and delay any negotiations  
	For example  if China decides to use their military to confront the protestors  then it could mean an end to the trade talks planned for September   
	All of these trade issues are exacerbating concerns of slowing growth around the world  On Monday  we saw bond yields continue to move lower while the 2 year and 10 year treasury yields are getting closer to inverting  
	So the market s got a lot on its mind right now  
	Will there be anything this week to give it some relief  Maybe  Earnings season is coming to an end  though we ll still see reports in the coming days from Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  and Nvidia  We ll also be getting reports on CPI and retail sales  
	However  will good news on these fronts be enough to soothe the market s nerves  And let s not forget that a rogue headline or Tweet out of nowhere could end up having the biggest impact

13044,234559,CBRE,Second Straight Monday With A 1  Advance ,opinion,"Feeling a little d j  vu 
	You should be 
	This was the second straight Monday with stocks gaining 1  in hopes of breaking a weekly losing streak 
	The NASDAQ jumped 1 32   or nearly 102 points  to 7853 74 and the S P rose 1 1  to 2878 38  The Dow advanced 1 05   or nearly 270 points  to 25 898 83 
	These indices each dropped by more than 2  on Friday  spoiling a chance to break their losing streaks  Stocks went into that session with gains of approximately 1  through Thursday  but finished the week with losses of over 1  thanks to the late selloff 
	Positive comments on trade from President Trump prompted today s rally  He said the U S  and China would be getting back to the negotiating table  though China denied such a call took place 
	But it didn t matter  It was the headline that counted  as has been the case with this market for a while now  Stocks liked what they heard and so they took off to reclaim part of last Friday s deficit 
	It was as simple as that 
	Just like headlines change from day to day  so can the President s tone  On Friday  he was irate after China put new tariffs on U S  goods  so irate  in fact  that he ordered U S  companies to stop doing business with China in a series of tweets 
	And then after the bell on Friday  he increased tariff rates on Chinese imports 
	Hopefully  that was enough tit for tat to tide the two sides over for a while  Because this market will continue taking its cue from news reports and Presidential tweets until something real happens 
	That s especially true this week  as we move toward a three day weekend with earnings season done and economic data rather light until next week s turn of the month deluge 
	Let s see if we can get through the rest of this week without any more drama  because it feels like stocks are willing to rise if things can calm down a bit  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Technology Innovators  Now that UpWork  UPWK  is near its 52 week lows  Brian sees a fantastic opportunity for a classic  buy low  sell high  trade on a stock he s been watching for a while  UPWK is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  provider of online recruitment services that jumped after a strong quarterly report earlier this month  but the trade war impact took a toll on the stock  The editor saw a great entry point to buy a company that has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  Analysts still expect losses for this year and next  but those losses have been narrowing in the past several weeks  With margins headed higher  Brian thinks UPWK is set for profitability in the next year or so  Read the full write up for more Insider Trader  Shares of Mosaic  MOS  have plunged to 5 year lows and are down more than 26  in the last month alone  as fertilizers remains a  hated  industry  Tracey thinks the sell off is absurd  and so does one of the company s directors  who bought nearly 13 000 shares last week at  19 21  The editor can t be certain that fertilizer stocks won t move lower  of course  but she likes that Wall Street is paying no attention to this space right now  That s usually when they find a bottom  Still  Tracey is going to be cautious and buy MOS with a smaller  5  allocation  Read the full write up for more and be ready for additional buys this week as the portfolio still has plenty of cash Black Box Trader  Half of the portfolio was changed in this week s adjustment  The stocks that were sold included

13045,234560,CBRE,5 ROE Stocks To Profit As Trade War Flip Flops Rattle Market,opinion,The U S  equity markets continued to be highly volatile as President Trump flip flopped on the trade war and

 we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater

13059,234574,CBRE,NMRK Vs  CBRE  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Real Estate   Operations stocks have likely encountered both Newmark Group  NMRK  and CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Newmark Group and CBRE Group are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
NMRK currently has a forward P E ratio of 5 66  while CBRE has a forward P E of 14 41  We also note that NMRK has a PEG ratio of 0 67  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  CBRE currently has a PEG ratio of 1 31 
Another notable valuation metric for NMRK is its P B ratio of 1 62  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CBRE has a P B of 3 31 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NMRK s Value grade of B and CBRE s Value grade of C 
Both NMRK and CBRE are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that NMRK is the superior value option right now ",2019-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nmrk-vs-cbre-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200453619,200453619

	Stocks are coming off their first positive week in a month  The Dow jumped 3  last week with the other major indices advancing by just under that mark  
	But its going to be tough to repeat now that this week begins in a hole with only three more days to climb out  
	We knew this would probably be a rough session because the U S  and China were scheduled to put new tariffs on each other over the weekend  And they did  There were no delays from either side to grease the wheels for a future meeting  
	Therefore  we re left wondering if there will be any get togethers between the two sides this month to try and bring this year long trade conflict to an end  President Trump still thinks it s possible  
	As if that weren t enough  the ISM s U S  manufacturing index showed its first contraction in over three years  It came down to 49 1   anything below 50  suggests contraction 
	That s not what a market worried about recession wants to hear  Hopefully  the Government Employment Situation report on Friday will be more cooperative    
	Last month started with a trade induced selloff as well and turned into a rough time for investors  Despite the strong ending  the NASDAQ still slipped by 2 7  in August while the other major indices were down by nearly 2

13065,234580,CBRE,REITs To Watch For Q2 Earnings On Aug 2  WPC  CHSP   BFS,opinion,After hiking interest rates on an accelerated pace till 2018  the Fed has put rate hikes on hold this year  In fact  on Jul 31  the central bank announced its first rate cut since December 2008  lowering the target range for overnight lending rate by 25 basis points  bps   With this  the interest rate range now stands at 2 2 25  REITs  major beneficiaries of a declining rate environment due to their interest rate sensitivity  are expected to display improvement  given strengths in the underlying asset categories in which these companies invest In fact  going by a  by the Boulder Group  cap rates for the U S  single tenant net lease sector declined across all three major sectors   retail  office and industrial   during the June end quarter  Specifically  following five consecutive quarters of upward movement  the retail sector witnessed a decline of 4 bps to 6 23  in its cap rates  Further  cap rates for office and industrial sectors contracted 3 and 1 bps  respectively Change in the Fed s monetary policy stance resulted in the downward movement in cap rates during the quarter  Further  as many believe this is the last stage of the current real estate cycle  companies are putting greater emphasis on tenant credit quality and lease length to withstand any uncertainty in the market This earnings season also seems to be lackluster for hotel REITs as the sector witnessed its slowest RevPAR growth rate since 2010  per a  by CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE    In fact  national hotel demand growth rate was 1 9  for the April June quarter  shrinking 0 5  as compared with the prior quarter  Furthermore  supply growth remained at 2   while occupancy edged down 0 1  year over year  These factors limited RevPAR growth by 1 1   year on year The recent  from Reis shows that the vacancy rate of neighborhood and community shopping center contracted 10 bps sequentially to 10 1  in the second quarter  denoting its first decline since the first quarter of 2016  The Regional Mall vacancy rate was flat in the second quarter at 9 3   Store closures continue to affect Regional Mall vacancy  Nonetheless  national average asking rent and effective rent  which nets out landlord concessions  both  inched up 0 4  sequentially and 1 7  from the year ago quarter Let s take a sneak peek into how the following REITs are poised prior to their second quarter earnings release on Aug 2 W  P  Carey Inc    NYSE WPC   is set to release its quarterly numbers before the market opens The REIT is engaged in providing long term sale leaseback and build to suit financing for companies  It focuses on investing in high quality single tenant industrial  warehouse  offices and retail properties  which it

Additionally  the market has achieved a 3  increase in rents from the prior year level  attaining an average of  1 390 per month Though the retail real estate market is undergoing structural changes  recent  from Reis indicates stability in the vacancy rate and rent levels  It also suggests that the sector has been able to weather such challenges to some extent as the retail landlords continued

13083,234598,CBRE,CBRE Group  CBRE  Is Up 1 48  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  CBRE Group currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CBRE that show why this provider of real estate investment management services shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CBRE  shares are up 1 48  over the past week while the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 2 93  compares favorably with the industry s 0 17  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of CBRE Group have increased 12 12  over the past quarter  and have gained 10 5  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 1 53  and 7 04   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CBRE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CBRE is currently averaging 1 140 715 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CBRE 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CBRE s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 61 to  3 63 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that CBRE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep CBRE Group on your short list ",2019-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cbre-group-cbre-is-up-148-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200450053,200450053
13084,234599,CBRE,CBRE Group  CBRE  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of real estate investment management services is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 80 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 1  
Revenues are expected to be  5 53 billion  up 8 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 49  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CBRE 
For CBRE  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CBRE will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CBRE would post earnings of  0 59 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 79  delivering a surprise of  33 90  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CBRE doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cbre-group-cbre-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200445020,200445020
13085,234600,CBRE,Factors Setting The Tone For Host Hotels   HST  Q2 Earnings,opinion,Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc    NYSE HST   is slated to report second quarter 2019 results after market close on Aug 6  The company s results are anticipated to reflect year over year decline in revenues  while funds from operations  FFO  per share is expected to remain flat In the last reported quarter  this Bethesda  MD based lodging real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of around 6 67  with respect to FFO per share  Results reflect increase in average room rate  However  the Marriott transformational capital program and the government shutdown dampened the company s RevPAR performance The company has an impressive surprise history  It posted positive surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 5 79   This is depicted in the graph below Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderHost Hotels has a solid portfolio of luxury and upper upscale resorts and properties situated across central business districts of main cities  and in close proximity to airports  To further strengthen its asset base  the company has undertaken several value enhancement initiatives  These will likely improve its operating statistics for the quarter In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter RevPAR is pegged at  205  indicating year over year growth of 4   Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter average daily rate is pinned at  246  indicating growth of 4 7  year on year The company has also undertaken an accretive capital recycling program to improve its portfolio quality and hotel RevPAR  This entails lowering its international footprint  and using sale proceeds to acquire iconic resorts and new properties with limited near term capital needs in strategic markets  These efforts will likely favor the company s upcoming results The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues is pegged at  1 5 billion  indicating a decline of 0 8  from the year ago reported figure However   the second quarter earnings season seems to be lackluster for hotel REITs as the sector witnessed its slowest RevPAR growth rate since 2010  per a  by CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE    In fact  national hotel demand growth rate was 1 9  for the April June quarter  shrinking 0 5  compared with the prior quarter  Furthermore  supply growth remained at 2   while occupancy edged down 0 1  year over year  These factors limited RevPAR growth by 1 1   year on year These underlying hotel fundamentals foreshadow Host Hotels  muted growth during the quarter under review  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues from rooms is pegged at  967 million  suggesting a marginal decline from the year ago quarter s tally of  973 million  Additionally  average occupancy rate is expected to remain flat  year over year  at 84  Moreover  Host Hotels  efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through strategic dispositions will likely result in the near term earnings dilution during the June end quarter Also  there was no solid catalyst during the quarter  Hence  in a month s time  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share remained unrevised at 54 cents  Moreover  the figure is flat year over year

13086,234601,CBRE,Worst Day Of The Year As China Punches Back,opinion,"The major indices just suffered through their worst session of 2019 as China didn t wait long to retaliate against President Trump s tariff threat from last week   
	The country allowed the yuan to drop to its lowest level against the dollar in 10 years  It also suspended purchases of U S  agricultural products and may slap on its own tariffs somewhere down the road 
	These moves come just a few days after the President Tweeted about an additional 10  tariff on  300 billion worth of Chinese goods beginning September 1 
	The market fears that a resolution to this trade conflict could be a far way off and grow even more contentious moving forward 
	The NASDAQ plunged 3 47   or about 278 points  to 7 726 04  while the S P dropped 2 98  to 2844 74  The Dow slipped 2 9   or around 767 points  to 25 717 74  That s one day 
	One of the few bits of good news on Monday was that stocks managed to pare some of the losses in the last hour  For example  the Dow was down more than 950 points at its worst of the session 
	Stocks have actually been slipping ever since last Wednesday when the Fed Chair talked about the quarter point rate cut as a  midcycle  move that does not guarantee future easing  And the day after was the tariff threat Tweets   
	Last week  the NASDAQ plunged 4   while the S P slipped 3 2   Both of these indices are now on 6 day losing streaks  The Dow declined 2 7  and has been in the red for 5 days in a row 
	The major indices were right around all time highs before all this drama got started  Now they re 5  or more away from those records in just a few days    
	Investors are left wondering if there s more downside to come or if the market will bounce back a bit  It s hard to make an educated guess when an unexpected headline or Tweet can send stocks dramatically higher or lower at a moment s notice 
	The important thing to remember is that the strong fundamentals of this economy haven t changed  We re coming to the end of a better than expected earnings season and unemployment remains historically low 
	So let s just take a breath and see what happens in the days ahead   Today s Portfolio Highlights  TAZR Trader  With the potential for further downside in the market  Kevin doesn t feel like holding genomic analysis company Invitae  NVTA  through its earnings report tomorrow  Instead  the editor decided to secure a more than 39  return in a little over two months for this small and innovative company  He d be interested in adding it again around  20 
	Meanwhile  a sharp downturn like today s is a great time to take a chance with something like the NASDAQ 100 3X Bull ETF  TQQQ   Kevin added this fund on Monday with a 5  allocation and would add more if the downturn continues toward the 200 day moving average  The editor also added to the portfolio s Domo  DOMO  position as it tests the June lows just above  25  Read the complete commentary for more Surprise Trader  Selling into a panic is a bad idea  Instead  Dave decided to use this sharp downturn to add a 12 5  allocation in InterActive Corp   IAC   which owns popular websites Match com and Tinder  The company has an impressive Earnings ESP of 36 5  for the quarter coming after the bell on Wednesday  August 7  Read the complete commentary for more on this new buy  Counterstrike  One good thing about a sharp selloff in a strong economy is the opportunities that it opens  if you don t panic  Jeremy has been through several of these pullbacks  so he has no problem dipping his toe into western footwear   apparel company Boot Barn Holdings  BOOT  and toy staple Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  with 4  allocations each  Both of these companies pulled back despite strong quarterly reports  which included earnings surprises of more than 50   He also added 5  to the Deckers Outdoor  DECK  position 
	But that wasn t all  Other moves on Monday included short selling GoDaddy  GDDY  with a 5  allocation after the cloud based products company moved higher despite a weak quarterly report  Finally  Jeremy got out of his silver play ProShares Ultra Silver  AGQ  with a nearly 17  return in less than a month and also got rid of a couple losers  Read the complete commentary for more on all of today s moves   Technology Innovators  Last week  the portfolio sold Facebook  NASDAQ FB  for a nice double digit return amid the social media giant s many headwinds  Today  Brian picked up another FAANG by adding Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   which posted a strong quarterly report recently and has less friction than FB at the moment  In the current environment though  the editor really appreciates that the stock is relatively insulated from the trade war due to the breadth of its operations around the world  He believes GOOGL can absorb most of the impacts on the currency fronts  Read the full write up for more  Black Box Trader  The portfolio had big changes this week with six swaps in all  The stocks that were sold on Monday included

13092,234607,CBRE,CBRE  CBRE  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for CBRE basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For CBRE  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for CBRE
This provider of real estate investment management services is expected to earn  3 63 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 10 7  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for CBRE  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

13097,234612,CBRE,Factors Setting The Tone For Vornado  VNO  In Q2 Earnings,opinion,Vornado Realty Trust   NYSE VNO   is scheduled to report second quarter results on Jul 29  after the closing bell  Results are projected to display year over year decline in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this NY based real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a negative surprise of 13 19  in terms of FFO per share  The company exited the quarter with lower year over year occupancy at its New York and theMART portfolios  Further  a decline in same store NOI witnessed in these segments affected results Over the preceding four quarters  Vornado missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and surpassed in the other  the average negative surprise being 2 26   This is depicted in the graph below Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderThe retail real estate market showed signs of recovery in second quarter 2019  as indicated by the increase in average net asking rents and total retail sales  Per a  by CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE    rebound in consumer sentiment enabled the retail industry to enjoy higher average net asking rents of  18 01 per square foot Furthermore  net absorption of retail space totaled nearly 3 6 million square feet of space during the quarter  suggesting elevated demand for retail space  The favorable retail environment is expected to have benefited Vornado s retail properties that are predominantly present in Manhattan   Also  amid stable economic environment and job market growth  demand for the company s New York City office portfolio is likely to have remained high  Amid this  revenues for the to be reported quarter are pinned at  542 6 million  calling for year over year growth of 0 14  In addition  occupancy in the company s New York retail and office portfolio is estimated to have been unchanged at 97  sequentially for the quarter ended Jun 30  2019 Moreover  in the second quarter  Vornado made strategic attempts to improve its core business by executing opportunistic divestures that provided the company with the dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic acquisitions and redevelopments  In June  Vornado announced an agreement to sell its 25  interest in 330 Madison Avenue This apart  in April  Vornado announced the sale of 45 4  common equity interest in its portfolio of high street retail properties at Upper Fifth Avenue and Times Square  NYSE SQ   to a group of institutional investors  The transaction will reflect a tax gain of nearly  735 million and financial statement gain of around  2 6 billion in second quarter 2019  Moreover  after tax net gain on the sale of 220 Central Park South condominium units will improve FFO per share by 44 cents However  Vornado s properties too are expected to be to impacted by a number of store closures at the priciest retail corridors that continue to torment the retail industry  During the quarter under review  British apparel brand  Topshop  joined a growing list of retailers that announced store closures  shutting doors at all of its 11 U S  stores  The apparel chain is a tenant at Vornado s 608 Fifth Avenue  Hence  the company will record a non cash impairment losses and related write offs  substantially all on 608 Fifth Avenue  reducing FFO per share by 38 cents per share Lastly  prior to its quarterly earnings release  the company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the June end quarter s FFO per share has been revised marginally downward to 93 cents over the past week  reflecting analysts  bearish sentiments  Also  it represents a year over year decline of 15 5 Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Vornado is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive   and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earning ESP

13102,234617,CBRE,Will CBRE  CBRE  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   which belongs to the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry 
This provider of real estate investment management services has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 18 87  
For the most recent quarter  CBRE was expected to post earnings of  0 78 per share  but it reported  0 81 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 85   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 59 per share  while it actually produced  0 79 per share  a surprise of 33 90  
Price and EPS Surprise

For CBRE  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CBRE has an Earnings ESP of  6 97  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-cbre-cbre-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200471938,200471938
13103,234618,CBRE,Top Analyst Reports For Intel  Oracle   Novo Nordisk,opinion,"Tuesday  October 15  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Intel  INTC   Oracle  ORCL  and Novo Nordisk  CSE NOVOb   NVO   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Intel s shares have outperformed the Zacks General Semiconductor industry year to date  3 1  vs   6 4    The Zacks analyst believes that Intel is benefiting from rising demand witnessed in its higher performance products  both in data center and client domains 
Moreover  synergies from its Mobileye  F 0ME  acquisition and growing clout in ADAS market favor the company s growth prospects  Further  Intel s strategy of expanding TAM beyond CPU to adjacent product lines like silicon photonics  fabric  network ASICs  and 3D XPoint memory is yielding results 
The launch of its new 10nm technology based AI chip  Springhill  holds promise  However  weakness in demand from China and softness in NAND flash pricing trends  expenses pertaining to 10 nanometer  nm  ramp and constrained supply remain major concerns  Moreover  intensifying competition and pricing pressure from AMD remains a headwind 
 You can  
Shares of Oracle have gained 3 4  in the past six months  compared with the Zacks Computer Software industry s rise of 8 2   The Zacks analyst believes that Oracle is benefiting from strong adoption of cloud based solutions  comprising NetSuite ERP  Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM  among others 
Partnerships with the likes of Accenture  NYSE ACN  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  are expected to aid Oracle in expanding cloud based clientele  Moreover  strong demand for the latest autonomous database supported by ML is likely to bolster the top line and provide a competitive edge against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  AWS  in the Database as a Service market 
Nonetheless  stiff competition in the cloud market from dominant players is anticipated to weigh on profits  Further  lower hardware volumes are expected to hurt the top line  keeping margins under pressure  Additionally  integration risks from buyouts remain a concern  Notably  shares of Oracle have underperformed the industry in the past year 
 You can  
Novo Nordisk s shares have gained 9  over the past three months  compared with the Zacks Biotech industry s rise of 0 4   The Zacks analyst believes a solid performance from Tresiba  Victoza  Ozempic  Xultophy and Saxenda have driven the company s sales in the year so far 
Label expansion of Victoza continues to boost performance  Ozempic  the company s once weekly GLP 1  continues to gain market share  The FDA recently approved semaglutide in tablet form under the brand name  Rybelsus  The company continues to evaluate the candidate for multiple indications  Shares of the company have outperformed the industry year to date 
However  lower realized prices in the United States  loss of exclusivity for products in hormone replacement therapy and intensifying competition within the diabetes and biopharmaceuticals markets will adversely impact sales  going ahead

13108,234623,CBRE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Michelin  CBRE And Pilgrim   s Pride,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  June 11  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Michelin   OTC MGDDY    CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE   and Pilgrim s Pride   NASDAQ PPC   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Rate Pressure Everywhere  Global Week AheadThere is life beyond Presidential tweeting On Monday  before U S  markets opened  Mexico s peso rebounded to 19 16 pesos USD from a low around 19 7 after the country reached a deal with the U S  to curb migration  avoiding tariffs on Mexican imports set to start this week Over the last year  a Mexican Peso toggling around 19 0 pesos to the U S  dollar is what traders show during periods of lower political uncertainty  Trading at a cheaper 20 0 pesos  and beyond  is the high uncertainty mark Still  the U S  China trade war is definitely bending macro data  This was shown everywhere I looked On Monday  data released by China s Customs Bureau showed exports of Chinese goods rose by  1 1  in dollar terms during the month  compared to the same period a year ago           That was significantly ahead of the  3 8  decline predicted by economists polled by Reuters  and the  2 7  slide witnessed in May           Export volumes of China s rare earths  which have recently become a focal point in the trade war  fell by more than  15  month on month to 3 640 tons Meanwhile  imports of goods into China fell by  8 5   or the most since July 2016           Analysts had predicted just a  3 8  fall           The two sets of figures taken together helped push China s overall monthly trade surplus to its highest level in the year so far Next are Reuters  five World Market Themes on June 10th  These data releases and political issues are most likely to influence both traders and investors in the Global Week Ahead I have them in order of importance to equities  Notably  I lead with the role of central banks  Policy rate cut pressure has never been higher  And it is notably higher everywhere  1  Political Pressure Heaps Onto Central Banks  Everywhere From the United States to India  central banks have come under heavy political pressure President Trump has frequently lambasted policy decisions of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell  while Turkey s Tayyip Erdogan calls regularly for lower borrowing costs  Public rows have broken out in India over the central bank s independence Now the South African Reserve Bank is feeling the heat  Some members of the governing African National Congress party are pushing for its mandate to widen beyond its current remit of inflation targeting to promote jobs and economic growth That is another worry for foreign investors on top of the past week s shock GDP reading  showing a deeper than expected contraction in the first three months of 2019 Many see the risk of painful parallels with Turkey  where the central bank  stymied by political interference  has resorted to unconventional policy tools to fight stubbornly high inflation  Unimpressed  many overseas investors have responded by pulling out That should serve as a reminder to South Africa s government  Tinkering with central banks in emerging markets rarely ends well  2  From the USA  May Producer and Consumer Price Inflation HitsThe Fed s latest catchphrase    average inflation targeting    will get some play when the U S  Labor Department releases May producer and consumer price indexes On Tuesday s PPI  a measure of pipeline inflation heavily influenced by raw material costs  is seen rising  2 0  year on year  The core measure  which strips out food and energy prices  is forecast at  2 3  But the Fed and investors will pay more attention to Wednesday s CPI print  measuring the pocketbook impact  Headline and core are seen rising  1 9  and  2 1  respectively The concern is that CPI will mirror the Fed s favorite inflation measure  the core Personal Consumption Expenditures  PCE  index  That rose 1 6  in the year to April and has consistently run below the official 2  target So  frustrated policymakers are floating once unspeakable notions  If they try to get inflation to average 2  over time  instead of ranging symmetrically on either side of it  interest rates could be cut sooner rather than later A little extra inflation while the economy is strong looks better than deflation   a consumption stifling alternative that would limit policy options if the economy turns south  That s a full agenda for the June FOMC meeting the following week  3  Oil Prices Have Fallen SwiftlyOil prices  hyper sensitive to any signs of weakness in the global economy  have finally started reacting to the trade war news flow and the ominous signals bond markets are sending on the possibility of recession Until end May  oil prices were holding above  70 a barrel  But recent dismal PMI readings may have tipped the balance  pushing Brent crude futures 12  lower in just three days With pricing sliding suddenly to five month lows  analysts have been left wondering if demand for the black gold is weaker than earlier thought  Such heavy selling is pretty rare  particularly outside recessions A global recession this year is unlikely  But with trade waning   2019 could turn out to be the worst year for global commerce flows in a decade   there are no compelling signs of economic improvement either Oil demand slows by several hundred thousand barrels per day during recessions  according to Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   which cut its Brent forecast for the second half of this year to  65 70 per barrel from  75 80 Meanwhile  OPEC   the group which controls most of the world s oil output   is starkly divided  The members  latest spat is over the date of their next meeting  Iran has set the scene for a tough OPEC meeting  as it opposes a date change  4  Already Looking Past China s Export  Investment and Lending DataThere s plenty of life left in the Chinese dragon  but after roaring for three decades it s certainly lost some of its puff Markets are primed for exports from the world s second largest economy to show weakness and for investment and lending data to show Beijing s stimulus efforts in the face of a trade war with Washington are bearing some fruit Indeed  investors are looking past these figures for May  PBOC boss Yi Gang has already signaled his readiness for more stimulus and focus is firmly on whether Presidents Xi and Trump can negotiate some kind of detente when they meet at the end June G20 summit The conflict has in fact moved on from mere trade  Blacklists on companies  rare earths supply threats and China advising citizens to avoid U S  travel  Washington s criticism of Chinese human rights practices   little seems off limits The International Monetary Fund  IMF  already expects Chinese growth to slow to 6 2  this year and to 6  in 2020  That would be the weakest since 1990  but analysts believe real growth has already dipped below those levels  Weak data in coming days would merely confirm the grim outlook for the world economy  5  Turkey s Monetary Policy Gets SetTurkey s central bank will publish its interest rate decision on Wednesday A few months ago  this meeting was meant to be the one at which policymakers were definitely going to start cutting rates  having successfully sailed through the rough waters of market turmoil sparked by political tensions Fast forward  and few of these issues have been put to bed  An election re run in the country s biggest city  Istanbul  is scheduled for June 23  The rocky U S  Turkey relationship has soured again over defense issues and trade tensions and economic woes are clouding the global backdrop But Turkey s economy is undergoing a sharp adjustment following the lira s 30  tumble in 2018 and near 10  drop so far this year  Inflation  now at nearly 19   has eased quicker than expected  No doubt the 24  interest benchmark rate will have to come down  But moving too early is seen by many as another policy mistake that Turkey s battered currency can ill afford Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks  1  Michelin  Yes  This is the

13112,234627,CBRE,Bet On These 4 Industrial REITs Despite No Rate Cut By Fed,opinion,As anticipated  this time the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at the end of its two day policy meeting in the 1 5 1 75  target range  Further  the  dot plot  of individual member s projection for the future suggests lesser chances of any rate hike or cut in 2020 The move comes after the benchmark rate was slashed thrice this year  in a bid to shield the economy amid global economic slowdown  recession fears and the long standing U S  Sino trade war Obviously  the Fed s neutral stance does not provide enough impetus to the rate sensitive REIT sector  as compared with a rate cut  This is because of REITs  historical dependence on debt for their business as well as for often being treated as bond substitutes for their high dividend paying nature However  instead of fretting over the central bank s neutral stance  we ought to shift attention to the slew of favorable economic data ruling the headlines  of late  This includes the latest numbers from the Labor Department  indicating a robust job market with increase in non farm payrolls and fall in unemployment rate in November  Moreover  consumer sentiment remains high and spending continues to be resilient  The economy  currently in its record 11th year of expansion  is still reporting growth  though at a sluggish pace  and consumers are anticipated to keep the momentum going For REITs  this can be far more rewarding because its business usually buoys up on a stepped up economy and job scenario  And with individual market dynamics playing a critical role in determining REITs  performance  favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth This draws our attention to the industrial real estate category that has  more than 48  so far in the year and posted continued strong increases in funds from operations  FFO  even in the third quarter  The asset category is further poised to excel in 2020  backed by robust fundamentals Fundamentals to Remain StrongIn fact  in a rising e commerce market  the industrial real estate asset category continues to play a pivotal role  transforming the way how consumers shop and receive their goods  Services like same day delivery are gaining traction and last mile properties in high income urban areas are witnessing solid pricing  occupancy and growth in rentals  Furthermore  demand for distribution space has been rising  as e commerce continues to expand to sectors like grocery and furniture Also  apart from e retail  companies are making immense efforts to improve their supply chain efficiencies  propelling demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks  in turn  enabling industrial landlords to enjoy a favorable market environment Per a  from CBRE group   NYSE CBRE    rent growth is projected at 5  in 2020  and will be driven by newer product and infill industrial space in supply constrained markets  There is likely to be acceleration in demand for light industrial warehouses of less than 120 000 square feet  with e commerce companies competing on the same day delivery service to customers  And with space being much limited in the smaller size section  growth in rent is projected to continue in the next year There is also an uptick in renewal rates and this trend is expected to continue in markets with low vacancy rates  If trade conflicts have made you skeptical  then it s apt to think again  Because lingering trade concerns will likely result in more focus on outsourcing and this  in turn  will result in growth in the third party logistics  3PL  sector and drive its leasing activity Stock PicksGiven the factors discussed above  we believe it is an appropriate time to invest in some fundamentally strong industrial REIT stocks  We have handpicked four stocks using our  and aside from having solid fundamentals  these better ranked REITs have high chances of market outperformance over the next 1 3 months  These stocks are witnessing positive estimate revisions too  reflecting analysts  upbeat view Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD   sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

13113,234628,CBRE,Market Drops As China Retaliates,opinion,"The major indices lost more on Monday than they did all of last week  as it was China s turn to raise tariffs after last Friday s trade deadline came and went with no agreement 
	It was the kind of session that many had expected on Friday when the U S  raised tariffs to 25  on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods  However  the market took that news in stride with indices actually enjoying their best day of the week 
	But China s decision to retaliate by raising tariffs on  60 billion worth of U S  goods snapped the market out of its good mood  Instead  the indices saw a late 2018 style selloff 
	The NASDAQ took the brunt of today s plunge as the semiconductors do a lot of business in China  which means this space could be on the frontlines of the trade conflict  The index had its worst day of the year by plunging 3 41   or nearly 270 points  to 7647 02 
	The S P slipped 2 41  to 2811 87 while the Dow dropped 2 38   or about 617 points  to 25 324 99  And we didn t get much of a late day rebound as we saw during most of last week s selloffs 
	Apple was a big drag on all the indices with the iPhone maker dipping 5 8  
	As of right now  there are no more talks scheduled between the two countries until President Trump and China President Xi Jinping meet at the G 20  in late June 
	However  it wouldn t be much of a surprise if more talks are scheduled in the interim 
	Want some good news  The President hasn t decided yet if he s going to place new tariffs on  325 billion worth of additional Chinese goods  Also  China s retaliatory tariffs won t take effect until June 1 
	It looks like we ll be back to watching the headlines for the time being  We can expect to hear good things from participants on both sides  but especially from the President and his staff  The big question is  Will the market still be listening  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Insider Trader  The market  threw the baby out with the bath water  on Monday as the re ignited trade conflict with China sparked a sharp selloff and increased uncertainty for investors  There s no telling how long this volatility will last  so Tracey decided to take some profits while she could  The editor sold half of Discover Financial  DFS  and half of Cadence Bancorp  CADE  for gains of 12 1  and 9   respectively 
	But Tracey didn t let this sharply negative market keep her from buying a new name  Earlier this month  health insurance giant UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  saw its CEO and a director pick up shares of their own company  Shares are down approximately 10  over the past three months in large part because of the Medicare for all proposal  but the editor thinks that selloff was overdone  She believes that UNH will provide some safety compared to other names with direct China exposure  The stock was added on Monday with a 10  allocation  Read the full write up for more  Large Cap Trader  The latest round of tariffs in this trade conflict has convinced John to dump his high beta growth tech stocks  which have lots of exposure to China  Fortunately  the portfolio s really going to the bank with three double digit winners  These solid returns include  CDW Corp   CDW   19 3    Micron  NASDAQ MU   16 8    Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   15 6   and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   5 6   Black Box Trader  The portfolio replaced six names in this week s adjustment  The positions sold today were

13114,234629,CBRE,Is CBRE  CBRE  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this provider of real estate investment management services a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for CBRE is 17 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 10 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 5 9  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for CBRE is 20 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 14 6  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for CBRE have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made CBRE a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

13117,234632,CBRE,CBRE  CBRE  Upgraded To Strong Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for CBRE is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For CBRE  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for CBRE
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this provider of real estate investment management services is expected to earn  3 61 per share  which is a change of 10 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for CBRE  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4 6  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Bet on These 4 Industrial REITs Despite No Rate Cut by the FedAs anticipated  this time the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at the end of its two day policy meeting in the 1 5 1 75  target range  Further  the  dot plot  of individual member s projection for the future suggests lesser chances of any rate hike or cut in 2020 The move comes after the benchmark rate was slashed thrice this year  in a bid to shield the economy amid global economic slowdown  recession fears and the long standing U S  Sino trade war Obviously  the Fed s neutral stance does not provide enough impetus to the rate sensitive REIT sector  as compared with a rate cut  This is because of REITs  historical dependence on debt for their business as well as for often being treated as bond substitutes for their high dividend paying nature However  instead of fretting over the central bank s neutral stance  we ought to shift attention to the slew of favorable economic data ruling the headlines  of late  This includes the latest numbers from the Labor Department  indicating a robust job market with increase in non farm payrolls and fall in unemployment rate in November  Moreover  consumer sentiment remains high and spending continues to be resilient  The economy  currently in its record 11th year of expansion  is still reporting growth  though at a sluggish pace  and consumers are anticipated to keep the momentum going For REITs  this can be far more rewarding because its business usually buoys up on a stepped up economy and job scenario  And with individual market dynamics playing a critical role in determining REITs  performance  favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth This draws our attention to the industrial real estate category that has  more than 48  so far in the year and posted continued strong increases in funds from operations  FFO  even in the third quarter  The asset category is further poised to excel in 2020  backed by robust fundamentals Fundamentals to Remain StrongIn fact  in a rising e commerce market  the industrial real estate asset category continues to play a pivotal role  transforming the way how consumers shop and receive their goods  Services like same day delivery are gaining traction and last mile properties in high income urban areas are witnessing solid pricing  occupancy and growth in rentals  Furthermore  demand for distribution space has been rising  as e commerce continues to expand to sectors like grocery and furniture Also  apart from e retail  companies are making immense efforts to improve their supply chain efficiencies  propelling demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks  in turn  enabling industrial landlords to enjoy a favorable market environment Per a  from CBRE group  rent growth is projected at 5  in 2020  and will be driven by newer product and infill industrial space in supply constrained markets  There is likely to be acceleration in demand for light industrial warehouses of less than 120 000 square feet  with e commerce companies competing on the same day delivery service to customers  And with space being much limited in the smaller size section  growth in rent is projected to continue in the next year There is also an uptick in renewal rates and this trend is expected to continue in markets with low vacancy rates  If trade conflicts have made you skeptical  then it s apt to think again  Because lingering trade concerns will likely result in more focus on outsourcing and this  in turn  will result in growth in the third party logistics  3PL  sector and drive its leasing activity Stock PicksGiven the factors discussed above  we believe it is an

13128,234643,CBRE,5 ROE Picks As Markets Show Resiliency Against Coronavirus,opinion,Retracting from record highs witnessed during the first half of the month  the U S  equity markets saw a sudden downturn as fears of a potential pandemic triggered by the outbreak of a newly identified coronavirus originating from Wuhan  China  took center stage  With the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting the first case of the contagious disease in the country  the markets remained apprehensive about possible repercussions  However  positive housing data  largely driven by low interest rates  a healthy job market and solid consumer spending helped investors shrug off the worries with markets reverting back to normalcy    As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they can benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns  However  singling out cash rich stocks alone do not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios  like return on equity  ROE    A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength    Zacks Rank less than or equal to

13136,234651,CBRE,PennyMac Mortgage  PMT  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust  PMT   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  21 91 in the previous session  PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust has gained 17 2  since the start of the year compared to the 14 4  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 22 1  return for the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 2  2019  PennyMac Mortgage reported EPS of  0 68 versus consensus estimate of  0 42 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 19 66  
For the current fiscal year  PennyMac Mortgage is expected to post earnings of  1 8 per share on  380 37 million in revenues  This represents a  9 55  change in EPS on an 8 35  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 97 per share on  406 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 31  and 6 74   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
PennyMac Mortgage may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
PennyMac Mortgage has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9 3X versus its peer group s average of 11 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 42  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  PennyMac Mortgage currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if PennyMac Mortgage meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though PennyMac Mortgage shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does PennyMac Mortgage Stack Up to the Competition

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 33 90   A quarter ago  it was expected that this provider of real estate investment management services would post earnings of  1 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 21  delivering a surprise of 7 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
CBRE  which belongs to the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry  posted revenues of  5 14 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 61   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 67 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CBRE shares have added about 24 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 1  
What s Next for CBRE 
While CBRE has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CBRE was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 80 on  5 54 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 58 on  23 09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

13152,234667,CBRE,Can CBRE  CBRE  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   which belongs to the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this provider of real estate investment management services has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 6 21   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  CBRE came out with earnings of  1 21 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 per share  representing a surprise of 7 08   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 75 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 79 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

For CBRE  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CBRE currently has an Earnings ESP of  7 69   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 8  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss

13158,234673,CBRE,These 5 Stocks Boast Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real time stock screen  A critical analysis of a company s financial background is essential for a better investment decision Often investors evaluate a company s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings  which sometimes do not reveal the real picture  To be more precise  they do not tell whether a company s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations  Here  the role of coverage ratios comes into play   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company  And the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  One should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1

13159,234674,CBRE,Alexandria  ARE  To Post Q1 Earnings  Is A Beat In Store  ,opinion,Alexandria Real Estate Equities   NYSE ARE   is scheduled to report first quarter results on Apr 30  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in its funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues In the last reported quarter  this Pasadena  CA based urban office real estate investment trust  REIT   which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses  had posted first quarter 2018 adjusted FFO of  1 68 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker  Nonetheless  decent internal and external growth during the quarter enabled it to witnessed rental rate growth of 17 4  Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion  missed in another two and met in the other  It delivered average positive surprise of 0 18  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history Alexandria Real Estate Equities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderRobust fundamentals of the life science and technology markets encouraged Alexandria to expand its footprint in top tier cluster locations  Accordingly  in February  the company announced plans to expand its life science cluster in Seattle  with a development project at 188 East Blaine Street and pre construction measures for 1165 Eastlake Avenue East in Seattle In the same month  the company unveiled Alexandria GradLabs at its Campus Pointe complex in San Diego  In fact  growth of the life science industry in San Diego is fueling demand for cluster campuses in the region  Hence  this new proprietary offering is a strategic fit for the company  Additionally  owing to its prime location and easy commuting options  Campus Pointe is expected to have witnessed healthy leasing activity and occupancy in the quarter under review Going by a CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE     the Boston Cambridge region is emerging as a leading life science cluster  as indicated by solid growth in rents and significant new lab space under construction  Further  the market is attracting large amount of funding Hence  Alexandria s acquisition of 10 Necco St  parking garage for  81 1 million with National Development in March is a strategic fit Additionally  the company announced another plan to grow Alexandria LaunchLabs  its premier life science startup platform  and the Alexandria Seed Capital Platform  a funding model for seed stage investments  in Alexandria s Seattle cluster market for supporting continuing  transformative growth Hence  we anticipate the company to have witnessed solid demand from life science and tech tenants during the first quarter  on the back of these efforts  Moreover  we expect the company to have witnessed healthy rent escalations and leasing activity at positive rent spreads  given the strategic location of its clusters  This will likely have boosted Alexandria s first quarter revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  348 million and reflects a year over year jump of 8 7  Lastly  prior to the first quarter earnings release  the company has been witnessing upward estimate revisions  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter has been revised marginally upward to  1 68 over the past month  reflecting analysts  bullish sentiments  Also  it represents year over year growth of 3 7  Earnings WhispersHere is what our

13161,234676,CBRE,Duke Realty  DRE  Gears Up For Q1 Earnings  What To Expect ,opinion,Duke Realty Corp    NYSE DRE   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 24  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in its funds from operations  FFO  per share  while revenues are expected to decline In the last reported quarter  this industrial real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered an in line performance with respect to FFO per share  Results mirrored overall year over year improvement in operations as well as increased investments in new industrial properties However  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the trailing four quarters and met estimates in the other two  the average beat being 1 57   The graph below depicts this surprise history Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market has been gathering steam on the back of solid consumer spending and high consumer confidence  strengthening e commerce market and a healthy manufacturing environment  Demand for warehouses  distribution centers and other industrial property remains strong amid paradigm shift of consumers opting for online shopping  Services like same day delivery are gaining traction  and last mile properties in high income urban areas are witnessing solid pricing  occupancy and growth in rentals Going by a  issued by commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE    availability fell for 35 straight quarters to 7  for the U S  industrial market in the first quarter  denoting the lowest point since 2000  Net asking rents increased 2 2  in the quarter to  7 51 per square feet   marking the highest level since 1989  per a CBRE  As for Duke Realty  its solid capacity to bank on this favorable trend will likely have helped the company witness high occupancy  active leasing and healthy rent levels across a number of properties during the Jan Mar period During the quarter under review  the company executed a number of leases  These included signing of two new leases in its Greenfield North 1001 building at 1001 North Greenfield Parkway in Garner  NC  The company also announced that it is developing a 194 120 square foot  build to suit  rail accessible warehouse for Schilli Distribution Services in Savannah Furthermore  Duke Realty announced signing a lease for Grand Lakes 4053 in Grand Prairie  Particularly  at this 189 200 square foot warehouse  the company inked a lease deal with the designer  manufacturer and the distributor of sustainable office furniture   Cherryman Industries However  the company has been disposing non strategic assets in a bid to focus on industrial properties  While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term  these might weigh on its top line growth in the first quarter  In fact  for 2019  the company anticipates dispositions of non strategic properties of  350  550 million Further  recovery in the industrial market has continued for long  and a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the near term  This will lead to higher supply  and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth  Intensifying trade tensions remain another concern Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s revenues is currently pinned at  205 9 million  indicating a 12 2  drop from the prior year quarter reported tally Additionally  Duke Realty s activities during the Mar end quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter 2019 FFO per share remained unchanged at 32 cents  over the last 30 days  However  the figure indicates projected year over year growth of 3 2  Here is what our quantitative model predicts Duke Realty has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold

13177,234692,CBRE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  CB Richard  Fortescue And WPP,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  April 2  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  CB Richard Ellis   NYSE CBRE    Fortescue Metals   OTC FSUGY   and WPP   NYSE WPP   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Will U S  Jobs Bounce Back This Spring In the Global Week Ahead  Friday s nonfarm payroll update for March is the big moment Spring is here  The U S  jobs market can bounce back with it Consensus has  145K for Federal payrolls for Friday s print ADP s nonfarm payroll data   160K  comes out ahead  on Wednesday A weak February labor market saw  20K U S  jobs created In short  the U S  could witness a burst of pent up hiring activity in March  after a Federal government shutdown and adverse winter weather depressed broad labor market sentiment However  one can t ignore negative signals sent by consumer surveys  The latest Conference Board consumer confidence reading for March reported a sharp deterioration in the measure of jobs availability being reported by consumers Wage growth  currently at  3 4  y y  is another key indicator out with nonfarm payroll data Next are five big Reuters world market themes These likely dominate thinking of both investors and traders in the Global Week Ahead  1  Yield Curve InversionWhich is it   growth or gloom  With 10 year U S  bond yields below 3 month T bill rates for the first time in more than a decade  recession fears are swirling  After all  an inverted yield curve  when longer dated yields drop below shorter maturities  has proved to be fairly reliable predictors of U S  recessions in the past  As a result some investors are busy putting cash behind bets the Fed is gearing up for rate cuts But there are many who scoff  they point to a world economy chugging along at a decent clip  dovish central banks and company earnings that are still growing  albeit more slowly  So while Treasury yields are down 30 basis points this quarter  world stocks are up more than 10 percent  Recession skeptics may also note that U S  equities are not far off record highs and credit spreads have retraced most of their December losses Also  while past recession discussions have focused on inversions of the 2 year 10 year U S  curve  that hasn t reacted so far  Fed policymakers too  such as voting member John Williams  NYSE WMB   say they are not worried about a recession this year or the next  Others  such as James Bullard  seem to be endorsing the  this time is different  argument  hinting that the curve s predictive power has weakened But policymakers around the world have already taken heed  The ECB has hinted at further rate cut delays and at tiering interest rates to help banks  other central banks  from New Zealand to Canada  are hinting at rate cuts ahead  2  Brexit s End of the RoadNo  No  No  No  Parliament s cold response to Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit deal so far means the manner of Britain s exit from the European Union   originally scheduled for March 29   is unknown Brussels has let Britain delay its departure while May battled to find a way forward but there is little enthusiasm in parliament or the population even for the stripped down version of May s twice defeated deal  But lawmakers have also given the thumbs down to a series of other amendments  including revoking Brexit  delaying it further or holding another referendum Dismayed investors have been avoiding the pound but the resulting shortage in trading volumes just exacerbates price swings  The question now is whether the most hardline Conservative euro skeptics and Northern Ireland s DUP  the party propping up May s government  can ever be convinced to back an exit deal before the new April 12 deadline If the withdrawal agreement does somehow scrape through  sterling would likely surge above  1 35  For the time being though  the bleak  if unlikely  alternative scenario   a chaotic no deal departure   persists Options markets aren t optimistic  The price investors are willing to pay for one month sterling protection   insurance against sterling falls   is at the highest since the 2016 referendum vote  3  The ISM Manufacturing IndexU S  factory job growth was its weakest in February since the summer of 2017 but still managed to extend the streak of monthly gains to 19  the longest in nearly a quarter century  If  as expected  Friday s March payrolls report makes it 20 in a row   economists polled by Reuters predict a 10 000 increase   it would mark the longest uninterrupted run of manufacturing employment expansion in a generation  matching the run from January 1983 through August 1984 But while comparable in length  the current manufacturing renaissance pales in terms of total

to agree on a trade deal  The first face to face meetings between the two sides since that deadline were apparently  constructive  and  productive   Now Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is to travel to Washington for further talks In the meantime  though  tariffs on Chinese goods worth  250 billion are in play and that is hurting China  as well as its Asian neighbors who are linked to it  through complex supply chains  March Purchasing Managers Indexes are expected to show a further deterioration in sentiment across the region  and another source of pressure is the worry of a recession in the

last year s currency meltdown Polls suggest Erdogan could lose Ankara  the city from which he has ruled Turkey with an increasingly iron grip since 2003  His AK Party could face a tough race in Istanbul  where Erdogan was once mayor  But policymakers  efforts shore up the currency before the election has run into trouble and moves to curb offshore lira supply has pushed investors into selling Turkish stocks and bonds The question now is how quickly policymakers will normalize their approach to markets  And even if they do  will pressure on the lira ease up and can they win back the

13178,234693,CBRE,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For CBRE  CBRE ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   which belongs to the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry 
This provider of real estate investment management services has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 6 21  
For the last reported quarter  CBRE came out with earnings of  1 21 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 per share  representing a surprise of 7 08   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 75 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 79 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for CBRE  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CBRE currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 68   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-cbre-cbre-200403181,200403181
13181,234696,CBRE,5 ROE Stocks To Buy On Solid Jobs Data   Trade Deal Odds,opinion,The U S  economy received a shot in the arm with the recent jobs data revealing better than expected job additions in March  With unemployment hovering near a five decade low  the report quelled fears of a recession and lent support to muted Fed interest hikes in 2019  Furthermore  as bilateral trade talks between the United States and China inched closer to a landmark deal  the equity markets appeared well poised to continue the uptrend As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios  like return on equity  ROE    A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5

13200,234715,CBRE,CBRE  CBRE  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 0 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  51 46 in the previous session  CBRE Group has gained 26 3  since the start of the year compared to the 11 6  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 21 5  return for the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 13  2019  CBRE reported EPS of  1 21 versus consensus estimate of  1 13 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5 9  
For the current fiscal year  CBRE is expected to post earnings of  3 57 per share on  22 96 billion in revenues  This represents an 8 84  change in EPS on a 7 58  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 82 per share on  24 47 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 14  and 6 6   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
CBRE may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
CBRE has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 10 7X versus its peer group s average of 12 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 29  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  CBRE currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if CBRE fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though CBRE shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2019-03-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cbre-cbre-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200399394,200399394

meetings  geopolitical developments and robust economic data  With the Fed widely expected to hit a likely pause button to interest rate hikes in 2019 as bilateral trade talks between the United States and China entered a decisive phase and inched closer to a landmark deal  the stock market euphoria is likely to continue in the near future As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from the  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios  like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms

with attractive risk adjusted returns Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength    Zacks Rank less

13202,234717,CBRE,5 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio To Invest In,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial

13204,234719,CBRE,5 Value Picks To Counter Yield Inversion Of Government Bonds,opinion,On Mar 22  the U S  stock market retreated owing to a yield curve inversion between the 3 month US Treasury Note and 10 year US Treasury Note  The Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite plunged 1 8   1 9  and 2 5   respectively  on the day  The yield inversion was mainly caused by the Fed s extra dovish monetary stance  which triggered investors  concerns about a global economic slowdown However  according to Fed  the fundamentals of the U S  economy remain strong  Meanwhile  the global economy will get a boost if the trade tussle between the United States and China is settled  Thus  the recent stock market meltdown could be a good buying opportunity  At this stage  it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as to make some gains from the upside potential Inverted Yield Curve Does Not Hint at Immediate RecessionOn Mar 22  yield on 3 month US Treasury Note surged ahead of 2 year  5 year ad 10 year US Treasury Notes  Yield curve inversion generally implies market s diminishing expectations about future economic growth  Specifically  inversion between the 3 month and 10 year bond yields is recognized by several financial experts as a clear indication of an imminent recession  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note fell below the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill for the first time since 2007 However  an inverted yield curve does not indicate immediate recession  It may happen after a year or two or even later  A survey by research firm Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  shows that historically  U S  stocks rose 15  on average in the 18 months following yield inversions  The study also revealed that it took nearly 24 months for the stock market to enter recession after yield curve inversion Despite the yield inversion between 3 month and 10 year US Treasury Notes  the yield curve between 2 year Treasury Note and 10 year Treasury Note is still upward sloping  Several financial experts consider this yield curve as a more powerful indicator of an impending recession Positive Development on Trade Front  Second  the 11 month long trade dispute between the United States and China is headed toward a possible settlement  If this happens  a major concern for the global economy will be eliminated  On Mar 20  Trump mentioned that negotiations with China for a trade deal  is coming along nicely    This week  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Beijing for another round of discussions with Chinese authorities  The International Monetary Fund has identified ongoing the tariff tussle between the countries as the primary factor behind a perceived

13205,234720,CBRE,3 Reasons Why CBRE  CBRE  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this provider of real estate investment management services is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for CBRE is 16 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 8 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 5  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for CBRE is 20 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 17 1  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 11 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for CBRE  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
CBRE has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

Picks to Counter Yield Curve InversionOn Mar 22  the U S  stock market retreated owing to a yield curve inversion between the 3 month US Treasury Note and 10 year US Treasury Note  The Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite plunged 1 8   1 9  and 2 5   respectively  on the day  The yield inversion was mainly caused by the Fed s extra dovish monetary stance  which triggered investors  concerns about a global economic slowdown However  according to Fed  the fundamentals of the U S  economy remain strong  Meanwhile  the global economy will get a boost if the trade tussle between the United States and China is settled  Thus  the recent stock market meltdown could be a good buying opportunity  At this stage  it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as to make some gains from the upside potential Inverted Yield Curve Does Not Hint at Immediate RecessionOn Mar 22  yield on 3 month US Treasury Note surged ahead of 2 year  5 year ad 10 year US Treasury Notes  Yield curve inversion generally implies market s diminishing expectations about future economic growth  Specifically  inversion between the 3 month and 10 year bond yields is recognized by several financial experts as a clear indication of an imminent recession  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note fell below the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill for the first time since 2007 However  an inverted yield curve does not indicate immediate recession  It may happen after a year or two or even later  A survey by research firm Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  shows that historically  U S  stocks rose 15  on average in the 18 months following yield inversions  The study also revealed that it took nearly 24 months for the stock market to enter recession after yield curve inversion Despite the yield inversion between 3 month and 10 year US Treasury Notes  the yield curve between 2 year Treasury Note and 10 year Treasury Note is still upward sloping  Several financial experts consider this yield curve as a more powerful indicator of an impending recession Positive Development on Trade Front  Second  the 11 month long trade dispute between the United States and China is headed toward a possible settlement  If this happens  a major concern for the global economy will be eliminated  On Mar 20  Trump mentioned that negotiations with China for a trade deal  is coming along nicely    This week  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Beijing for another round of discussions with Chinese authorities  The International Monetary Fund has identified ongoing the tariff tussle between the countries as the primary factor behind a perceived global economic slowdown in 2019 Our Top PicksAt

13220,234735,CBRE,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook CBRE  CBRE ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this provider of real estate investment management services a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for CBRE is 16 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 6 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for CBRE is 20 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 18 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14 5  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 12 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for CBRE have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
CBRE has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

	The NASDAQ recovered nearly all of last week s pullback that ended its impressive 10 week winning streak  The index jumped 2 02   or nearly 150 points  today to 7558 06  The S P took a big step towards regaining 2800 with a rise of 1 47  to 2783 30 
	These indices got a huge assist from tech  especially the nearly 3 5  advance in Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  after it was upgraded by Bank of America  NYSE BAC   The FAANGs were out in force today with other noteworthy advances from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN    3 07    Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL    2 93    Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX    2 65   and Facebook  NASDAQ FB    1 46   
	The Dow s advance was limited by Boeing  NYSE BA   which slid more than 5  after the second crash in less than six months for its 737 Max 8 jet model  Nevertheless  the index still had a positive  streak breaking performance with a gain of 0 79   or 200 points  to 25 650 88 
	Not only was this the first green in days for the market  but the major indices closed near their highs 
	Another positive for the session was retail sales  which climbed 0 2  in January and beat expectations  This reading will make investors feel somewhat better after the extremely sharp decline in December  which should be noted was revised even lower to 1 6  from 1 2   We re all concerned about slowing growth these days  but this report suggests that the December result could have been a one off given the sharp correction and government shutdown 
	Let s see if there s some follow through the rest of this week  No date has been set yet for the face to face meeting between President Trump and China President Xi  so we probably won t get any trade breakthroughs in the coming days  But some good headlines  or  at least  lack of bad ones  wouldn t hurt  We ll also be watching out for any other economic reports from here in the U S  or abroad  Today s Portfolio Highlights Blockchain Innovators  The portfolio added a couple big names on Monday  Facebook  FB  and Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL   The social media giant has been aggressively hiring engineers with blockchain experience  while the airline is using blockchain to track their cargo shipments  These are two of three additions that Dave has planned for this week  Read the full write up for more Healthcare Innovators  The two new buys for this week are DexCom  DXCM  and Veeva Systems  VEEV   which are both Zacks Rank  2s  Buys  coming off of solid quarterly reports  DXCM s continuous glucose monitor  CGM  is designed to track glucose levels throughout the day  rather than making diabetes sufferers prick their fingers several times a day  VEEV provides cloud based software solutions to the life sciences industry  which satisfies Kevin s desire for a SaaS innovator that s focused on that space  The full write up has a lot more on these new additions  including a  deep dive  on DXCM Technology Innovators  After cashing in a couple gains last week  the portfolio has some spots to fill  Therefore  Brian Bolan added Perficient  PRFT   a leading digital transformation consulting firm  The company is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   which saw its earnings estimates rise after beating expectations in its most recent quarter  In fact  PRFT has a solid earnings history and is part of a space  Computer   Services  in the top 11  of the Zacks Industry Rank  Read the complete commentary for a lot more on this new addition  Black Box Trader  More than half of the portfolio was changed in this week s adjustment  The six names that were sold included

13225,234740,CBRE,Here s Why CBRE Group  CBRE  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  CBRE Group currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CBRE that show why this provider of real estate investment management services shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CBRE  shares are up 0 85  over the past week while the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 15  compares favorably with the industry s 0 69  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of CBRE Group have risen 28 16   and are up 6 08  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 6 11  and 1 87   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CBRE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CBRE is currently averaging 1 913 073 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CBRE 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CBRE s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 38 to  3 57 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CBRE is a  1  Strong Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep CBRE Group on your short list ",2019-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-cbre-group-cbre-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200396929,200396929

13241,234756,CBRE,Real Estate Operations Stocks  Near Term Outlook Looks Upbeat,opinion,"The Zacks  industry comprises companies that provide leasing  property management  investment management  valuation  development services  facilities management  project management  transaction and consulting services  among others  However  real estate investment trusts or REITs are excluded from this group This industry had been making a steady run  post the financial crisis  as commercial real estate markets enjoyed increased demand  rising absorptions  high occupancy and escalating rents  This was backed by a recovering economy  job market gains  low cost credit availability  as well as rising institutional capital inflows toward commercial real estate  Particularly  the slow but steady pace of economic growth and low interest rates provided a decent impetus  aiding the industry to excel Let us now look at the major themes in the industry Healthy economy  capital availability and technology investments  Although economic growth will likely moderate to some extent this year  the level is expected to remain healthy and continue backing the industry  In fact  easy availability of capital and comparatively lower levels of interest rates  high consumer confidence  low unemployment level  high consumption levels and business investment are expected to keep the momentum upbeat 
Moreover  the constituent companies in this industry are focusing on investments in strategic acquisitions  human capital and technology which provide significant competitive edge  aid in market share expansion  and help differentiate from peers Outsourcing of real estate needs  Occupiers of real estate  such as corporations  public sector entities  health care providers and others  are increasingly opting for outsourcing of real estate needs  and depending on the expertise of third party real estate specialists for execution and efficiency improvement  This is opening up scope for constituents of the real estate operations industry and the large players are banking on this trend  with both existing as well as new client wins Maturing cycle  trade tensions and political uncertainty  The industry seems to be entering the later stages of its growth cycle  Further  trade tensions  political uncertainty and volatile equity markets are likely to negatively impact business sentiment  As such  after recording decent growth for years  investment volumes are anticipated to be softer given the cautious approach of the investors  In addition  any rise in interest rates might affect capital market activities  moving ahead Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Real Estate Operations industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  55  which places it at the top 22  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry s Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks Real Estate Operations industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector  but lagged the Zacks S P 500 composite in a year s time The industry has edged down 0 1  during this period compared to the S P 500 s uptick of 1 7   During the same time frame  the broader Finance sector has declined 6 7  One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to EPS ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Real Estate Operations stocks  we see that the industry is currently trading at 19 04X compared to the S P 500 s forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  of 16 87X  The industry is also trading above the Finance sector s forward 12 month P E of 13 74X  This is shown in the chart below Forward 12 Month Price To Earnings RatioOver the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 28 26X  as low as 14 29X  with a median of 19 42X Bottom LineIn a nutshell  domestic economy is gathering steam  and consumer and business confidence are building up as well  Furthermore  occupancy levels remain healthy  and consumer spending continues to be robust amid tax cuts and a tighter labor market  which is pushing up wages  Also  despite rate hikes  interest rate levels are still low and there is decent availability of capital in the market  Further  amid rising trend of outsourcing of real estate needs by companies  the real estate operations industry is having solid scope for growth Here we present three stocks from the industry with a favorable Zacks Rank that investors may consider adding to their portfolios Jones Lang LaSalle Inc   JLL   Popularly known as JLL  Jones Lang LaSalle is a leading  global professional services and investment management firm specializing in real estate  The stock sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   at present  The company s 2019 earnings per share have been

13242,234757,CBRE,CBRE  CBRE  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  50 57 in the previous session  CBRE Group has gained 26 3  since the start of the year compared to the 10 7  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 20 2  return for the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 13  2019  CBRE reported EPS of  1 21 versus consensus estimate of  1 13 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5 9  
For the current fiscal year  CBRE is expected to post earnings of  3 45 per share on  22 4 billion in revenues  This represents a 5 18  change in EPS on a 4 95  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 7 per share on  23 68 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 39  and 5 73   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
CBRE may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
CBRE has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 10 9X versus its peer group s average of 12 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 33  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank

13244,234759,CBRE,Deal On The Way Now That Deadline Is Delayed  ,opinion,"It s official  President Trump postponed the March 1 deadline for higher tariffs since trade negotiations with China have made enough  substantial progress   Though stocks came well off their highs from the morning  the major indices still finished the day in the green as stocks attempt a 10th straight week on positive ground 
	The NASDAQ climbed 0 36  today to 7554 46  while the Dow stayed above 26 000 with a rise of 0 23   or about 60 points  to 26 091 95  At its best point of the day though  the Dow had soared approximately 200 points  The S P momentarily crossed over 2800  but couldn t hold onto the milestone and finished with a gain of 0 12  to 2796 11 
	The past couple of weeks have been full of positive headlines from the meetings both in Beijing and in Washington  The President said last week that the deadline  which was rapidly approaching  was not set in stone  Today s delay is the most positive bit of news we ve had thus far  but there s still no actual deal 
	However  both sides seem to be working toward a summit between President Trump and President Xi of China sometime next month and possibly in Mr  Trump s Florida resort Mar a Lago  If everything goes as hoped  this could be the final step in an actual deal between the two countries that includes smiles  handshakes and  most importantly  signatures 
	With stocks running out of steam as the day continued  many investors are worried that a deal has already been priced in  The market has been in an unusually good mood so far in 2019  stemming mainly from a more  patient  Fed and expectations for a trade deal  Who knows for sure  Maybe a good amount of this agreement has already been taken into account  but we still need this issue to move into the rear view mirror if we hope to completely recover from the late 2018 correction and get back to new all time highs  Today s Portfolio Highlights

13265,234780,CBRE,CBRE Group  CBRE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of real estate investment management services is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 1  
Revenues are expected to be  5 94 billion  up 37 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CBRE 
For CBRE  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CBRE will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CBRE would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 79  delivering a surprise of  5 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CBRE doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cbre-group-cbre-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200384426,200384426

Consensus Estimate of  537 6 million Over the trailing four quarters  Vornado surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in the other  witnessing average positive surprise of 5 04   This is depicted in the graph below Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderEconomic tailwinds like upbeat consumer sentiment and continued healthy growth in the job market have resulted in increased consumer spending and helped bring the mojo back in the sector  In fact  going by a  by CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE    net absorption at U S  retail properties aggregated to more than 14 8 million square feet of space in the fourth quarter Further  net asking rents escalated across all retail property types  with the lifestyle   mall segment witnessing year over year rent growth of 6 7  during the quarter  its first rent increase since third quarter 2017 These encouraging numbers suggest Vornado to have witnessed decent rent growth and occupancy at its Manhattan street retail portfolio  In fact  the fourth quarter occupancy for the company s New York retail portfolio is pegged at 97   flat year over year  In addition  revenues for the quarter are pinned at  549 1 million  indicating year over year growth of 2 4   Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2018 lease termination fees is pegged at  0 87 million  improving from the quarter ago tally of  0 36 million Also  Vornado has made considerable efforts to expand its portfolio through strategic acquisitions  In line with this  the company increased its ownership stake in the Farley Post Office joint venture  JV  with the Related Companies  by acquiring additional 44 9  from its JV partner  The transaction increases Vornado s Penn Plaza holdings to 9 million square feet Importantly  the company announced that the fourth quarter 2018 financial results will include certain items that will increase its FFO per share  including assumed conversions by 20 cents  However  this amount will be excluded in the adjusted FFO plus assumed conversions per share figure However  higher interest rates during the quarter are expected to have escalated the company s interest expense  This will weigh on the company s bottom line growth in the quarter under review Prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s fourth quarter FFO per share has been revised marginally downward in a month s time  indicating bearish sentiments of analysts  Nonetheless  the estimate of 99 cents indicates year over year growth of 1 02  Earnings WhispersHere is what our quantitative model predicts Vornado has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3

 It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share  This  when combined with a favorable Zacks rank  makes

13267,234782,CBRE,CBRE Group  CBRE  To Post Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBRE   is slated to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 13  before the market opens  The company is anticipated to display year over year growth in both revenues and earnings In the last reported quarter  this Los Angeles  CA based commercial real estate services and investment firm delivered a 5 33  positive earnings surprise  Results indicate strong top line growth  driven by occupier outsourcing In fact  CBRE has a decent record of earnings surprise  having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  coming up with average positive beat of 6 19   The graph below depicts this surprise history CBRE Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderCBRE Group has a robust scale as the largest commercial real estate services and investment firm  based on 2017 revenues   The company is among the few offering a full suite of services to multi national clients  It has an extensive knowledge of domestic and international real estate markets  and its market leading position is likely to lend it a competitive edge in capitalizing on the commercial real estate industry tailwinds Moreover  CBRE Group has grown organically and banked on strategic in fill acquisitions to fortify its service offerings and geographic reach  The company has made concerted efforts to diversify its revenue base over the past years  It has opted for a better balanced and more resilient business model  and in pursuit of this  shifted the revenue mix toward more contractual sources and leasing  This trend is expected to have continued into the fourth quarter as well Furthermore  occupiers of real estate are increasingly opting for outsourcing and depending on the expertise of third party real estate specialists to achieve improvement in execution and efficiency  With a market leading position and being one of the few companies boasting occupier outsourcing capabilities on a global scale  CBRE Group remains well poised to capitalize on the favorable trends in the Dec end quarter Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is currently pegged at  5 94 billion  indicating projected growth of nearly 37 1  year over year Nonetheless  shift toward a comparatively lower margin outsourcing business might strain the company s margins  Additionally  things  of late  have been turning sour and the commercial real estate market  both domestic and international  do not appear as prosperous as it used to be The industry  rather  seems to be entering the late stages of its growth cycle  In fact  after years of witnessing decent growth  commercial real estate transaction volumes have decelerated in the past couple of years  Along with the financial markets  volatility  investors and lenders are compelled to adopt a more cautious approach with respect to underwriting  thereby  affecting the sales activity  Further  trade tensions  political uncertainty and volatile equity markets are anticipated to add to these woes  affecting transaction levels Also  CBRE Group s activities during the Oct Dec quarter did not gain analysts  confidence  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings remained unchanged over the last 30 days at  1 13  However  it indicates a year over year increase of 14 1  Here is what our quantitative model predicts CBRE Group does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank

13269,234784,CBRE,4 REITs Poised To Emerge Winners This Earnings Season ,opinion,As we stand in one of the busiest weeks of the current reporting cycle  investors can be lured by profits of companies that have already released their quarterly figures  But rather than adding the stock later to your portfolio  accumulating the ones that are yet to report and poised to beat estimates  can generate higher gains  This is because an earnings beat usually serves as a catalyst  raising investors  confidence in a stock and resulting in price appreciation And REITs are now back in limelight as after a soft performance in 2018  the sector emerged as a solid winner this January  with the FTSE Nareit ALL REITs Index gaining 11 42   outperforming the S P 500 s rally of 8 01  Obviously  the pause mode adopted by the Federal Reserve toward rate hike has garnered enthusiasm for this sector as REITs are a preferred choice among investors owing to their high dividend paying nature  Moreover  an unchanged decision with respect to rate comes as a relief because REITs usually have a high dependence on debt Further  prospects of a number of underlying asset categories of REITs are getting a boost amid healthy economy  job market gains and high consumer confidence that are translating into greater demand for real estate and resulting in higher occupancy levels Take for example the industrial real estate category which is exhibiting solid strength amid e commerce boom and supply chain strategy transformations  In fact  per a  by the commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE     availability fell for 34 straight quarters to 7 0  for the U S  industrial market in Q4  denoting the lowest point since 2000  Additionally  with demand surpassing new supply  net asking rents increased 2 2  in Q4 to  7 37 per square feet   marking the highest level since 1989  per a CBRE  In the office sector too  the fourth quarter vacancy rate declined to its lowest level in 11 years  shrinking 10 basis points  bps  to 12 6   according to a  by CBRE Group  Further  job growth boosted annual net absorption to 58 3 million square feet of space   the highest since 2015 In addition  the recent  from Reis shows that the neighborhood and community shopping center vacancy rate remained flat in the Dec end quarter at 10 2   but inched up from 10  witnessed at year end 2017  Mall vacancy rate slightly edged down to 9  in the quarter from 9 1  in the third quarter  At year end 2017  the company s vacancy was 8 3   Despite the store closure issue plaguing the market  the little stability indicates slowdown in new development Furthermore  an improved economy  job market gains and upbeat consumer confidence are signaling brighter prospects for hotel REITs  In fact  hotel demand registered 2 5  growth nationally in Q4 against the 1 6  rate in the prior quarter  while supply growth remained at 2 0   per a  from CBRE  This solid demand growth has boosted national occupancy which went up 0 4  year over year as against the prior quarter s decline  Average Daily Rate  ADR  moved up 2 0  nationally in Q4  while RevPAR was up 2 4  year over year Finally  data center REITs too are experiencing a boom  with growing popularity of cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  as well as the use of third party IT infrastructure by several companies  Demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  These markets are absorbing new construction at an accelerated pace despite enjoying high occupancy However  despite the above mentioned growth drivers  choosing the right stock could be difficult unless one knows the proper method  To make the task simple we rely on the Zacks methodology  combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive  Our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP  shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks

to  110 6 billion this holiday season  indicating a 17 8  year over year increase  This upside is anticipated to send across positive ripple effects across the industrial real estate industry In fact  companies are putting immense efforts to improve and revamp their distribution and production platforms in order to support the thriving e commerce business  address a larger customer base and boost urbanization  Retailers are focusing on faster delivery  which is propelling demand for modern distribution facilities  As such  demand for warehouses  distribution centers and other industrial property remains strong  and continues to surpass supply levels  Also  last mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values Furthermore  not only online sales  but also online returns are opening up scope for this asset category  This is because returns from the online sales platform are usually more than in store sales  In fact  per a  from CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE    while traditional return rate for goods purchased from stores is around 8   the same for online purchases is much higher at 15 30   subject to product category This trend is eroding profit margins of retailers  as they are plagued with the challenge in processing and reselling the products  Nonetheless  this reverse flow of merchandise can be mastered with an efficient supply chain network  The process is also propelling demand for purpose built warehouses with arrangements chalked out especially for processing returns These will provide significant impetus to REITs in the industrial asset category  such as Prologis   NYSE PLD    Duke Realty   NYSE DRE    Plymouth Industrial REIT  Inc    NYSE PLYM   and Terreno Realty Corporation   NYSE TRNO    in the form of rent escalation  apart from high occupancy In fact such factors are giving reasons to the industrial REITs to rejoice  Per a  by CBRE Group  availability fell for 34 straight quarters to 7 0  for the U S  industrial market in fourth quarter 2018  denoting the lowest point since 2000  Furthermore  demand for warehouses surpassed the delivery of newly constructed supply by around 6 million square feet  according to the report Additionally  with demand surpassing new supply  net asking rents increased 2 2  in Q4 to  7 37 per square feet   marking the highest level since 1989  per a CBRE   Moreover  rents have climbed 7 4  year over year  This not only marks one of the largest growth rates in this cycle  but the figure has also surpassed the average annual growth rate of 4 3  since 2012 Going forward  taking a recovering economy and the healthy job market scenario into consideration  consumption levels will likely remain elevated  And a substantial rise in e commerce business  healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories are likely to drive demand for warehouse and logistics real estate  Added to this is the Fed Chair s assurance to adopt a  patient  approach in raising rates in tandem with the evolution of the economy  rather than being too aggressive in its tightening measures Nevertheless  development activity is also picking up pace in this sector and the demand and supply gap reduced to nearly 6 million square feet of space in the Dec end quarter from 9 3 million square feet in the third quarter  In addition  protectionist trade policies have an adverse impact on economic growth  as well as the industrial REIT s business At present  Plymouth Industrial REIT flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Terreno Realty has a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   while Prologis and

13291,234806,CBRE,Safeguard Your Portfolio In A Volatile Market  5 Value Picks ,opinion,Wall Street has been reeling under severe volatility over the last three months  The recent rate hike  conflicting news related to trade war between the United States and China and fear of a global economic slowdown have resulted in market skepticism regarding the future growth potential of U S  stocks Despite the negatives  fundamentals of the U S  economy remain strong  However  investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability  At this stage  it would be a prudent decision to pick up value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank Fed Hikes Rate and Pursues Quantitative TighteningOn Dec 19  the Fed raised benchmark lending target rate by 0 25  to the range of 2 25 2 50   This was the fourth rate hike by the central bank in 2018  However  the Fed hinted that it may lower the pace of rate hikes from the previous projections of three to two times for 2019  Despite the Fed s assurance of lowering the pace of rate hikes  Wall Street remained extremely volatile in the last two days Investors remain highly concerned about the continuation of Quantitative Tightening through which the central bank is reducing the size of its balance sheet by  50 billion each month by redeeming government debt and mortgage bonds  This implies that a massive  600 billion will not be invested in sovereign bonds in 2019  This will significantly reduce demand for U S  government bonds  resulting in lower bond price and higher yields  Consequently  interest rate will go up in the long term   Fear of Partial Government ShutdownOn Dec 18  Senate Majority Lead Mitch McConnell said that a proposed short term government funding plan worth  5 billion border security fencing was rejected by Democrat representatives  Notably  without the approval of a spending bill  several government agencies face the risk of a shutdown On Dec 20  President Trump refused to sign a Senate approved appropriations bill that would avert a government shutdown  Trump stated categorically as long as both houses of Congress allocate  5 billion in funds for expansion of the U S  southern border wall  he will not sign the bill  Investors fear that a partial government shutdown is likely to start from mid night Dec 21 Our Top PicksThe U S  markets remain volatile so far in 2018  Trade related concerns  geopolitical conflicts and inflationary concerns will certainly lead to more fluctuations at least in the short term  This in turn will force investors to put their money in safe assets At this juncture  it will be a prudent decision to buy value on the dip stocks that could prove to be valuable once the rally

future rate hikes  He dropped hints that the Fed would apply a relatively slower than anticipated approach to increasing interest rates in the near future  On the cue  stocks witnessed a steep climb and allayed investor fears    As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher

13335,234850,CBRE,Buy These 5 Stocks With Sales Growth Amid Volatile Markets,opinion,Investors often overlook sales growth while selecting stocks for investment purpose  as a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings growth  However  earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily manipulated and inflated  That s why sales should always be taken into consideration Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company s health and ability to sustain its business  It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not rigged and is less volatile than earnings Without some top line growth  the bottom line improvement may not be sustainable in the long term  While a company can show earnings strength by lowering expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires continued sales growth Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order

stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated

13337,234852,CBRE,This Reit Pays A 5 5  Yield With Monthly Dividends,opinion,"Most dividend stocks make their payouts to shareholders on a quarterly schedule  But some companies choose to pay dividends once per year  or semi annually  In rarer cases  companies pay dividends each month  Receiving 12 dividends per year provides investors a boost  as monthly payouts allow shareholders to compound their dividends slightly faster than with quarterly  semi annual  or annual payouts 
However  not all monthly dividend stocks are automatic buys  Investors looking to add a monthly dividend stock to their portfolio should still perform thorough research on the company  to make sure it is worthy of investment 
STAG Industrial Inc  NYSE STAG  is a REIT with a high dividend yield of 5 5   and it also pays dividends each month  STAG is a high quality company that could be an attractive dividend stock for income investors 
This STAG Can Run
STAG Industrial is a Real Estate Investment Trust  or REIT  that became publicly traded in 2011 after its initial public offering  Today  the company primarily owns single tenant  industrial real estate properties such as warehouses  distribution  and manufacturing facilities  It owns approximately 370 properties in 37 states  It has a diverse lineup of properties  across the automotive  industrial  packaging  food and beverage  and retail industries 
REITs are typically known as slow growth companies  but STAG has generated strong growth over the past year  For example  STAG s rental revenue increased 17  in the most recent quarter  Growth was due to increased occupancy  rent increases  and contributions from recent property acquisitions  Funds from operation  a commonly used financial metric for REITs as a proxy for earnings per share  increased 10  year over year  STAG is off to a good start to 2018  Adjusted EBITDA and funds from operation  or FFO  increased 16 9  and 19 2   respectively  in the first six months 
STAG s above average growth for a REIT is a result of its property acquisition strategy  The company has primarily focused on industrial properties because it believes the industrial market offers unique advantages  The U S  industrial real estate industry is a large and stable market  It is also highly fragmented  which is prone to frequent pricing inefficiencies  which gives large owners like STAG to find attractive acquisitions at discounted values  Lastly  according to STAG  industrial real estate properties have low capital expenditure requirements and high retention rates  relative to other forms of real estate 
Specifically  warehouses are an emerging area of growth for STAG  largely the result of the e commerce boom in the United States  As consumers increasingly shift shopping to online  e commerce retail platforms like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  need greater amounts of warehouse space  A recent report from real estate brokerage firm CBRE Group Inc   NYSE CBRE  found that warehouse availability in the third quarter of 2018 fell to its lowest level since 2000  indicating a shortage of properties  Combined with rising demand for warehouse space  this should create a significant tailwind for occupancy and rents for STAG going forward 
As you can see in the image below  STAG has benefited from rising occupancy and rents over the past several years 

Source  Investor Presentation  page 6
STAG has a positive growth outlook moving forward  Acquisitions are a major part of STAG s growth strategy  In 2017  STAG invested over  600 million in new property acquisitions  Last quarter  the company acquired 15 buildings for  185 million  New property acquisitions provide additional cash flow over time  which allow the company to purchase additional buildings  and so on  This creates as snowball effect of sorts  that can provide long term growth to STAG  The company is expected to grow FFO by roughly 5  in 2018  and could grow at a 6  annual rate over the next five years  This growth will fuel STAG s rising dividends 
Growth And Dividends Fuel High Expected Returns
STAG currently pays a monthly dividend of  0 1183 per share  On an annual basis  STAG s dividends total  1 42 per share  With a recent share price of  25 96 per share  STAG has a current dividend yield of 5 5   This is a very attractive dividend yield  as the S P 500 Index has an average dividend yield below 2  right now 
Importantly  the dividend appears to be secure  STAG is expected to generate FFO per share of  1 75 in 2018  Based on this  the stock is likely to have a dividend payout ratio of 81  this year  This is a manageable payout ratio  as REITs are accustomed to paying out a high percentage of FFO to shareholders  Future FFO growth will allow the company to raise its dividend each year 
In addition  STAG has a strong enough financial position to maintain and even grow the dividend over time  STAG has a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4 7x  a ratio below 5 0x indicates an acceptable leverage ratio for a REIT  STAG also has an investment grade credit rating  which will help contain the cost of debt financing for future acquisitions  This will be especially valuable in a rising interest rate environment 
STAG is also attractive on a valuation basis  Using expected FFO per share of  1 75 for 2018  shares of the company trade for a price to FFO ratio of 14 8  In the past 10 years  the stock has held an average price to FFO ratio of 14 9  The 10 year average is a reasonable estimate of fair value  which indicates that STAG is fairly valued today 
Going forward  STAG s shareholder returns will be comprised mostly of FFO growth and dividends  Assuming a relatively flat valuation  the combination of 6  annual FFO growth along with the 5 5  dividend yield  result in expected annual returns of 11 5  per year over the next five years  This is a strong rate of return  especially for a high quality business 
Final Thoughts
The REIT asset class is a great source of stock picks for investors interested mainly in generating dividend income from their portfolios  STAG has durable competitive advantages  a diversified property portfolio  and strong growth prospects moving forward thanks to the e commerce boom  The company has a 5 5  current dividend yield  and opportunities to raise the dividend going forward  Investors looking for higher dividend income today  as well as dividend growth down the road  should see a lot to like about this company  STAG checks all the boxes of a high quality REIT with a high dividend yield  and an added bonus monthly dividend payouts

13355,234870,CBRE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Regency Centers  Chatham Lodging Trust  New Residential Investment  Sun Communities And Urstadt Biddle Properties,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 14 2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  REITs  Part 2  including Regency Centers Corp    NYSE REG    Chatham Lodging Trust   NYSE CLDT    New Residential Investment Corp    NYSE NRZ    Sun Communities  Inc    NYSE SUI   and Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc    NYSE UBA   Industry  REITs  Part 2Link  The Federal Reserve didn t raise interest rates at the latest FOMC meeting  But with inflation nearing its target 2  mark  the market expects the central bank to stay the course and raise rates at least two more times this year and three times next This seemingly hawkish Fed stance would typically be a negative backdrop for REITs  but the space appears to have done adequate preparation for this monetary policy tightening cycle  Stronger balance sheets  fixed rate borrowings and extended maturities are some of the notable features that are giving REITs the flexibility to operate in the current environment  This financial flexibility is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies Moreover  high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains are fueling consumption levels  In fact  with one eventually requiring  real space  for economic activities  prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels Further  valuation wise  several REIT stocks seem attractive  while encouraging performance by a number of REITs in Q1 as well as an increase in merger and acquisition activities in the industry point at the prevailing favorable environment  Further with the inflation level creeping up  one must keep in mind that REIT dividend growth has   as measured by Consumer Price Index   in 18 of the past 20 years All these provide enough incentive to investors to delve into the fundamentals of the individual asset segment of the REIT industry Industrial REITsIndustrial REITs are indeed firing on all cylinders  and per a  by the commercial real estate services firm CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7 3  for the U S  industrial market in first quarter 2018  Moreover  with demand surpassing new supply   climbed 1 9  in Q1 to  7 01 per square feet  denoting the highest level since 1989 In fact  to support e commerce business  address a large customer base and urbanization  companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms  Services like same day delivery are gaining traction  propelling demand for modern distribution facilities  Also  last mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values Going forward  with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms  consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated  And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories  demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high Data Center  Cell Tower REITsIn addition to industrial REITs  e commerce is also driving demand for data center and cell tower REITs  This is because  when demand is placed through smartphones  tablets or computers  the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers  In fact  without the offering of this critical infrastructure  the e commerce value chain simply cannot sustain and therefore REITs  which happen to own many of these cell towers and data centers  are expected to benefit substantially Along with making purchases online  an increasing number of people are consuming digital content  Estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence  Internet of Things  autonomous vehicle and virtual augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years  In addition  the deployment of 5G network should drive growth of tower and fiber business as wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks  Therefore  along with an improved outlook for economic growth  all these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower and data center REITs Retail REITsDespite several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record high defaults by retail corporates  recent  from Reis  which Reuters had cited  shows that U S  retail real estate vacancies was 10  in the first quarter of 2018    unchanged for the fourth consecutive quarter  Admittedly  consumer confidence is still high  Moreover  the stability clearly reflects the benefit from concerted efforts of the retail landlords to boost productivity of retail assets by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non productive ones  Also  with limited retail supply  refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction Retail REITs are now avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories  and rather expanding dining options  opening movie theaters  offering recreational facilities and opening fitness centers in particular  Also  amid the changing landscape in the retail real estate market  prime properties continue to enjoy strong demand  though class B and lower properties are experiencing a decline in occupancies  With the recent tax overhaul likely to benefit wages  consumer confidence and consumption levels  demand for prime properties is anticipated to remain strong in the rest of the year Residential REITsIn the national apartment market  despite high supply and a seasonally slow first quarter leasing period  thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households  the occupancy level remained elevated and came in at 94 5  this March  just a notch lower than the prior year tally of 95   per the latest  from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage Moreover  solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for still healthy apartment market occupancy despite high deliveries in the near term  Also  shortages of construction labor and rising expenses might somewhat impede the growth momentum of supply Student Housing REITsFor student housing real estate market  there is stability in performance per a  by RealPage  Specifically  an increasing number of giveaways being offered and proximity to campus are aiding the healthy leasing volumes of this sector  Nonetheless  this sector has witnessed slight moderation in rent growth In fact  with a significant salary differential between college graduates and high school graduates  college enrolment is set to increase  This will likely drive demand for residential units that are leased by student housing REITs  Also  demand is emanating for on campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds  And on campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy Office REITsIn the office sector too  though supply of new office space has slightly pushed up vacancy levels  by 20 bps  to 13 3  in Q1  per a CBRE Group   demand for high quality  efficient space remains strong  This is indicated by the pre leasing of around 70  of space being delivered in Q1 While higher construction with increased completions might moderate the pace of growth in the primary markets  suburban markets are likely to excel with increased population and growth in employment  Per the data from CBRE Group  for the fifth straight quarter  annual rent growth in suburban markets  2 3   surpassed that of the downtown markets  0 2   Hotel REITsIn case of hotel REITs too  an improving economy  growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels  Particularly  improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends  plus strong demand from leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs Mixed Use Developments Mixed use developments have gained immense popularity in recent years  Such developments lower the distance between housing  workplaces  retail businesses  and other amenities and destinations  Hence  such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live  work and play in the same area   a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States  In recent years  retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp  also directed their investments toward such projects Healthcare REITsDemand for healthcare real estate is expected to increase considerably on favorable demographics  This is because the senior citizen population is growing at a faster rate than other adults  calling for a greater healthcare needs  Along with an aging population and cost containment  less expensive delivery settings and new technologies  demand for medical office buildings  outpatient facilities as well as urgent care facilities is growing Moreover  university based life science real estate has grabbed attention  In fact  increasing longevity of the aging U S  population  along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities  have promoted institutional life science and medical market fundamentals  Further  long lease terms and top rated  institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for health care landlords Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioSpecific REITs that we prefer include Chatham Lodging Trust  New Residential

13356,234871,CBRE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  RealPage  DDR  Seritage Growth Properties  New Senior Investment Group And Mack Cali Realty,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 14 2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  REITs  Part 3  including RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP    DDR Corp    NYSE DDR    Seritage Growth Properties   NYSE SRG    New Senior Investment Group Inc    NYSE SNR   and Mack Cali Realty Corp    NYSE CLI   Industry  REITs  Part 3Link  Even though the benchmark interest rate was kept unchanged in the latest FOMC meeting  the acknowledgement by Fed officials that inflation is nearing the target level indicates that a number of rate hikes are on course this year and next Admittedly  for REITs  this remains the biggest near term challenge as the use of leverage for REIT business makes the returns from this industry susceptible to interest rate movements  Moreover  the dividend payout itself might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts  Particularly  a rise in the interest rate affects the present value of future cash flows  Therefore  asset valuation  including bond coupons and stock dividends  is expected to experience a decline Apart from this  the softening of fundamentals in a number of asset categories indicates limited scope of growing future cash flows from the properties of the corresponding REITs  Also  REITs with lower pricing power and longer lease durations have less chances of beating the rate hike blues Let s now delve more into the headwinds for the following REIT segments Retail REITRetail REITs are not in the pink as mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers  shopping preference through the online channel  In fact  with ecommerce gaining market share from the traditional brick and mortar stores  retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies Specifically  the first few months of 2018 witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record high defaults by retail corporates  Moreover   from real estate research firm Reis which Reuters had cited  reveals that U S  retail real estate vacancies persisted at the 10  levels for first quarter 2018 Such an environment has also led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified  In addition  when substantial store closures happen in the middle of the lease term  not only are mall landlords hurt  but tenants occupying space in that mall are equally affected because their shop visits depend on the mix of specific types of retailers However  retail REITs are fighting back and transforming their traditional retail hubs into entertainment destinations and lifestyle resorts in an attempt to lure customers  But  in the process  vacancies are escalating in Class B  and below properties  Moreover  with huge outlay for refurbishments  growth in the profit margins of retail REITs in the near term is likely to be curbed Residential REITThe latest  from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc  reveals that the national apartment market indeed moderated in first quarter 2018  Going by statistics  the annual rent growth shrunk to 2 3  in Q1  This not only marked moderation from the 2 6 2 9  growth rate experienced throughout 2017 but also denoted the slowest growth since third quarter 2010 Of course  the first quarter marks a slow leasing period  thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand  However  a whole lot of new supply is the ultimate culprit  fueling competition and curbing landlords  pricing power Also  occupancy level of 94 5  this March edged down from the prior year tally of 95   with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy  Although the overall occupancy level is still healthy  the deceleration suggests that a competitive leasing environment is fast building up  and any robust upturn in occupancy seems elusive in the near term This is quite obvious when so much of new supply is likely to come on course  According to the RealPage report  during the last half of 2017  across the nation s 150 largest metros  annual pace of completions  climbed above the 300 000 unit level  Further  through early 2019   scheduled new supply  will keep adding on to the flow at about the same annual pace Therefore  the stressed environment is anticipated to continue in the near term and likely to curb residential landlords  ability to command more rents and affect concession levels Office REITIf improved economy  healthy job market environment and growing corporate profit raise expectations of robust fundamentals for the office market  then investors should perhaps think twice  This is because supply of office space has been rapidly increasing  In fact  according to  from CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE   in Q1  new supply aggregated 12 3 million square feet  which was marginally lower than the two highest quarterly aggregates of this cycle Amid high supply  the overall vacancy rate climbed 20 basis points to 13 3  in the quarter while rent growth decelerated from the recent peak levels  The average gross asking rent inched up 0 7  sequentially and 1 4  year over year  The situation is particularly worsening in the downtown markets where annual rent growth has just managed to grow 0 2   Therefore  the pricing power of landlords remains curbed and elevated concession levels rule the market Healthcare REITHealthcare REITs are more sensitive to rising interest rates than other asset classes  thanks to their long term leases  Moreover  despite the sector benefiting strongly from the aging baby boomer population  there are areas of concern of late  Particularly  there is softness in seniors housing fundamentals as supply has escalated rapidly in recent times in this asset category Moreover  skilled nursing facilities are becoming more susceptible to top line pressure due to the gradual shift in the medical billing procedure that stresses more on the value of care provided rather than the volume of services offered mREITsAlso  volatility in rates affect the performance of mortgage REITs  or mREITs  which offer real estate financing through the purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage backed securities  These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on mortgage assets and their funding costs  Therefore  these REITs face increased spread volatility when rates climb up REITs to AvoidSpecific REITs that we don t like

13359,234874,CBRE,Interest Rates To Be Less Of A Drag For REITs ,opinion,"The Federal Reserve didn t raise interest rates at the latest FOMC meeting  But with inflation nearing its target 2  mark  the market expects the central bank to stay the course and raise rates at least two more times this year and three times next 
This seemingly hawkish Fed stance would typically be a negative backdrop for REITs  but the space appears to have done adequate preparation for this monetary policy tightening cycle  Stronger balance sheets  fixed rate borrowings and extended maturities are some of the notable features that are giving REITs the flexibility to operate in the current environment  This financial flexibility is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies 
Moreover  high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains are fueling consumption levels  In fact  with one eventually requiring  real space  for economic activities  prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels 
Further  valuation wise  several REIT stocks seem attractive  while encouraging performance by a number of REITs in Q1 as well as an increase in merger and acquisition activities in the industry point at the prevailing favorable environment  Further with the inflation level creeping up  one must keep in mind that REIT dividend growth has   as measured by Consumer Price Index   in 18 of the past 20 years 
All these provide enough incentive to investors to delve into the fundamentals of the individual asset segment of the REIT industry 
Industrial REITs
Industrial REITs are indeed firing on all cylinders  and per a  by the commercial real estate services firm CBRE Group Inc  NYSE CBRE    CBRE   availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7 3  for the U S  industrial market in first quarter 2018  Moreover  with demand surpassing new supply   climbed 1 9  in Q1 to  7 01 per square feet  denoting the highest level since 1989 
In fact  to support e commerce business  address a large customer base and urbanization  companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms  Services like same day delivery are gaining traction  propelling demand for modern distribution facilities  Also  last mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values 
Going forward  with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms  consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated  And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories  demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high 
Data Center  Cell Tower REITs
In addition to industrial REITs  e commerce is also driving demand for data center and cell tower REITs  This is because  when demand is placed through smartphones  tablets or computers  the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers  In fact  without the offering of this critical infrastructure  the e commerce value chain simply cannot sustain and therefore REITs  which happen to own many of these cell towers and data centers  are expected to benefit substantially 
Along with making purchases online  an increasing number of people are consuming digital content  Estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence  Internet of Things  autonomous vehicle and virtual augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years  In addition  the deployment of 5G network should drive growth of tower and fiber business as wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks  Therefore  along with an improved outlook for economic growth  all these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower and data center REITs 
Retail REITs
Despite several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record high defaults by retail corporates  recent  from Reis  which Reuters had cited  shows that U S  retail real estate vacancies was 10  in the first quarter of 2018    unchanged for the fourth consecutive quarter  Admittedly  consumer confidence is still high  Moreover  the stability clearly reflects the benefit from concerted efforts of the retail landlords to boost productivity of retail assets by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non productive ones  Also  with limited retail supply  refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction 
Retail REITs are now avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories  and rather expanding dining options  opening movie theaters  offering recreational facilities and opening fitness centers in particular  Also  amid the changing landscape in the retail real estate market  prime properties continue to enjoy strong demand  though class B and lower properties are experiencing a decline in occupancies  With the recent tax overhaul likely to benefit wages  consumer confidence and consumption levels  demand for prime properties is anticipated to remain strong in the rest of the year 
Residential REITsIn the national apartment market  despite high supply and a seasonally slow first quarter leasing period  thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households  the occupancy level remained elevated and came in at 94 5  this March  just a notch lower than the prior year tally of 95   per the latest  from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   RP  
Moreover  solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for still healthy apartment market occupancy despite high deliveries in the near term  Also  shortages of construction labor and rising expenses might somewhat impede the growth momentum of supply 
Student Housing REITs
For student housing real estate market  there is stability in performance per a  by RealPage  Specifically  an increasing number of giveaways being offered and proximity to campus are aiding the healthy leasing volumes of this sector  Nonetheless  this sector has witnessed slight moderation in rent growth 
In fact  with a significant salary differential between college graduates and high school graduates  college enrolment is set to increase  This will likely drive demand for residential units that are leased by student housing REITs  Also  demand is emanating for on campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds  And on campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy Office REITs
In the office sector too  though supply of new office space has slightly pushed up vacancy levels  by 20 bps  to 13 3  in Q1  per a CBRE Group   demand for high quality  efficient space remains strong  This is indicated by the pre leasing of around 70  of space being delivered in Q1 While higher construction with increased completions might moderate the pace of growth in the primary markets  suburban markets are likely to excel with increased population and growth in employment  Per the data from CBRE Group  for the fifth straight quarter  annual rent growth in suburban markets  2 3   surpassed that of the downtown markets  0 2   
Hotel REITs
In case of hotel REITs too  an improving economy  growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels  Particularly  improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends  plus strong demand from leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs 
Mixed Use Developments Mixed use developments have gained immense popularity in recent years  Such developments lower the distance between housing  workplaces  retail businesses  and other amenities and destinations  Hence  such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live  work and play in the same area   a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States  In recent years  retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp   REG  and Federal Realty Investment Trust  FRT  also directed their investments toward such projects Healthcare REITsDemand for healthcare real estate is expected to increase considerably on favorable demographics  This is because the senior citizen population is growing at a faster rate than other adults  calling for a greater healthcare needs  Along with an aging population and cost containment  less expensive delivery settings and new technologies  demand for medical office buildings  outpatient facilities as well as urgent care facilities is growing Moreover  university based life science real estate has grabbed attention  In fact  increasing longevity of the aging U S  population  along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities  have promoted institutional life science and medical market fundamentals  Further  long lease terms and top rated  institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for health care landlords Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 17 major stocks  including BP  LON BP   Gilead  GILD   Enterprise Products  EPD  and Colgate  CL   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Strong Buy ranked BP s shares are up  26 7  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry  up  16 1    The integrated energy company has been gaining on the back of a strong portfolio of upstream projects  Since 2016  BP has placed 13 key upstream projects online  including Atoll Phase 1   Zohr  driving the company s record first quarter 2018 production  Notably  since the October December quarter of 2010  the first quarter output has been the highest  
The Zacks analyst appreciates the company s commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividend payments  The company s dividend yield of almost 4  is way higher than 1 9  of the S P 500  In fact  the strong first quarter 2018 results have raised expectations of a hike in quarterly dividend soon which will mark the company s first dividend raise since 2014

Shares of Buy rated Gilead have outperformed the Zacks Biotech industry in the last six months  losing  10  vs  a decline of  13   Gilead s first quarter results were disappointing with both earnings and sales missing estimates as the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was wider than expected due to lower patient starts and increasing competition  
Nevertheless  Gilead is now banking on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like the CAR T therapy to drive growth  The HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of Descovy based regimens  The FDA approval of Biktarvy has further widened the portfolio  
The CHMP has also adopted a positive opinion on the regimen and a tentative approval is expected in the third quarter  The initial uptake of Yescarta is encouraging  Meanwhile  Gilead is intending to foray into the NASH market with selonsertib and filgotinib  Both the candidates are being evaluated in late stage studies and a tentative approval will diversify Gilead s portfolio
 You can   
Enterprise Products  shares have gained  6 1  over the last six months  even as the Zacks Oil Production Pipeline MLP industry declined by  5 3   Enterprise Products Partners  extensive network of pipeline that is spread across 50 000 miles is noteworthy  The pipeline network is connected to every major U S  shale play and provides services to producers and users of commodities by transporting gas  liquids and refined products  
Enterprise Products has a strong commitment to return cash back to the unitholders  The partnership has raised its cash distribution for 55 successive quarters  reflecting stable fee based cash flow from diversified midstream assets  Also  during first quarter 2018  Enterprise s earnings and revenue beat expectations  However  Enterprise Products  excessive reliance on debt reflects its balance sheet weaknesses  
The Zacks analyst is also concerned about Enterprise Products  rising operating costs  The partnership s units have lost 0 9  over the last year  as compared to the industry s 19 4  decline 
 You can   
Shares of Colgate have lost  9 3  over the last three months  underperforming the Zacks Consumer Staples sector  which has declined  8 6  over the same period  However  Colgate has been popular with investors for its meet or beat earnings track record  Continuing with this trend  the company delivered an earnings beat in first quarter 2018  after three consecutive quarters of in line earnings  Results continue to be driven by sales growth and significant market share gains  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives  Consequently  it provided a robust outlook for 2018  Further  the company is encouraged by the progress on Global Growth and Efficiency Program along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program  
However  its margins continue to be strained due to higher raw material and packaging costs  Moreover  Colgate expects the backdrop to remain challenging in 2018 due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide

13377,234892,CBRE,What s In Store For Alexandria  ARE  This Earnings Season  ,opinion,Alexandria Real Estate Equities   NYSE ARE   is scheduled to report first quarter results on Apr 30  after the market closes  Revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share are expected to grow sequentially Last quarter  this Pasadena  CA based urban office real estate investment trust  REIT   which primarily focuses on collaborative life science and technology campuses  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker  The company witnessed a year over year rise in expenses related to rental operations and interest expenses Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions  met in another and missed in the other  coming up with an average positive surprise of around 0 3   The graph below depicts this surprise history Alexandria Real Estate Equities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderThe fundamentals of the office real estate market remained moderate in the first quarter  In fact  going by numbers  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm CBRE Group Inc   NYSE CBRE   although new supply for the quarter exceeded the 10 million square foot mark  totaling 12 3 million square feet of space  70  of these deliveries were pre leased  Encouragingly  around half of the total space  currently under construction  has already been pre leased at higher rates  This underscores high demand for premier office space in major office markets This operating environment remains favorable for Alexandria  which focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses  primarily for the life science and technology entities  Its properties are located in markets with high barriers to entry and exit  This adds to the productivity and efficiency of tenants  We anticipate this to help the company generate steady revenues from its properties in the to be reported quarter  Further  in the past three months  shares of the company have lost 4 5   while the incurred a loss of 7 1    However  per the study  high level of new supply in the Jan Mar quarter has resulted in an uptick in overall vacancy rates by 20 basis points  bps   Further  in contrast to the recent peak rates witnessed by the industry  rent growth was sluggish in the quarter  merely inching up 0 7  sequentially  Further  the industry is witnessing a shift from downtown markets toward sub urban areas  as evident in the high annual growth rates in the sub urban office spaces We expect this changing landscape to impact the company s performance in the soon to be reported quarter  Sluggish rental growth will likely limit its operating margins and high vacancies might add to its concerns In addition to the above  Alexandria s strategy to sell non core operating assets and non strategic land parcels is expected to have affected its bottom line growth in the quarter Hence  there is lack of any solid catalyst prior to the first quarter earnings release  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations  FFO  per share for the first quarter fell by a cent to  1 59 over the past month  reflecting bearish analyst sentiment Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexandria is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks ESP  Alexandria s Earnings ESP is 0 00  Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter Taubman Centers  Inc    NYSE TCO    slated to release earnings on Apr 26  has an Earnings

13378,234893,CBRE,Forget Rate Hikes  Bet On 3 REITs With Beat Potential In Q1,opinion,We are in one of the busiest weeks of the current reporting cycle  and it s natural for investors to be lured by big profits and huge surprises of companies that have already released their quarterly numbers  But instead of accumulating the stock later  investing in ones that are poised for a beat can be far more rewarding  This is because earnings beats essentially raise investors  confidence in a stock and results in further price appreciation And if you believed that the rate hike in March and projections for the number of increases this year and in the next have put REITs in the back foot  then perhaps you need to reconsider  Because not only have the REITs made their balance sheets less leveraged  they have locked in the low rates by borrowing at a fixed rate and extending the average maturity of their debt outstanding   This financial flexibility is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies Moreover  high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains are fueling consumption levels  In fact  with one eventually requiring  real space  for economic activities  prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels Particularly  consider the industrial REITs where availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7 3  for the U S  industrial market in first quarter 2018  per a  by the commercial real estate services firm   CBRE Group Inc    NYSE CBRE    High consumption levels  strengthening e commerce market  and a healthy manufacturing environment amid a recovering economy and job market are fueling demand Also  despite several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record high defaults by retail corporates  recent  from Reis shows that for the neighborhood and community shopping centers  the vacancy rate remained moderately unchanged at 10  for first quarter 2018 This stability clearly reflects the concerted efforts of the retail landlords to boost productivity of retail assets by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants  Also  with limited retail supply  refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction  Retail REITs are now avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories  and rather expanding dining options  opening movie theaters  offering recreational facilities and opening fitness centers in particular Moreover  in the national apartment market  despite high supply and

seven years with decent performance across the table  As global tensions eased a bit with leaders of North and South Korea pledging to collaborate to secure complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and reduce the risk of war  the markets might be headed for a smooth spell As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A

article include  Zebra Technologies Corporation   NASDAQ ZBRA    Stryker Corporation   NYSE SYK    The Progressive Corporation   NYSE PGR    The Interpublic Group of Companies  Inc    NYSE IPG   and CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBRE   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Stocks with Impressive Sales Growth to Keep an Eye OnSales growth is an important metric for any company  as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making  It provides an insight into product demand and pricing power  By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods  one can easily understand a company s growth trend Sales growth is important to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and disappointing financial performance  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit but can t rev up enough growth to attract new investors Also  in a growing economy  lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  some sustained sales growth is essential to support the bottom line Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction And that s what

13396,234911,CBRE,CBRE Group  CBRE  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of CBRE Group   NYSE CBRE    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 0 4  over the past month  CBRE hit a new 52 week high of  48 44 in the previous session  CBRE Group has gained 10 6  since the start of the year compared to the  1 6  move for the Finance sector and the 0 9  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 8  2018  CBRE Group reported EPS of  0 99 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 93 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5 53  
For the current fiscal year  CBRE Group is expected to post earnings of  3 06 per share on  15 64 billion in revenues  This represents a 12 92  change in EPS on a 10 05  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 3 per share on  16 67 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 58  and 6 63   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
CBRE Group may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for CBRE  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
CBRE Group has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 15 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 12 1X versus its peer group s average of 13 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 2  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective CBRE Group  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  CBRE Group currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if CBRE Group passes the test  Thus  it seems as though CBRE shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2018-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cbre-group-cbre-hits-a-52weekhigh-can-the-run-continue-200306882,200306882

13400,234915,CBRE,Aggressive Dispositions To Hurt Kimco  KIM   Time To Sell ,opinion,Kimco Realty s   NYSE KIM   financials are likely to be hurt by decreasing footfall at malls amid the shift of consumers toward online channels  store closures and bankruptcy of retailers  Moreover  the dilutive impact on earnings from the sale of assets cannot be bypassed in near term  Competition from other players in the industry and rate hike pose other challenges to this retail REIT  However  Kimco s 2020 Vision  which aims ownership of premium assets in strategic locations  will enhance its portfolio For fourth quarter 2017  Kimco reported adjusted funds from operations  FFO  of 38 cents per share  in line with Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company reported the same figure in the year ago quarter as well  Kimco posted revenues from rental properties of  310 6 million in the reported quarter  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  299 0 million  The figure compared favorably with the year ago number of  292 9 million  Moreover  the company leased more than 10 million square feet in 2017  denoting the highest leasing volume in past 10 years Kimco is focused on simplifying its business structure and thus is making significant disposition of its assets  In fact  Kimco s disposition activity in 2017 consisted of 25 consolidated operating properties and nine parcels  for an aggregate sales price of  352 2 million  The company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018 and projects its pro rata share of dispositions net of any acquisitions to be in the range of  700  900 million  While such efforts are encouraging for the long term  the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term Further  though upbeat consumer confidence and an improving economy have infused optimism into the retail market  mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers  shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds  These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures  Retailers that are not being able to cope with competition are filing for bankruptcies  This has emerged as a pressing concern  as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably Moreover  the rising rate of interest is likely to hurt the REIT s rate sensitive business  It would restrict the company s ability to refinance existing debt while increasing the interest cost on new debt  This has the power to adversely impact the company s financial results and its dividend payout  In addition  amid rising interest rates  the common stock buyers demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock Shares of Kimco have underperformed the  it belongs to in the past three months  During this time frame  shares of the company declined 21 3  compared with the industry s descend of 11  Nevertheless  Kimco s 2020 Vision envisages the ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States as well as a reduction in the joint venture portfolio  Its efforts included the exit from Canada and the exodus from secondary markets  Further  the company is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost its capital structure and enhance its growth profile and tax efficiency  These efforts are expected to drive Kimco s bottom line over the long term However  we expect the net effect to be negative in the near term  Kimco currently holds a Zacks Rank  5  Strong

13401,234916,CBRE,These 5 Stocks Flaunt Attractive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision  A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio   the Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A

13422,234937,CBRE,5 Stocks With Steady Sales Growth To Invest In Right Now,opinion,Steady sales growth holds the key to survival in an ever changing and highly competitive business environment  But when it comes to picking stocks  investors often ignore sales growth as a dependable metric  This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum But it s worth keeping in mind that when companies incur losses  albeit temporarily  they are valued based on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance  Further  a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense control measures while maintaining stable revenues  However  sustainable bottom line growth invariably requires higher revenues Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can be an apt metric for stock valuation  The importance of this metric lies in the fact that management has limited scope to manipulate revenues unlike earnings While sales growth provides investors an understanding of product demand and pricing power  it doesn t reflect whether the company is operating efficiently  A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits So  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy  Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to

Additionally  hike in the interest rate is a concern for Ventas  particularly considering its substantial exposure to long term leased assets  Properties under long term triple net leases generally have fixed rental rates  which are subject to annual escalations  However  many of the company s debt obligations bear floating rates with interest and related payments rates  varying with the movement of LIBOR  bankers  acceptance or other indexes Therefore  any rise in the interest rate is likely to raise the cost of debt  which in turn  is expected to adversely affect the profitability of the company  In addition  rising rates increase the cost of financing acquisitions  investment and development activity costs and also lowers the amount that third parties are ready to pay for the company s assets at disposal Ventas currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   In the past three months  shares of the company have underperformed the   While the stock has declined 20 9   the industry has lost 10 4  during this period  You can see

	Wow  The market dropped more on Monday than it did all of last week and that was a pretty bad week  Without further ado  here are the ugly details  The Dow plunged 4 6  today  or 1175 points   to 24 345 8  The S P slipped 4 1  to 2648 9 and the NASDAQ was off 3 8  to 6967 5  That hurts 

The knee jerk reaction to such a massacre is to freak out  But it s really not too hard to find a silver lining in today s extreme pullback 

 I couldn t be happier   said Kevin Matras in Options Trader   This recent pullback is exactly what the market needed  I know pullbacks can be tough when you re going thru them  But if you believe as strongly as I do that this market is far from over  then every pullback looks like a welcomed sale and not a going out of business sign  

That idea permeated throughout most of the portfolios on Monday  While the market went down  the editors came in to buy  Many had been waiting for a pullback  and the past few days have provided the opportunity to pick up quality companies at prices not seen all year  In the highlights section below  you ll see five portfolios that made 11 buys in total and that s not including the eight swaps in Black Box Trader 

Let s put an end to this day and get right to those moves  But first  here s a few words from Dave 

 I added to both of my services today  scooping up deals early on in the session  Guess what I m doing tomorrow  I m going back to the well to get more  I ll be adding when the market gaps down in the morning because the madness has to stop   he said in Momentum Trader and Surprise Trader 

Today s Portfolio Highlights 

Counterstrike  On Friday  Jeremy stated   No matter what happens  we need to be buyers next week  We finally got our sell off we have patiently waited for   The editor wasted no time on Monday morning  He picked up these four new names 

  Brinker Int l  EAT 
	  CA Inc   NASDAQ CA 
	  IDEXX Labs  IDXX 
	  athenahealth  ATHN 

Each of these stocks are Zacks Rank  1s  Strong Buys  that recently reported strong numbers  EAT  CA and IDXX have plunged despite their results  while ATHN has NOT succumbed to market weakness  Jeremy is taking a smaller 5  position in each of these names because the selloff may not be over and he wants the option to buy more on a dip 

The portfolio also sold ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and DMC Global  BOOM  for profits of 8 8  and 4 5   respectively  The complete commentary has a lot more info on today s moves  And be ready for even more buys in the coming days as this selloff is playing right into the editor s hands by putting companies with strong earnings on sale 

Options Trader  The portfolio added two names on Monday  Firstly  Lithia Motors  LAD  is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in a highly ranked industry with a Zacks VGM Score of  A   Technically  the stock has pulled back to the apex of a bullish ascending triangle pattern  which is a great place for a breakout to occur  It reports on February 14 and has a positive Earnings ESP  Kevin bought to open 3 June 125 00 Calls and sold to open 3 June 130 00 Calls 

The other move today was in Arrow Electronics  ARW   a major distributor of electronic components and computer products to industrial and commercial customers  Like LAD  it too is in a bullish ascending triangle pattern  However  this stock reports tomorrow and has an Earnings ESP of 1 05   Kevin thinks that a positive announcement could set ARW for an enduring breakout  He bought to open only 1 June 82 50 Call  but would add more on a positive performance  Get more specifics about these moves in the full write up 

Surprise Trader   You buy when there s blood in the streets   says Dave  The editor is speaking figuratively of course  In other words  when a strong market pulls back vigorously  it s a great time to put some money to work  On Monday  the portfolio picked up Total Fina  TOT  and Penn National Gaming  PENN  

TOT is an oil and gas production company that has a solid Earnings ESP of 11 32  for the quarter to be reported later this week  This could be a real quick turnaround  PENN reports after the bell on Thursday and has a positive Earnings ESP of 7 9   The company reported a big beat last time and its estimates have been moving up nicely over the past year  Both stocks are Zacks Rank  2s  Buys  and are being added with 12 5  allocations  Read the complete commentary for more 

TAZR Trader  Kevin does not believe this is a double digit correction  but it is deep enough to put some cash to work in front of a possible March April rally  Therefore  the editor added more allocation to his favorite stock  NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   The  monster of all things advanced computing  reports on Thursday  and he thinks it will be strong enough to make  220 a great place to add  Get more specifics on the move in the full write up  along with Kevin s 5 takes on the market right now  And be ready for even more trades soon   

Momentum Trader  The portfolio picked up a couple of stocks during the pullback  Monster Beverage  NASDAQ MNST  and Kirby  KEX   The chart for MNST appears to be setting up one of Dave s favorite continuation patterns  As for KEX  the company recently reported a nice earnings beat and is breaking out from its 52 week high on solid volume  Both stocks are Zacks Rank  2s  Buys  and are being added with 12 5  allocations 

 Black Box Trader  The portfolio is almost completely new this week as eight stocks were swapped out  The positions that left the portfolio were

13450,234965,CBRE,5 Top ROE Picks Amid Federal Government Shutdown,opinion,A deadlock to pass the budget deal in the U S  Senate led to a federal shutdown at midnight on Feb 8 with Senator Rand Paul repeatedly stalling proceedings  This brought into the fore partisan division and continued bickering within both the parties  closing non essential government operations for the second time in less than a month   As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum

13451,234966,CBRE,REITs To Watch For Q4 Earnings On Feb 12  VNO  NNN   More,opinion,"As we are about to enter another eventful week of the current reporting cycle  real estate investment trust  REIT  will be seeing a really busy Monday Admittedly  the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent  However  underlying asset categories and location of properties play a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs Going by numbers  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm   CBRE Group Inc    NYSE CBG     the overall U S  office vacancy rate expanded 10 basis points  bps  to 13 0  during fourth quarter 2017 amid an uptick in supply  Nevertheless  the national office vacancy rate still hovers near its post recession low and vacancy continues to drop in majority of the U S  office markets Also  the holiday season turned out to be blissful for the retailers with upbeat consumer sentiment amid an improving economy  rising income and low unemployment level  Per government data  consumer spending remained solid during this season  with retail sales rising 0 9  and 0 4  in November and December  respectively However  the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic suffered amid a rapid shift in customers  shopping preference through online channels  resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot com bandwagon  These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years  while others unable to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies  Additionally  the turbulent retail real estate market is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions  which mall landlords find unjustified Nevertheless  retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories  but expanding dining options  opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities to boost traffic Therefore  surprises might be in store for some REITs  while others may disappoint this earnings season  However to predict that  we rely on the Zacks methodology  combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold    and a positive   to predict the chances of a beat this quarter  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Per our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  for the stocks Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases Vornado Realty Trust   NYSE VNO   has been actively repositioning its portfolio  In line with this  the company is involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures  along with business spin offs  In July 2017  it completed the spin off of its Washington  DC business  This made Vornado a New York based office and retail REIT  Though such efforts to streamline business are commendable  the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be ignored In January 2018  Vornado announced that its fourth quarter 2017 financial results will include certain items that will have a negative impact of 18 cents on its funds from operations  FFO  per share  However  this amount will be excluded in the adjusted FFO per share figure We predict a fall in the company s total revenues in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at  524 1 million  This reflects a decline of 17 9  from the prior year quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at 93 cents  which also denotes a projected decline of 17 7  year over year At present  Vornado has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and an Earnings ESP of  4 76   This combination of a negative ESP and a Zacks Rank of 4 lowers the chances of a positive surprise for the company   Read more   Moreover  Vornado has a mixed surprise history  Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions and missed in the other two  witnessing an average negative surprise of 4 6   This is depicted in the graph below Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise    National Retail Properties  Inc    NYSE NNN   invests in net leased retail properties throughout the United States  The company is expected to report quarterly numbers around Feb 12 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for National Retail Properties is projected to register 3 2  year over year growth in the fourth quarter to 64 cents  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at nearly  148 8 million  which reflects growth of 5 7  year over year This Zacks Rank  3 stock has an Earnings ESP of  1 73   Therefore  according to our quantitative model  it cannot be conclusively predicted whether National Retail Properties will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter under review  In fact  though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat You can see  The stock has exceeded estimates in three out of the preceding four quarters and met in the other  with an average beat of 2 87   as demonstrated in the chart below 
 National Retail Properties Price and EPS Surprise    Brixmor Property Group   NYSE BRX   is engaged in ownership and operation of high quality  open air shopping centers  The company s assets have a varied mix of highly productive non discretionary and value oriented retailers  as well as consumer oriented service providers The company s FFO per share for the quarter is expected to drop 5 7  year over year to 50 cents  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at nearly  315 2 million  which reflects a decline of 2 7  from the prior year period Currently  Brixmor Property Group has an Earnings ESP of  0 33  and a Zacks Rank  4  So  we can t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat  However  Brixmor Property Group witnessed positive surprises in three out of the trailing four quarters  and met in the other  resulting in an average positive surprise of 2 44   This is depicted in the graph below Brixmor Property Group Inc  Price and EPS Surprise 
    Lodging REIT Sunstone Hotel Investors  Inc    NYSE SHO   has a portfolio of hotels which are mainly in the urban and resort upper upscale segment and usually operated under reputed brands The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at  283 3 million  This reflects a decline of 2 2  as compared with the prior year period  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at 26 cents  which indicates a projected decline of 10 3  year over year At present  Sunstone Hotel Investors has an Earnings ESP of  1 74   Though this is leading and meaningful indicator of a positive surprise  its Zacks Rank  4 lowers the chances of a beat in the to be reported quarter Nevertheless  the stock has exceeded estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 9 4   This is depicted in the graph below Sunstone Hotel Investors  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Note  Anything related to earnings presented in this write up represent funds from operations  FFO    a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2018-02-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reits-to-watch-for-q4-earnings-on-feb-12-vno-nnn--more-200288999,200288999
13457,234972,CBRE,Why It s Wise To Hold Liberty Property  LPT  Stock For Now,opinion,Liberty Property Trust   NYSE LPT   is shifting its focus toward industrial properties due to favorable demand supply conditions  The company plans to fund investments in industrial assets through proceeds from dispositions of office properties  Its premium quality industrial properties  situated at key locations  are likely to drive long term growth by leveraging on the e commerce boom and supply chain strategy transformations However  the near term dilution effect from asset dispositions cannot be bypassed  Moreover  rate hike remains a concern for the company The fundamentals of the industrial market remain solid  backed by growing demand for industrial properties amid manageable supply  which has led to strong rent growth  high occupancy and development opportunities  Therefore  given its premium quality industrial portfolio in upscale locations  pro business environment and continued e commerce demand  Liberty Property is poised to gain  In fact  the company s industrial portfolio  spanning 94 2 million square feet  enjoyed occupancy of 97 0  at the end of fourth quarter 2017  marking an expansion of 70 bps from the prior quarter  Moreover  industrial rents escalated 14 8  on renewal and replacement leases signed during the quarter Further  Liberty Property has been aiming at divesting its non core properties and is using the dry powder for gaining preferred properties across the United States  The company is specifically aiming for growth of its industrial platform and it is financing that through the disposition of office assets  The company particularly plans to dispose of its remaining sub urban office properties in 2018  In numbers  the company expects dispositions of at least  600  800 million in 2018  with the majority being suburban office properties  On the other hand  the company aims to fortify its national industrial platform through acquisitions of  400  600 million of industrial properties in key markets and commence  500  600 million of development projects  These measures are likely to help the company achieve a favorable portfolio mix Early in February  the company reported fourth quarter 2017 funds from operations  FFO  per share of 68 cents  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents  Total operating revenues of around  192 8 million for the quarter also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results reflected a high occupancy level and growth in rents Amid these  shares of Liberty Property outperformed the  it belongs to in the past six months  The company s shares declined 7 1  compared with the industry s decrease of 11  Nonetheless  the company is gradually shifting its focus toward industrial properties due to favorable demand supply conditions  As part of that  the company is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures of office properties  In fact  the company expects dispositions of at least  600  800 million in 2018  with the majority being suburban office properties  While such efforts are a strategic fit for long term growth  the near term dilution impact of such moves on earnings is unavoidable Additionally  the recovery in the industrial market has continued for long and chances of any striking decrease in availability rates are less  Hence  any robust improvement in the performance of Liberty Property is unlikely  Also  supply is likely to increase in the upcoming quarters and somewhat adversely affect the growth tempo of this real estate category Moreover  the rise in interest rate can pose a challenge for Liberty Property  This is because  in case of a hike in interest rates  the company s ability to refinance existing debt would be restricted while the interest cost on new debt would increase  This could adversely affect the company s financial results and consequently dent its dividend payout Liberty Property currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the real estate industry can consider some top ranked stocks like HFF  Inc    NYSE HF    The RMR Group Inc

projected to grow 7 1  in 2018 against the industry s growth of 3 7  Further  the company has made more than 110 mergers and acquisitions since 2005 through 2017  This included five strategic acquisitions in 2017 itself  Moreover  the company is increasingly investing in technology and data capabilities  which is likely to enable JLL to enjoy a competitive advantage over its peers  Such strategic acquisitions are likely to help the company gain strength to capitalize on an improving market environment Steady Capital Deployment  JLL has been consistently raising dividend since 2011 and aiming at enhancing shareholders  value  Concurrent with first quarter 2017 earnings  the company announced a semi annual dividend of 35 cents per share on its common stock  marking a 6  hike over the last payment  Again  during the third quarter earnings release  JLL s board of directors announced a dividend of 37 cents per share  reflecting a 5 7  increase from the previous payout  Subsequently  dividends for 2017 totaled 72 cents  a 13  increase from the year ago figure  Given its financial strength and lower payout ratio  this dividend payment is expected to be sustainable Superior Return on Equity  ROE   JLL s ROE of 13 6  compared with the industry average of 3 9  reflects the company s commendable position over its peers Strong Balance Sheet  JLL s robust balance sheet helps it manage debt level in an efficient way  The company enjoys unsecured revolving credit facility of  2 75 billion  set to mature in Jun 2021  In fact  at the end of the fourth quarter  the company s net debt was  586 2 million  down  426 6 million from the prior quarter end  This reflects a significant improvement in its business performance and working capital management  Armed with a solid balance sheet and healthy debt position  the company remains well poised to continue with its growth momentum Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the real estate industry can also

Further  rising rates are easing margin pressure to an extent  Notably  following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate hike by 25 bps  Wells Fargo raised its prime lending rate from 4 25  to 4 50   While the current crisis related to the revelation of illegally opening millions of illegal accounts last year at the company will take some time to alleviate  the Zacks analyst thinks consistent growth in loans and deposits and expansions will likely support its growth profile

Further  the planned acquisition of Broadsoft will boost company s recurring revenue base  Moreover  the company s collaboration with Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Cloud to offer hybrid cloud solution is a key catalyst  However  intense competition from peers and challenges in the emerging markets remains a headwind

13475,234990,CBRE,5 Best Stocks With Solid Sales Growth To Keep An Eye On,opinion,Sales growth is an important metric for any company  as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making  By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods  one can understand a company s growth trend Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and dismal financial performance  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but can t register enough growth to attract new investors Also  in a growing economy  lack of sales growth shows that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable investment strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow provide the company with more flexibility in relation to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening Based in Bethesda  MD  CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBG   operates as a commercial real estate services and

13484,234999,CBRE,U S  Service Sector Grows For 98th Straight Month  4 Picks ,opinion,The U S  service sector expanded for the 98th consecutive month in March  albeit at a slower rate  supported by growth in new orders and business activity coupled with an increase in employment  Though the report hints at a slight slowdown in the service industry  overall sentiments surrounding it are bullish against the backdrop of solid consumer confidence  strong employment picture and a favorable economic growth Thus investing in stocks from the service sector seems wise to generate strong portfolio returns Service Sector ExpandsPer the Institute for Supply Management  ISM   the non manufacturing index  NMI   which measures the service sector performance  came in at 58 8  in March  missing the consensus of 59 0  by a hair  The same was down from February s reading of 59 5  The non manufacturing sector  however  saw continued growth for the 98th consecutive month and compared favorably with the average level of 57  in 2017  The NMI data which is widely followed to get an idea about economic performance indicated that the broader economy is on track for steady growth this year  Notably  the non manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 90  of the economy  and any reading above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding On the other hand  an NMI reading above 49   over a period of time  points at an expansion of the overall economy  In this regard  the March data reflects the 103rd consecutive month of growth in the broader economy and corresponds to a 3 6  increase in U S  GDP Moreover  the seasonally adjusted IHS Markit U S  Services Purchasing Managers  Index   PMI   recorded a reading of 54 in March compared with 55 9 in February  But the average PMI reading for the first quarter of 2018 was more or less in line with the 2017 rate of expansion  The key findings of the HIS Markit report were that service sector output and new order growth eased  but rates of expansion remained robust overall and an upturn in employment reached a seven month high Strong Performance Across IndustriesStrong performance was witnessed across industries with 15 out of 17 on an expansion mode  The growth in order was witnessed in Mining  Transportation   Warehousing  Agriculture  Forestry  Fishing   Hunting  Retail Trade  Real Estate  Rental   Leasing  Wholesale Trade  Finance   Insurance  Management of Companies   Support Services  Professional  Scientific   Technical Services  Accommodation   Food Services  Public Administration  Construction  Health Care   Social Assistance  Other Services  and Utilities  Only education services and information industries were the outliers Let s take a look at some of the important sub indexes   Business Activity  New Orders  Employment  which are part of the NMI index Business Activity Grows for 104th Consecutive MonthThe business activity index came in at 60 6  in March  down 2 2 percentage points from the February reading of 62 8   This showed an uptick in business activity for the 104th consecutive month  but at a slower rate  Confidence in business activity remained intact as 13 industries reported increased business activity  and only one saw decreased activity  Positive comments from market participants included  business is increasing  and  New Business gained  A cut in the corporate tax rate to 21  from 35  by President Trump must have buoyed business activity New Orders Grew for 86th Consecutive MonthThe index for new orders came in at 59 5  and represented growth for 86th months in a row  Participants made positive comments   new business contracts   and  many new productions are reaching new markets   The same  however  moderated from the February reading of 64 8   which was the highest since August 2005   Notably  the measure of order backlogs climbed to 56 5  from 56  in February Employment UpCompanies jacked up hiring in March as reflected by the non manufacturing employment index of 56 6  which came in higher than the February reading of 55   As many as twelve industries reported an increase in employment while just two saw a pull back  The increase in this measure came as businesses hired more to process increased volumes The Labor Department is expected to release March s employment report on Apr 6  while the estimate is job growth of 175 000  In February 313 000 jobs were added In EssenceEconomists brushed aside the slight decline in the NMI s index  which still remains at near historic recent highs  The ISM nonmanufacturing reading reflects that the economy is performing quite well  with most of the industries witnessing expansion  The services gauge s three month average of 59 4  is the best for a quarter in records dated back to 1997  according to data compiled by Bloomberg A strong employment scenario coupled with solid consumer confidence is acting as a catalyst to services demand  A concern  however  is the ensuing trade war between the two biggest world economies   the United States and China   which might further push up raw material prices  Trump s tariff on aluminum and steel might hurt the manufacturing sector and the effect of this might boil down to the industries directly related to manufacturing such as transportation and warehouse  Also  tariffs imposed by China on the United States on a number of food products might disrupt the agriculture industry However  overall sentiment with regard to the service sector remains robust  We thus pick up some stocks from the Other Services industry  other than warehousing  transportation and agriculture   which should perform well in the coming months 4 Attractive BetsWe have  thus  selected four stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   The search was also narrowed down with a  of A or B  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a

the tax bill  inching closer to a legislative tax overhaul centered on President Trump s electoral promise  With corporate taxes likely to come down from 35  to 20   expectations of higher corporate earnings and dividend payouts are likely to drive stocks  However  the houses need to reconcile to craft a joint bill for it to become a law While Dow scaled a record high on the news  other markets closed relatively lower on tech sector woes  As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that

A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from

13493,235008,CBRE,7 Stocks With Impressive Sales Growth To Keep An Eye On,opinion,Sales growth is an important metric for any company  as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making  It provides an insight into product demand and pricing power  By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods  one can easily understand a company s growth trend Sales growth is important to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and disappointing financial performance  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit but can t rev up enough growth to attract new investors Also  in a growing economy  lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  some sustained sales growth is essential to support the bottom line Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are seven of the 23 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Lincolnshire  IL  Zebra Technologies

13498,235013,CBRE,Top Stock Reports For Cisco  Dominion Energy And Petrobras ,opinion,"Friday  November 17  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Cisco  CSCO   Dominion Energy  D  and Petrobras  PBR   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Cisco s shares have outperformed the Zacks Networking industry on a year to date basis  gaining  18 7  vs   17 2   The company s results have been negatively impacted by weak switching and router revenues  Top line continues to hurt by intense competition from several smaller players and challenges in the emerging markets  
However  acquisitions contributed strongly to top line growth  Management provided positive top line guidance for second quarter fiscal 2018 based on order strength and improving traction of the subscription based model  The Zacks analyst thinks the company s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market presents significant growth opportunity  
Additionally  partnerships with Telenor  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   IBM  NYSE IBM  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  are positive  in our view  The company s recently announced collaboration with Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Cloud to offer hybrid cloud solution is a key catalyst  The planned acquisition of Broadsoft will boost company s recurring revenue base 
 You can   
Shares of Dominion Energy have gained  4 1  over the last three months  outperforming the Zacks Electric Power industry  which has increased 2 9  over the same period  The company reported mixed results in the third quarter  with earnings topping expectations but total revenues lagged the same  Dominion Energy is benefiting from its regulated growth projects and synergies from Questar acquisition  Dominion s Greensville County Power Station and Cove Point Liquefaction project are proceeding on time and budget and are likely to boost the company s performance over the long term  
The company s expansion of electric transmission  natural gas facilities and midstream assets are strong positives  However  Dominion Energy s near term prospects and earnings will be adversely impacted due to lower solar investment tax credit  higher PJM electric capacity expenses and lower earnings from Cove Point due to the roll off of one of its import contracts 
 You can   
Petrobras  shares have outperformed the Zacks Emerging Markets Integrated Oil industry over the last one year  gaining  14 3  vs   9 1   Petrobras is poised to benefit from Brazil s economic growth and huge pre salt oil reserves  The Zacks analyst likes the company s strong pipeline of development projects and impressive exploration successes  
Petrobras  focus on cost improvement measures and divestment of non core assets will help it revive its financial health  However  though the company is making successful efforts to trim its massive debt loads  it still has a leverage of 53  which is cause for concern 
Petrobras ADRs continue to struggle  reflecting lingering issues pertaining to the money laundering scandal that has scarred its credit metrics  Therefore  we take cautious stance on the prospects of the stock

for Marvelous ReturnsInvestors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy This well liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a

13523,235038,CBRE,Solid Sales Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Worth Buying Now,opinion,Sales growth is an important measure for any company  as it is vital to growth projections and strategic decision making  By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods  one can clearly understand a company s growth trend Sales growth is essential to justify the expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and dismal financial performance  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit but cannot generate enough growth to attract new investors Also  in a growing economy  lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  without impressive sales growth  the bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term Further  it s worth keeping in mind that when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as sales growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  This metric s importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales unlike earnings Focusing alone on sales growth is  however  not desirable  Considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Auburn Hills  MI  BorgWarner Inc    NYSE BWA   provides solutions for combustion  hybrid  and electric vehicles  The company has expected sales growth rate of 6 4

NUE   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks That Flaunt Impressive Interest Coverage RatiosYou can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio   the Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the

created on the GARP way of investing is expected to help find stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS   and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is

portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy

 cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X

13549,235064,CBRE,EQR And IRM Q3 Earnings  Here Are The Key Predictions,opinion,We are in the heart of the Q3 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust  REIT  space is buzzing with activity  In fact  there is a deluge of Q3 earnings releases line up for this week  of which Equity Residential   NYSE EQR   and Iron Mountain Incorporated   NYSE IRM   will release quarterly numbers on Oct 24 No doubt  the Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting  which clearly signal a December rate hike  have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent  This is because REITs depend on debt for their business  and pay high and consistent dividend  Thus  a higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows Nevertheless  with improvement in the macroeconomic scenario  at a steady yet sluggish pace  demand for a number of asset categories displayed strength in third quarter 2017  Though supply has been increasing  the pace has been modest in many of the asset categories According to a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP    the U S  apartment market recorded stable rent growth  while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter  However  these growth levels have moderated from the earlier years  For new leases  effective rents inched up 0 9  during the quarter and 2 6  annually  Further  apartment occupancy came in at 95 5  for the third quarter across the nation s top 100 metros Going by numbers  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm  CBRE Group Inc    NYSE CBG    the U S  office vacancy rate declined to 12 9  in the third quarter amid growth in office using jobs  In most of the U S  office markets  vacancy declined  taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post recession low Additionally  data center REITs are experiencing a boom with the growing popularity of cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data as well as the use of third party IT infrastructure by several companies  In fact  demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  Despite enjoying high occupancy  these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Per the latest   overall earnings for the Finance sector  of which REITs are part  are expected to be down 1 5  year over year on 1 1  higher revenues  This represents the Q3 earnings and revenue expectations for the sector as a whole   i e  after combining the reported actual results with the still to come estimates Now  let s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above mentioned two REITs  third quarter results For Chicago  IL based residential real estate investment trust  REIT    Equity Residential  things do not appear to be much favorable  In fact  there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company s markets  This elevated supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to be reported quarter  In addition to this  there is high concession activity amid higher supply  which remains a concern Furthermore  the company has made strategic efforts toward repositioning the portfolio from low barrier to entry non core markets to high barrier to entry core markets  and opted for substantial sale out of its portfolio in recent years Though the assets sale might enable the company to focus exclusively on its core  high density urban markets over the long term  the earnings dilution impact from such a move cannot be bypassed in the near term  These issues are expected to affect the company s net operating income in the quarter to be reported Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at  619 6 million  marking estimated growth of 2 2  year over year For third quarter 2017  Equity Residential projects normalized funds from operations  FFO  per share in the range of 77 81 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at

company s diversified revenue base remains a positive  Moreover  a solid product portfolio and increasing market share are growth catalysts  The company has an aggressive acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth in storage revenues  Also  it has been investing aggressively in order to set up its data center business Still  Iron Mountain s Service revenues remain modest due to declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active  Further  the storage and information management services industry remains a highly fragmented industry with intensifying competition  In addition  the company s highly leveraged balance sheet remains a concern Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at  962 4 million  denoting expected growth of nearly 2 1  year over year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is pegged at 56 cents At present  Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of  1 35   Though the Zacks Rank is favorable  the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat  Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise    You can see  Note  All earnings per share numbers presented in

  NYSE HST   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Forget the Rate Hike  Scoop Up Huge Gains with These REIT StocksWhen a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve  investors in the REIT space are usually skittish because of the sector s dependence on debt and the investment world treating them as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend paying nature  There was no exception this time too and the REIT industry went into red  when the much anticipated rate hike occurred this time However  instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter percentage point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting and brooding too much on the indication of two more hikes later this year  we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018  More good news is a positive revision in projected inflation and a slash in the Fed s forecast for unemployment Such an environment can be far more rewarding for the REITs business  which usually buoys up on a stepped up economy and job scenario  And why not  With one eventually requiring  real space  for economic activities  prospects of the real estate sector get a boost as growth in the economy and job market translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels Particularly  with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms  consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated  And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories  demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high  giving significant impetus to industrial REITs to flourish In fact  in recent years  companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e commerce business  address a large customer base and urbanization  Services like same day delivery are gaining traction  propelling demand for modern distribution facilities  Also  last mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values These have helped the industrial REITs to scale new heights  Per a  by the commercial real estate services firm  CBRE Group Inc   availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7 3  for the U S  industrial market in first quarter 2018  Moreover  with demand surpassing new supply   climbed 1 9  in Q1 to  7 01 per square foot  denoting the highest level since 1989 Lodging Resorts REITs too are in the favorable bunch as an improving economy  growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels  Particularly  improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends  plus strong demand from the leisure division signal brighter prospects for these REITs 4 Stocks to Scoop Big GainsHere we have handpicked four REIT stocks from the above mentioned asset categories that sport a top Zacks Rank

13566,235081,CBRE,5 Top Stocks With Impressive Sales Growth Worth Betting On,opinion,In a bullish market  selecting stocks is not an easy task  One might end up with overpriced and unprofitable stocks So  while choosing stocks  one should employ a meticulous strategy with focus on low risk stocks that usually provide steady returns  Nonetheless  at times  with an aim to book higher returns  investors apply complex investment strategies  which may not lead to the desired returns So  it s advisable to use conventional strategies  based on key fundamentals  to choose stocks  Not only are such strategies safe  they are valuable in bearish markets as well  One such strategy is focus on sales growth Why Sales Growth Persistent growth in sales is the key to the survival of any business  For any company  sales growth not only provides an insight into product demand and pricing power  it is vital for growth projections and strategic decision making But investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric  This could be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is generally sensitive to its earnings momentum However  it should be kept in mind that in case companies incurs a loss  albeit temporarily   these are valued on its revenues  Top line growth  or decline  is generally an indicator of a company s future earnings performance Also  in an improving economy  absence of sales growth indicates that the company s market share is not increasing  Hence  some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line Therefore  Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  The importance of the metric lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings Nevertheless  a huge sales number does not always turn into profits  Hence  it s more sensible to consider a company s cash position along with its sales number  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow provide a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Pawtucket  RI  Hasbro  Inc    NASDAQ HAS   operates as a play and entertainment

market  selecting stocks is not an easy task  One might end up with overpriced and unprofitable stocks So  while choosing stocks  one should employ a meticulous strategy with focus on low risk stocks that usually provide steady returns  Nonetheless  at times  with an aim to book higher returns  investors apply complex investment strategies  which may not lead to the desired returns So  it s advisable to use conventional strategies  based on key fundamentals  to choose stocks  Not only are such strategies safe  they are valuable in bearish markets as well  One such strategy is focus on sales growth Why Sales Growth Persistent growth in sales is the key to the survival of any business  For any company  sales growth not only provides an insight into product demand and pricing power  it is vital for growth projections and strategic decision making But investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric  This could be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is generally sensitive to its earnings momentum However  it should be kept in mind that in case companies incurs a loss  albeit temporarily   these are valued on its revenues  Top line growth  or decline  is generally an indicator of a company s future earnings performance Also  in an improving economy  absence of sales growth indicates that the company s market share is not increasing  Hence  some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line Therefore  Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  The importance of the metric lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings Nevertheless  a huge sales number does not always turn into profits  Hence  it s more sensible to consider a company s cash position along with its sales number  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow provide a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Here are five of the 16 stocks

13570,235085,CBRE,5 Top ROE Stocks To Buy As Markets Snub Geopolitical Threats,opinion,The U S  equity market maintained a steady momentum  rebuffing geopolitical threats related to North Korean missile tests and deadly terrorist attacks in the home soil in Las Vegas  As investors reposed their faith in riskier bets like equities  courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell off in global bond markets   cash cow  stocks that offer higher returns have been sought after However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE

ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS

investors to make some quick gains  This well liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount  Unlike the blend strategy  a portfolio created on the GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth

ratios less than M industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued  These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700

at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects However  one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy  While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks  GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to make the strategy foolproof Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of

13596,235111,CBRE,Holding For Harvey,opinion,"Everybody s thoughts right now are with the people of Houston and the surrounding areas due to Hurricane Harvey  The storm s full impact on the market is unknown at the moment  which could explain why the major indices were mostly flat on Monday  Many investors want to know the extent of the damage before making their next moves    Hurricane Harvey dominated the headlines as thousands were displaced as a result of the devastating flooding happening in the Houston area   said Dave in Momentum Trader   The market seemed to be hungover from the weekend as there was little activity in either direction   The S P inched forward by 0 05  to 2444 2  though the Dow slipped 0 02  to 21808 4  The NASDAQ had the best day with an advance of 0 28  to 6283  
	The market wasn t alone in waiting for Harvey  The portfolios were also quiet when it came to making moves  Black Box Trader swapped out two positions in this week s adjustment and that was about it for activity  However  the highlights section below also includes the latest version of Zacks Confidential and some analysis from Insider Trader and Counterstrike  Today s Portfolio Highlights   Black Box Trader  Two positions were swapped out this week  The portfolio sold Aaron s  AAN  and CBRE Group  NYSE CBG   The new buys that replaced these names are Fiat Chrysler  FCAU  and Guess  GES   Read the Black Box Trader s Guide to learn more about this computer driven service designed to take the emotion out of investing  Zacks Confidential  Don t let the 2015 tumble in Chinese stocks scare you away from some of the best company growth stories around  John Blank believes that your portfolio should have exposure to this thriving economy  and Steve has given him the platform to explain in this week s Zacks Confidential  Learn about the fundamentals of the Chinese economy and get descriptions of six Megacap Internet businesses that you should watch  Now is the Time for Chinese Mega Cap Stocks   Healthcare Innovators  The portfolio really dominated all the other services on Monday with four of the top five movers on the day  But the most impressive aspect was its TWO double digit performers  Juno Therapeutics  JUNO  and Immune Design  IMDZ  fought it out for the top spot with surges of 18 7  and 18 4   respectively  bluebird bio  BLUE  and Sangamo Therapeutics  SGMO  rounded out the top four with advances of 8 6  and 7 5   respectively  Counterstrike   Harvey has obvious economic ramifications  Not only will there be billions of dollars in damages  but Houston is the fourth biggest economic metro area in the country  Energy is the focus  but the Houston port being closed will prevent all types product from going in and out of the area  The port saw over  29 billion in imports and  35 billion of exports from January to June of this year  

 This shutdown of a major economic region will cause a small dent in GDP and will likely effect Houston area companies from making the bottom line expectations  Most of these companies are oil related  Conoco Phillips  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Baker Hughes all being on that list  I expect next earnings season to hear a lot about Harvey on the conference calls   Today was a very low volume day that was a bit confusing  I m surprised that there wasn t more selling due to the potential economic damage in Texas  The positive is that investors might believe that the damage will not be as bad as it looks on T V      Jeremy Mullin Insider Trader   Historically  the last week of August is usually the peak of the  dog days of summer  type of trading  This week  it s exasperated by the tragedy unfolding in Texas and Louisiana with Harvey  All eyes are still on the Gulf and sending assistance there  
	 One thing that may spook the markets this week  however  is the aggressive military maneuvers by North Korea  It fired several missiles over Japan after the close of the US markets today  Futures are already opening lower on the news  It s something to watch tomorrow   Otherwise  the markets shouldn t really do too much this week but  as we ve seen in Augusts in the past  anything can happen      Tracey Ryniec

days as the nation faced one of the worst tropical storms in 50 years   Hurricane Harvey  In addition to catastrophic flooding  the Category 4 storm ravaged properties and caused widespread damage to various industries  As sublime tensions within and outside the country continue to raise an element of caution  investors are on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that will offer high returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is increasing its profits without investing new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 08   A quarter ago  it was expected that this provider of real estate investment management services would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 79  delivering a surprise of 5 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
CBRE  which belongs to the Zacks Real Estate   Operations industry  posted revenues of  6 29 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 90   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 34 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CBRE shares have added about 19 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 5  
What s Next for CBRE 
While CBRE has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CBRE was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

13611,235126,CBRE,Top 5 GARP Stocks To Scoop Up Right Now,opinion,Investors following the growth or value strategy have always been on the lookout for stocks that are poised to see strong growth and available at a discount  Growth at a reasonable price or GARP investing is a strategy that takes care of these criteria However  one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy  While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks  GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock As the GARP strategy employs the principles of both value and growth  returns are more consistent and predictable irrespective of the market condition GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues and earnings per share  EPS  Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that are poised to offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure

The Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  Let s have a look at what s in store for these four REITs set to release quarterly results on Jul 31 NY based Vornado Realty Trust has been aggressively disposing its assets  Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable  the earnings dilutive effects of these moves cannot be bypassed  Also  the company faces intense competition from developers  owners and operators of office properties  and other commercial real estate in its markets  Amid this  Vornado s pricing power and occupancy gains are likely to remain limited   Read more  Vornado has an Earnings ESP of  0 79   However  it currently has a Zacks Rank  5  which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP Over the trailing four quarters  the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  with an average negative surprise of 8 4   This is depicted in the graph below  Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise
    Pasadena  CA based urban office REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities is anticipated to benefit in the to be reported quarter from its assets in high barriers to entry and exit markets  with limited supply of available space

Alexandria Real Estate Equities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   U S  based Brixmor Property Group Inc  is anticipated to benefit from strong demand in the transaction market for grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers  Although the company increased its disposal activities  exiting various markets  the earnings dilutive impact of such exits cannot be ignored Currently  Brixmor Property Group has an Earnings ESP of 1 96  and a Zacks Rank  4  So  we can t conclusively predict an earnings beat  Brixmor Property Group witnessed positive surprises in all of the trailing four quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 1 46   This is depicted in the graph below Brixmor Property Group Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

13621,235136,CBRE,REIT Stocks  Q2 Earnings Queued For Jul 28  HCN  VTR   IRM,opinion,We are in the heart of the ongoing reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust  REIT  space is buzzing with activity  In fact  there have been a deluge of Q2 earnings releases this week  and next we have Welltower Inc    NYSE HCN    Ventas  Inc    NYSE VTR   and Iron Mountain Incorporated   NYSE IRM   releasing quarterly numbers on Jul 28 Admittedly  rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year  However  with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs  not all players in the space have equally excelled or fallen behind In fact  a number of asset categories displayed strength in second quarter 2017  with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery  Going by numbers  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm   CBRE Group Inc    NYSE CBG     the overall U S  industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter  with the industrial availability rate contracting 10 basis points to 7 8  In addition  the U S  office vacancy rate  at 13  in the second quarter amid a balanced demand supply environment  Moreover  growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data are not only helping tech companies  these are also driving demand for data center REITs  Additionally  defying concerns about supply in the market  the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand levels However  dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks  Also  for healthcare REITs  rising supply of senior housing units is expected to have put a pressure on pricing in some markets Therefore  surprises might be in store for some REITs  while others may disappoint this earnings season  However to predict that  we rely on the Zacks methodology  combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold    and a positive   to predict the chances of a beat this quarter  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Per our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  for the stocks Let s have a look at what s in store for the three REITs set to release quarterly results on Friday Toledo  OH based  Welltower s efforts to enhance its healthcare real estate portfolio quality through prudent asset allocation and disposal  along with its diversified portfolio  are anticipated to boost its performance in the quarter to be reported  Additionally  rising senior citizen population will likely prove conducive to growth However  interest rate hike remains a concern for Welltower due to its high exposure to long term leased assets  In addition  increased deliveries in certain markets are likely to adversely affect the company s pricing power and occupancy  Further  intense competition from national and local healthcare operators curtails the company s power to significantly improve its top line and ink deals at attractive rates   Read more   Welltower has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   However  it currently has a Zacks Rank  4  which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP Over the trailing four quarters  Welltower posted in line funds from operations   FFO   per share in one occasion and beat estimates in the other three  recording an average positive surprise of 0 9   The graph below depicts this surprise history Welltower Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Note  All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations   FFO   per share Chicago  IL based healthcare REIT Ventas is anticipated to benefit in the to be reported quarter from its diversification efforts  increasing healthcare spending and aging population  Furthermore  its strong balance sheet positions it well for growth  Moreover  university based life science real estate is a new zone of investment that has grabbed attention and Ventas has  by now  already committed nearly  2 billion to this segment However  hike in interest rate is a concern for Ventas  as the company has considerable exposure to long term leased assets  Additionally  rising supply of senior housing units is expected to have a pressure on

13627,235142,CBRE,5 ROE Stocks To Profit As Trade Talks Enter Decisive Phase,opinion,The U S  equity market continued its uptrend for the bulk of the past week as bilateral trade talks between the United States and China entered a decisive phase and inched closer to a landmark deal  With both sides showing efforts to resolve the trade differences and seeking to ink a formal agreement at a summit between the state heads later this month  the stock market euphoria is likely to continue in the near future As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength    Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1

13628,235143,CBRE,S P Below 2800 Again After Monday Selloff,opinion,"This more than two month rally combined with a slow trade deal process really weighed on the market to start this week  The major indices all lost ground on Monday  but came well off the lows by the closing bell 
	Unfortunately  they were also well off the highs  Stocks started the session solidly in the green  before soft construction spending data for December provided an excuse to sell off 
	The Dow jumped approximately 130 points this morning  and then dived to a loss of about 400 points  It managed to halve that deficit by the close but still declined 0 79   or about 206 points  to 25 819 65 
	The S P s trip above 2800 was short lived  The index reclaimed that mark on Friday for the first time since November  but today it slipped 0 39  to 2792 81  The FAANGs had a pretty solid session despite the negativity  helping the NASDAQ to the best performance of the day with a loss of only 0 23  to 7577 57 
	Lower than expected construction spending of 0 6  in December  delayed due to the shutdown  feeds into concerns of slowing economic growth  But the swiftness of today s selloff suggests that investors were just looking for a reason to take some money off the table after such a long run up 
	Meanwhile  the trade headlines continue to be positive  In fact  reports say a deal is in the final stages  and could be signed later this month at a meeting between President Trump and President Xi of China 
	It can t come soon enough for the market  We ve been at the mercy of trade headlines for too long now  Many investors believe that today s pullback suggests a deal is completely baked into the market and could result in a  sell the news  reaction  Maybe  But the most important thing is that we put this issue into the rear view mirror 
	Today s Portfolio Highlights  Marijuana Innovators  We ve talked about it enough  and now it s time for the inaugural picks of this new service  The following recommendations haven t been picked just because they have some connection with the burgeoning marijuana space  Editor Dave Borun is also making sure that these are solid companies with big potential for growth  especially when the U S  joins its northern neighbor in official legalization  The first three positions are 
	  GW Pharmaceuticals  GWPH   This company is a  clear market leader in the industry  as it was the first to receive FDA approval for a prescription drug made from CBD  Cannabidiol  
	  Canopy Growth Corporation  CGC   In addition to medical uses  this company supplies cannabis for recreational use at home  CGC also received a big investment from beverage giant Constellation Brands  NYSE STZ  
	  Molson Coors  TAP   The world s 7th largest brewer has plans to develop non alcoholic cannabis infused adult beverages  As with CGC  this company can t wait for the U S  to officially legalize marijuana 
	Dave plans to add SEVEN more names tomorrow as he works to get the portfolio up to his target complement of 10 to 15 positions  Read the complete commentary for a lot more about these inaugural buys and the editor s plans for the portfolio 
	Technology Innovators  5G is basically right around the corner  Clearfield  CLFD  is a fiber optic play that wants to make sure there s enough bandwidth for the new technology  Brian Bolan likes its recent history of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  which includes a positive surprise of more than 96  over the past four quarters  When 5G really picks up  the editor expects CLFD to be along for the ride  He added the stock on Monday and expects at least one more buy later this week  Read the full write up for more  Black Box Trader  It s almost a whole new portfolio after this week s adjustment swapped out 9 names  The stocks that were sold today include

Stocks to Buy for Stellar ReturnsIf you re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing  try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive prospects However  one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy  While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks  GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorableZacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than M industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued  These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only eight Here are four stocks that made it through the screen Pasadena  CA based East West Bancorp Inc   NASDAQ      is the holding company for East West Bank  East West Capital Trust I

13666,235181,CBRE,REITs To Watch For Q1 Earnings On May 5  HCN  SNH  DRH,opinion,The current reporting cycle is drawing to a close but results are still pouring in from the real estate investment trust  REIT  industry  On May 5  Welltower Inc    NYSE HCN    Senior Housing Properties Trust   NASDAQ SNH   and DiamondRock Hospitality Company   NYSE DRH   are slated to release their quarterly figures In the broader market  results from over 350 S P 500 members that are already out reveal a substantial improvement from the recent past quarters  These companies have not only managed to show improvement in earnings and revenues  but have also mostly surpassed expectations  specifically  revenue estimates   Read more   However  the performance of the REIT sector has so far been mixed  Obviously  the rate hike issue was a dominant factor in the first quarter  but underlying asset category dynamics and location of properties played a key role in the operating performance of REITs  While some markets like industrial real estate  data center and office revealed strength  retail and residential markets had their issues In fact  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm   CBRE Group Inc    NYSE CBG     the overall U S  industrial real estate market remained upbeat in first quarter 2017  with an essentially unchanged national availability rate despite increased supply On the other hand  the overall office vacancy rate moved up a modest 10 basis points to 13 0  in the first quarter amid increased supply  according to a  from CBRE  In fact  despite an overall increase  in almost half of the office markets  vacancy level continued to fall and the national office vacancy rate remained close to its post recession low  Also  growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data are not only helping tech companies  these are also driving demand for data center REITs However  things are not so pretty on the other side  An increasing number of deliveries of new units in a number of key markets and elevated concession activity have raised concerns over some residential REIT stocks  while dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks Therefore  not all players in the REIT space are equally poised to excel this time around  To predict that  we rely on the Zacks methodology  combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Per our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  for the stocks We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Let s have a look at what s in store for the three REITs set to release their first quarter results on Friday Toledo  OH based healthcare REIT Welltower s efficiency in improving its healthcare real estate portfolio quality  along with lower leverage  is expected to serve as a growth driver for the company in the to be reported quarter However  it has an Earnings ESP of  0 96  and a Zacks Rank  4  Though a positive ESP is a significant indicator for an earnings beat  we also need to have a favorable Zacks Rank to be reasonably confident of a positive surprise Notably  increasing senior housing supply is likely to limit occupancy growth and taper pricing power  Also  expenses are anticipated to remain elevated in the quarter  As such  growth in net operating income is likely to remain limited  Moreover  as part of its portfolio repositioning efforts  the company is aggressively disposing its assets  Though such efforts are commendable  the earnings dilutive effects of these moves cannot be ignored   Read more   However  over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed estimates on all occasions  with an average beat of 1 12   This is depicted in the graph below Welltower Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Senior Housing Properties Trust is a Newton  MA based healthcare REIT that invests in senior living communities  office buildings leased to medical providers  medical related businesses  clinics  and biotech laboratory tenants  along with wellness centers Though it has a favorable Zacks Rank  3  its Earnings ESP of  2 13  makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see  Senior Housing Properties Trust has a mixed surprise history over the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 0 51   While it exceeded estimates on two occasions  it met in another and missed in the other Senior Housing Properties Trust Price and EPS Surprise    DiamondRock Hospitality Company is a Bethesda  MD based hotel REIT which owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts comprising more than 9 600 rooms in aggregate  These are concentrated in key gateway cities and destination resorts throughout North America and the U S  Virgin Islands However  it has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  Therefore  our proven model does not conclusively show that DiamondRock Hospitality will beat on earnings this season because it lacks the right combination required for an earnings beat prediction Nevertheless  DiamondRock Hospitality exceeded estimates in three quarters and missed in the other  resulting in an average positive surprise of 5 48  for the trailing four quarters  This is depicted in the chart below Diamondrock Hospitality Company Price and EPS Surprise    Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to

13667,235182,CBRE,CBRE Group  Should Value Investors Consider CBG Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CBRE Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 24  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 97  If we focus on the long term PE trend  CBRE Group s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17 76 over the past five years  Moreover  the current multiple stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a solid entry point However  the stock s PE is pegged slightly above the Zacks classified Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 68  This indicates that the stock is slightly overvalued right now  compared to its peers  Nevertheless  we should also point out that CBRE Group s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  CBRE Group has a P S ratio of about 2 0 93  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 19 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CBG is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CBRE Group currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CBRE Group a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for CBRE Group is just 1 21  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 35  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 51  which is far better than the industry average of 12 39  Clearly  CBG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though CBRE Group might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives CBG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 3 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CBRE Group  Inc  Price and Consensus    Owing to these bearish trends  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates that we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCBRE Group is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 35  out of over 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks categorized Real Estate Operations industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The

	The Dow slipped 0 10   or about 27 points  to 26 384 77  while the NASDAQ was down by the exact same percentage to 7976 01

13688,235203,CBRE,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why CBRE  CBRE  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this provider of real estate investment management services a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for CBRE is 16 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for CBRE is 20 1   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 14 6  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for CBRE have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
CBRE has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that CBRE is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-a-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-cbre-cbre-is-a-solid-choice-200412848,200412848
13689,235204,CBRE,CBRE Group  CBRE  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CBRE Group  NYSE CBRE  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of real estate investment management services is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 10 billion  up 9 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 84  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CBRE 
For CBRE  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that CBRE will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CBRE would post earnings of  1 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 21  delivering a surprise of  7 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

	Chicago  IL   April 11  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Foot Locker  NYSE FL   Inc   NYSE         Principal Financial Group  Inc   NYSE         CBRE Group  NYSE CBG   Inc   NYSE         TransUnion  NYSE        and Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   Inc   NASDAQ        

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Solid Sales Growth Make These 5 Stocks Solid Picks 

	Robust sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the market  The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive edge  as strong sales usually translate to improved profitability 

	While assessing business growth  revenues are often more monitored than earnings  This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base 

	Stable or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors 

	Without impressive revenue growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over a longer term  While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs  continuous bottom line improvement usually requires robust sales growth 

	Nonetheless  sales growth alone doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits 

	Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable investment strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Also  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction 

Selecting the Winning Stocks

	In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters 

	But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy 

Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales 

  Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry   Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price 

Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company 

Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

	Here are five of the seven stocks that qualified the screening 

Foot Locker  Inc    NYSE        based in New York  operates as an athletic shoes and apparel retailer  It has long term expected earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of 9 71   The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 

Principal Financial Group  Inc   NYSE       provides retirement  asset management  and insurance products and services  This Des Moines  IA based company currently has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 8 71  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see   

	Headquartered in Los Angeles  CA  CBRE Group  Inc   NYSE        operates as a commercial real estate services and investment company  The company currently has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 12 5  and a Zacks Rank  2 

TransUnion   NYSE        based in Chicago  IL  provides risk and information solutions  The company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 12 77  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 

Activision Blizzard  Inc    NASDAQ       develops and publishes games for video game consoles  personal computers  mobile devices  and online social platforms  This Santa Monica  CA based company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 16 19  and carries a Zacks Rank  2

Moreover  the real estate market fundamentals reveal stability and continued strength  So  with the majority of REITs lined up to report Q3 financial results  the time is apt to size up industry fundamentals and recall past quarter performances to figure out their chances of a beat this time around

Study Reveals Stability and Strength in Fundamentals

In fact  according to a  by the commercial real estate services  firm CBRE Group Inc  NYSE CBG    the industrial property market continued its longest stretch of recovery  with Q3 representing the 26th straight quarter of declining availability  Availability contracted 20 basis points  bps  sequentially to 8 4  in the third quarter as economic expansion  an e commerce boom  supply chain consolidation and heightened urbanization have led to a rising demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks 

Also  the national vacancy rate in the U S   remained at the lowest level since 2008  with a 30 bps decline over the past year to 13 1  and suburbs outperforming the downtown markets 

Further  though the national apartment market has been experiencing moderation over the past few quarters  per an   amid the new supply in the high rent metros  the market has been still performing above the long term average  Also  market fundamentals have remained steady in the mid range markets  Additionally  the student housing market recorded solid rent growth in the fall 2016 leasing session  according to another recent Axiometrics  

Retail availability rate also tightened in many of the U S  markets in the third quarter  according to a CBRE Group   Nationally  average availability came in at 10 4  in the quarter under review  denoting a decrease of 20 bps sequentially and 50 bps from a year ago 

Amid limited supply  demand for retail spaces have continued to rise  with retailers combining online and bricks and mortar operations and retail landlords transforming their boring shopping hubs into entertainment zones  This is because even though online retailing has gathered momentum  customers still prefer spending time in retail centers for shopping  together with dining and entertaining activities

13745,235260,CBRE,REIT Investing Pitfalls  Fed Uncertainty And Latent Weakness,opinion,"While the overall outlook for the space remains favorable  a number of issues remain  The biggest headwind undoubtedly is the Fed uncertainty  with many in the market now expecting the central bank to announce the next rate hike at the December meeting  The modest upturn in long term treasury yields in recent days is a reflection of this development  which is not favorable for rate sensitive sectors like REITs  utilities and telecoms are some of the other spaces  
In addition to the interest rates issue  REITs  performance can be dulled by the weakness in the underlying asset categories  In fact  if close heed is not paid to all the weakness before investing in REIT stocks  one can end up incurring big losses 
Fundamental WeaknessOf late  things turned worse for residential REITs as increased supply in many of the markets sounded alarms  In fact  markets with high rents like San Francisco  New York and San Jose have been much affected and the high end and luxury apartment categories have been flooded with new supply  Usually  higher supply curtails landlords  ability to demand higher rents and leads to lesser absorption  Also  job losses in the energy sector are weighing on the Houston market 
Reflecting such weaknesses  in Q3  the average effective rent nationwide grew 3  year over year  per an   This not only marked a decrease from the solid 5 2  rent growth experienced one year ago  but also denoted the fourth straight quarter in which the annual rent growth rate declined  Also  there seems to be no respite from the situation anytime soon and the moderation is anticipated to continue next year with a whole lot of new construction slated to be delivered 
Further  though upbeat consumer confidence and an improving economy have infused optimism into the retail market  mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers  shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds  These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures 
Also  retailers that are not being able to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies  This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs  as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably 
In the self storage industry  rising supply in some of the markets is affecting revenue growth  On the other hand  per a CBRE Group Inc  NYSE CBG    CBG  study  the  is on its lengthiest stretch of recovery  with availability rates declining for the 25th straight quarter to 8 8  in Q2  the lowest since mid 2001  So  chances of any striking decline in availability rates are less  Also  a whole lot of new construction is expected over the next two years  which can put a pause on growth next year 
When Rates Finally Move UpREITs have breathed a sigh relief with the Fed deciding to keep the rate unchanged in its last meeting  However  the eventual rise in interest rates will no doubt be a burden on debt dependent REITs  Moreover  the dividend payout itself might turn out less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts 
Also  this could impact healthcare REITs  This is because these REITs usually have significant exposure to long term leased assets which carry fixed rental rates that are subject to annual bumps  Therefore  as rate goes up  the cost of borrowing will increase but their revenue flows will not get adjusted quickly for their fixed rate nature  leading to an adverse impact on profitability 
Further  volatility in rates can further cast a pall on mortgage REITs or mREITs  which offer real estate financing through the purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage backed securities  These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on the mortgage assets and their funding costs  Though these types of REITs have started adjusting their strategies and business models  they bear long term risk as interest rates will eventually rise

13758,235273,CBRE,Build Up To REIT Q2 Earnings  4 Stocks Likely To Beat ,opinion,"Declining Treasury yields and Brexit issues have already raised hopes for an extended period of low interest rate  making real estate investment trusts  REITs  preferred choices for their high dividend yields  And now their fundamentals too reveal stability and continued strength  further justifying their addition to your portfolio 

In fact  with the majority of REITs still to report in Q2  the time is apt to size up the industry fundamentals and the past quarter performance to figure their chances of beating earnings expectations  Because usually an earnings beat raises investors  confidence in a stock  leading to rapid price appreciation and ensuring more gains from one s investments 
Study Reveals Stability and Strength in Fundamentals

Per a CBRE Group Inc   NYSE CBG  study  the  is on its lengthiest stretch of recovery  with availability rates declining for the 25th straight quarter to 8 8  in Q2  the lowest since mid 2001  This is because rapid growth of e commerce has raised demand for warehouse and distribution facilities for handling services like same day delivery as well as reverse logistics  In fact  demand is outpacing supply and this is driving growth in rents 

Moreover  amid reviving retail sales   declined to the lowest level since 2008  In the second quarter  retail availability averaged 10 9   down 10 basis points  bps  sequentially and 30 bps from a year ago  Encouragingly  in two third of the U S  markets  retail availability tightened and this trend is expected to continue backed by the solid job market report for June and strong momentum in retail spending 

Further  vacancy rate in the  too witnessed a decline of 10 bps to 13 0  in the quarter  In fact  with a 40 bp decline over the past year  the national office vacancy rate is at the lowest level since 2008  Though global economic uncertainty has delayed decisions on new space for a number of tenants  this recovery suggests that supply has been limited     

And finally  in the residential real estate sector  though delivery of new supply has moderated the annual effective rent growth in recent quarters  demand for apartment units stepped up in Q2 with new graduates entering the work force and looking for a place to live in  Also  renter families are seeking settlement well ahead of the upcoming school year 

As such  the early end of quarter apartment numbers from  revealed that rent growth was substantially stronger in Q2 with quarterly effective rent growth coming in at 2 3  in the second quarter against 0 5  in the first 
How to Select the Best Stocks 

However  despite the above mentioned sub sectors revealing strength  not every stock belonging to these categories are poised to benefit  In fact  choosing the right stocks could be quite difficult unless one knows the right method 

To make the task simple we rely on the Zacks methodology  combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive  

Our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP  shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  And research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  

Here are four REIT stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release their second quarter results 
CoreSite Realty Corporation    has a Zacks Rank  1 and an Earnings ESP of  1 18   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 85 cents per share  Over the past four quarters  the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3 80  

Denver  CO based CoreSite Realty is a data center REIT that provides data center products and interconnection services

Chicago  IL   October 10  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the REITs  part 3  including CBRE Group Inc  NYSE CBG    NYSE     Five Oaks Investment Corp   NYSE     GEO Group  Inc   NYSE     Public Storage  NYSE PSA   NYSE    and Select Income REIT  NASDAQ     

Industry  REITs  part 3

Link  

While the overall outlook for the space remains favorable  a number of issues remain  The biggest headwind undoubtedly is the Fed uncertainty  with many in the market now expecting the central bank to announce the next rate hike at the December meeting  The modest upturn in long term treasury yields in recent days is a reflection of this development  which is not favorable for rate sensitive sectors like REITs  utilities and telecoms are some of the other spaces  

In addition to the interest rates issue  REITs  performance can be dulled by the weakness in the underlying asset categories  In fact  if close heed is not paid to all the weakness before investing in REIT stocks  one can end up incurring big losses 

Fundamental Weakness  
	Of late  things turned worse for residential REITs as increased supply in many of the markets sounded alarms  In fact  markets with high rents like San Francisco  New York and San Jose have been much affected and the high end and luxury apartment categories have been flooded with new supply  Usually  higher supply curtails landlords  ability to demand higher rents and leads to lesser absorption  Also  job losses in the energy sector are weighing on the Houston market 

Reflecting such weaknesses  in Q3  the average effective rent nationwide grew 3  year over year  per an   This not only marked a decrease from the solid 5 2  rent growth experienced one year ago  but also denoted the fourth straight quarter in which the annual rent growth rate declined  Also  there seems to be no respite from the situation anytime soon and the moderation is anticipated to continue next year with a whole lot of new construction slated to be delivered 

Further  though upbeat consumer confidence and an improving economy have infused optimism into the retail market  mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers  shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds  These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures 

Also  retailers that are not being able to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies  This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs  as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably 

In the self storage industry  rising supply in some of the markets is affecting revenue growth  On the other hand  per a CBRE Group Inc   NYSE     study  the  is on its lengthiest stretch of recovery  with availability rates declining for the 25th straight quarter to 8 8  in Q2  the lowest since mid 2001  So  chances of any striking decline in availability rates are less  Also  a whole lot of new construction is expected over the next two years  which can put a pause on growth next year 

When Rates Finally Move Up
	REITs have breathed a sigh relief with the Fed deciding to keep the rate unchanged in its last meeting  However  the eventual rise in interest rates will no doubt be a burden on debt dependent REITs  Moreover  the dividend payout itself might turn out less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts 

Also  this could impact healthcare REITs  This is because these REITs usually have significant exposure to long term leased assets which carry fixed rental rates that are subject to annual bumps  Therefore  as rate goes up  the cost of borrowing will increase but their revenue flows will not get adjusted quickly for their fixed rate nature  leading to an adverse impact on profitability 

Further  volatility in rates can further cast a pall on mortgage REITs or mREITs  which offer real estate financing through the purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage backed securities  These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on the mortgage assets and their funding costs  Though these types of REITs have started adjusting their strategies and business models  they bear long term risk as interest rates will eventually rise 

Bottom Line  
	Therefore  before calling the shots for investments  investors should satisfy themselves by dispassionately absorbing both sides of the argument and then call the shots

13785,235300,CBRE,Why REITs Are Preferred Investments Right Now,opinion,"Proving their mettle  REITs are again performing better than the other stocks  thus providing strategic additions to one s portfolio  Also  their decent show in first quarter earnings season signals that opportunities are widely present in this industry to fetch good returns 
No doubt a low rate environment and low Treasury yields will be catalysts in the short term  but for the long term  one should look forward to an added boost from solid fundamentals in several asset categories that REITs own and operate 
Industrial REIT
According to a study by the commercial real estate services  firm CBRE Group Inc   NYSE CBG   the industrial market continued its longest stretch of recovery with the 24th straight quarter of declining availability  Notably  availability fell 20 basis points  bps  sequentially to 9 2  in the first quarter while rents continued to climb 
Amid an e commerce boom and heightened urbanization  retailers are shifting their strategy toward services like same day delivery and other such options  propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities  And with a larger customer base  companies are opting for supply chain consolidation  resulting in greater demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks  thereby creating scope for industrial REITs 
Office REIT
For the office market  despite the 10 basis points  bps  increase in national vacancy to 13 2  in Q1  the level is still the lowest since 2008  In fact  tiding over the hiccups in the job market recently and a modest supply rise  the office market is expected to grow at a moderate pace for the rest of the year 
Data Center REITsWith growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increased number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  These REITs pulled in their capital and scored well on the return book  producing  in May 
Retail REIT
Also  per the CBRE Group study  U S  neighborhood  community and strip retail centers showed continued recovery in Q1 with a 10 bps sequential decline in average availability rate to 11 2   Despite lackluster retails sales in the first quarter  the absence of ample supply helped the retail real estate market to address the slump  Moreover  a strong  raises our hopes for a better tally in Q2 
Further  amid rising competition from online retailers  retail REITs are emphasizing omni channel retailing  They are transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones and distribution centers as well as embracing the latest technologies to offer attractive services to tenants and mall visitors  Eventually  these will only help increase traffic 
Also  small shop portfolio expansion is a priority for Kimco Realty Corporation  NYSE KIM   KIM  as such shops comprise service based industries such as saloons and spas  personal fitness  and medical practices which enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant 
Self Storage REIT
Self storage industry fundamentals are also strong as a result of limited new supply amid capital constraints and increased barriers to entry  And demand remains solid on the back of favorable demographic changes and events like marriages  shifting  death and even divorce  That should give ample opportunities of growth to self storage REITs 
Health Care REIT  NYSE HCN 
Finally  rate issues might have a short term adverse impact on health care REITs for their long term leased assets  exposure  But an increase in the elderly population and the consequent proliferation of health care expenses along with a rise in new insured individuals with health care reforms are driving demand for several types of health care 
Particularly  medical office buildings  MOBs  are opening up solid scope for growth  Consolidation among physician groups  hospitals and increasing transfer of hospital services to outpatient facilities are driving growth in this category

Chicago  IL   June 16  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the REITs  part 2  including Summit Hotel Properties  Inc      W  P  Carey Inc      Retail Opportunity Investments Corp      Urban Edge Properties    and Equity LifeStyle Properties  Inc      

Industry  REITs  part 2

Link  

Proving their mettle  REITs are again performing better than the other stocks  thus providing strategic additions to one s portfolio  Also  their decent show in first quarter earnings season signals that opportunities are widely present in this industry to fetch good returns 

No doubt a low rate environment and low Treasury yields will be catalysts in the short term  but for the long term  one should look forward to an added boost from solid fundamentals in several asset categories that REITs own and operate 

Industrial REIT

According to a study by the commercial real estate services  firm CBRE Group Inc   NYSE CBG   the industrial market continued its longest stretch of recovery with the 24th straight quarter of declining availability  Notably  availability fell 20 basis points  bps  sequentially to 9 2  in the first quarter while rents continued to climb 

Amid an e commerce boom and heightened urbanization  retailers are shifting their strategy toward services like same day delivery and other such options  propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities  And with a larger customer base  companies are opting for supply chain consolidation  resulting in greater demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks  thereby creating scope for industrial REITs 

Office REIT

For the office market  despite the 10 basis points  bps  increase in national vacancy to 13 2  in Q1  the level is still the lowest since 2008  In fact  tiding over the hiccups in the job market recently and a modest supply rise  the office market is expected to grow at a moderate pace for the rest of the year 

Data Center REITs
	With growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increased number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  These REITs pulled in their capital and scored well on the return book  producing  in May 

Retail REIT

Also  per the CBRE Group study  U S  neighborhood  community and strip retail centers showed continued recovery in Q1 with a 10 bps sequential decline in average availability rate to 11 2   Despite lackluster retails sales in the first quarter  the absence of ample supply helped the retail real estate market to address the slump  Moreover  a strong  raises our hopes for a better tally in Q2 

Further  amid rising competition from online retailers  retail REITs are emphasizing omni channel retailing  They are transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones and distribution centers as well as embracing the latest technologies to offer attractive services to tenants and mall visitors  Eventually  these will only help increase traffic 

Self Storage REIT

Self storage industry fundamentals are also strong as a result of limited new supply amid capital constraints and increased barriers to entry  And demand remains solid on the back of favorable demographic changes and events like marriages  shifting  death and even divorce  That should give ample opportunities of growth to self storage REITs 

Health Care REIT  NYSE HCN 

Finally  rate issues might have a short term adverse impact on health care REITs for their long term leased assets  exposure  But an increase in the elderly population and the consequent proliferation of health care expenses along with a rise in new insured individuals with health care reforms are driving demand for several types of health care 

Particularly  medical office buildings  MOBs  are opening up solid scope for growth  Consolidation among physician groups  hospitals and increasing transfer of hospital services to outpatient facilities are driving growth in this category

13790,235305,CBRE,China s Slowing Economy Driving U S  Real Estate  How to Profit,opinion,"Money is coming out from under mattresses in China and seeking safe havens
The US and Europe are the primary beneficiaries
With a long agrarian tradition  Chinese investors are most comfortable with real estate
Is there a U S  stock play here  In a word  REITs

China has many problems  a number of which are structural  not transitory  These are not merely growing pains  though they at one time could have gone in that direction 
After Mao s death  new leader Deng Xiaoping recognized that the country was failing under its communist economic system  His visits to Thailand  Malaysia and  in particular  Singapore  where he met with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew  the capitalist architect of Singapore s resurgence  convinced him that drastic change was needed 
Impressed with Singapore s economic development  respect for the environment and quality housing  he sent tens of thousands of Chinese to Singapore to learn from their experience  Lee advised Deng to stop exporting bankrupt communist ideologies to Southeast Asia  advice which Deng chose to follow 
However  after Deng s 14 years of leadership  during which China opened itself to the world  followed a path of living with its neighbors  and lifting itself from the poverty and destruction of communism  everything changed  Deng s final years were weakened by his association with Tiananmen Square in 1989 and upon his resignation  the ensuing power struggles resumed among the elites who had lived so well under the old totalitarian system 
These struggles continue behind the scenes today  China is still  on paper  a socialist nation  the Chinese press still refers to it as socialist communist but is increasingly dropping the latter term  but like so many other  people s republics   it is divorced from the needs of most of its people and fails to enjoy any republican principles  It has become  instead  just another autocracy  founded upon oligarchic striving for individual power and individual wealth 
What does this have to do with investing in US real estate and real estate securities  During the transitions from communism  hundreds of thousands of well placed insiders and Communist Party members were handed significant shares of state owned companies  often based solely upon their position of power or loyalty to a winning faction  Along the way  as the Chinese stock markets sizzled  they were able to sell their shares to less sophisticated investors who believed stocks would only rise forever  Of course  as easily as all this wealth was granted  it can just as quickly be clawed back as today s much publicized seizures of wealth for either real or trumped up transgressions makes readily apparent 
This minority  which possess such assets  realize the party may be coming to an end and are looking for a safe haven for their money  They are increasingly sending it to Europe and the Americas  with the lion s share of the latter coming to the USA and Canada 
The figures below  from US based global real estate giant CBRE Group  NYSE CBG   do not include any outbound Asian investments into other nations  stocks or bonds  It is a look solely at Asian  mostly Chinese  investment in office  industrial  hotel and residential properties  expressed in US dollar values 

A total of  62 4 billion left Asia for other safer destinations in 2015  As you can see  the bulk of that all but  13 5 billion came from China  Singapore and Hong Kong  with the latter two often way points along the path from China to other destinations  Where did the total amount go   14 3 billion was sent within  and staying in  other Asian nations   8 3 billion went to Pacific nations  almost all of it to Australia and New Zealand   17 6 billion found its way to Europe and  22 4 billion came to  the Americas  
Does it seem odd that so much cash would go into real estate rather than the far more liquid stock and bond markets  It shouldn t  The markets might provide a greater return but  for a nation that was primarily agrarian  as China was during the youth of most of those with money to sequester today  the land is the land  Think Tara   The last moments of  Gone With the Wind  find Scarlett O Hara hearing her father Gerald say   Land s the only thing that matters  it s the only thing that lasts   as well as Rhett Butler s voice from happier times   It s from this you get your strength  the red earth of Tara    Land is solid  Land lasts  And Will Rogers  dictum from 1930  usually shortened and misquoted as  Put your money in land  because they aren t making any more of it  still makes sense today 
The Chinese are listening  And investing  The more China s leadership makes a show of clamping down on bribery  nepotism  and ill gotten gains  the more money will stealthily flow out of China  The country s leadership is actually between a bit of a rock and a hard place  They are trying to become more transparent and responsive to Western demands for less bribery  etc  in order to attract Western investment  which has slowed down in recent years  But the more they do to placate Western governments and corporations  the greater the stream of Chinese money leaving China 
It is my belief that 5 sectors of the real estate market are most likely to benefit from new investment  whether from Asia  Europe  Latin America or elsewhere  I prefer  for the most part  to invest in these areas via real estate investment trusts  REITs  wherever possible 
The 5 sectors are  self storage  as a nation  we have too many  things  but are loath to part with them   senior living  they ain t making any more land  but every month a quarter million Americans turn 65   student housing  as long as the federal government keeps promoting student loans and hints they will be forgiven  hundreds of thousands more will apply for college   medical office buildings and facilities  did I mention that every month a quarter million Americans turn 65   and triple net lease commercial properties  Sectors specifically seeing likely inflows from Asian investors  particularly from China also include commercial  hotel  and high end retail properties 
In our Investor s Edge  Growth and Value portfolio  we already own a large percentage of REITs  We own shares of Starwood Property Trust  NYSE STWD  the largest commercial real estate lending  servicing and investing company in the U S A  As the biggest originator of commercial mortgages  I believe STWD will see increasing revenues and earnings going forward   and that increasing revenues and earnings may prove to be a rarity among most US sectors and companies 
We also own National Health Investors  NYSE NHI    healthcare  Public Storage  NYSE PSA  preferreds  PSA T   self storage   Blackstone Mortgage Trust  NYSE BXMT    a mortgage REIT  Physician s Realty  NYSE DOC   a medical facilities REIT  EPR Properties pfd  NYSE EPR pc    recreational properties like movie theaters  and Stag Industrial pfd  NYSE STAG pb    an industrial properties REIT 
Given that the current market as measured by the S P 500 is no higher today than it was 9 months ago  I plan to raise the percentage of real estate equities and preferreds from a current 17  of the portfolio to 22   27   If the market cannot break out decisively from here  we ll be happy with a 6  yield on this portion of our portfolio 
If it does  these will participate in the rally  And if it declines  that 6  yield will give us a cushion against the decline as more investors flock to the greater stability of real estate holdings 
I will write four more detailed articles about four of my favorites in the next two weeks  If you are an investor who prefers to buy a basket of REITs to get started  may I suggest for your due diligence Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  NYSE RQI   RQI is a closed end fund selling at a current discount of 8 3  and with a quite respectable yield of 7 4   RQI is an equity fund that holds some of the biggest names in U S  REITs  firms like Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   Equity Residential  NYSE EQR  Public Storage  NYSE PSA   Omega Healthcare  NYSE OHI  and Vornado  NYSE VNO  
RQI covers the waterfront  It owns common stocks and preferred stocks  but mostly real estate investment trusts  Interestingly  when I run the numbers for RQI since its inception in 2002  I find it has actually beaten the S P 500  in total return even during this bull market from 2009 forward  It has also beaten the Vanguard REIT ETF  NYSE VNQ   despite VNQ s much touted low expenses  So much for the  just buy index funds with the lowest expenses  mantra 
I believe U S  REITs and other real estate firms are situated for further growth this year  While the real American economy is merely plodding along  other nations are doing worse  As a result  a lot of foreign capital is coming to the USA and real estate is what most of these sovereign wealth funds and wealthy individuals know best  Unlike many of the nations from which these funds will flow  the US real estate market is stable and seen as a safe haven  Please stay tuned for the next four discussions of our favorite individual real estate investments

13870,235385,CBRE,Hong Kong property investors go trophy hunting in London despite Brexit,news,"By Esha Vaish and Dasha Afanasieva LONDON  Reuters    Chinese investment in London commercial property has more than trebled since before Britain voted to leave the European Union  most of it channeled through Hong Kong at a time of heightened political uncertainty in the former British colony  While others have pulled back from British property following last year s Brexit referendum  investors largely from Hong Kong are snapping up the British capital s best known skyscrapers including the  Cheesegrater  and  Walkie Talkie   In the first six months of 2017 Chinese investors spent 3 96 billion pounds   5 10 billion  on London commercial property according to data from the  CBRE  real estate group  the highest amount on record and outpacing the 2 69 billion pounds spent in the whole of 2016  Hong Kong accounted for 92 percent of the Chinese investment  according to the Knight Frank agency  Hong Kong food conglomerate Lee Kum Kee is set to pay 1 28 billion pounds later this month for 20 Fenchurch Street   the 34 story skyscraper known as the Walkie Talkie   a record for an office building in Britain  With Beijing cracking down on foreign deals by mainland companies  investors there are instead using Hong Kong as a conduit for overseas deals  China s state planner announced on Friday that the country will strengthen rules to defuse risks for domestic companies investing abroad and curb  irrational  overseas investment  However  Hong Kong based investors are more significant players    Deals from mainland China already make up a smaller proportion of the activity from the region  with Hong Kong investors most active   said Anthony Duggan  head of capital markets research at Knight Frank   We expect that Chinese investors will still look to make strategic real estate purchases that fit within their business plans   Hong Kong s freedoms  including judicial independence  are constitutionally enshrined under a  one country  two systems  deal struck before Britain returned the territory to China in 1997  However  concerns have been rising in recent years and an appeals court jailed three leaders of Hong Kong s democracy movement last week  Tens of thousands protested in Hong Kong on Sunday against the jailing of the young activists  with many demonstrators questioning the independence of the judiciary  Hong Kong s legal chief has denied any  political motive  in seeking the prison terms  TAKING CONTROL  If you re concerned that China is taking control of Hong Kong more and more and you need to take capital out of that jurisdiction  London is attractive   said Chris Brett  head of international capital markets at CBRE  N CBG    Several factors are drawing the investment  including sterling s 12 percent drop since the Brexit referendum against the U S  dollar   to which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged    Cheaper money  the rule of law  cultural familiarity and a need to diversify out of a home market is what s driving Hong Kong demand in the UK   said James Beckham  head of central London investment at property consultant Cushman   Wakefield  which advised the Walkie Talkie s buyers and Cheesegrater s sellers  Record Hong Kong commercial and residential property prices  along with the political concerns are pushing investors to turn to overseas markets where rental yields are higher   The illiquidity of a building compared with other investments is also an attraction  should Beijing demand that funds be repatriated to China  Jefferies analyst Mike Prew said  The Brexit vote means some London based financial jobs will shift to the continent or Ireland so that banks can continue selling to clients in the EU   But this negative factor for the office market is offset by the pound s fall  which makes property cheaper for foreign investors  and the fact that the buildings sold have come with tenants signed up to leases of around 10 15 years   Real estate sources said other City of London landmarks  including 30 St Mary Axe   known as the Gherkin   and the Heron Tower are also attracting interest from Hong Kong investors  These prime  trophy  assets  like the Cheesegrater and Walkie Talkie  have well known tenants and are in limited supply  Chinese pricing of UK commercial real estate has already established an  entry premium  of about 100 basis points on yields for platinum or top grade buildings  according to Prew  Capital from China and Hong Kong has accounted for a third of all investment in London commercial real estate this year  up from less than 10 percent before the referendum  according to CBRE  This stands in contrast to other investors  Money raised by UK property focused private equity funds has fallen since the Brexit vote  with  2 9 billion raised in the first half of 2017 compared with  3 7 billion a year earlier  according to data from Prequin  That s as the outlook for the London office market as a whole clouds before Britain s EU exit in 2019  The amount of empty space has jumped since the referendum  with developers having to offer longer rent free periods and lease breaks early into leases to secure tenants  Central London office developer  Derwent London   L DLN   which has a portfolio worth 4 8 billion pounds  forecast that 2017 rental values would be anything between down 3 percent to up 2 percent  SKY HIGH London s skyscraper boom of the last decade reshaped the skyline  adorning it with unusually shaped silhouettes inspiring nicknames such as the Shard and the 24 storey Can of Ham  which is due to open next year   The largest chunk of cross border Chinese real estate investment continues to be poured into the United States  but that proportion declined in the first half of the year while increasing in Britain   Buildings in London are cheaper per square foot than in Hong Kong  Tokyo  New York and San Francisco  but they offer higher rents than most other global centers of their stature  according to Knight Frank data     Chinese investors  want stable and good returns and trophy buildings generally look part of that   said Dan Norris  real estate head at Hogan Lovells  the second largest law firm in China  Norris helped Chinese buyers in May to buy 20 Gresham Street  a seven floor building near St Paul s Cathedral  for around 300 million pounds  Asian investors were choosing to avoid development deals as they remained wary of riskier projects and were most keen on London offices  he added  Sales of trophy assets have been a prominent feature of the central London deal market for the past six months  resulting in 29 transactions of over 100 million pounds completing  up from 19 a year ago  according to data from  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  Real Estate   The most recently sold skyscrapers are also cheaper than the same caliber of building in Hong Kong  CBRE data show rental yields stand at about 3 4 3 5 percent for a top tier London building versus 1 percent for a similar Hong Kong one

13876,235391,CBRE, Proptech  firms angle for riches in U S  real estate market,news,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK  Reuters    New technology such as machine learning algorithms coupled with improved heating and cooling units that can be controlled by software helped cut electricity consumption at Rudin Management  a large New York landlord  by 41 percent since 2005 
Rudin s Nantum operating system can now predict when to adjust building temperatures according to the flow of people leaving and entering a property because it stores information instead of dumping all the data at day s end 
The advent of smart building technology is one of the ways scores of property focused start ups known as  proptech  firms are trying to tap growing reams of data in commercial real estate to increase productivity 
Venture capital in recent years has plowed more than  2 billion into  proptech  firms that cull data from leasing contracts  capital projects  public records or a building s infrastructure 
John Gilbert  chief operating officer at Rudin and executive chairman at Prescriptive Data  a company that owns Nantum and is controlled by the Rudin family  said the tools to efficiently manage a building did not exist until a few years ago 
The drop in electricity consumption at Rudin s 16 office towers occurred even as rising demand by its tenants boosted their usage over the past dozen years by 11 percent  data from Rudin that has not been reported before show 
A more thorough collection of data that can be analyzed with better software and the use of variable speed fans in HVAC systems have opened a new frontier in building systems  he said 
 Simply by correlating two data sets that never talked to each other   such as  population occupancy and modulated fan speed  I can have huge electricity savings in the middle of the day   Gilbert said 
NEW FRONTIER FOR DATA
Real estate services firm  CBRE  Group Inc  NYSE CBRE  estimates utility savings of 5 to 15 percent annually at the more than 22 000 properties it has helped convert to smart status 
Converting properties into smart buildings has been a large focus in commercial real estate because of their massive energy consumption 
Better  cheaper and longer lasting sensors such as those made by Norway s Disruptive Technologies Research AS promise further efficiency gains in monitoring temperature and the movement of people 
Prescriptive Data and Disruptive Technologies plan a joint U S  launch once the Federal Communications Commission grants certification of coin sized wireless sensors  which install in seconds and immediately transmit data  the companies said 
LaSalle Investment Management  a big U S  property owner  credits start ups such as VTS  a leasing tool  for increased efficiency by no longer wasting time to gather data that s now available in real time 
LaSalle  a unit of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc  has tracked about 190 proptech companies launched over the past three to four years 
Brookfield Property Partners  one of the largest real estate owners  estimates use of start up Honest Buildings  has reduced the cost of a typical capital project by 6 3 percent and cut administrative labor by 80 percent   to 18 hours from 92 hours 
Both Brookfield and Rudin have invested in Honest Buildings  a firm that helps companies tackle capital planning by putting data on a single platform for both clients  and internal use 
Collecting and analyzing data has been hindered in the mostly privately owned commercial real estate industry  which closely guards information 
Various computer protocols have also made it hard to unify data from scattered databases  said Richard Sarkis  co founder and chief executive of analytics firm Reonomy 
 It sounds like a trivial problem but it is both very difficult to solve and it is universal for everybody who cares about commercial real estate   said Sarkis 
SEEKING AN EDGE
Data about commercial properties that was inaccessible is now available and can be used in creative ways  said Charlie Oshman  chief operating officer of Delshah Capital  an investor in New York commercial real estate 
Mortgage broker Eastern Union Funding credits a jump in business at a time commercial loan originations industry wide are down  to an app that allows investors to peruse properties  find the most active brokers and view data on mortgages coming due and the banks that made those loans  among other features 
The tool is free because Eastern Union wants to attract customers as it expands nationally  said Ira Zlotowitz  president of the Brooklyn  New York based company 
 This is what helped boost the sales   said Zlotowitz  who recognizes any edge in data he may have now will soon evaporate   What s really going to happen now over the next 12 to 18 months is not having the data  it s how to use the data   he said ",2018-06-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/proptech-firms-angle-for-riches-in-us-real-estate-market-1481364,1481364

14025,235540,CBRE,An unlikely winner in Venezuela crisis  high end real estate,news,"By Brian Ellsworth CARACAS  Reuters    Building luxury apartments or corporate office towers might seem like an odd investment in an economy reeling from a deep recession  triple digit inflation and chronic product shortages   Unless it s Venezuela  The combination of soaring prices and exchange controls that prevent businesses from buying dollars has made high end real estate an attractive way for companies to protect the value of revenue earned in the increasingly worthless bolivar currency  Cranes clutter the skyline of the Caracas municipality of Chacao  home to the capital s financial district and most of its embassies  despite a backdrop of huge supermarket lines that have become a symbol of the country s economic decay   Las Mercedes  a neighborhood developed in the 1950s as an exclusive residential zone that is now filled with garish restaurants and bars  is also awash in real estate development   These projects all start from the same premise    let s absorb bolivars    said Beatriz Yilo of  CBRE  Venezuela  an affiliate of real estate services firm CBRE Group Inc  N CBG    When you have a system that penalizes foreign exchange operations  and you don t want to commit a crime   what else do you have left   Total square footage of premium office space in Chacao and Las Mercedes is set to jump by nearly 50 percent by the end of next year  according to figures compiled by CBRE  while the cost in local currency of renting or buying such space has soared by nearly a factor of 15 in the last two years  That roughly tracks the returns that would have been provided by buying dollars on the black market during the same period   with the added benefit that developers will have valuable assets on the ground if the economy recovers  The government of President Nicolas Maduro sells dollars at 10 bolivars each for priority goods such as food and medicine and at around 660 bolivars for less important items  But greenbacks fetch nearly 1 100 bolivars on the black market  where the Venezuelan currency has lost 91 percent of its value in the last two years  Municipal officials say multinational companies with operations in Venezuela  which routinely take write offs on earnings statements due to depreciation of their bolivar holdings  are key investors in premium office space   The officials declined to identify specific companies  but said they range from a well known financial services company to popular consumer products groups  Foreign companies contacted by Reuters about real estate investments in Venezuela declined to comment  LUXURY BUILDINGS  BREAD LINES Many of the projects were drawn up in 2010  when the government toughened exchange controls by outlawing a widely used parallel currency market  leaving bolivars trapped in local bank accounts  The luxury real estate development contrasts with the tough day to day realities of Venezuelans who spend hours in lines seeking staple goods ranging from rice to medicine    This is routine  it s like this every day   said Carlos Martinez  40  a bank employee standing in a line stretching through the flashy La Castellana neighborhood  a few blocks from where a new mall with office space and luxury apartments is set to open   This is a wealthy area with all these luxury buildings and look at the line I m stuck in   The overall construction industry  like the rest of the economy  is in crisis  Building middle income homes is rarely feasible because so little financing is available for construction or for purchase  and middle class spending power has been battered by inflation  Production of cement and steel have plummeted since late socialist leader Hugo Chavez put those industries under state control  meaning developers now have to buy such materials on the black market at increasingly high prices  Real estate experts say that the high end construction frenzy may have peaked last year as rising prices mean that new square footage is no longer necessarily a bargain   But municipal authorities overseeing both Chacao and Las Mercedes their say phones continue ringing off the hook with requests for information about construction permits   
 These are people who have a long term vision  who want to invest because they see the country is going to change   said Chacao Mayor Ramon Muchacho   But this is also a financial issue  the only shortage we don t have in Venezuela is a shortage of bolivars  ",2016-10-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/an-unlikely-winner-in-venezuela-crisis:-high-end-real-estate-430974,430974
14026,235541,CBRE,London offices have designs on tech as Brexit puts brake on finance,news,"By Esha Vaish and Sarah Young  Reuters    High up in western Europe s tallest skyscraper  an office layout shows how the power balance in London s property market is shifting in favor of booming tech companies and away from finance firms which may shrink in London after the Brexit vote  Some employees of digital marketing agency Jellyfish work from hot desks at The Shard  gathered around a long pine table suggestive of a trendy coffee shop  enjoying views of St Paul s Cathedral   Edged by a bar with a screen displaying train times  floor to ceiling whiteboards  cozy sound proofed booths and a tap dispensing barista style coffees  the design encourages staff to work together   We wanted to be taken seriously  not just frittering client money away with crazy guys on roller skates  so this is a serious space   said the company s Chief Creative Officer Mark Deeprose   Jellyfish s offices are one sign of how fast growing tech firms are calling the shots in the London property market  outshining the finance sector which accounts for around 8 percent of British GDP and has long been the cornerstone of the capital s property scene  Property developers are ditching the marble fittings  suspended ceilings and tight rows of desks associated with the grand old banks  replacing them with more spacious irregular offices finished with the brickwork  colorful furniture and exposed wires beloved of tech companies  Since Britons voted on June 23 to leave the European Union  some financial services companies have threatened to move operations to other European capitals over fears that Brexit may prevent them serving EU clients  Tech companies  however  have shrugged off the vote and are expanding in London  with Google  O GOOGL  and Facebook  O FB  leading the charge  helping property developers with a greater tech exposure to outperform their peers   Immediately after Brexit no one was doing anything but once we got into August and September  all of the tech firms just seemed to say  well  we re moving on   said James Roberts  chief economist at property consultant Knight Frank  According to the broker  rental demand from tech names including Apple  O AAPL  and WeWork meant that 2 7 million square feet  250 000 square meters  of central London office space were leased in the quarter that followed the June 23 vote  a 15 percent increase on the previous three months  Interest from the likes of Spotify and Deliveroo promises to support future office demand  and UK online fashion retailer ASOS  L ASOS  has announced plans to expand in London this month  drawn to the city s talent pool and international status  By contrast   Barclays   L BARC  has announced it is sub letting a quarter of the space in one of its main offices in the Canary Wharf financial district  COFFEE SHOP STYLE  For ASOS s expanded and redeveloped London headquarters  it has used software to map how its people use the building to encourage different units to work together  It will also have a quiet library  and a concierge service to help employees with their needs outside work    Tech  is an active sector at the moment and we re seeing developers beginning to acknowledge this within the way that they re building   said Simon Calvert  senior director of advisory and transaction services at property firm  CBRE   N CBG   But the growth in tech may not be enough to fill new commercial property space  The City of London warns that up to 10 percent of jobs in London s financial district may be lost if Britain fails to secure adequate EU access after Brexit  At the same time  London office construction has reached its highest level since 2008  according to Deloitte   British Land   L BLND   developer of the  Cheesegrater  office tower in London s historic financial district  is reducing the amount of office space it builds without a guaranteed tenant  and is instead refurbishing sites to add more flexible accommodation  It has amended an existing planning consent at a site in Paddington  west London  to introduce features such as sun terraces  a rooftop basketball court and collaborative work spaces that position the building more towards the TMT  technology  media and telecommunications  sectors    We ll adapt tactically  but we re confident that s good for the longer term   CEO Chris Grigg said  after the firm in November posted a fall in the value of its office portfolio which gets 17 percent of its rent from banks and finance firms and 7 percent from TMT  French insurer AXA s  PA AXAF  investment management arm has decided to go ahead with a new skyscraper in London s financial district  reversing a decision taken in the wake of the Brexit vote to put the project on ice   Harry Badham  who heads the UK development team at AXA IM   Real Assets  said the 22 Bishopsgate site would aim to attract tech clients with a plan to offer space for an incubator workshop for start ups where they would charge lower rent  Luring established tech clients requires not just space with an industrial  retro vibe  but also flexible rental deals  said Andrew Sell  commercial director at Real Estate Management  UK   which handles The Shard    Whereas before there was an aversion from the owners to have lease breaks  we recognize it s really important for the tech sector because their rate of growth is colossal   he said  Software firm  Sage Group   L SGE   for example  negotiated at least two breaks in its lease when it moved to The Shard  he said  Sage added extra space less than a year later  Providing tech friendly offices may also eventually serve to attract financial services firms anyway  said Neil Prime  JLL s  N JLL  lead director of Central London Markets    Ten years ago maybe the banks  model was rack it  stack it and squeeze them in   he said   
  But  the banks are going to be competing with the Googles for these digitally enabled people  they are going to need to have that  tech friendly  environment   he said ",2016-12-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/london-offices-have-designs-on-tech-as-brexit-puts-brake-on-finance-449403,449403

That s according to  CBRE  Group Inc  NYSE CBRE   s Global Living report  which canvassed 35 cities from Barcelona to Birmingham 
A few metropolises have taken a tumble    the report last year found that some of the best performing cities were New York  Los Angeles  Toronto  Vancouver  Sydney and Melbourne  With home price growth in those markets now slowing  they ve been pushed down the list  making room for European cities where growth is still robust 
Asia s showing remains strong  After Hong Kong comes Singapore and then Shanghai  Vancouver and Shenzhen    one of the bigger cities in China s Greater Bay Area    round out the top five for highest average property price 
While Hong Kong saw 17 790 private housing projects completed last year  that isn t sufficient given the pressure on demand in relation to the size of the city  current population 7 4 million  and its limited suitable land for residential use  CBRE said

14431,235946,CBRE,Hong Kong s Property Bubble Is Protest Proof,news," Bloomberg Opinion     It will take more than a few protests to cool Hong Kong s real estate market  The latest round of social unrest has homeowners worried that the local economy  especially the property sector  will suffer  In fact  the market is only going to get hotter   if it can weather the current round of chaos 
The city has been in turbulence since early June  amid massive demonstrations against a proposed bill that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China  Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets on three separate occasions  culminating in the unprecedented invasion and trashing of the Legislative Council building by a minority of protesters on Monday  The intermittent chaos has interrupted normal daily life  leading to the closure of transportation systems and shopping malls 
During the tumult  a listed property company forfeited its  3 2 million deposit on the purchase of commercial land listed at  1 41 billion  and a wealthy individual buyer walked away from a  1 6 million deposit on a  32 2 million luxury home  Many in the media took these two events as a sign that the real estate bubble was finally going to burst  Yet the overall market has remained firm  with values as measured by the Centa City Leading Index less than 1  off its record high reached in late May 
To understand why prices are so high  let s look at what keeps this bubble aloft in the first place  The average purchase price for a home in Hong Kong is  1 23 million  according to property services firm  CBRE  Group Inc  NYSE CBRE   The city posted its second best year for real estate sales ever in 2018  at  93 billion  Yet for the majority of the city s approximately 7 4 million residents earning the median annual income of  38 500  buying into the market is simply unaffordable 
Those fortunate enough to purchase a home devote 70  of their monthly income to their mortgages on average  The affordability ratio  monthly mortgage payments as a percentage of median income  is more than 60   the highest it s reached since the last property bubble in 1997  In other words  buying property in Hong Kong is a rich person s sport 
Costs have become so prohibitive that some home hunters are willing to ruin their feng shui by purchasing apartments believed to be haunted by the ghosts of murdered former inhabitants  Additionally  whenever developers slash prices  buyers snatch up whatever s available 
The bubble reflects an enormous housing crisis with no easy solution  The Hong Kong government greatly underestimated the need for new home construction  Our Hong Kong Foundation said in a recent study  Housing supply will slump 40  in the five years through 2022 23  the think tank warned  In many Hong Kong households  three generations now live together because younger family members have been unable to afford high rents or to buy in the past 10 years  according to a researcher on the report cited in the South China Morning Post  This pent up demand isn t reflected in the official projections 
The study questioned whether the government s target of constructing 450 000 new units in the next decade will be enough to satisfy demand  Given the fact that Hong Kong is running out of available land on which to build  it s hard to see how prices can fail to stay high for the foreseeable future 
Interest rate cuts in the U S  would exacerbate the situation  While the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged at its meeting in June  Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to a reduction as early as this month  saying downside risks to the U S  economy had increased recently  In this event  expect Hong Kong to follow suit  The city s interest rates track those in the U S  because of the currency peg to the dollar  Lower borrowing costs would give a further boost to the Hong Kong property market 
An added tailwind has come from Osaka  where the latest meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his U S  counterpart Donald Trump appeared to secure another temporary trade truce  The effect on property sales in Hong Kong was instant  Lingering tensions over existing tariffs could still plunge the world into an economic tailspin  and any global catastrophe could shock the entire system into submission  But for now  steady interest rates will continue to entice home buyers 
As prices keep rising  rather than applying the old adage of  buy low  sell high   a more applicable mantra may be   buy high  sell higher   Hong Kong may have signs of a bubble  but it seems to be one made of steel ",2019-07-03,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/hong-kongs-property-bubble-is-protestproof-1915035,1915035
14432,235947,CBRE,Foreign Investment in U S  Commercial Property Drops Almost 50 ,news," Bloomberg     Foreign investment in U S  commercial real estate plunged in the first half of 2019 as signs of a global economic slowdown made buyers more cautious 
Deals totaled  16 9 billion  down from a record  32 7 billion in the same period last year  according to a report by  CBRE  Group Inc  NYSE CBRE   Much of the decline was in spending on large mergers and acquisitions  which tumbled 83   the brokerage said  Individual asset and portfolio sales fell 26  
The current slowing economy and uncertainty over where U S  interest rates were headed have caused many overseas investors to hesitate on deals  according to Spencer Levy  chairman of Americas research for CBRE  That may change as buyers get more clarity 
 Many people have hit the pause button  but I think it s a temporary pause button   Levy said by phone  The Federal Reserve  has now been explicit in what their path is  and that is lowering interest rates  which will lower the cost of hedging  which will bring more money into the U S  
Canada was the biggest foreign investor in the first half  with  5 3 billion of U S  commercial property deals  Following were Israel  Germany  United Arab Emirates and Bahrain  with about  1 billion each 
Levy said transactions should pick up in the second half  partly because the U S  is still growing faster than just about any other global economy 
 The relative value of the U S  versus Europe  in particular  will become more clear   he said   I would not be surprised if  by the end of this year  we re actually ahead of last year s pace  ",2019-09-09,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/foreign-investment-in-us-commercial-property-drops-almost-50-1973623,1973623
14433,235948,CBRE,China Office Vacancies Reach Decade High on Slowing Economy,news," Bloomberg    
China s deepening economic slowdown and a glut of supply has pushed the nation s office vacancy rate to the highest since at least 2008 
The vacancy rate in 17 major cities climbed to 21 5  in the third quarter  according to  CBRE  Group Inc  NYSE CBRE   The  spike  in vacancies this year is the worst since the depths of the global financial crisis a decade ago  said Sam Xie  the firm s head of research in China 
China s office market is being buffeted by a confluence of forces  driving vacancy rates to the highest among global business centers  Overseas companies are waiting for an end to hostilities in the U S  trade war before committing to new leases  skyscrapers built during the boom years are unleashing a wave of supply  and cost conscious tenants are moving to cheaper buildings as the economy slows 
In Lujiazui on the banks of Shanghai s Pudong River    one of Asia s most expensive business districts    vacancy rates reached 16  last quarter  up from about 3  three years earlier  CBRE said 
Among the departures was Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc   which moved to the New Bund Time Square  NYSE SQ  building in the emerging business zone of Qiantan  where rents are about 50  cheaper than Lujiazui 
In an effort to attract tenants  landlords are offering incentives including longer rent free periods  Even so  rents declined in 14 of the 17 cities last quarter  including the major hubs of Beijing and Shanghai  CBRE s Xie said 
In Shenzhen  authorities have offered rent discounts of as much as 50  to attract tenants to Qianhai  an emerging business zone  Nine years after it was established as a future financial services hub  two thirds of office space in the area is empty  according to Colliers International Group Inc
