153168,374684,NXPI,Better Buy  NXP Semiconductors vs  Texas Instruments,news,"Investors with an interest in the semiconductor industry often find themselves weighing Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  against NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI   The two enormous chipmakers have a lot in common  competing head to head in several key markets and running very similar hybrid manufacturing models  So which one is the better investment right now 
Valuation
Once upon a time  the main tiebreaker between these two stocks lay in their valuation  NXP traded at the bargain bin ratio of 10 times forward earnings last spring  making it a no brainer bargain of an investment  At the time  Texas Instruments shares were changing hands at 20 times forward earnings  For P E purists  there was just no reason to consider TI over NXP 
Things have changed since then  but perhaps not to a game changing degree  NXP investors pocketed a 74  return in 2019  while TI s shareholders had to settle for a  still market beating  gain of 36   Today  NXP s stock trades at 15 times forward earnings and 24 times free cash flows  while Texas Instrument s valuation ratios stand at 26 times forward earnings and 39 times free cash flows 
Operating trends
So NXP sure looks like the richer bargain right now  but that s never the whole story  Master investor Warren Buffett famously prefers buying great companies at a fair price over settling for fair companies at a great price  and that s a fantastic way to think about what matters to serious investors 
From that point of view  both companies have seen better days 
TI s top line sales fell 12  year over year in October s third quarter report  Adjusted earnings per share declined by 6   The Chinese American trade war limited the demand for TI s analog and embedded chips in important markets such as automotive computing and communications 
At the same time  NXP s revenues fell 7  and operating profits followed in lockstep  Once again  management pointed to weakness in the automotive computing sector  and the trigger event for that negative trend can be traced back to Chinese American trade tensions 
On the other hand  NXP may have seen the worst of the trade war related market softness  CEO Rick Clemmer said that the automotive revenue drops should slow down in the fourth quarter and probably turn around in 2020  And TI s top and bottom lines may be suffering  but the chip giant s free cash flows increased by 6 2  in the third quarter 

So which stock should I buy 
At the end of the day  we re looking at two fantastic companies with plenty of long term growth ahead of them  as soon as the tensions between Washington and Beijing go away  Anything can happen in an election year  and I would be surprised to see international trade issues weighing on the tech sector in 2021 
There aren t any losers in this matchup  but the two stocks do serve different types of investors 
Texas Instruments is the larger and slower option  committed to returning those massive cash flows directly to shareholders through buybacks and dividends  The dividend yield currently stands at 2 8   which might not sound like a lot  but it really does make a difference in the long term  Over the last 10 years  TI delivered a 391  return measured in pure share price gains  Reinvesting the dividends along the way into more TI stock would have boosted your returns to 523  
NXP Semiconductors started paying a modest dividend last year  sporting a yield of 1 2  today  But this smaller and nimbler business can turn its attention to new growth markets with more conviction than TI s broad product portfolio ever could  That s how NXP became a market leader in not yet hot sectors like automotive computing and mobile security  Today  NXP investors can look back at an 807  return as these trends played out over the last decade  or 823  with dividends reinvested 
So TI is arguably the better choice for patient long term investors with a yen for juicy dividends  while NXP appeals more to growth stock enthusiasts  In this age of commission free stock trades  there s nothing stopping you from buying some of each ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pd7q0,2052063

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by  and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 NXP Semiconductors Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today  Mr  Jeff Palmer  Sir  you may begin Jeff Palmer    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Crystal  and good morning  everyone  Welcome to the NXP Semiconductors Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call  With me on the call today is Rick Clemmer  NXP s CEO  Kurt Sievers  NXP s President  and Peter Kelly  our CFO  If you ve not obtained a copy of our earnings press release  it can be found in our company website under the Investor Relations section at nxp com  This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our corporate website Our call today will include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause NXP s results to differ materially from management s current expectations  These risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  statements regarding the macroeconomic impact on the specific end markets in which we operate  the sale of new and existing products  and our expectations for the financial results for the first quarter 2020  Please be reminded that NXP undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements  For a full disclosure on forward looking statements  please refer to our press release today Additionally  during our call today  we will make reference to certain non GAAP financial measures  which exclude the impact of purchase price accounting  restructuring  stock based compensation  impairment  merger related costs and other charges that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to NXP s underlying core operating performance  Pursuant to Regulation G  NXP has provided reconciliations of the non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter 2019 earnings press release  which will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8 K and is available on NXP s website in the Investor Relations section at nxp com Now I d like to turn the call over to Rick Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerThanks Jeff  and welcome  everyone  to our conference call today  NXP delivered full year revenue of  8 9 billion  a decline of 6  year on year against a very challenging semiconductor industry backdrop throughout the year  Even on lower sales volume  we successfully improved our non GAAP gross margin by 60 basis points and our non GAAP operating margin by 30 basis points  clearly better operating performance than in previous market downturns Our free cash flow conversion was solid at  1 9 billion  And we continued to follow through on our capital return strategy  returning nearly 95  of free cash flow generated  or  1 8 billion  to our owners  As a reminder  we have returned  6 8 billion to our shareholders by share buybacks and cash dividends over the last two years and have reduced the diluted share count by 60 million shares  Kurt will provide more details on the quarterly trends in a few moments Notwithstanding the semiconductor market environment during 2019  we continued to invest in and execute our strategy within our target markets  We have introduced many new products  We ve been actively engaged with customers on adopting these solutions  which we believe will support our long term growth targets If you happened to attend our investor open house at the CES trade show  you saw a glimpse of how some of these products will be used in real world applications  These included automotive radar solutions  providing improved driver safety  our family of quad core i MX processors  which enable new multi display digital clusters  and our innovative battery management solutions for hybrid and full electric vehicles  We also demonstrated our latest ultrawideband solutions for secure access and localization with a mobile device for automotive  smart home and smart building solutions Additionally  we showcased multiple new processor families  including the i MX 8M Plus  the first i MX family to integrate neural net processing  offering higher performance per dollar to GPU solutions  the RT crossover family for the secure edge computing market  the quad core i MX 8 for industrial and high end home automation applications  and the high performance  fully ASIL D compliant S32G for automotive network domain control  Taken together  the wave of new product introductions across the Company and associated customer engagement is truly impressive  and there is more to come over the coming periods The NXP product portfolio was in its most competitive and innovative position in many years and is just beginning to fully reflect the synergy we envisioned when NXP and Freescale merged in 2016  We are confident that as new products ramp into volume production  they will underpin both our top line growth  our longer term gross margin targets  and will yield significant cash flow  Then  as the end markets begin to rebound  which we are beginning to initially see  especially in our automotive and industrial end markets  we anticipate a healthy improvement in our core business  which will also provide positive tailwinds to growth In summary  as we begin a new year  the team is invigorated and fully engaged  Our strategy continues to yield positive results  and the customer response to new products is very encouraging  We will continue to be laser focused on our strategic end markets  engaging with customers to deliver superior and highly differentiated solutions I d like now to pass the call over to Kurt to discuss the results of the full year and the current quarter and provide an outlook for Q1 Kurt Sievers    PresidentThanks very much  Rick  and good morning  everyone  We appreciate you joining the call today  Today  I m going to review both our quarter four  as well as our full year 2019 results Overall  our Q4 results were above the midpoint of our guidance with the contribution from the mobile  automotive and the industrial IoT markets  all stronger than planned  while demand in the comms infrastructure market performed as anticipated  Taken together  NXP delivered revenue of  2 3 billion  about  30 million above the midpoint of our guidance range  We did close the acquisition of the Marvell connectivity assets in early December  which was not included in our guidance  The connectivity assets contributed about  6 million of revenue to our quarter four results  Non GAAP operating margin was a strong 29 9   about 30 basis points below guidance as a result of closing the Marvell transaction in early December Now let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets  starting with automotive  Full year revenue was  4 2 billion  down 7  year over year as a result of lower industrywide auto production and rationalization of the global auto supply chain  Our growth automotive products grew year on year  primarily due to the ramp of radar and battery management system solutions During quarter four  our automotive revenue was  1 09 billion  down 1  versus the year ago period  at a lesser rate of decline than in the previous quarters  and showing 5  sequential growth and better than our guidance by  9 million  Included in our quarter four results in automotive was about  1 million associated with the newly acquired Marvell wireless assets Turning to our industrial   IoT segment  full year revenue was  1 59 billion  down 12  year on year  as global trade concerns impacted demand for broad based general purpose MCU products  The demand trends for our industrial i Mx application processors were flattish on a year on year basis During quarter four  industrial   IoT revenue was  415 million  down 5  versus the year ago period  down 3  sequentially and  5 million better than our guidance  Included in our quarter four results for industrial   IoT were about  5 million associated with the newly acquired Marvell wireless assets Turning to mobile  full year revenue was  1 19 billion  up 2  year on year  During the year  we experienced continued strong adoption of our secure mobile wallet and transit solutions  which was partially offset by anticipated declines in our semi custom mobile analog interface business  We do estimate the attach rate of mobile wallets increased to about 35   in line with our expectations and very supportive of our 50  attach rate targets exiting 2021 During quarter four  mobile revenue was  332 million  down 3  versus the year ago period  up 3  sequentially and  15 million better than our guidance Lastly  turning to our comms infrastructure and other business  full year revenue was  1 87 billion  up 5  year over year  During the year  we experienced robust growth as associated with NXP s RF power products due to the adoption of the Company s massive MIMO solutions for the cellular base station markets  as mobile carriers began to increase network densification efforts ahead of future 5G cellular deployments The strength in the cellular base station market was complemented by a stabilization in the Company s communication processor business  However  these positive trends were offset by year on year declines in the Company s secure bank cards and e government businesses During quarter four  revenue was  457 million  down 5  year over year  down 3  sequentially and in line with our guidance Now  let me turn to our expectations for quarter one  Our guidance reflects what we view as an improved demand environment that is moderately better than we ve seen over the last number of quarters  It does appear that the channel rationalization trends we witnessed throughout  19 has essentially played out  both with our direct customers and those served through global distribution  We are guiding quarter one revenue at  2 23 billion  up about 6  versus the first quarter of 2019  within the range of up 5  to 8  year on year  From a sequential perspective  this represents a decline of about 3  at the midpoint versus the prior quarter At the midpoint  we anticipate the following year over year trends in our business for quarter one  Automotive is expected to be up mid single digits versus Q1  19 and down low single digits versus Q4  Industrial   IoT is expected to be up in the 20  range versus quarter one  19 and up high single digits versus quarter four  19  Mobile is expected to be up in the low double digit percent range versus the period a year ago and down in the high teens versus Q4  19  Please remember  in 2019  the mobile VAS  Voice and Audio Solutions  business was  150 million  And finally  communication infrastructure and other is expected to be down in the high single digit range on a percentage basis  both on a year on year as well as on a sequential basis Lastly  our aggregate quarter one guidance does include about  60 million contribution from the acquired Marvell assets  And at the same time  it excludes the mobile VAS business  of which we did close the divestiture yesterday  For your reference  the mobile VAS business contributed  150 million in 2019 In summary  our new product introductions  customer engagement levels and design win momentum in our strategic focus areas continue to be very positive  and we continue to be very optimistic about the mid to long term potential of NXP And now  I d like to pass the call to Peter for a review of our financial performance Peter Kelly    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Kurt  Good morning to everyone on today s call  As Kurt already covered the drivers of the revenue during the quarter and provided the revenue outlook for Q1  I ll move to the financial highlights  In summary  our fourth quarter revenue performance was above the high end of our guidance range  with improved non GAAP gross profit and in line non GAAP operating profit  I ll first provide full year highlights and then move to the fourth quarter results Full year revenue for 2019 was  8 88 billion  down 6  year on year  of which 140 basis points was the elimination of the MSA in 2019 versus 2018  We generated  4 75 billion in non GAAP gross profit and reported a non GAAP gross margin of 53 5   up 60 basis points year on year Total non GAAP operating expenses were  2 18 billion  down  99 million year on year  Total non GAAP operating profit was  2 57 billion and non GAAP operating margin was 29   up 30 basis points year on year despite a  530 million drop in revenue versus 2018  Non GAAP interest expense was  265 million  Cash taxes for ongoing operations were  120 million and incidental taxes were  248 million with non controlling interest of  29 million  Stock based compensation  which is not included in our non GAAP earnings  was  346 million Full year cash flow highlights include  2 37 billion in cash flow from operations and  503 million in net capex investments  resulting in  1 87 billion of non GAAP free cash flow  During 2019  we repurchased  1 44 billion of our shares and paid cash dividends of  319 million  In total  we returned  1 76 billion to our owners  which was 94  of the total non GAAP free cash flow generated during the year  We also spent a similar amount on the acquisition the Marvell asset Now  moving to details of the fourth quarter  total revenue was  2 3 billion  down 4  year on year  at the high end of our guidance range  of which 110 basis points of the decline was the elimination of the MSA  The quarter included  6 million of revenue associated with the acquisition of the Marvell assets  which closed in early December and which was not included in our guidance  We generated  1 25 billion in non GAAP gross profit and reported a non GAAP gross margin of 54 2   up 110 basis points year on year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance  despite the small headwind created by the Marvell acquisition Total non GAAP operating expenses were  563 million  up  20 million year on year and up  32 million from the third quarter  This was  18 million above the midpoint of our guidance  and about  8 million of this was due to the operating cost associated with the Marvell asset acquisition and the majority of the remainder to greater than anticipated new product introduction expenses From a total operating profit perspective  non GAAP operating profit was  687 million and non GAAP operating margin was 29 9   down 50 basis points year on year  driven by lower revenue  Non GAAP interest expense was  77 million  Cash taxes for ongoing operations were  34 million and non controlling interest was  9 million  Stock based comp  which is not included in our non GAAP earnings  was  89 million Now  I d like to turn to the changes in our cash and debt  Our total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was  7 37 billion  down  1 14 billion sequentially as we retired the  1 15 billion convertible notes at maturity in early December  Our ending cash position was  1 05 billion  down  2 49 billion due to a combination of the closure of the Marvell asset and the previously noted debt repayment  offset by cash generation during the fourth quarter  The resulting net debt was  6 32 billion  And we exited the quarter with a trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of  3 1 billion  Our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter was 2 times and our non GAAP interest coverage was 8 9 times Our liquidity is excellent and our balance sheet continues to be very strong  During the fourth quarter  we paid  105 million in cash dividends and repurchased  74 million of our shares  Our capital return policy continues to be to return all excess cash to shareholders Turning to working capital metrics  Days of inventory was 102 days  an increase of four days sequentially  which was a result of the Marvell acquisition  We continue to closely manage our distribution channel with inventory in the channel at 2 3 months  within our long term targets but slightly below the 2 4 months we normally expect to run  Days receivables were 26 days  down six days sequentially on improved sales linearity  And days payable were 81  an increase of seven days versus the prior quarter  Taken together  our cash conversion cycle was 47 days  an improvement of nine days versus the prior quarter  Cash flow from operations was  814 million and net capex was  138 million  resulting in non GAAP free cash flow of  676 million Turning to our expectations for the first quarter  As Kurt mentioned  we anticipate Q1 revenue to be about  2 23 billion  plus or minus about  30 million  At the midpoint  this is up 6  year on year  down 3  sequentially  We expect non GAAP gross margin to be about 53 2   plus or minus 30 bps  Operating expenses are expected to be about  573 million  plus or minus about  9 million  And taken together  we see non GAAP operating margin to be about 27 6   plus or minus about 20 bps  We estimate non GAAP financial expense to be about  78 million and anticipate cash tax related to ongoing operations to be about  32 million  Non controlling interest will be about  6 million  And for Q1  we suggest that  for your modeling purposes  you use an average share count of 284 5 million shares Finally  I have a few closing comments I d like to make  As both Rick and Kurt pointed out  we see the beginning of a moderately improving demand environment across our end markets with the exception of the 5G base station market  From a revenue perspective  we re pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter  Our revenue was slightly better than guidance with the contribution from the mobile  auto and industrial markets  all a bit stronger than expected  Our results within the communication infrastructure market were essentially in line with our expectation Our non GAAP gross margin has steadily improved over the last year  even as we ve navigated a challenging top line demand environment  Our non GAAP gross margin improved again in the fourth quarter  And as we have previously signaled  we expect to see modest gross margin compression in the first quarter based on annual price agreements and lower revenue  We continue to be laser focused on achieving our intermediate non GAAP gross margin target of 55   and we continue to believe this can be achieved with a revenue level in the  2 4 billion range As previously noted  our Board of Directors has approved an additional share repurchase  And with the closure of the Marvell deal in December  we began to repurchase shares again in early January and have bought 1 76 million shares at a cost of  230 million between January 2 and February 3 So with that  I d now like to turn it back to the operator for your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities  Your line is open Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks for taking my question  and great job on the free cash flow generation  I think it s a record  indecipherable   My first question  on the China impact  I m curious if your Q1 outlook bakes any supply or demand impact from the ongoing coronavirus related shutdowns  Or do you think there could be perhaps a delayed impact on the industry that affects Q2 instead  And if you could remind us of how we think about seasonality for Q2 Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerSo  thanks Vivek  At this time  the situation on the coronavirus continues to be very fluid  and we re monitoring it very closely  We ve taken actions on travel to protect our employees and in our manufacturing operations to be sure that we have our employees at the forefront of our minds  and also been trying to support the general containment of any spread  But as of today  we ve seen no impact on orders  Although we re just coming out of the Lunar New Year holiday  clearly  the forced closures by some of the additional provinces in China add more to the uncertainty  And to be clear  it s just impossible for us to speculate on the impact and the implications associated with it  Our guidance today does not contemplate any potential impact from the coronavirus Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAlright  And so my follow up on gross margins  so Peter  thanks for giving us that  2 4 billion or so level  What will it take    is it just revenue that is the main driver to get to your    the middle of your 53  to 57  target gross margin range  Or is there anything about the products or end markets or manufacturing cost or competition that is influencing it  Because when I look at your largest market in automotive  things like BMS that you re working on  most of your competitors are on the analog side and they re making 60   70  gross margins  So it seems to me  whether I look at 5G or BMS and autos  that from that mix perspective  gross margin should be trending in the right direction Peter Kelly    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think there s a few things  First of all  Q1 is obviously a very low number of 53 2   It came off the fourth quarter of 54 2   And the change really is  we have the annual price agreements that    contractual agreement fixes  Phonetic   and that s roughly 60 basis points  And then  volume from Q4 to Q1    the revenue decline is probably another 60 basis points  And that s offset by the continued improvement we have in purchasing and manufacturing performance So to go from 53 2  to 55   I think is    we just need to get our revenue up to a run rates of about  2 4 billion a quarter  Now  to go from 55  to 57   which I think takes potentially a number of years  I ll call it mix  but it really is around    and you ve highlighted some of it  Vivek  it s    our new products that are coming into place now  particularly in automotive  but also in our crossover products and the like  I don t think that we re the type of company that you    is a traditional analog company that runs 65  gross margin with no real growth  What we are targeting is to run well in excess of the market  and we think our model of up to 57     I think we had said about  Phonetic  53  to 57  is more realistic  So we get to 55  based on volume  55  to 57  is probably a couple of years out  but it s based on the mix and the introduction of our new products Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research  Your line is open Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    AnalystHi guys  thanks for taking my question  I wanted to follow up again on the gross margin  So  you re still saying 55  on  2 4 billion  even with the impact of Marvell  Can you give us  I guess  a ballpark estimate of how dilutive Marvell is by itself  And is just maybe the additional wireless mobile divestiture that s offsetting some of that  How do we think about Marvell in the context of that gross margin target Peter Kelly    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerFrom a gross margin perspective  Stacy  I think it s a rounding error  It s    what we ve talked about  it s not a significant part of our revenue just yet  We ve always said it runs sort of low to mid 50s  It s a rounding  I don t think that really has an impact on our ability to get to 55  on  2 4 billion Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    AnalystGot it  And the divested mobile businesses  was that also kind of also closer to corporate average gross margins as well  or was that not  Phonetic  Peter Kelly    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s  150 million of revenue  From memory  it might be a little bit below our regular gross margins  But again  it kind of ends up being a rounding really Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    AnalystGot it  Thank you  That s helpful  So my follow up  I just wanted to talk a little bit about the demand improvement  You said  especially  auto and industrial IoT are rebounding  Do you think this is real kind of end demand  like customer pull  or this just an inventory balance  Or would you have any way to tell    just what are you seeing in the customer channel Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerSo what we re really seeing  Stacy  is  out of China  and it s POS  So it s actually shipped through    the majority of our business in China is shipped through the distribution    through our distribution partners  But this is POS where customers have requested business and taken the business  So it s not just orders  As far as replenishment of inventory  it s not possible for us to track what the orders are actually being used for  But it s based on their run rates and increased improvements  primarily again focused in micros for the industrial space  as well as our automotive business  I m not sure what the impact or implications  as we said earlier  will be from the coronavirus  But through just before the Lunar New Year  we continued to see strong POS and strong sell through Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    AnalystGot it  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse  Your line is open John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystYeah  good morning  guys  Congratulations on the solid results  Rick  Kurt  it s nice to see you guys get back to year over year growth in the March quarter  even excluding the Marvell acquisition  But my first question is just on the Marvell acquisition  Rick  when you guys announced the deal  you had put out some pretty  I wouldn t say aggressive targets  but targets for significant growth of that asset through your distribution business  I know  you ve given a specific guidance for the calendar first quarter  But I wonder if you could just level set everybody on the call as to how you feel about sort of the long term growth of that Marvell asset and how we should think about the yearly sort of revenue levels to get to that  600 million sort of rev target you talked about when you first announced the deal Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerI think  we still feel as confident about the business  as good about the business as we talk about  John  It really is about the fact that 60  of our apps processors have connectivity associated with it  So  as we make those reference designs in place  we can obviously provide our own connectivity solutions  which puts us in a good position  The additional distribution  feet on the street that we have with the channel    broad channel base we have  we think  also positions us quite well  That means that it s going to be a ramp that will take place as all of that comes to fruition  So  the  600 million out in time  we ll clearly be growing at a faster rate at the end of that period than it will be this quarter and next year  We feel good about the business and think all of the feedback from customers had been extremely positive about how important it is  And I ll let Kurt make some comments Kurt Sievers    PresidentYes  Thanks Rick  And let me just add  John  for those of you who possibly have been at our booth at CES in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago  I think we have turned at light speed the availability of the Marvell connectivity assets into reference design  So we were able at CES  just a couple of weeks actually after closing the deal  to show a number of reference designs  which did include already the Wi Fi product from the former Marvell  into our reference designs for both automotive infotainment connectivity  as well as industrial and IoT applications  And I would just tell you that the interest level and the engagement with customers on that combined solution is as big as we had anticipated John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystThat s helpful  And then  as my follow up  just looking at your auto business in the calendar fourth quarter  only down slightly year over year  which relative to peers appears to be significant outperformance  Kurt  I wonder if you could just comment about how the core business performed in the calendar fourth quarter versus kind of the growth segments  And as you look out over the next couple of years  with some of the product specific drivers you have  do you think your growth rate as a multiple of SAARs improves from what it s historically been Kurt Sievers    PresidentThanks  John  So  on Q4  yes  I think  our decline rate with only 1 percentage point has significantly improved over the much higher decline rates in the earlier quarters last year  So absolutely  yes  And clearly  that is a function of  what I would say  a continued growth of our growth elements  being radar BMS  mainly  and I d say  a good improvement of the core business  which is very much in line with what we had anticipated  given a careful ending of the rationalization of the supply chain  That s what we have said all year long  that we would hit that point  And that s also what carries forward into quarter one  which is then reflected  Phonetic  with what Rick just said  solid POS trends  especially in China  where that core product is a key part of our revenue Going forward  John  we totally stick to our model of clearly outgrowing the SAAR  based on the content gains of semis  We gave that guidance of 7  to 10   based on a 1  to 2  SAAR  So if the SAAR is flattish  well  maybe then we are at 5   6   7  or so  And I d say  the ratio between core and growth initially stays the same  Over time  when the growth portion is getting bigger from a relative perspective  it might tilt slightly toward higher growth on the toll  Phonetic   But in principle  we are just seeing now what we have anticipated  which is that the core is more getting back to normal  given the SAAR coming from a minus 6  environment last year into a probably flattish environment this year Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerJohn  one thing if I could just add to that  if you go back and look at the declines we had in our automotive business  which was kind of mid to high single digit earlier in the year  our top tier customers in automotive were actually flat  And where we really saw the significant decline was in the mass market and our distribution partners in automotive  So that s where we re beginning to see the rebound associated with that  where we had such a negative decline in those  and then beginning to see the rest of the business come together  So it really has to do with that combination  I thought it s important to point out that our top tier customers in automotive didn t really see a significant decline but were actually flat during this period of time John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks guys  Nice to see the outperformance Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerThanks John OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust  Your line is open William Stein    SunTrust    AnalystHey  great  Thanks for taking my questions  two  First  Rick  I think at some conferences in the last quarter or so  you ve talked about repurchasing 2 plus billion dollars of shares in the coming year  Can you maybe frame that up relative to your expectations for free cash flow in the coming year  your appetite for raising additional debt in order to keep the net leverage at 2 times  and maybe any appetite on the horizon for similar tuck in acquisitions like Marvell Peter Kelly    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey Will  it s Peter  I think I d describe it as follows  first of all  the Board has authorized  2 billion  So technically  that wasn t a forecast of how much we d spend in the full year  but we just spent  230 million in basically the first six weeks of this quarter  So once we get started on these things  we don t cease  What we have said is  we will return all excess cash to shareholders and we will manage our net debt at 2 times trailing 12 months EBITDA  So depending on your forecast  that require us to take on a little bit of extra debt to maintain the leverage  And I won t give you an absolute number for the full year because it really depends on what you want to forecast for us  But I think we re an exciting company  I think  once the market comes back  you ll see significant growth from us  and that will drive very  very significant cash flow generation  which we ll return to our shareholders  So   Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerAnd relative to the other M A that you asked about  Will  I think the important thing to realize is  we ve been talking about connectivity being a critical element for us for some time  We actually talked about it going into the Qualcomm transaction  And when the Qualcomm transaction broke  we actually were quite open about the fact that the missing element we had would be connectivity  Clearly  the assets from Marvell put us in a position to have leadership connectivity  which was really the missing element for us  So  yeah  I think we ll do relatively small tuck in acquisitions for technology  but nothing at the scope and size of Marvell  And clearly  we ll be focused on how we return cash to our shareholders during this period of time William Stein    SunTrust    AnalystThat s really helpful  Thank you  If I can have one follow up  in automotive  I m hoping you can frame up the timing of the various more growthy opportunities  For 2020 and maybe looking into 2021  should we expect the growth to be driven more by the emerging radar solutions  the battery management stuff  or the new network domain controllers  Thanks so much Kurt Sievers    PresidentThis is Kurt  Let me try to stage this a little  From a size perspective  it is led by radar  being about 10  of the total auto segment revenue  and we continue to absolutely see our midterm growth here with 25  to 30  compound annual revenue growth  So that s the biggest and fastest growing from those  The next one  about the similar size  digital cluster business  So  that follows the trends of multi screen environments in the passenger cabin of the modern cars  where we see a growth in the mid teens  And then  you have a number of smaller ones  and they are smaller because they are much earlier in the growth cycle You did mention battery management solutions  This is high growth  but significantly smaller than the others  But it does contribute already into the 2020 and 2021 growth  And what you also mentioned is the S32G  which I think had a great show up at CES  which is our new fully ASIL D compliant network processor for the car  That is actually really launching into the market only in 2021  So from a growth contribution into 2021  I d say it s at the late end kicking in  But we are sampling now and we are getting traction now William Stein    SunTrust    AnalystThank you Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerAnd ultrawideband will begin to kick in as well in the second half Kurt Sievers    PresidentYes  Rick  thanks for the reminder  Ultrawideband is our    say  in between mobile and auto  which is why I didn t put it now fully into auto  but indeed  we are already shipping small amounts now into auto  Second half of this year  we re going to see the first more material lift in revenues from ultrawideband in the mobile segment and then extending into auto through the next few years  So again  summary is  the two large ones  radar and digital clusters  both about 10  of the total order revenue  radar 25  to 30  growth  digital clusters  mid teens William Stein    SunTrust    AnalystThanks for those reminders  Congrats again Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Will OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYes  Thank you  I just want to follow up on ultrawideband comments and just how you think about kind of the ecosystem  where NXP kind of fits in  and the different applications  as you see them ramping Kurt Sievers    PresidentYeah  thanks Craig  I d say  we    I continue to see us as one of the initiators and leaders of the ecosystem  which really stems from our former leadership in the security and mobile wallet applications  including software on the mobile side  as well as the keyless entry applications on the auto side  And as we talked about earlier  the first major use case which we see coming up now is actually using ultrawideband for mobile based secure car access  which is a perfect  I d say  hybrid and convergence between these two leadership positions  which we have had historically Now  the competitive dynamics  I d say  judging from the traffic around this at CES  ultrawideband has now really hit everybody s attention relative to a very precise localization technology  a technology which allows mobile access    secure mobile access ahead of any other possible technologies  So it s really in the spot light now  We continue to see very  very good traction with our solution portfolio actually in this convergence space  initially between mobile and auto  But now  we also start to see more traction  I would say  for further IoT application use cases going into  21   22 probably revenue range  when it comes to  for example  property access solutions and indoor navigation Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerOne of the key things that really differentiates our solution is our secure element technology and the software that we provide and the ability to leverage that for the ultrawideband  So we re really in a unique position to bring that installed base that we have in the mobile wallet and leveraging that for ultrawideband  as Kurt talked about Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Thanks for that  And then  just as a follow up  I think  one of the common themes through this earnings season has been the pause in 5G infrastructure  And so  Rick  could you just give us  Phonetic  a sense in terms of what you re seeing  kind of what you re hearing out there and if there s any different trends by geography Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerThe 5G infrastructure  the expectations of real strong growth comes from China  And clearly  there is a churn going on in China right now  not only with the suppliers  but also with the different standards and the different combination of carriers and their technology  So we ve talked about  for a quarter or so  a pause  We really saw the strength last year from the deployment of the massive MIMO that will ultimately be used for 5G  But we actually got through a lot of that so that it was in the pipeline  if you will  And then  we haven t seen a resumption of the 5G growth yet  And it looks like it ll still be a couple of quarters out before we ll see strong growth in 5G deployment  We clearly see that it s coming  just don t see it in the near term Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank  Your line is now open Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi  guys  Congrats on turning the cyclical corner  Just wanted to ask a question about the industrial and IoT business  That one has been very volatile  I know  it s a very disty heavy business and has its own share of China exposure  But can you just talk about the return to 20  growth  How much of that is organic  Are you putting Marvell in there as well in the quarter  And from a cycle to cycle perspective  how do you think that business is shaping up heading into 2020 versus  I think  the volatile 2019 Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerSo  Ross  the one thing that you should be clear  we talked about that Marvell will be about  60 million in Q1  So it s nearly half of the growth of the industrial and IoT in that 22  year over year  We d probably be more like 12  or so without Marvell in  But that being said  12  year on year growth is a long ways from where we ve been for the last four  five quarters and feels really good  And again  what we see from that it s really POS and the ship through primarily in China  We don t see real strength in Europe or in the US  but really it s POS and ship through in China in industrial and IoT Now  the other thing that is a key factor for us is the deployment of some of this company specific design wins that will contribute to that and be a factor associated with it  But basically  on a stand alone basis  we d probably be more like 12  than the 22  and probably be flat on a sequential basis versus the 9  that we are    when you include Marvell  Kurt  anything else you   Kurt Sievers    PresidentYes  I d say  clearly  we see full support of our 8  to 11  growth target going forward  So that s maybe then the perspective you should look at this in hopefully what is somewhat more normal quarters in the near and midterm future On the specific design wins  clearly the Marvell synergy  which we talked about earlier  in the reference designs is a very helpful element  Secondly  we see continued great traction on the crossover products  So we think about a  60 million run rate from last year  which we have all confidence that it should double this year  So that s on track with how we talked about it earlier And finally  I m personally really excited and proud about the i MX 8M Plus product  which we showed first time in Las Vegas  That s a 14 nanometer neural net processor  actually the first neural net processor which NXP has ever launched  We got silicon back from the factory just before Christmas  And the team has done a superb job to get it running on a demo at CES in Vegas  which really gets  I would say  AI performance at the edge on a much  much higher value to dollar than you would get from what people have done so far on GPUs  So I really think that s a breakthrough product from a performance cost combination perspective into what I would call the secure edge and IoT So it s of course early  I cannot yet say there is    that number of design wins because we just showed the product now  But from the interest it gains and from the promise it delivers for secure edge processing  very  very exciting Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThanks for all those details  As my follow up  I just wanted to head over onto the opex side  and one for Peter  You re really helpful on the gross margin side with the revenue levels and the levers to get to the 55  and eventually the 57   I want to see if you could put some sort of framework around the operating margin or maybe the opex intensity  I think  in the past  you ve talked about targets of roughly 23  of sales is your opex intensity  Can you just talk about the puts and takes  Especially with the acquisition of Marvell coming in and the divestiture of that mobile business going out  how should we think about opex and or operating margin going forward Peter Kelly    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  one way to think about it    we disclosed that in the fourth quarter  Marvell s revenue    revenue from Marvell was about  6 million  I think the opex was about  8 million  which was just less than a full month  So  that gives you an idea of what quarterly run rate would be  And from a income perspective  I think in the fourth quarter  it was a hit of about  8 million  So  as we go forward  you would add in Marvell into the first quarter  So that s a big chunk of additional costs  You ve got AIP  Phonetic   The opex associated with VAS would be relatively small  I want to say  I don t know  maybe  6 million or  7 million  It s not a huge amount of money that pops out of the Company I think  the more important part of your question  Ross  is  where are we planning to be  And our goal is still to run 16  R D and 7  SG A  I kind of hate to admit it  but I think  it has to be in a more normal market and maybe we re getting back there where you see some growth in    a normal growth in revenue  But we re targeting it very hard and we plan to get there  It s always a question of how quickly we get there Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from C J  Muse from Evercore  Your line is open C J  Muse    Evercore ISI    AnalystYeah  Good morning  Thank you for taking the question  I guess  a follow up to Ross  question on the opex side  So it sounds like  for the March quarter  you re including Marvell  excluding the divested mobile biz  As we push forward beyond the March quarter  how should we think of the trajectory of opex Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerI think you should think about it that as our revenue gets back to more of a normalized basis  we ll be still targeting for the 16  R D and the 7  SG A that Peter talked about  We won t be there for the next couple of quarters because of the revenue trough that we ve been in  But as we work our way through that growth  I think  we clearly have the objective to be able to achieve that and feel comfortable about the actions we have in place to be sure we can achieve it Peter Kelly    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I don t want to say it s totally linked to revenue  But we were    in the fourth quarter  at  2 3 billion  we were 16 and    16 7   Phonetic   16 5  something like that and just over 7 5  in SG A  So I think once we get to the kind of  2 4 billion level  we re getting pretty close to the opex numbers we want to hit C J  Muse    Evercore ISI    AnalystExcellent  And I guess  as my follow up  I guess two part here  On the free cash flow margin side  I think you ve talked about a near term target of 25   Yet you did a great job and hit 28   29  in the second half of the year  though that was a little bit helped by working cap  So  curious  thinking into  20  into  21  what is your goal there  And then  just as a quick kind of follow up  any update in terms of the S P 500 inclusion  Thank you Peter Kelly    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  let me talk to the S P inclusion at the moment  So  as you know and as we ve said in the past  it s just an incredibly opaque process  We believe we qualify and we believe that probably waiting for our K to be filed  which will be our first significant document  quickly followed by our proxy  So to be honest  you probably know as much as we do  We ve been using our friends and family to try and help us get a better understanding and to push S P  But they are pretty    as I said  they re pretty opaque  despite the best efforts of us and our bankers  But we believe we qualify  So it ought to be just a question of time Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerBut please feel free to reach out to them and ask them directly Jeff Palmer    Vice President of Investor RelationsAnd C J   it s Jeff  We really don t have a free cash flow margin target stated  What we have said is that we will pay out 25  of cash flow from operations in dividend  That s our target long term  And then  more holistically  what we said is  we will return all excess free cash flow to our shareholders via buybacks and dividend  So there is no stated corporate free cash flow margin target C J  Muse    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you Jeff Palmer    Vice President of Investor RelationsOperator  one last question here today  please OperatorThank you  sir  And we ll take our final question from Chris Caso from Raymond James  Your line is open Chris Caso    Raymond James    AnalystYes  Thank you  Good morning  The question is on mobile  First  from a short term perspective  it looks like the guidance is roughly seasonal  Is that how you characterize the environment there  And then  as we look out through the year  your mobile wallet was a big driver of mobile segment revenue last year  You talked about increasing attach rate  Is that something still to be expected this year  And with some of the growth last year  I guess  is there any concern of lingering inventory issues in mobile  Thank you Kurt Sievers    PresidentChris  let me go through the mobile attach rate first  mobile wallet  Yes  we are on track to our earlier stated target of an attach rate 50  exiting  21  I think the interim mark from last year is probably about 35   which we consider on track  So the answer to your question is  yes  There is continued attach rate increase  We are in the middle of the game  and there is more to come toward  21  And then  beyond that  as I talked about in one of the earlier questions  ultrawideband  which is a similar technology but totally complementary to mobile wallet  It s going to come in on top of this  again  very strongly driving content in mobile  independent of run rate  actually Now  on the inventory question  no  I d say  we have no visibility of anything particularly concerning on the mobile side  And seasonality  I think  in the current environment  I really wouldn t want to go into any discussion about seasonality because it s really hard to say when the industry goes through a cycle as it currently does  In general  it is  however  important to note that our mobile business is not as it used to be a single customer game  So we have broadened our business into especially a number of Chinese players  which makes it probably different to what you would have expected from the past in terms of seasonality anyway Chris Caso    Raymond James    AnalystThank you  And as a follow up  maybe I can ask a little more on what you said on ultrawideband  And you mentioned a number of applications for that and a number of areas for which it ll have exposure  Perhaps  if we look at it in the short term and the longer term  which areas do you think are expected to be most impactful as we look out into next year  Is it more on the mobile side or the IoT side  more on the auto side  And where do you think the longer    where s the most opportunity over the longer term Kurt Sievers    PresidentWell  so first of all  there is a very small baseline  which is actually small in size  but it s significant from giving evidence of the strength of the technology  which is in auto  So we are shipping as we speak ultrawideband into key fobs  So that s all about mobile access  It s the classic key fob form factor  but it is ultrawideband technology  which is being picked up and used for more secure applications against relay station attacks  So that is running as we speak  but it s really small  And then  the first meaningful lift in the second half of 2020 is going to be in mobile  But the use case is very strongly focused on mobile car access  So the revenue goes into mobile  and of course on the counter side  in auto  but mobile is going to have the higher volumes for the use case of car access  That s what we see kicking in second half 2020  And all these other nice applications I mentioned earlier  especially in IoT  are then layered into the coming years Chris Caso    Raymond James    AnalystGreat  Thank you Rick Clemmer    Chief Executive OfficerGreat  So let me just take this opportunity to thank all of our investors for their support through this difficult semiconductor cycle we ve been through in 2019  We re encouraged that we see some of the initial near term improvements  specifically in China  in sell through and more of a stabilization in some of the other regions  which puts us in a good position to get back on strong growth going forward from the company specific design wins and the portfolio that we ve been able to put in place  We think that that will bode well for us and give us the opportunity to significantly outgrow the market  and as we get to the kind of margin level that we d like to be at  clearly generate a significant amount of cash that we plan on focusing on returning to our shareholders So we re excited about the future and the opportunity associated with it  albeit somewhat concerned about the impact of the coronavirus  which clearly we have not reflected and don t know what that really will be yet  but are clearly excited about the opportunities going into 2020 and returning to more of a normal semiconductor market  combined with the company specific design wins that will be ramping for us in 2020 that will allow us to continue to grow at a significant rate  So thank you very much Jeff Palmer    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you Operator

153184,374700,NXPI,NXP Semiconductors Started Bouncing Back Already,news,"Embedded chip maker NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  reported fourth quarter results late Monday evening  The company edged out Wall Street s revenue targets while smashing analysts  earnings estimates  despite modest or even falling year over year comparisons 
NXP Semiconductors  fourth quarter results by the numbers

Data source  NXP Semiconductors  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
Sales fell by single digit percentages year over year in all four of NXP s reported target markets  At the same time  the fourth quarter drops were smaller than NXP s full year declines in the automotive and industrial segments  In both cases  the reported results also came in above the midpoints of management s guidance targets  All things considered  it looks like these key markets are ready to swing back from a few dark quarters of sliding sales and modest operating profits 
The view from the inside
CEO Rick Clemmer supported this analysis in the earnings call 
 We are confident that as new products ramp into volume production  they will underpin both our top line growth  our longer term gross margin targets  and will yield significant cash flow   Clemmer said   Then  as the end markets begin to rebound  which we are beginning to initially see  especially in our automotive and industrial end markets  we anticipate a healthy improvement in our core business  which will also provide positive tailwinds to growth  
Within the automotive computing rebound  NXP is already recording double digit sales growth for radar components and battery management solutions  Both of these sub markets factor into the rising interest in self driving and electric vehicles  in both cases led by major NXP client Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  

What s next for NXP 
Based on these results and market trends  NXP offered guidance for the first quarter of 2020  At the midpoint of each target range  management s first quarter guidance calls for revenues to rise by approximately 6  to  2 22 billion  Adjusted operating profits should land near  613 million  10  above the year ago period s result 
This wasn t exactly a snappy return to full health  but NXP seems to have bounced off the bottom of a cyclical trough period  The company is reporting stable sales and management sees further improvements developing in NXP s most important markets  The overall tenor of NXP s report carried echoes of semiconductor peers Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS  and Intel  NASDAQ INTC   both of whom posted solid results alongside rosy guidance over the last couple of weeks 
So it looks like we re standing in the middle of a sectorwide recovery here  All of the stocks mentioned above are already crushing the broader market s returns over the last 52 weeks and I wouldn t be surprised to see this broad outperformance sticking around as the financial rebound trends play out  The bottom of this cycle passed us by in the summer of 2019 but it s not too late to take advantage of some great buy in opportunities on high quality tech stocks ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prywj,2077865

153210,374726,NXPI,Infineon Will Buy Cypress Semi in Latest Chip Mega Deal,news," Bloomberg     Want the lowdown on European markets  In your inbox before the open  every day  Sign up here 
Infineon Technologies AG  DE IFXGn  agreed to buy Cypress Semiconductor Corp   NASDAQ CY  in a deal that values the U S  target at about  10 billion including debt  the latest mega deal for an industry grappling with slowing growth 
The deal confers an enterprise value of 9 billion euros   10 billion  on Cypress  a memory chip maker re positioning itself as a provider to automobiles and other connected devices  Infineon s cash offer of  23 85 a share marks a 46  premium to Cypress s average price over the past 30 days  the companies said in a statement confirming an earlier Bloomberg report 
Shares of Infineon fell as much as 6 5  during early trading Monday in Frankfurt 
The semiconductor industry has been reshaped over the past five years as companies combine to gain scale while fighting rising costs and shrinking customer bases   NXP Semiconductors  NV  NASDAQ NXPI  recently announced a  1 76 billion deal for Marvell Technology Group Ltd  s Wi Fi connectivity business  while Nvidia Corp  agreed to buy chipmaker Mellanox Technologies Ltd  for  6 9 billion in March 
But Infineon until now has mostly sat on the sidelines  It s lost almost a third of its value over the past year  as the European chipmaker twice revised its forecasts to account for global economic uncertainty and a slowdown in Chinese car sales  Infineon s offer values Cypress at roughly  8 7 billion based on its outstanding shares alone  excluding debt 
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Infineon s reported plans to acquire Cypress may result in some arduous integration work  with the buyer focused on power chips and the target on Internet of Things and specialty memory  Infineon makes about a quarter of its sales in China  which has turned into a headwind as the economy slows  It will need stronger 2H sales to meet its 8 billion euro sales guidance 
   Anand Srinivasan and Johnathan Ritucci  analysts  Click here to read the research
Infineon s target designs and manufactures flash memory chips and microcontrollers  or chips used for powering small electronic devices 
Cypress has been trying to recast itself as a provider of chips for use in vehicles and the growing market for so called internet of things  the push by the electronics industry to connect devices  It s told investors it expects its automotive business to grow 8  to 12  over the next five years and its IoT unit to expand at as much as 14  in that period

153269,374785,NXPI,Chinese Takeover of European Tech Assets Set for Greater Scrutiny,news," Bloomberg     Chinese investors have renewed their billion dollar shopping spree for high tech assets in Europe  but new rules from the European Union promise greater scrutiny of such acquisitions 
The technology sector in particular has been an important target as China is intent on developing its own semiconductor production to lessen its dependence on foreign technology 
EU negotiators last week approved the first bloc wide rules to prevent foreign investments from threatening national security  largely driven by unease over acquisitions by Chinese companies 
Under the new rules  authorities are likely to intensify their scrutiny of so called dual use technology that can be tapped by both the civilian and military sectors  according to Mikko Huotari  deputy director at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin  France and Germany in particular are likely to train their eyes more closely on acquisitions from China  he said 
Chinese acquirers have been behind  4 4 billion worth of European deals so far this year  up almost two times the volume for 2017  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
Under the new law  EU governments will be allowed to request information and offer comments on a foreign direct investment in a particular member country  The nation in which the investment was planned would have to take any remarks and opinions into account when deciding on the deal 
EU officials hope the mechanism will provide a broader overview of Chinese investment in Europe amid concerns that companies with indirect ties to the state are snapping up strategically important businesses 
Economy Minister Margarete Schramboeck of Austria  which holds the EU s rotating presidency and negotiated the Nov  20 accord on behalf of the bloc s national governments  called the 2016 acquisition of German robotics company Kuka by Chinese appliance maker Midea Group a  wake up call  for the bloc s politicians The attempted purchase of Aixtron SE  a German supplier of semiconductor equipment  by a consortium of Chinese investors also fanned concerns in both Europe and the U S  The deal derailed in late 2016 after the Obama administration blocked it on national security grounds 
Schramboeck stressed that the EU mechanism isn t aimed only at Chinese investments  Still  China appears to feel targeted by the measures 
In reaction to last week s agreement  the Mission of China to the EU said investments in Europe by the nation s companies aren t part of a political strategy and that it hopes the EU can  steer clear of trade protectionism  
The new rules still need official approval from the EU governments and the European Parliament  The legislation is on track to take effect at around the end of 2020 
While deals like Kuka and Aixtron sparked heated debate  many other Chinese acquisitions in Europe s tech sector have flown through with little alarm  That could change under the future system  which is designed to raise awareness among officials about who is investing where 
 Step by step  we are creating a bloc wide method for raising questions   said Franck Proust  a French member of the European Parliament who helped negotiate the agreement   We are determined under the new system to gain information about the ultimate investor and to understand the context of the investment  
Sweden s Silex Microsystems  which manufactures sensors that are used in handsets  cars  medical and other devices  was indirectly acquired in 2015 via a holding company by NAV Technology Co  Ltd  The Chinese parent is an investment company that invests in navigation systems  which can be used both for civilian and military purposes 
In one of the largest ever Chinese acquisitions in the Netherlands  JAC Capital  a subsidiary of a state owned investment company  and Wise Road Capital in 2016 jointly bought a spin off of  NXP Semiconductors  NV  NASDAQ NXPI  called Nexperia  The company  which manufactures semiconductors for the automobile industry  has since become the target of Chinese smartphone manufacturer Wingtech Technology Co   which in late October said it s acquiring the firm for 25 2 billion yuan   3 6 billion  
For many European companies  Chinese ownership has meant access to much needed capital that is sometimes hard to come by in Europe  But greater regulatory scrutiny on such deals in the future could restrict those options ",2018-11-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinese-takeover-of-european-tech-assets-set-for-greater-scrutiny-1704466,1704466

153303,374819,NXPI,U S  touts EU trade truce  attention now turns to China,news,By Steve Holland and David Lawder WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States signaled on Thursday it is set to push ahead on trade talks with Canada and Mexico after agreeing to suspend hostilities over tariffs with Europe in a fragile deal that may clear the way for renewed pressure on China  A surprise deal struck on Wednesday will see Washington suspend the imposition of any new tariffs on the European Union  including a proposed 25 percent levy on auto imports  and hold talks over tariffs on imports of European steel and aluminum  The deal boosted share markets initially  and U S  industrial shares were stronger on Thursday as fears of a trade war with Europe ebbed   Both sides claimed victory in the deal  reached by Trump and European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker in Washington  In return for the talks and a suspension of auto tariffs  the EU will import more soybeans and energy from the United States  A White House official told Reuters that Juncker had shown greater flexibility than expected in the talks and that while there was no deadline for an overall deal  Trump retained the power to impose tariffs if progress was not made   One key aspect of the agreement  according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity  was that the two sides had agreed to work together to tackle China s market abuses    They want to work together with us on China and they want to help us reform the WTO  World Trade Organization    said the official  adding that the Europeans came into the talks  with a real positive spirit   Trump has announced a series of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports in a bid to halt a Chinese surge in high technology industries that threatens to displace U S  dominance  Both the U S  and the EU charge that Chinese companies steal company secrets  On the North American Free Trade Agreement talks with Canada and Mexico  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he was  hopeful that we ll have an agreement in principal in the near future    Whether it s one deal or two deals  so long as we get the right agreement  we re indifferent   Mnuchin told CNBC  Trump and officials from his administration said the EU had given ground by agreeing to import more American goods and to hold talks on tariff reductions including on cars  an industry in which Trump has accused Europe of imposing heavy duties   EU officials said little had been given away by Juncker and that Europe had emerged as the winner by getting Trump to defer the threatened car tariffs which would have hit European carmakers hard  The deal was hailed by commentators in the United States and Europe for drawing back from an escalation in a trade war that had threatened to take the world back to the kind of protectionism not seen since the 1930s  although some cautioned the relief may be only temporary  French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to challenge the deal  saying on Thursday he would not discuss agriculture in talks with the United States  If it holds  the US EU pact could allow both to focus on China  whose economic rise threatens both  Lawmakers in Washington on Thursday passed legislation to slow Chinese investment in U S  companies  In Europe  alarm bells have been sounded over China s growing economic influence there   U S  and EU will be allied in the fight against China  which has broken the world trading system  in effect   Trump s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said   President Juncker made it very clear yesterday that he intended to help us  President Trump  on the China problem   CASUALTIES IN TRADE FIGHT Since taking office last year  Trump has implemented policies to restrict what he sees as unfair competition from other countries  He tore up an agreement to join a Pacific trade pact  has threatened to pull out of NAFTA  and imposed steel and aluminum tariffs aimed at China  In an effort to rein in China s high technology industries that he charges have stolen intellectual property from American companies  Trump has ramped up threats of tariffs on  50 billion worth of imports from China to  450 billion after China retaliated with its own duties on imports from the United States  The impact has fallen mainly on U S  farmers and Republican party lawmakers  A move by Trump to offset farmers  losses with a  12 billion aid package drew criticism with farmers saying they wanted access to markets rather than subsidies   U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  a veteran of trade negotiations from former President Ronald Reagan s administration in the 1980s who is Trump s top trade official  told lawmakers in Washington that the United States could not afford to capitulate to China economically   I don t think it s a stupid fight   Lighthizer said of the trade battle with China in heated exchanges in the Senate   I don t know a single person that has read this report that thinks it s a stupid fight to say China should not be able to come in and steal the future of American industry   A more conciliatory tone emerged from Mnuchin  who told CNBC the United States was willing to reopen trade talks with China if Beijing was willing to make  serious changes   as he said the EU had indicated it was willing to do  In May  the United States and China initially appeared willing to strike a deal that would see China reduce its  350 billion surplus in the trading of goods by buying more U S  agriculture and energy products   That deal fell apart quickly and has been replaced with a rising tally of tariff retaliation that has led to Trump threatening tariffs on almost everything the United States imports from China  China has threatened to retaliate dollar for dollar  and its refusal to sign off on regulatory approval caused a  44 billion deal from  Qualcomm Inc   O QCOM  to buy  NXP Semiconductors   O NXPI  to fall apart  a move that showed U S  companies were being targeted

Activist Elliott first announced a stake in NXP a year ago  launching a campaign to push for a higher price tag in the Qualcomm deal  which drove the bid up from  38 billion 
Qualcomm s acquisition of NXP failed when the Chinese regulator refused to approve the deal by a deadline on June 25 
China s State Administration for Market Regulator said in a statement in Friday that proposals put forth by the firms to resolve antitrust concerns were insufficient  but it hoped to continue communication with Qualcomm 
Elliott reduced its position to 3 5 percent  from 5 5 percent  a filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission on July 31 showed  It is no longer NXP s top shareholder

 As far as I know  the two sides don t have contact to renew talks   Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said at a regular press conference on Thursday in Beijing   We have said many times that the premise for negotiations is to be faithful and honor one s own words  
While both sides have hinted at restarting talks  the last official talks were in early June  and since then both sides have imposed tariffs on each other  While the two nations seemed close to a deal in May  the collapse of that left Chinese officials embarrassed and they re worried that they might get played again  according to three Chinese officials who asked not to be identified discussing strategy 
The U S  has started and escalated trade tensions to meet its domestic political agenda  and the extreme pressure and blackmail from the U S  won t work on China  Gao said  commenting on President Donald Trump s threat that he is  ready to go  to impose tariffs on all  500 billion in U S  imports from China 
Gao declined to confirm if the bid by U S  company Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  to acquire  NXP Semiconductors  NV  NASDAQ NXPI  was vetoed by the Chinese government  but stressed that any decision would be about market monopoly and wasn t related to the trade tensions  NXP announced earlier Thursday that Qualcomm had ended the pact to purchase it 
Gao also said it is a good thing that the U S  and the European Union could reach a truce on trade  but  China will closely watch to see if the bilateral statement can really be realized

This chipmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 25 97  
For the last reported quarter  NXP came out with earnings of  2 42 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 93 per share  representing a surprise of 25 39   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 77 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 24 per share  delivering a surprise of 26 55  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for NXP lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
NXP currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 13   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-nxp-nxpi-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200497372,200497372

153341,374857,NXPI,NXP Semiconductors  NXPI  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 3  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 28 billion  down 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 23  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NXP 
For NXP  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 04  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that NXP will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NXP would post earnings of  1 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 42  delivering a surprise of  25 39  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NXP appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nxp-semiconductors-nxpi-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200501890,200501890

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
NXP shares have lost about 0 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s decline of  0 2  
What s Next for NXP 
While NXP has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for NXP was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

153380,374896,NXPI,Should Value Investors Consider NXP Semiconductors  NXPI  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put NXP Semiconductors N V    NASDAQ NXPI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  NXP Semiconductors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 71  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 43  If we focus on the long term PE trend  NXP Semiconductors  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 52  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that NXP Semiconductors has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 98  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  NXP Semiconductors has a P S ratio of about 3 23  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 25 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  NXPI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  NXP Semiconductors currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NXP Semiconductors a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for NXP Semiconductors is just 1 12  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 99  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio comes in at 8 85  which is lower than the industry average of 14 25  Clearly  NXPI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall    Though NXP Semiconductors might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives NXPI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen nine estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen ten downward revision compared to one upward in the same time period      This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 7 6  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has declined by 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below NXP Semiconductors N V  Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  NXP Semiconductors is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 25  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ,2019-09-24,Zacks Investment

153381,374897,NXPI,Analysts Estimate NXP Semiconductors  NXPI  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 24 billion  down 8 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 38  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NXP 
For NXP  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NXP will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NXP would post earnings of  1 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 24  delivering a surprise of  26 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NXP doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-nxp-semiconductors-nxpi-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200475740,200475740
153382,374898,NXPI,NXP Semiconductors  NXPI  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 42 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 93 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 01 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 25 39   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  1 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 24  delivering a surprise of 26 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
NXP  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed industry  posted revenues of  2 27 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 20   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 45 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
NXP shares have added about 44 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 6  
What s Next for NXP 
While NXP has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for NXP was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 07 on  2 27 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 57 on  8 82 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed is currently in the top 41  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nxp-semiconductors-nxpi-beats-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200479260,200479260

153388,374904,NXPI,China Pledges  Significantly  More U S  Buying  No Trade War,news," Bloomberg     China will  significantly increase purchases  of U S  goods  the White House said as Beijing s special envoy at talks in Washington declared a trade war has been averted between the world s two largest economies 
A joint statement released by the White House following the talks didn t place a dollar figure on the increased purchases by China  or address a comment by President Donald Trump s top economic adviser suggesting Beijing had agreed to slash its annual trade surplus with the U S  by  200 billion 
Vice Premier Liu He  a special envoy of China s President Xi Jinping  told reporters in Washington that talks with U S  officials  including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  ended with a pledge not to engage in a trade war  according to a Xinhua news agency report 
Liu said the two sides agreed to stop  slapping tariffs  on each other  Xinhua reported  Liu said his trip to the U S  had been positive  pragmatic  constructive and productive  Trade cooperation would be enhanced in such areas as energy  agriculture  health care  high tech products and finance  a  win win  choice for both nations 
China agreed to  meaningful increases in U S  agriculture and energy exports   the White House said  adding that the U S  will send a team to China to work out the details 
Trade Deficit
 There was a consensus on taking effective measures to substantially reduce the United States trade deficit in goods with China   the White House said 
The delegations also discussed expanding trade in manufactured goods  and each side agreed to strengthen cooperation on intellectual property  China will  advance relevant amendments  to its laws and and regulations in that area  including its patent law  the White House said 
On Friday morning  Larry Kudlow  director of the National Economic Council  told reporters that China had offered to reduce its annual trade surplus with the U S  by  at least  200 billion  
 The number s a good number   Kudlow said outside the White House 
Conciliatory Stance
Earlier  two posts on Chinese state social media disputed a report that China planned to slash its trade surplus by the extent demanded by Washington though increased imports of U S  products  A foreign ministry official also played down the suggestion 
In a sign that the Chinese government is seeking a conciliatory stance  it announced on Friday it was ending an anti dumping and anti subsidy investigation into imports of U S  sorghum  citing  public interest   That move came days after it restarted a review of Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  s application to acquire  NXP Semiconductors  NV  NASDAQ NXPI  
A  200 billion reduction in the U S  trade gap with China by 2020 was on a list of demands the U S  made earlier this month as Mnuchin led a delegation to Beijing  That mission left with little common ground with China and reports emerging of infighting among the U S  officials  The U S  merchandise trade deficit with China hit a record  375 billion last year 
Mnuchin and Kudlow will appear on U S  political talk shows on Sunday 
Trump s administration has threatened to impose tariffs on as much as  150 billion of Chinese imports to the U S  as tensions over trade have escalated  Trump expressed doubt before his meeting with Liu that China and the U S  would come to an agreement to avoid a damaging trade war 
ZTE Silence
Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer criticized a lack of specific measures in the joint statement to protect U S  intellectual property and stop China  from keeping our best goods until we hand over our trade secrets  
Schumer noted that the statement also didn t mention ZTE Corp  HK 0763    the Chinese telecom company that Trump a week ago ordered the U S  Commerce Department to get help back into business after  too many jobs in China lost  because of recent U S  action 
 If the administration capitulates on ZTE and allows it to continue to exist   Schumer said   that will signal to President Xi that we are weak negotiators  
Kudlow said Friday that ZTE may need to change its management to win a reprieve from U S  sanctions that shut it off from key parts suppliers ",2018-05-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-pledges-significantly-more-us-buying-no-trade-war-1454709,1454709

A Qualcomm team and officials from the State Administration for Market Regulation  SAMR  met in Beijing on Friday and had  productive  talks  the sources said 
The San Diego based firm is now  cautiously optimistic  the deal will go forward  one of the sources said  amid recent indications of a thaw in U S  China trade tensions that has seen both sides propose tens of billions of dollars in tariffs 
On Friday  the Trump administration said it had reached a deal that would put ZTE Corp  SZ 000063   HK 0763  back in business after the Chinese telecommunications company pays a  1 3 billion fine and makes management changes 
Resolving the ZTE sales ban has been of chief importance to China s leadership  The firm was banned in April from buying U S  technology components for seven years after breaking an agreement it reached for violating U S  sanctions against Iran and North Korea 
 It feels as though it s getting close to the end   said the source quoted above 
Qualcomm did not immediately reply to an email from Reuters seeking comment on Sunday  while calls to NXP went unanswered outside regular business hours 
NEW SUBMISSION
Qualcomm is now preparing a new submission to SAMR aimed at providing final guarantees and assurances  the sources said 
China s market regulator did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment outside of business hours 
While there are no explicit ties between ZTE s problems  Sino U S  trade tensions and Qualcomm NXP merger clearance  there are  perceived linkages  and the timing of current discussions is  not coincidental   two of the sources said 
 The degree to which the two sides are moving to resolve trade tensions clearly has an impact   one source said 
Qualcomm in recent weeks has moved to restart discussions that have stalled since the end of last year 
The company in April was forced to refile its China anti trust application to clear the NXP deal  after talks reached a dead end 
Cristiano Amon  Qualcomm s president  was in China last week  attending a big data industry expo in the southwest province of Guizhou 
Earlier this month  China s anti trust regulator approved Qualcomm s investment with a unit of state owned Datang Telecom Technology Co  to design  package and test smartphone chipsets  one year after the joint venture was announced ",2018-05-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/qualcomm-to-meet-china-regulators-in-push-to-clear-44-billion-nxp-deal-sources-1464361,1464361

153415,374931,NXPI,5 Top European Stocks To Buy On ECB s Hints Of More Stimulus ,opinion,"The Euro zone indicated on Jun 18 that it could restart money printing to boost its ailing economy even though the ECB ended QE in 2018  The stimulus moves could be cutting rates even further and other expansionary measures  Draghi ruled out concerns that the ECB was short of means for any new stimulus measures 
Already  the ECB delayed the timing of its first rate hike  to the second half of 2020 at the earliest  during its June meeting  thanks to global growth concerns and tepid inflation outlook 
ECB president Draghi hinted that economic indicators point to persistent softness  Risks are skewed toward the downside  The rising threat of protectionism  possible US sanctions on EU  Brexit issuers  US China trade war and vulnerabilities in emerging markets are leading the ECB to consider a more dovish approach 
The trade war related risks have taken a toll on exports and in particular manufacturing  Inflation is also under control  with the  far below the bank s target of about 2

153424,374940,NXPI,Trump defends intervention to help China telecom company ZTE,news,"By Roberta Rampton and Karen Freifeld WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump on Monday defended his decision to revisit penalties for Chinese company ZTE Corp for flouting U S  sanctions on trade with Iran  saying the telecom maker is a big buyer for U S  suppliers  Trump  known for his fiery rhetoric against Chinese trade practices he says hurt U S  jobs  faced backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers after he pledged to work with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help ZTE  saying too many jobs in China had been lost  The company shut its main operations after the Commerce Department banned U S  companies from selling components to ZTE for seven years after it violated the terms of a settlement deal for illegally shipping goods made with U S  parts to Iran and North Korea   ZTE  the large Chinese phone company  buys a big percentage of individual parts from U S  companies  This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi   Trump said on Monday  ZTE paid more than  2 3 billion to 211 U S  exporters in 2017  a senior ZTE official said on Friday  U S  companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of components used in ZTE s smartphones  network gear and other products  The U S  Commerce Department is exploring options besides a supplier ban to punish ZTE  SZ 000063   HK 0763   China s second largest telecom maker  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said   ZTE did do some inappropriate things     the question is are there alternative remedies to the ones we had originally put forward and that s the area we will be exploring very  very promptly   Ross told journalists at the National Press Club in Washington  ZTE declined comment on Monday  Ross did not provide details about options under consideration  Washington export control lawyer Doug Jacobson  who represents ZTE suppliers  said Trump s tweet  gives ZTE light at the end of the tunnel   Shares of ZTE suppliers rose after Trump s pledge  Acacia Communications Inc  O ACIA   an optical component maker  jumped nearly 9 percent  Since the ZTE ban went into effect last month  U S  suppliers have sought guidance from the Commerce Department about inventory  The companies would like to withdraw the inventory so they can sell the components elsewhere  But in a possible indication the government is considering easing the ban  suppliers are being told to wait a week or so before taking further action  a source familiar with the situation said  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT Trump s olive branch comes as his top trade and economic officials prepare to meet this week in Washington with Chinese Vice Premier Liu for talks on trade concerns ranging from intellectual property protections to farm goods to steel capacity  Trump has threatened  150 billion in tariffs on imports of Chinese goods  and China has threatened to retaliate against U S  exports  including soybeans and aircraft  Ross said  the gap remains wide  on how to address the trade imbalance between the two nations  Sources briefed on the matter said Beijing demanded the ZTE issue be resolved as a prerequisite for broader trade talks  The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing would back away from threats to slap tariffs on U S  farm goods in exchange for easing the ban on selling components to ZTE  citing people in both countries briefed on the emerging deal  Two sources  who declined to be identified  told Reuters on Sunday China was willing in principle to import more U S  agriculture products in return for Washington smoothing out penalties against ZTE  A U S  official briefed on the matter said a possible deal involving ZTE and U S  agriculture products could include Chinese concessions to allow completion of Qualcomm Inc s  O QCOM   44 billion takeover of  NXP Semiconductors   O NXPI   which has been delayed by a lengthy antitrust review by Chinese regulators  NXP shares surged 11 8 percent on Monday  CAUGHT OFF GUARD U S  intelligence officials on Sunday evening and Monday said they were caught off guard by Trump s reversal and remained concerned about security threats they said the Chinese company poses to the United States and its allies  Speaking on the condition of anonymity  three officials said the Chinese government  which has close ties to ZTE  could use its mobile phones and other technology to spy on U S  citizens  companies and government activities  By handing the decision to the Commerce Department  Trump appeared to prioritize commercial issues over security concerns  and cut national security officials out of the process  they said  Republican senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton have backed legislation that would prevent the U S  government from buying or leasing equipment from ZTE or Huawei  the largest Chinese telecom maker   I hope this isn t the beginning of backing down to China   Rubio said on Twitter   We are crazy to allow them to operate in U S  without tighter restrictions    The White House said Trump wanted Ross to look at the issue  consistent with applicable laws and regulations  after Chinese officials raised the matter in various talks  
 This is part of a very complex relationship between the United States and China that involves economic issues  national security issues  and the like   White House spokesman Raj Shah said on Monday ",2018-05-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trumps-comments-on-chinas-zte-draw-security-concerns-1445877,1445877
153425,374941,NXPI,China Casts Doubt on Report of  200 Billion Trade Deficit Offer,news," Bloomberg     China cast doubt on reports that it had offered to reduce its annual trade surplus with the U S  by  200 billion through increased imports of American products 
The offer was made during talks in Washington this week as Vice Premier Liu He visited to try to resolve a trade dispute  according to a Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity  On Friday  two posts on Chinese state social media disputed the report  and a foreign ministry official said no such offer had been made to his knowledge 
In a sign that the Chinese government is seeking a conciliatory stance  on Friday it announced that it would end its anti dumping and anti subsidy investigation into imports of U S  sorghum  citing  public interest   That move comes days after the restarting of a review of Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc s application to acquire  NXP Semiconductors  NV  NASDAQ NXPI  
 If Trump can cut a deal with China for a  200 billion reduction in the bilateral trade deficit  then he ll have won the trade deal of the century   said Rajiv Biswas  chief Asia Pacific economist at IHS Markit in Singapore   The devil will be in the details  with key factors being the timeframe over which China is offering to achieve this reduction  
List of Demands
A  200 billion reduction in the U S  trade gap with China by 2020 was on a list of demands the Trump administration made earlier this month as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin led a delegation to Beijing  The U S  merchandise trade deficit with China hit a record  375 billion last year 
The U S  had earlier made additional demands  including a halt to subsidies and other government support for the Made in China 2025 plan that targets strategic industries from robotics to new energy vehicles  China had made its own demands  including giving equal treatment to its investment  and warned U S  companies may be excluded from measures to open its economy 
The Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs on as much as  150 billion of Chinese imports to the U S  as tensions over trade have escalated  Trump expressed doubt before his meeting with Liu that China and the U S  would come to an agreement to avoid a damaging trade war 
 Will that be successful  I tend to doubt it   Trump said during a press briefing on Thursday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg   The reason I doubt it is because China s become very spoiled  
 Positive Sign 
Shane Oliver  head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd  in Sydney  said the Chinese proposal is  a positive sign that a full on trade war may be averted  
 By making a significant offer to the U S  it indicates that China is taking the negotiations very seriously   Oliver said   Much will depend on the details and time period and later in terms of the implementation  
Reuters reported China s trade deficit reduction offer earlier 
The U S  and China were expected to exchange new trade proposals during the Washington talks  Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said earlier Thursday  Mnuchin is leading the talks with Liu  along with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  according to the White House 
Victor Shih  a professor at the University of California in San Diego who studies China s politics and finance  said he finds an agreement to cut the U S  deficit by  200 billion  difficult to contemplate  
 Even with a drastic reallocation of Chinese imports of energy  raw materials and airplanes in favor of the U S   the bilateral trade deficit may reduce by  100 billion   he said   A  200 billion reduction would mean a drastic reduction in Chinese exports to the U S  and a dramatic restructuring of the supply chain  
Market Access
Kudlow said the U S  focus is on China opening market access to American companies by lowering their trading barriers and addressing U S  concerns over the theft of intellectual property 
 American ownership of its own companies in China must be permitted   Kudlow said   We are going to have serious talks dealing with a difficult trade situation that needs to be fixed  
Trump also said on Thursday that his decision to order a review of U S  penalties on China s ZTE Corp  HK 0763   came directly at the request of Chinese President Xi Jinping   The president of China  President Xi  asked me to look at it  I said I would look at it   Trump said  adding  But anything we do with ZTE is always    it s just a small component of the overall deal 
In a surprise move  Trump on Sunday said that the U S  was considering ways to help get ZTE   back in business fast   fueling speculation of a softening of his get tough position on China  The Commerce Department blocked ZTE s access to U S  suppliers last month  saying the company had violated a 2017 sanctions settlement related to trading with Iran and North Korea and then lied about the violations ",2018-05-18,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-casts-doubt-on-report-of-200-billion-trade-deficit-offer-1453099,1453099

153467,374983,NXPI,Is NXP Semiconductors  NXPI  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put NXP Semiconductors N V    NASDAQ NXPI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  NXP Semiconductors has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 16 6  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts NXP Semiconductors  current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 19 1  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that NXP Semiconductors has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for NXP Semiconductors  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  NXP Semiconductors has a P S ratio of about 2 6  This is slightly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 9 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  NXP Semiconductors currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NXPI a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for NXP Semiconductors is just 0 7  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 0 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 6  which is slightly better than the industry average of 9 9  Clearly  NXPI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though NXP Semiconductors might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C  This gives NXPI a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter consensus estimate has not witnessed any earnings momentum in the past two months  while the full year 2019 estimate has dipped 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below NXP Semiconductors N V  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNXP Semiconductors is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 27  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Medical Stocks to Buy Now The greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating revenue

Investors are still struggling to make sense of this week s central bank meetings  The Federal Reserve hiked rates and the median dot indicated that most officials see two hikes instead of one as likely appropriate in H2  It upgraded its assessment of the economy and projected a continued decline in unemployment  The forecasts also indicate that in 2019 and 2020  the Fed funds rate is expected to be above the long run equilibrium rate  And yet the dollar sold off 
The ECB forward guidance was stronger than most expected  It provided a hard stop to the asset purchases in December and provided details on its Q4 tapering plans  Many thought the ECB would wait for the next meeting in July for such an announcement  And yet  the euro suffered its largest decline since the Brexit reaction in late June 2016  We suspect that the price action colored the way many interpreted the ECB  The euro fell so the ECB must have been dovish 
The ECB did say interest rates would not be raised until after next summer  The implied yield of the December 2019 Euribor futures contract fell five basis points  Yet rather than take it to unchartered waters  the market seemed to simply return to where it was before the rogue press report claiming the meeting was  live   which in the market s jargon means action was reasonably likely   The soft economic data  including the weak survey data and disappointing April industrial output   0 9   the third and largest monthly decline in this year  had encouraged ideas that the first hike would come later in Q3 2019  and the market has returned to that view  Surely a 2  slide in the euro yesterday was disproportionate with the five basis point decline in the December 2019 Euribor futures 
As the euro plunged  many turned their attention from the ECB per se and toward reports that Germany s coalition was under threat by a dispute over refugees between CSU s head Seehofer who is also the interior minister  Bavaria  which is the home of the CSU holds regional elections in October  Last year it  like the CDU and SPD saw their support wane in the face of the rise of the AfD  The CSU had been critical of Merkel s immigration policies  and this is a continuing source of tensions  Cooler heads seem to be prevailing now as the cost of a serious fissure of the CDU CSU alliance is high for both parties 
Consistent with the seemingly counter intuitive market reactions to both the Fed and ECB  the yen is stronger even though the BOJ lefts rates on hold and downgraded its inflation assessment  ahead of next month s updated forecasts  The optimism that prompted an upgrade in January has been reversed  Indeed  its reassessment of price pressures was greater than expected  It now sees core CPI  excludes fresh food prices  0 5  1 0  down from  around 1 0    Although the BOJ reduced its bond buying program twice in recent weeks  investors recognize that it will lag behind the other central banks in normalizing policy 
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda linked the lack of recent progress on inflation to the rise of the yen and fall in accommodation prices  though he argued that progress toward the 2  target remains intact  However  Kataoka disagreed  Core CPI has fallen for two consecutive months  and he did not think it was likely that progress was still being made  At next month s meeting  the BOJ will update its growth and inflation forecasts  Surveys suggest that the vast majority of participants do not expect any measures toward normalization until after 2020 after the impact of the October 2019 sales tax increase can be assessed 
We have been tracking the rise  five of the past six weeks  of the gross long euro position in the futures market  As of last week  the gross long euro position was larger than it was at the end of last year  It remains near the record high seen near the middle of Q1  The net long position has fallen  not because long have liquidated  but because the gross shorts have grown faster  This week s CFTC data will not cover the price action after the FOMC and ECB meetings 
We suspect  and will have to wait for the data to confirm  that market positioning helped exaggerate yesterday s price action  though on a medium term basis we are still bearish the euro  More immediately  though some backing and filling is likely  Expiring options may influence the price action  There are around 2 bln euro in options struck between  1 1600 and  1 1615 that will be cut and another 1 1 bln euros at  1 1650  which may cap the single currency today 
The US dollar made a marginal new high for the week against the yen  rising to about JPY110 90 in Asia before retreating to JPY110 40  It looks poised to retest the highs  There is a  1 2 bln option at JPY110 50 that expires today  and  1 6 bln struck between JPY111 00 JPY111 05  Barring a large setback  this will be the third weekly advance of the dollar against the yen 
Sterling held above  1 3200 level and the year s lows seen in late May  There is nearly a billion pound option struck at  1 3250 that expires today  We suggest a near term target in the  1 3300  1 3330 area  We think there is a reasonable chance that the BOE hikes rates in August  but it may not be the next major central bank to hike  That role may go to the Bank of Canada 
With NAFTA negotiations now tipped to continue in the coming months  and the US investigation of auto imports on national security grounds is unlikely to be concluded in the coming months  the Bank of Canada may see next month s meeting as an opportunity to remove some accommodation  Technically  we had thought the Canadian dollar was poised to outperform this week  but it did not  It did perform slightly better than the Australian dollar  where we had thought the risk reward was the greatest  but both currencies were the worst performers among the majors 
Canada reports its international securities transactions  manufacturing sales and existing home sales  The market may be most sensitive to the latter  May existing home sales are expected to have fallen for the fourth time this year after falling in five months in 2017  The US reports the June Empire manufacturing survey and the May industrial production manufacturing output figures  With strong confidence that the Fed will hike rates in September  outside of some headline risk  the data is unlikely to have much impact  The TIC data that will be released after close may offer insight  but the data is for April  We do know that the Fed s custody holdings for foreign central banks slipped in April  six week decline streak that began in April ended and the Fed s custody holdings have risen for the past three weeks ",2018-06-15,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-slips-while-escalating-trade-tensions-may-roil-markets-200325183,200325183

153494,375010,NXPI,3 Key Market Drivers In A Jam Packed Week Ahead,opinion,"The week ahead may be among the busiest of the year  There are important events every day that will shed light on three drivers of the ever evolving investment climate  slower growth  softer prices  and trade tensions  
The IMF revised down its forecast for world growth  Late last week  S P increased the probability of a US recession in the next 12 months to 15 20  from 10 15   Sweden and Switzerland joined Germany  Italy  and Japan to report contracting Q3 GDP  The recent official PMI from China suggests either new efforts to support the economy have not been implemented or are not having an impact  yet   At the end of last week  India reported its growth slowed more than expected in Q3 to 7 1  year over year from 8 2  in Q2 
The US October PCE deflator eased to 2 0   but the core eased to 1 8   More troubling has been the persistent easing of the three month annualized rate  which can be used to capture the near term trend  It fell to 1 2  in October from 1 5  in September  It was at 2 2  in May  Germany  France  and Spain reported softer than expected headline November CPI figures  while the core rate unexpectedly fell on the EMU level to 1 0  where it was in January  
Brent is off 31  over the past two months  and WTI has fallen almost 33   Some places in the US were reporting sub  2 a gallon for gasoline  This will weigh on headline inflation  The drop in dramatic fall in oil prices will transfer wealth from oil producers to oil consumers  In the US  this is good for household consumption but may weigh on capital investment  in which the energy sector has played an outsized role

Reaction to the weekend G20 meeting and bilateral meetings


Trump and Xi  The US agreed not to escalate the current tariff schedule for 90 days in exchange for China s willingness to boost its imports from the US  without specific targets  immediately  regard fentanyl as a controlled substance  which will allow the possibility for greater control   Xi also indicated that a new attempt by Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  to buy NXP  NASDAQ NXPI  would find a more receptive Chinese response  Trade talks will be intensified and if there is no agreement in 90 days the US threat to raise the current 10  tariff on  200 bln of Chinese goods to 25  will be back on the table  Recall that this was slated for January 1  so the 90 day period may really only be a 60 day delay  Still  the 90 day negotiating period seems short given the holidays  Xmas  New Years and the Lunar New Year in early February  and the extent of the negotiations needed 
Putin and MBS  Pact reaffirmed  Volumes not discussed  but after being cagey  Russia seemed more willing to consider an output cut 
NATFA 2 0  Signed by the heads of state  but may be challenged in the US Congress next year  The steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place  it will raise the antagonism if not addressed shortly 


South Korea final Q3 GDP and November CPI  The South Korean central bank raised its key rate 25 bp to 1 75  before the weekend  Korea is expected to confirm the preliminary estimate of 2 0  for Q3 GDP  It is the weakest in five years  Headline inflation has risen from 1  in January to2 0  in October  where it is expected to have remained in November  The rise is largely food and energy  The core rate finished last year at 1 5  and has fallen to 1 1  in October and may have slipped further in November 
Turkey CPI  Inflation may have peaked in October over 25   In November  it probably fell closer to 23   The central bank will likely be in a hurry to cut rates  but the December 13 meeting may be a bit too soon 
US auto sales  Although auto and light truck sales are likely to decline sequentially  they are expected to remain above the year s average  17 09 mln seasonally adjusted annual rate   Last year s monthly average was 17 16 mln 
Three Fed governors  Clarida  Quarles  and Brainard  and two regional presidents speak  Williams and Kaplan    Investors will be interested in any insight into estimates of the neutral rate and if there has been a change since September when the median forecast anticipated three hikes in 2019

UK Parliament continues to debate Withdrawal Bill
Bank of Canada  After lifting the overnight rate to 1 75  in October  the Bank of Canada was widely expected to be on hold at its next meet  The central bank will likely be disappointed and surprised by the pre weekend news that the real final demand contracted in Q3  The implied yield on the March 2019 BA futures fell from 2 55  at the end of October to 2 39  at the end of November  The chances of a January hike has fallen from almost 85  to just below 60   It is still  arguably  rich 
ADP US private sector jobs estimate  This private sector data is fairly good at estimating the private sector payroll growth estimated by the government  The ADP estimate averaged 185 4k last year while the government s estimate after revisions is 180k  This year ADP has averaged 204 4k  while the official estimate is 206k 
Powell scheduled to testify before Joint Economic Committee of Congress before President Trump declared a day of mourning for the passing of former President George H  Bush  Despite the seemingly dramatic response to Powell s comments last week  we do not think he intended to reflect a change in his thinking or policy  The central bank s flexibility  data dependency  and even a pause next year could be deduced from two known facts  that there will be a press conference after every meeting in 2019 and the median official forecast was for three hikes in 2019 after four  likely  in 2018 
EIA estimate of crude oil inventories  Oil stocks rose last week by nearly six times more than expected last week and has risen for the past ten weeks  US production is at record highs and is expected to increase even further next year as new projects come online  The price of shale from the Permian Basin is seen near  42 a barrel  and  40 from the Bakken Field  Technological improvements allow for productivity advances and lower break evens  The sector is leveraged  high fixed costs   and there is pressure to produce even if at a loss 

Thursday  December 6

China s Reserves  if not  then on the following day   Reserves have fallen for three months through October and likely fell in November as the PBOC sought to prevent further market pressure that was weakening the yuan  Typically  but not always  when China s reserves fall  their dollar holdings are drawn down  China s reserves finished last year near  3 14 trillion and were about  3 05 trillion in October 
OPEC  meet in Vienna  A short term agreement is likely  and prices of seemed to be stabilizing at the end of November  Output cuts of more than 1 0 1 5 mln barrels may be necessary to meet market expectations  The agreement will have to be reviewed next year when the US exemptions for Iranian purchases expire 
German factory orders  After unexpectedly contracting in Q3  the investors and policymakers are particularly sensitive to the high frequency German data  The flash manufacturing PMI for November disappointed  falling to 51 6 from 52 2  and October factory orders are expected to have slipped after posting back to back gains in August and September  Factory orders have fallen in six of the first nine months of the year 
UK Parliament continues to debate Withdrawal Bill
US October trade balance  The advance report of the merchandise balance showed the second consecutive record shortfall  Import growth was strong  and with inventories rising  it supports the narrative that links the increased shipments to trying to beat the tariffs  which would imply payback of some sort next year  The best thing for US exports is stronger world demand

Canada employment data  Through October  full time employment growth has averaged about a third   11 4k of what it was in the same period last year  Average hourly pay for permanent workers had fallen since May when it reached 3 93   In October  it stood at 1 87  and is likely to have slipped further in November 
Mexico CPI  Consumer inflation peaked at the end of last year near 6 8  and has been trending lower most of this year  It is expected to have fallen from 4 9  in October to 4 6  in November  However  falling inflation is unlikely to steady the central bank s hand  It is likely to ratchet up rates  to 8 25   for the fourth time this year  Its concern is the uncertainty surrounding the new government that was sworn on December 1

153515,375031,NXPI,Here s Why You Should Dump Ambarella From Your Portfolio,opinion,If you are still holding on to shares of Ambarella Inc    NASDAQ AMBA   in your portfolio  it is time you dump those as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak Similar to wise buying decisions  offloading certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Ambarella has witnessed a significant price decline in the year to date period  and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal indicate bleaks prospects for the company in near term  Further  the company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  only reflects its innate weakness Ambarella manufactures video compression and image processing technology used in a variety of small cameras  computers and mobile phones  The company has a diversified product line  offering devices which fit into five main markets   Security Cameras  Automotive Cameras  Sports   Flying Cameras  Wearable Cameras  and Broadcast Infrastructure Systems Shares of this chip maker have plunged approximately 12 5  since its last earnings results  In fact  the stock has been among the worst performers in the  to which it belongs to in the year to date period  During the said period  Ambarella s shares have lost 26 4   while the industry has gained 5 1  The latest downtrend is mainly due to the company s recently issued disappointing outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019  wherein it projects a decline in revenues  contraction in gross margin and rise in operating expenses Let s take a look at factors behind this dismal projection Loss of a Key CustomerAmbarella  most noted for its sports camera technology  has almost lost its one of the company s largest customer   GoPro   NASDAQ GPRO    The company produces a video processing chip  which is a main component in the popular brand of GoPro action cameras  GoPro produces water resistant  wearable  high definition cameras which produce unique first person videos  and have been taking the Internet by storm for the last few years However  since fiscal 2018  GoPro has been fulfilling its majority of requirements from one of Ambarella s competitors  This is affecting Ambarella s shipment volumes  resulting in revenue decline throughout fiscal 2018  as well as in the first quarter of the current fiscal  In fiscal 2018  GoPro s contribution to total revenues went down to 12 8  from the 24 3  reported at the end of fiscal 2017  The company expects that revenues from the sales of chips to GoPro will continue declining throughout fiscal 2019 Drone Market WeakensPrevailing weakness in the drone market has been denting this chip maker s revenues  The company witnessed four back to back quarters of decline in this market Moreover  Ambarella projects softness in the drone market to persist throughout fiscal 2019  Per the company  drone manufacturers have been witnessing a tough time  and its major clients are now shifting focus on building low priced drones  thereby impacting its top line performance Qualcomm May Heighten CompetitionThe company is facing a new challenge in the form of Qualcomm Incorporated   NASDAQ QCOM    It should be noted that Qualcomm is also looking to expand its product portfolio in order to cope with its declining share in the mobile chipset market It is set to acquire NXP Semiconductors   NASDAQ NXPI    which is the world s biggest automotive chipmaker  This acquisition is likely to help Qualcomm in expanding its foothold in new markets such as wearables  automotive  drones  and other Internet of Things devices  The entry of Qualcomm is a real threat as Ambarella may find it difficult to win new deals and might  as well  lose some of its customers Bottom LineThe aforementioned challenges the company is facing right now do not seem to fade away anytime sooner  Furthermore  the stock s valuation looks significantly stretched from a P E perspective  The company currently trades at 55 4x based on its forward earnings estimate  massively higher than the industry s average of 13 3  This limits its upside potential for the near term Looking at the prevailing challenges  along with higher forward valuation multiple and Zacks sell rating  it is wise to stay away from investing in Ambarella stock right now A buy rated stock in the same space is Mellanox

153614,375130,NXPI,Can Germany s Political Crisis Stall EU Recovery  5 Picks,opinion,On Sunday  Eurozone s economic powerhouse Germany was pushed into a political crisis after negotiations aimed at forming a new government broke down  This represents the gravest crisis of Chancellor Angela Merkel s tenure and is threatening to derail an economic recovery which has come as a surprise to several observers across the world The current impasse may well lead to an extended period of political instability  However  Germany s prominent political parties may be better off avoiding fresh elections  since they are likely to produce another indecisive verdict More importantly  Germany and the broader Eurozone continue to show signs of economic resilience  This is possibly why Europe s markets have continued to notch up gains this week  choosing to ignore the current crisis  Investing in stocks from the Eurozone  therefore  continues to make for a prudent choice Germany Faces Political Impasse  Merkel Prefers Fresh Elections Coalition negotiations among Germany s leading parties broke down on Sunday  plunging the country into a political crisis  The business friendly Free Democrats or FDP party opted out of discussions with chancellor Merkel s CDU CSU  leading her to comment on Monday that she would prefer to face fresh elections rather than head a minority government The final decision regarding the fate of Germany s incumbent government lies with President Frank Walter Steinmeier  He will first attempt to break the deadlock which talks has reached  failing which he will likely appoint a chancellor to head a minority government or take steps required to hold fresh elections Eurozone Growth Broad Based  Germany s Economy Remains Strong Germany s current political impasse is an outcome of the split verdict delivered by elections held on Sep 24  Even though Merkel s CDU CSU emerged as the single largest party  her party s vote share declined alarmingly  Now  the breakdown of coalition talks threatens to derail the Eurozone s spectacular economic recovery But such fears may have been blown out of proportion  Speaking in Brussels on Monday  ECB President Mario Draghi described the region s economic expansion as  solid  and the most broad based since the economic bloc s formation  Draghi also said that based on data received recently  the region s growth would continue unabated in the near term  The only cause for concern was sluggish wage growth  However  Draghi was of the opinion that wage increases would come into force soon as a result of a decline in unemployment levels Meanwhile  Germany s Bundesbank said on Monday that the country s economy was entering the last section of the year on a firm footing  A considerable pickup in industrial activity was leading to a shortage of workers needed to fulfil orders  This recent evaluation of the largest economy in Europe indicates that Germany has remained largely unaffected by the recent political crisis  Our ChoicesEurozone s economy has posted the most remarkable recovery witnessed in the post crisis period  Despite political concerns  the most recent of which is the breakdown of coalition talks in Germany  such a trend is likely to continue in the near future As far as Germany itself is concerned  the country s economy is entering the last few months of this year on a high  Given this backdrop  it makes sense to add stocks from the Eurozone to your portfolios  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is

153658,375174,NXPI,Merger Arbitrage 101  Investing In Acquisitions With An ETF ,opinion,"The merger and acquisition market is hot 
Companies flush with cash and short on growth opportunities are looking to mergers and acquisitions to boost their prospects in the near term  We have seen plenty of deals in this environment  and it looks like this trend might continue for a while longer too 
Obviously  finding potential acquisition targets can lead to big gains  but some investors are looking to the so called  merger arbitrage  strategy in order to tap into the hot M A world   
What is a merger arbitrage strategy  Well  to get some insights on this topic  I spoke with Sal Bruno  CIO at IndexIQ to get his take on this approach for the latest edition of the Dutram Report 
Merger Arbitrage
Generally speaking  when a company announces a takeover  the target firm will see its share price rise  but not up to the full deal value  For example  let s say a potential target is trading at around  15 share  If a company offers  20 share for the target  the target might see its shares only rise to  19 25 share  This gap between the offer price and the current price is due to the risk of the deal falling through for any number of reasons and it is where those employing the merger arbitrage strategy come in to the picture 
Those employing this technique buy up shares of the target company after the deal has been announced and look to profit on that gap between the current price and the offer price once the deal closes  It is generally seen as a lower risk and uncorrelated strategy  and Sal Bruno walks us through the mechanics of this approach in the podcast 
Merger Arbitrage ETF 
Additionally  Sal also discusses his company s fund  the IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF  and how this product employs a merger arbitrage strategy in fund form  The technique produces a return that has a surprisingly low volatility level  and has a beta that is extremely low as well  the current beta against the S P 500 is below 0 3  
Sal also clues us in on the construction of the ETF and how components are decided for the fund  as well as what happens if a deal falls through  We also discuss the fund s components  and right now this includes Becton Dickinson s target CR Bard   NYSE BCR    Time Warner   NYSE TWX   which is being purchased by AT T  NYSE T   and NXP Semiconductors   NASDAQ NXPI   which is being acquired by Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   all of which have more than 7  of the total each  The exposure is pretty diversified all things considered  as five segments each account for at least 10  of the total asset base  and we also touch on the sector biases in this approach as well 
We also discuss some of the mechanics of this technique such as how companies are removed and why there is a level of short exposure in the ETF and what the outlook is for mergers and acquisitions under the Trump administration  Make sure to check out the podcast for insights from Sal  and a complete discussion of this strategy

153796,375312,NXPI,3 Tips On A 20   Winning Stock Trade,opinion,"Recently  we locked in an average share price gain of 23  through buying and selling shares of NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  and we are still long one third of the initial position as well 
As always  a few valuable lessons and tips from this trade can be added to your trading arsenal  so let s take a simple  objective look at why we bought NXPI in our nightly stock picking newsletter and what was learned from it as well  Read on 
The Setup
At the beginning of the year  NXPI first caught our attention after following up an impressive 40  rally  from late 2014  with a period of price consolidation above its 50 day moving average 
As January progressed  the price action tightened up a bit more  causing the semiconductor stock to oscillate in an 8  price range  while still holding above key support of its 50 day MA 
On February 6  NXPI tested the high of its band of consolidation by probing above the  82 level on heavier than average volume 
Two days later  the stock formed a tight  on lighter volume  giving us a pretty low risk entry point based on the bullish price and volume action of February 6 
The Buy Entry
After forming the inside day  we listed NXPI as a potential buy entry in the Watchlist section of the February 11 issue of The Wagner Daily 
Specifically  we told subscribers we were placing a buy stop to enter the trade on a move above the high of the February 10 inside day 
The daily chart below shows the actual trade setup at that time 

As anticipated  NXPI triggered our buy entry that day and subsequently cruised 6  higher before stalling and waiting for near term support of the 10 day moving average to catch up to the price  which it did on February 23  
As shown on the following chart  NXPI gapped sharply higher on a news driven move that occurred on March 2  then again traded in a tight  sideways range while waiting for the 10 day MA to catch up  which occurred on March 12  
The First Exit  27  Gain 
On March 23  the stock showed its first sign that a potential short term pullback may be around the corner by forming a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern 
As such  we made a judgement call to lock in some profits by selling about 1 3 of the position size the following day  March 24  
On that first exit at  104 83  subscribers who followed the trade setup netted approximately a 27  gain 
On the chart below  notice how a touch of the 10 day MA  dashed blue line  perfectly acted as near term price support several times after the initial February 11 breakout 

The Second Exit  18  Gain 
After locking in profits on partial share size  we tightened the protective stop to protect gains on another 1 3 of the position size 
On April 6  NXPI gapped down on the open and clipped that stop  beneath the April 1 low   enabling us to lock in an 18  price gain on the second third of the position  sold at  97 65  
The second exit is shown below 

As of today  April 15   we remain long the final third of the position with an unrealized gain of about 20  
From here  the plan is to buy more shares with another low risk entry of a pullback to the area of the rising 50 day moving average  currently just below  95  
Top 3 Takeaways
There are a few great tips  mini lessons  to be learned from this trade review  which will surely help to increase your profits in any stock trades you make in the future 
On high momentum stocks that have broken out and then enter into a   the 10 day moving average is a simple  yet highly reliable indicator to help determine when the stock may be ready to resume its ascent 
When sitting on a winning stock  patient and disciplined traders are rewarded  Although we bagged a 27  gain on the initial exit of one third of the position  realize that its required the patience to hold the trade for six weeks 
Proper trade management is nearly as important as picking the right stocks  NXPI is just one of many stocks that have zoomed sharply higher in recent months  but even traders who picked one of the right stocks could still have easily realized a much smaller gain  or possibly even loss if the timing is wrong   That s why we always provide exact and updated entry  stop and target prices for each trade setup in our swing trading newsletter  picking a winning stock is one thing  but knowing the right time to buy and sell is a whole different ballgame 
Overall  perhaps the biggest tip for newer traders  and a reminder for experienced traders  is that losing trades should always be dumped quickly and without hesitation  but winning trades should always be held until price action gives a valid reason to sell 
As long as the price action of NXPI remains bullish  we will continue to hold  and possibly add to  the remaining third of our position that is currently showing a 20  unrealized share price gain ",2015-04-15,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-top-tips-from-a-20-winning-stock-trade-248533,248533
153797,375313,NXPI,Shaking Out Shake Shack Profits,opinion,"In trading  when to  take the money and run  on a winning trade depends on whether the original trade setup  the reason for entering the trade  was a quick  momentum driven swing trade or a core trade that is based on a combination of strong technicals and a history of high earnings growth 
In the case of the  we recently locked in with the NXP Semiconductors NV  NASDAQ NXPI  trade  it was a core trade that we held for several months 
But this time around  we walk you through a purely momentum driven setup instead  a trade that bagged Wagner Daily subscribers about a 30  share price gain in Shake Shack Inc  NYSE SHAK  over a 3 week period 
Nightly Process For Daily Profits
Our daily stock scanning process is what keeps us in tune with the market  as the number of bullish chart patterns with leading stocks is one of the best indicators of the market s true bullish momentum 
Each night  we run through several scans  using a combination of our online stock screener and good ol  fashioned elbow grease  to search for stocks and ETFs with   which are then added to our internal watchlist to monitor for low risk entry points 
Specifically  there are 3 basic stock scans we run each and every night 
Combo   Scan for leading stocks trading near 52 week highs  with top  ranked fundamental and technical ratings  strong earnings and revenue growth  
Relative Strength   Scan for stocks that have made a strong advance over the past 6 to 12 months  a pure technical price scan with no fundamentals  
IPO   Scan all IPOs within the past two years  with an emphasis on those within the past 6 months  for bullish chart patterns 
IPO   Strong Technicals   Explosive Action
Although not many of the trade setups we detail in our stock picking report are from the IPO scan  we always look forward to trading those stocks that eventually appear in the IPO scan because we have learned over the years that a combination of an IPO with a bullish chart pattern leads to nice breakouts with a high level of reliability 
About two months ago  SHAK first appeared in our IPO scan and we first took notice of the price action as it set a higher low in late February  while holding the rising 10 day moving average 
On March 12  SHAK opened about 10  lower due to a negative knee jerk reaction to an earnings report  but buyers immediately stepped in and not only erased the intraday loss  but surprisingly pushed the stock to a positive closing price 
The result of that wild day of trading was the formation of a wide ranged candlestick that closed above the prior day s high on heavy volume 
This bullish reversal candle was certainly a clear buy signal  however  we patiently waited for a lower risk buy entry to develop  because there wasn t one at the time  
The Entry
After a 3 day pullback  on declining volume  to the 10 day moving average  a bullish sign   we decided to list SHAK as a buy limit or buy stop order  whichever triggered first was the one we would take  in the March 18 issue of The Wagner Daily 
The daily chart below shows you how the chart looked when we bought the stock in mid March 

On the morning of March 18  SHAK  undercut  the prior day s low and triggered our buy limit order at  45 10 
Once again  buyers arrived on price weakness  enabling the stock to reverse and rally to close in positive territory and above the prior day s high 
As anticipated  price action followed through to the upside over the next few days  and quickly cleared the high of the wide ranged reversal candle from March 12 
The Exit
After a few weeks of consolidation at the  50 level  SHAK exploded higher over two sessions  allowing us to sell two thirds of the position into strength  netting a 29  price gain on the open of April 16 

Although we sold on the open of April 16  it would have also been a good exit to have sold partial size on the prior day s open or on the close of the second big up day as well 
After such a massive rally in a short period of time  we made a judgment call to significantly tighten the stop on our remaining shares  in order to protect the profits while still giving the setup a small bit of breathing room 
Just a few days later  SHAK triggered our stop for the remaining one third of the position  as it slipped below the prior day s low  32  gain on the remaining shares sold that day  
How Long Do You Like To Hold 
For a pure swing trader  selling into strength of an explosive move like this is usually the way to go 
However  traders who are comfortable with being more patient with the action could alternatively have sold partial size  one third to one half of shares  into strength  then placed a very wide stop to hold the remaining shares longer ",2015-04-22,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-we-shook-out-the-trading-profits-in-shake-shack-stock-($shak)-249306,249306
153826,375342,NXPI,The Stocks To Follow Now,opinion,"The stock market kind of missed today  and a little on the choppy side  but a late rally brought it back  and it ended mixed  A lot of stocks we follow  and traded today  were quite interesting  I m going to show you some of those patterns 
Coupons com  NYSE COUP  had a big day on Wednesday  Going back a to the beginning of the year  it had a big move up  then big decline  it snapped back in June  rolled over in June July  hit bottom about mid to late Sept after the IPO and then based out  The pattern over the last few months shows that it had four test to the lows to create a bottoming type pattern  Wednesday s pop of 4 13  or 33 2   on almost 7 million shares was huge  For me  all goes well for this stock moving forward  It s very similar to what we saw on Groupon  So the near term target will be a test of the gap at 18 66  and then the secondary target is up around the 21 22 zone 
Criteo SA  NASDAQ CRTO  had a nice move on Wednesday  A big base had developed on this one  This stock came down in March at 61  and then got down into the low 20 s  around the 25 range  It bounced around  spiked up in three places  and then formed a falling channel  It broke out of that on Wednesday  up 6 44  or 22   on 3 4 million shares  It popped  came across the declining topsline  moving average  and lateral price resistance  So  I m looking for a quick test to see if it can get up to 37 37 1 4  but I think the target  for me  is going to be up around 40  If it breaks out of that level  then it s on its way up to an important move as the major base pattern over the last several months will have been broken 
FormFactor Inc   NASDAQ FORM  is acting great  along with many other semiconductor stocks  up 96 cents  or 12   on 2 million shares  on Wednesday  The pattern for this stock over the last couple three years now  has moved it up to a breakout point that could very well test the big level of resistance at 10 40  50  which is my next target 
Integrated Device Technology  Inc   NASDAQ IDTI   which I put a swing trade on Wednesday  had a good day  I like the way it broke out  formed a beautiful wedge  the bottom receded  and then it popped again  closing at the upper end of the range  and across resistance  I m expecting a test of at least 18 1 2 19 short term  and then maybe it will get into the 22 zone

153827,375343,NXPI,NXP Semiconductors  Keeping On The Radar,opinion,"Sometimes a trade set up looks too good to be true  NXP Semiconductors  NXPI  was one of those for me this past weekend  It had just closed the week with a strong run higher from a higher low  It broke above trend resistance  and triggered a target of 84 65 out of an ascending triangle  The RSI was rising and positive while the MACD had crossed up and was rising  All was rosy and a typical bullish set up that I would get excited about to continue higher 
Except for one thing  An Advance Block  This is a Japanese Candlestick pattern that looks very much like the three Advancing White Soldiers pattern  That is a bullish continuation pattern  But the difference with an Advance Block is that the 3 candlesticks higher do not overlap  but rather show gaps between them  This is a sign that the rise has happened too quickly and it may exhaust 

I kept it off of my Top 10 list for this reason  but it stayed on my trading radar  And it turns out that was the right call  It did exhaust Monday and retreated the following two days  It now sits on the break out level  And this tells me it was also correct to keep it on the radar 
A hold and reverse here would carry that same target to 84 65 higher  but after having worked through that excess momentum  Conversely a breakdown through the support would target a move to the bottom of the triangle at about 72 75  A  6 move on a bounce or a  6 move on a breakdown  Now it gets interesting

153890,375406,NXPI,What The Market Wants  Another Sell Off  A Market Conundrum,opinion,"What can we say after yet another sharp sell off  Since last Friday s open  the S P 500 has fallen nearly 3   the Nasdaq has fallen more than 4 3  and the Russell 2000 has fallen more than 3   We might argue that the S P 500 held slightly above its 50 day moving average  after falling below it  Or that the Nasdaq didn t  and it is well below the 50 day moving average and only about 4  above its 200 day moving average  Perhaps  it would cooler to remind you that the style cap down last week was Small cap Growth  off only 0 46  or that Mid cap Value was up 1 18  on the week to lead the cap styles  see market stats   Is the glass half full or half empty 
Frankly  it could be either  I have read compelling arguments for both this weekend  The fact is that we just don t know  Year to date  all major markets are down with the S P 500 doing the best  down only 0 2   The DJI  NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are all off around 2  or a bit worse  Does the economy look 2  worse than it did at 2013 s end  Domestically  globally  or universally  That s probably a stretch with political progress domestically  But in turn  one could argue that the market was overvalued by 5  to 10  at year end 
It is a conundrum  But where else shall we put our money  All sectors were down today as well as Friday  except for Utilities  But do we really want to put our equities in Utilities with the likelihood of a rising 10 year treasury yield over the next year or so  Housing prices are up a bit  but if so  then one should expect the economy to grow 
I hate to sound like a broken record but since February of 2009  undervalued growth stocks have been the best choice for most of us  and I would argue that it still is  It just isn t that hard to find a few dozen stocks that carry very reasonable forward PE s and are destined to grow their earnings over the next few years 
If that is frightening  then consider hedging with a VIX based hedge  Today that was great  up more than 11    but for most of the last year  it hasn t been that much help
