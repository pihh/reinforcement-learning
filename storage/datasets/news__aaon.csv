5 Top Stocks to Gain From Blowout Jobs Report
Jobs growth picked up in March and smashed estimates  with nonfarm payrolls increasing for the 102th straight month  Hiring increased in almost all major segments of the economy  with the unemployment rate remaining at record low levels and wages improving at a steady pace 
Such a hiring spree eased lingering worries about the economy  Let us  thus  take a look at stocks that can make the most of a stellar jobs report 
U S  Hiring Bounces Back 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the economy added 196 000 new jobs in March  exceeding analysts  estimates of around 179 000  The job additions in February were also revised up to 33 000 from 20 000  January s job gains  in the meanwhile  remained a little changed at 312 000 
Nonetheless  hiring speeds up by an average of 180 000 in the first three months of this year  marking a solid start indeed  After all  such a feat was achieved despite questions about employers  ability to find skilled labor  Steve Rick  chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group  said  with a strong March employment report now in the books  we ve gotten some reassurance that the labor market is still strong  
Meanwhile  the jobless rate remained at 3 8  last month  slightly above a 49 year low  The real unemployment rate  including those who are underemployed and discouraged  also known as the U6 rate  is down from 7 9  a year ago  At the same time  another broader gauge of unemployment that especially includes discouraged workers or those who are into part time jobs for economic reasons was unchanged at 7 3  
Staffing Stocks Shine
Such a strong month of hiring surely bodes well for staffing companies  Additionally  the Conference Board s Employment Trends Index increased to 111 15 in February  up from downwardly revised 109 34 in January  Compared to the year ago level  the index shows a jump of 4 3  
Gad Levanon  Chief Economist  North America  at The Conference Board had said that  the Employment Trends Index bounced back in February and we expect employment to grow fast enough for the labor market to tighten further in 2019  making it easier for job seekers to find a job  
A Slew of Job Hunters  Health Care Providers Led the Way
By and large  the jobs report showed that most of the industries added jobs and workers  pay continued to remain consistent over the past few months  Health care providers boosted payrolls by 49 000 and have increased staff by nearly 400 000 in the past year  Professional and technical firms took on 34 000 workers and leisure and hospitality sector beefed up payrolls by 33 000  Restaurants too increased staffing by 27 000 
Construction companies  in the meantime  boosted payrolls by 16 000  This is a significant improvement  since the prior month builders  trimmed employment by the most in a year and a half due to the harsh winter season  But  there were some pockets of weakness  While manufacturers eliminated 6 000 jobs  retailers trimmed 12 000 jobs  Nevertheless  such a broader hiring spree indicated that those who are into the heath care  hotels and food businesses  and construction activities are in an expansion mode and their businesses are churning out enough profits

21320,242835,AAON,5 Market Beating Construction Stocks That Might Lose Steam In 2020,opinion,The construction industry has had a tumultuous phase this year  While fears of an all out U S  China trade

21387,242902,AAON,5 Stocks To Ride On Increased U S  Construction Spending ,opinion,"The U S  Commerce Department recently reported that the country s construction spending had registered a spike in February  This marks the rise in construction spending for the third straight month  owing to macroeconomic factors such as Fed s accommodative policy on interest rates  easing mortgage rates and President Donald Trump s tax cuts 
Secondly  the rise in construction spending also indicates that construction activity in the country remained unaffected by fears of a global slowdown  Therefore  in such an encouraging scenario  investing in a few stocks that would raise your portfolio s exposure to the construction sector makes sense 
Construction Activity Moves Up 
Construction spending in the United States increased 1  in February  the Commerce Department cited in a   In fact  construction spending touched a nine month high in the month on an increase in both public and private construction projects 
This strong rise in construction spending has taken place amid land and labor setbacks  and increasingly expensive building materials 
Investment in federal government construction projects increased 0 9  in February to reach the highest level since October  after rising 5 7  in January  Spending on state and local government construction projects also increased 3 8  in the month after gaining 5 7  in January 
Spending on private nonresidential structures declined 0 5  in February after a 1 1  jump in the prior month  while spending on public construction projects increased 3 6  after a 5 7  rise in January  Construction spending on private construction projects and private residential projects also rose in February  gaining 0 2  and 0 7  respectively 

Highest New Home Sales Since March 2018
In addition to the impressive construction spending data  new home sales in the United States rebounded in February to its highest since March 2018  According to a government on Mar 29  single family home sales increased from 636 000 in January to 667 000 in February 
New home sales data is particularly imperative to judge the pulse of housing because this indicates when the contracts have been signed instead of when they are closed  thus giving a timelier insight of the housing market 
Easing mortgage rates since late last year and tax concessions played a vital role in boosting buyer interest in properties  The rates on 30 year fixed rate mortgages fell to their lowest levels in April since February 2018  owing to the central bank s decision to freeze interest rates  in the range of 2 25 2 50  at present  for the year in January  Fed s dovish stance is also making homebuyers less concerned about rising interest rates 
Also  the number of properties purchased for which construction is yet to start increased 14  to a one year high of 197 000  a Bloomberg report cited  This is indicative of a stronger market  which could keep property developers busy in the near future

21388,242903,AAON,5 Top Stocks To Gain From Blowout Jobs Report,opinion,Jobs growth picked up in March and smashed estimates  with nonfarm payrolls increasing for the 102th straight month  Hiring increased in almost all major segments of the economy  with the unemployment rate remaining at record low levels and wages improving at a steady pace Such a hiring spree eased lingering worries about the economy  Let us  thus  take a look at stocks that can make the most of a stellar jobs report U S  Hiring Bounces Back According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the economy added 196 000 new jobs in March  exceeding analysts  estimates of around 179 000  The job additions in February were also revised up to 33 000 from 20 000  January s job gains  in the meanwhile  remained a little changed at 312 000 Nonetheless  hiring speeds up by an average of 180 000 in the first three months of this year  marking a solid start indeed  After all  such a feat was achieved despite questions about employers  ability to find skilled labor  Steve Rick  chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group  said  with a strong March employment report now in the books  we ve gotten some reassurance that the labor market is still strong  Meanwhile  the jobless rate remained at 3 8  last month  slightly above a 49 year low  The real unemployment rate  including those who are underemployed and discouraged  also known as the U6 rate  is down from 7 9  a year ago  At the same time  another broader gauge of unemployment that especially includes discouraged workers or those who are into part time jobs for economic reasons was unchanged at 7 3   Staffing Stocks ShineSuch a strong month of hiring surely bodes well for staffing companies  Additionally  the Conference Board s Employment Trends Index increased to 111 15 in February  up from downwardly revised 109 34 in January  Compared to the year ago level  the index shows a jump of 4 3  Gad Levanon  Chief Economist  North America  at The Conference Board had said that  the Employment Trends Index bounced back in February and we expect employment to grow fast enough for the labor market to tighten further in 2019  making it easier for job seekers to find a job  A Slew of Job Hunters  Health Care Providers Led the WayBy and large  the jobs report showed that most of the industries added jobs and workers  pay continued to remain consistent over the past few months  Health care providers boosted payrolls by 49 000 and have increased staff by nearly 400 000 in the past year  Professional and technical firms took on 34 000 workers and leisure and hospitality sector beefed up payrolls by 33 000  Restaurants too increased staffing by 27 000 Construction companies  in the meantime  boosted payrolls by 16 000  This is a significant improvement  since the prior month builders  trimmed employment by the most in a year and a half due to the harsh winter season  But  there were some pockets of weakness  While manufacturers eliminated 6 000 jobs  retailers trimmed 12 000 jobs  Nevertheless  such a broader hiring spree indicated that those who are into the heath care  hotels and food businesses  and construction activities are in an expansion mode and their businesses are churning out enough profits   Source  Bureau of Labor Statistics 5 Top GainersFrom recruiters and heath care to leisure and

21401,242916,AAON,AAON  Why This Stock Is Impressing Investors Again,opinion,"Finding really good businesses that grow their operations  and share prices  consistently over time is actually very difficult  Whether it s the current state of the business cycle  interest rates  capital spending  or the weather  a business that can consistently grow through all the risks is golden 
One such company that I ve looked at before in these pages is AAON Inc   AAON   a seemingly boring heating  ventilation  and air conditioning  HVAC  enterprise out of Tulsa  Oklahoma 
The company just announced record first quarter sales and earnings again  This isn t a highflying technology business  it makes heating and cooling equipment  and the stock continues to be an excellent wealth creator for stockholders  
If you scan the equity universe for consistent stock market performers  the list gets small very quickly as your time horizon lengthens  I think stability of performance  both in terms of operational growth and share price performance  is one of the most important attributes in an equity market investment  It s very difficult to find both  Traders might thrive on volatility  but I suspect most long term investors do not 
AAON s 2014 first quarter sales grew 14  to  76 4 million  up from  66 8 million  According to management  the comparable quarterly gain was due to growth in market share  overall volume  and pricing 
Net income came to  9 8 million  representing a comparable gain of 38   with the aid of differing tax rates   Earnings per share grew 37  to  0 26 from  0 19  helped by a reduction in the cost of raw materials  The stock split three for two on July 2  2013 
As a stock market investment  this company has proven to be a consistent wealth creator  Now  this doesn t mean that the trend will continue  but a solid track record of wealth creation is just one more feature encompassing the overall story 
I attribute considerable weight to what a business has accomplished in the past  Good businesses have a tendency to remain that way  The company s 15 year stock chart is featured below 
Because the equity market is a system of relative values susceptible to pricing manias  the appropriate value for a company like AAON is the price another corporation would pay to acquire it 
With a market capitalization now at more than a billion dollars  this is a potential outcome  Insider ownership is substantial  however  which in itself is a positive attribute for passive investors 
The company s strengthening balance sheet recently led management to boost its semi annual cash dividend by 30  to  0 13 per share to shareholders of record on June 12 
AAON is one of a few companies that files its form 10 Q commensurate with its financial press releases  This timely disclosure is useful  and you learn a great deal more about the company and its business conditions at the earliest time 
Compared to the first quarter of 2013  the company s metal prices fell materially  Copper was down 4 3  and galvanized steel prices fell 4 2   while stainless steel dropped 12 3  and aluminum fell 6 2  
Last month  AAON donated air handling units as well as cash to the Tulsa Library Trust for a combined total value of  1 0 million 
By all accounts  this is a very successful company with a strong track record of operational growth and stock market success  These days  consistent metrics like these are tough to come by

21402,242917,AAON,Beyond Pulte  4 Construction Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"Shares of PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM   rose 4  on Tuesday on rumors that hedge fund  Elliott Management Corp  has bought a stake in the homebuilder amid a public battle between the board and the founder 
The Public Battle
In April  the company s largest shareholder  William J  Pulte  made public a letter he had sent to the board of directors that recommended the immediate removal of the long time CEO  Richard Dugas  and a change in the company s direction  Pulte expressed his displeasure over the company s announcement that Dugas will retire as Chairman and CEO in May next year and requested the board to accelerate the process  Bill Pulte  his grandson  and another board member  Jim Grosfeld  criticized Dugas  decision to move the company s headquarters to Atlanta as well as change its overall performance or strategy 
In another letter  Pulte demanded that lead independent director  James J  Postl  should resign immediately from all his positions in the company  In response  James J  Postl  issued an open letter to shareholders stressing the board s strong support for Dugas and the company s value creation strategy which  has produced significantly higher profitability and shareholder returns  
Not paying heed to Pulte s requests  shareholders overwhelmingly re elected Mr  Dugas as chairman and chief executive  along with all 10 director nominees  at Pulte s annual meeting in May 
Q1 Earnings Solid
As a measure of the company s performance  its share price has increased almost 14  year to date  Pulte posted robust first quarter 2016 results in April with both earnings and sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share surged 60  year over year on the back of higher home sales  a lower share count and taxes and an improved SG A ratio  Home sales rose 28  as overall demand trends remained positive  read more    
How is the Sector Placed 
In fact  the Q1 performance across the broader construction sector was overall better than expected  Leading homebuilders  Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN   and KB Home   NYSE KBH     the early birds   set the tempo for the season with positive sales and earnings surprises  Another industry bigwig D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales on the back of higher home sales  Toll Brothers  Inc    NYSE TOL    which reported its second quarter fiscal 2016 results in late May  also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales 
Almost all homebuilders are of the consensus that the spring selling season was off to a good start with strong demand and traffic trends  The companies are also optimistic that the growth momentum will be sustained through the rest of the year amid an improving economy  rising wages  favorable job outlook and a tight supply situation 
A flurry of housing data released in May   housing starts  new home sales and existing home sales   has also been fairly upbeat  read more    
The increase in home construction not only benefits homebuilders but also spurs demand for homebuilding materials  home decoration products and other related businesses  This  in turn  boosts the growth prospects of companies manufacturing these products like Vulcan Materials Company   NYSE VMC    Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    NYSE MLM    Masco Corp    NYSE MAS   and Headwaters Inc    NYSE HW   and many others  They too performed generally well in Q1

Dividend hike is a prudent strategy for enhancing shareholder returns and raising the market value of the stock  It is primarily used by companies with a stable cash position and solid future prospects  Consequently  companies bank on this strategy to bolster investors  confidence in the stock  persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it 
Additionally  Owens Corning repurchased 1 6 million shares of its common stock for  86 million during third quarter fiscal 2016 ended Sep 30  2016  Further  the company approved an additional share repurchase authorization for up to 10 million shares during its third quarter conference call

Notably  the shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  building material retailer has gained 10 4  compared with the Zacks categorized Building   Construction Product Miscellaneous industry  which has showcased a gain of 17 5    Although the stock has underperformed compared to the Zacks Subindustry group  it carries a  of  A   The stock carries a P E ratio of 14 8 compared to an Industry P E ratio of 18 74  Hence we believe although the stock is underpriced now  there is scope for its price to appreciate 
We believe that the dividend hike will not only help improve shareholder returns but also enhance the company s goodwill and enable it to tackle peer competition OWENS CORNING Price
