181077,402593,ABT,Here s Why Investors Really Liked Abbott Labs  Q4 Earnings Results,news,"It s fair to say that Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT  stock performance in 2019 was good but not great  Shares jumped more than 20  last year while lagging well behind the 29  gain delivered by the S P 500 index  But Abbott is off to a great start in 2020 
The global healthcare leader announced its fourth quarter results on Wednesday before the market opened  There was a lot for investors to like with its latest quarterly update 

By the numbers
Abbott reported Q4 revenue of  8 3 billion  a solid 7 1  year over year increase  This also topped the consensus analysts  estimate of  8 26 billion 
The company announced Q4 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of  0 59 based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   This reflected a 59 5  jump from the  0 37 per share posted in the year ago period 
Abbott s adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter came in at  0 95 per share  up from  0 81 in the prior year period  This met the average analyst earnings estimate 
Behind the numbers
The Q4 sales growth looks even more impressive when adjusted for foreign exchange fluctuations  The company said that its sales increased by 8 5  year over year on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of discontinued operations 
All three of Abbott s business segments delivered solid growth  The company s medical devices unit was the biggest winner  with revenue jumping 9 7  year over year to  3 2 billion thanks to double digit organic sales growth in its diabetes care  electrophysiology  heart failure  and structural heart businesses 
Sales for the company s established pharmaceuticals segment increased 7 8  over the prior year period to nearly  1 2 billion  Improving performances in Asia and Latin America drove this growth  
Abbott s nutrition and diagnostics segments trailed with year over year revenue growth of 5 2  and 5   respectively  Total Q4 revenue for the company s diagnostics segment was nearly  2 1 billion  with the Alinity line of diagnostic instruments contributing significantly to growth  The nutrition segment raked in  1 9 billion  with stronger growth in the adult market driven largely by Abbott s Ensure and Glucerna brands 
The company s bottom line improvement was even better than its sales mainly because operating costs increased at a slower pace than sales did  In addition  Abbott s interest expense and tax expense decreased significantly from the prior year period 
Looking ahead
Management anticipates full year 2020 organic sales growth to come in between 7  and 8   with GAAP EPS between  2 35 and  2 45  Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between  3 55 and  3 65  For the first quarter of 2020  the company is anticipating EPS between  0 40 and  0 42  with adjusted EPS between  0 69 and  0 71 
CEO Miles White said that Abbott s focus on organic growth is  driving top tier performance   He added that the company is  entering 2020 with very good momentum and targeting continued strong growth   
Abbott remains one of the top blue chip stocks on the market  with solid growth and an attractive dividend  With the potential for Food and Drug Administration clearance of the company s new version of its Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system in the near future and positive Q4 results under its belt  Abbott has a pretty good chance to deliver an even better performance in 2020 than it did last year ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plgiw,2065200

noted  our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth  which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today With that I will now turn the call over to Miles Miles D  White    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks  Scott  Good morning  2019 was another highly successful year for Abbott  Our focused execution resulted in strong financial performance  including ongoing earnings per share of  3 24 reflecting 12 5  growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency  All four of our businesses performed well contributing to full year organic sales growth of more than 7 5  which is above the guidance range we set at the beginning of last year  The successful year was capped off by a strong fourth quarter with organic sales growth of 8 5   including double digit sales growth in Medical Devices  Established Pharmaceuticals and Core Laboratory Diagnostics  along with ongoing EPS growth of more than 17  Our consistent strong performance demonstrates that our business model is working exactly as intended  We ve built the Company very deliberately through a multi year process to deliver superior results for years to come  We ve shaped our businesses to align with important trends to make sure we re in the right places with the right products and we ve targeted businesses that are focused on some of the world s greatest healthcare concerns  for example  diabetes and cardiovascular disease are two of the most significant healthcare challenges of our lifetime  They are chronic  long lasting and dramatically increasing in prevalence around the world Nearly every healthcare decision begins with a diagnostic test  And this testing not only occurs in the traditional hospital setting  but also increasingly at alternate sites such as physicians  offices  pharmacies and even at home  Proper nutrition is the foundational element of good health across every stage of life  Whether you re a newborn baby  a child striving to grow  or an aging adult working to overcome a health condition  And access to healthcare continues to expand rapidly in emerging markets were 85  of the world s population resides We shaped our Company to achieve scale and leadership positions in all of these areas  The investments we ve made and our focus on execution are working  Our product pipelines are strong  our operating culture is strong and we re well positioned to achieve sustainable strong growth for years to come For 2020 we re forecasting another year of top tier financial performance  As we announced this morning we forecast organic sales growth of 7  to 8   and adjusted earnings per share of  3 55 to  3 65  reflecting double digit growth I ll now provide a brief overview of our 2019 results and 2020 outlook for each business  and I ll start with Diagnostics  where sales grew 6 5  in the fourth quarter led by double digit growth in core laboratory testing  The rollout of Alinity continues to go well in Europe where we re winning new business at a high rate and successfully renewing existing contracts that come up for bid  We continue to expand our rollout of Alinity systems across multiple key markets including US  where last year we obtained FDA approval of Alinity for blood and plasma screening and have made significant progress obtaining regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry test menu I ll turn now to Nutrition  where sales increased 6  in the quarter  led by strong growth across several countries and segments of our business  including Southeast Asia and Latin America  across both Pediatric and Adult Nutrition as well as above market growth in the US  In Pediatric Nutrition growth was driven by PediaSure  our nutrition solutions to help kids grow and thrive  and Pedialyte  our oral rehydration product which continues to see unprecedented uptick with both children and adults  In Adult Nutrition  global growth of 10  in the fourth quarter was led by Ensure  our leading complete and balanced nutrition brand and Glucerna our leading brand for people with diabetes Moving now to Medical Devices  where sales increased nearly 11 5  in the fourth quarter led by double digit growth in Structural Heart  Diabetes Care  Electrophysiology and Heart Failure  In Structural Heart  sales increased 17  in the fourth quarter  Over the last couple of years  our portfolio and long term growth opportunities in this area have strengthened considerably  We ve been building our position organically in this area for quite some time  when in 2017  the combination with St  Jude created what I d now consider a best in class Structural Heart portfolio MitraClip  our market leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation or a leaky heart valve is the cornerstone of our portfolio with annual sales this past year of nearly  700 million  growing 30   Last year  we obtained an important new indication in the US that significantly expands the number of people that can be treated with MitraClip  And just last week  we announced that we are initiating a clinical trial that offers the potential to expand the treatable patient population even further Beyond MitraClip  several exciting technologies are expected to emerge from our Structural Heart pipeline in 2020  including CE Mark approvals for TriClip  a first of its kind technology to repair leaky tricuspid heart valves and for Tendyne  which targets replacement of the mitral valve  as well as US approval of Portico for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Turning now to Diabetes Care where sales increased nearly 35  in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre  our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system  Several years back we saw an opportunity to approach continuous glucose monitoring or CGM in a fundamentally different manner compared to others in the space  We challenged ourselves to rethink existing paradigms as we sought to develop a solution that would truly benefit the mass population of people living with diabetes around the world  That aspiration influenced every aspect of Libre  highly accurate  simple to use  particularly affordable and easy for patients to access The results of our unique approach have been remarkable by any measure  Libre has quickly become the global market leading wearable CGM  Its user base has roughly doubled each year to its current level of approximately 2 million users globally  including the highest user base among CGMs in the US  Reimbursement coverage has ramped up quickly around the world as payers increasingly recognize its highly differentiated value proposition  And it s only CGM that s widely available through the pharmacy channel  which is a significant benefit for patients as it simplifies the process of acquiring the product In 2019  Libre achieved full year sales approaching  2 billion  an increase of 70  versus the prior year  And importantly  as we plan for the substantial growth opportunity to come  we significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity to keep up with anticipated demand for this life changing technology Now  I ll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD  where sales increased 10  in the quarter led by growth across several geographies in Latin America and Asia  For the full year  sales increased 7  for the second year in a row  as this business continues to execute its unique branded generic strategy in emerging markets  These markets are growing rapidly  their populations are aging  their middle classes are expanding and healthcare spending is increasing due to improving access to healthcare  Our strategy to build a significant presence and scale in these markets is unique and continues to result in strong growth So in summary  this was another highly successful year with strong performance across our businesses  We continue to strengthen our leadership positions in some of the largest and fastest growing areas in healthcare and we re entering 2020 with great momentum across our businesses and targeting another year of strong organic sales growth and double digit EPS growth I ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2019 results and 2020 outlook in more detail  Brian Brian B  Yoor    Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Miles  As Scott mentioned earlier  please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis which is consistent with our previous guidance Turning to our results  Sales for the fourth quarter increased 8 5   Exchange had an unfavorable year over year impact of 1 4  on fourth quarter sales  Regarding other aspects of the P L  the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59 4  of sales  adjusted R D investment was 6 7  of sales and adjusted SG A expense was 28 3  of sales  The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 12 8  lower than our previous full year guidance of around 14 5   due to continued implementation of and adaptation to the US tax reform regulations  Our fourth quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to achieve our full year revised effective tax rate of 14  Turning to our outlook for the full year 2020  today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of  3 55 to  3 65  For the full year we forecast organic sales growth of 7  to 8   And based on current rates  we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 0 05  on our full year reported sales  We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59  of sales for the full year  which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses  offset by the impact of investments to support the rapid market adoption of our Alinity diagnostic systems  investments in Libre and MitraClip manufacturing capacity expansions and the impact of currency mix  We forecast adjusted R D investment of approximately 7  of sales and adjusted SG A expense of around 29 5  of sales  We forecast net interest expense of around  515 million and non operating income around  200 million  Lastly  we forecast an adjusted tax rate of 13 5  to 14  for the full year 2020 Turning to our outlook for the first quarter  We forecast adjusted EPS of  0 69 to  0 71 which reflects double digit growth  We forecast organic sales growth of around 7  and at current rates would expect exchange to have a negative impact of a little more than 1  on our first quarter reported sales  We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 58 5  of sales  adjusted R D investment of somewhat above 7  of sales and adjusted SG A expense of around 32  of sales  Lastly  we forecast net interest expense of around  130 million in the first quarter Before we open the call for questions  I ll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business  For Established Pharmaceuticals  we forecast mid to high single digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year  In Nutrition  we forecast growth of around 4  for the full year and growth of 3  to 4  for the first quarter  In Diagnostics  we forecast mid to high single digit growth for both the first quarter and full year  and in Medical Devices  we forecast double digit growth similar to last year for both the first quarter and full year With that  we will now open the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America  Your line is open Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking the question  So I guess  first  Miles congratulations on such an incredible run of 20 plus years of value creation  obviously incredibly impressive track record  And in light of that the first question  I d love to ask  both you and Robert to comment on a topic  that I know is on the minds of most investors from a big picture perspective and that is the durability of the incredible 7  revenue growth outlook that you guys have expressed for 2020 and beyond  And the main reason I want to ask that question is that when you take a step back  there is no other company in med tech modeling anything close to that kind of growth off of that large of a base  especially for multiple years  So Miles for you  I guess  just if you wouldn t mind providing some big picture thoughts on that durability topic  And then for Robert maybe getting a little bit more specific on the product areas that give you the confidence long term and whether or not M A or divestitures could play a slightly bigger role going forward to help you maintain that level of growth  Thank you Miles D  White    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBob  this is Miles  There is a temptation to sort of say something that sticks my successor with just unbelievable goals for the future  etc   is overwhelming  So I m going to speak first  Seriously  we have been building what we ve got here for an extended period of time  It didn t just happen  It s not based on a single driving product or driving business  It s actually quite broad based across all of our businesses  And while you know  a lot of people have commented to me or us that gee  you get the lot of big numbers and you know hard for a big company to grow  etc  We don t actually feel like that big a company And we don t necessarily feel even though we ve got leading positions in so many of our businesses  We don t actually feel like a lot of big numbers is working against us  We feel like the opportunity for growth  if you ve got an innovative pipeline and you re in markets  where there is a natural tailwind of growth demographically or from an innovation standpoint and so on  yeah  I don t really think that this whole notion of gee  our size or big numbers applies  If we were a tech company  you wouldn t be asking us that  because we d be too small So  you know  I think if we look at the size of the opportunities where we place the Company and its businesses and the portfolio of products and geographies and so forth  I think there is enormous market opportunity that s untapped  And I think there is enormous penetration to be tapped  and I think there are some obvious examples out there  And fortunately in all of our businesses  I think every one of them is innovating and creating new products and innovating to replace older products in a way that s really never been true before and it s across the board  And so as we look forward to that and model it  we think our growth rates are sustainable  How far out are they sustainable  I don t know  but years anyway And are we going to have speed bumps  We re going to have speed bumps of our own making  we re going to have speed bumps from trade  we re going to have speed bumps from exchange  we re going to have speed bumps in any number of ways  as all companies have and do and yet we    and we have them now  and we re still growing at a very healthy strong rate  And I credit the innovation pipeline  some smart acquisitions at the right time  with the right businesses  the right strategies  the right fits  I credit the execution of our organization and the culture of execution that is here  I have super confidence in my successor  no qualms  The minute you retire everybody thinks you ought to diversify your holdings  because you re too concentrated in one thing  I only wish I had more And I ll remind them every day that I m a shareholder  but which he knows  but I have nothing but confidence in the pipeline  the management  the products  the strategies and the new leader  who is going to take over from me  I have tremendous confidence in Robert  and he s got all the abilities  all the skills  etc  So we can keep talking about the lot of big numbers and gee  how do you grow on this base  We don t feel slowed or anything by that  We feel like we ve got tremendous opportunity to sustain our growth rates Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Bob  this is Robert here  As you re aware  under Miles  leadership last 20 plus years  Abbott has been reshaped several times  I was close to him and to the Board when we went through this last reshaping of the Company to really position and align our businesses to kind of high growth markets  geographies  etc  And as Miles said  it wasn t just the acquisition piece of it  which was important  but it was also how we looked at our internal R D  our internal innovation  how we thought about it  So obviously with the transition here to CEO  there s the natural question of the incoming  Do they think differently  Is there a change in strategy  Is a different way of thinking  And I can tell you  I m very much aligned with Miles We see things very similar  as it relates to our strategy  how we operate  the philosophy of the Company  the vision we have for Abbott  And in the last 18 months for me  in particular to be kind of close to Miles during this transition period  being closer to him with his mentorship and learning how he has been able to kind of create value as you referenced in the beginning there  that leaves me with my number 1 priority to do that is to really execute as Miles said on these organic growth opportunities we have  And we have multiple growth drivers as you know  Bob that  in my opinion they re in their very early stages  whether it s Libre  the Alinity rollout  our rejuvenated cardiovascular portfolio  I think we ve got a great opportunity in our adult International Nutrition business  our branded generic pharmaceutical business in the emerging markets  which is a very unique strategy So I look at all of that and I think your question how sustainable is this  I think all these opportunities are in the early stages here  and it s really going to be up to me and the team here to make sure that we maximize on all of these opportunities  So we ve got a portfolio that s aligned to the biggest areas of medical need  attractive geographies  As Miles said about the pipeline  it s a very rich pipeline  We talk about how this pipeline has evolved  and how we haven t seen as rich as a pipeline at Abbott in a long time  and it s a nice cadence also  It s not just a kind of won and done  We ve got multiple kind of rollouts here Our operate    the way we operate is very strong  Miles talked about our culture  We set high aspirations for ourselves  and we do have a culture of accountability  of execution  and then you layer that in with 100 000 of the colleagues around the world that are passionate  they care about what they re doing  they believe in what we re doing  they believe in our strategy  I think we ve got all the elements here to be able to sustain this kind of growth rate going forward Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  That s super helpful  Just one super short follow up on Diabetes  Robert  if you wouldn t mind just giving us a quick update on Libre 2 timelines and your thoughts there  And then if you re willing to give us a sense for in your 2020 guidance  what sort of growth assumption are you making for Libre in 2020  Thank you Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  So on Libre 2  specifically last October  I mentioned that we were working through a handful of issues  Quite frankly  we encounter this handful of issues in other parts of our business too  so it s nothing that s for us is terribly surprising  It s normal  I m not going to go into any of the real specifics here  But what I will say  Bob  is that since that time in October  I m very pleased with the progress that we ve made  And I continue to be very confident in Libre 2 and its performance and the product itself and its iCGM label So regarding the guidance on Libre 2  what I can tell you is that we ve got a lot of growth  We    our guidance contemplates  Phonetic  a lot of Libre growth  So we re not necessarily differentiating here between one and two  But if you look at our Q4  we had a great Q4 with Libre and that s without Libre 2 in the US  It was a great way to exit and to enter 2020  As Miles said  we re the market leader in CGM in revenue and in the amount of patients  and we re growing at twice the rate Our strategy here  has always been Miles talked about challenging some of the paradigms  It has always been from the moment we launched  to look at this as a more kind of consumer  retail  kind of web shop online play here  So when you look at our Q4  you don t see that kind of big Q4 spike and then drop in Q1  which you usually see from kind of medical benefit DME products  Our growth is very kind of consistent and sequential The US has done very well in the year  Obviously  we want to do better  but we exited the year with well over 0 5 million patients in the US  We set up some goals for 2019  as it relates to distribution  payer coverage in the US  formulary positions  And we exited 2019 exactly where we wanted to be  with all of those goals  all favorable to Libre So  our focus in the US in 2020 here is really to take advantage of what we ve established in terms of the infrastructure and drive demand  So you ll see more TV advertising  you ll see more sales force expansion  you ll see more partnerships and execution of those partnerships  you ll see more sampling  And I think that  that same momentum that you see in the US is also there in our international markets  which is obviously a much larger base for us  and we saw great momentum in Q4 So our 2020 here is really focusing on international markets as expanding Libre into geographies that we haven t yet launched  We were capacity constrained in 2019 to the several markets that we haven t launched  and we put in place now plans to roll Libre into those new geographies and rollout Libre 2 into some of those Libre 1 markets One thing I think is important to kind of put front and center here is the clinical aspect of Libre  It is the most studied CGM right now  And if you look at the data  whether it s our data  whether it s real world evidence data  whether it s third party government sponsored trials  they all say the same thing  which is people that use Libre have better outcomes  They live better  They have let    their A1c drops  Their hypo drops  Their rate of hospitalization goes down  So that the value proposition that we ve always envisioned for Libre not only is it intact  but we actually see it growing  It s an easy to use  intuitive  consumer friendly product that delivers the outcomes that are real and measurable and it s priced for mass adoption  it s affordable We always saw the therapy benefit not only for type 1s and for pumpers  we saw this therapy benefit for people that were on one shot a day insulin  oral med patients  So we always looked at this market to be 80 million to 100 million people  Now  is it going to penetrate all the 100 million people  That might be a little bit too aspirational  But what I would say  is it more than 2 million  3 million  5 million  10 million people  Absolutely  And that s how we re building our strategy  investing in the product  investing in the awareness and investing in the scalability  so we can capitalize on this opportunity Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from J P  Morgan  Your line is open Robert Marcus    J P  Morgan    AnalystThanks for taking the question  I ll echo Bob s sentiment  Miles  sorry to see you go  but we re very happy to have someone so confident as Robert step in  Maybe if we could turn to Structural Heart  I was wondering if you could give an update on where we are with reimbursement and MitraClip  And then also a bit more broadly  Miles  you talked about some of the new product launches we re going to see in 2020  Maybe you could just walk us through those and the expectations throughout the year Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  Robbie  I ll take that  On MitraClip listen  we had a great quarter  had a great year  and as Miles said in his comments about  700 million product growing at 30   And the interesting thing here is that the penetration of the therapy is only at about 5   right  So we see a long opportunity  I talked about MitraClip being a multi year  multi billion dollar opportunity here And there s several elements to that  CMS reimbursement is an important building block  We expect that some time in Q2  But I ve always said that it was more than just the CMS reimbursement for the indication expansion we got  We know that we need to be able to penetrate the therapy  We need to open new centers  make it more available  To do that  we need to hire more reps  invest in field clinical teams to be able to get that penetration  And we ve also invested in a lot of clinical evidence and building clinical evidence here  we just recently announced our study to investigate MitraClip in moderate risk surgical patients So again  we ve been investing to build this market and obviously MitraClip gets a lot of attention in the Structural Heart portfolio  But if I take a step back here  I think it s important that we look at  we ve always seen valvular heart disease as a big opportunity for Abbott  whether it s the demographics  whether it s the medical need  And we saw this unique opportunity with the St  Jude acquisition to put together our MitraClip capabilities with the portfolio  St  Jude and really create a stand alone business unit that was best in class for Structural Heart  And we did that and it s been about two years that we ve done that  And I    I think we re seeing really the impact of the effect of a dedicated team  R D  clinical  and we ve got a nice cadence of products coming out this year as a result of that work We ve got two new CE approvals that we expect this year  Miles mentioned them  TriClip  This is a modified version of our MitraClip to treat the leaky heart valve  We believe it s a big opportunity  because the therapy    if mitral therapy is low  tricuspid leaky valve treatment or repair is even lower  So we know that    we know how to build this  We did it with mitral  and we re going to go about doing it the same way  building the capability  the clinical evidence Another big opportunity we have is with Tendyne  This will be the first minimally invasive mitral replacement valve  So if you think about our team right now  we ve built a lot of competency on mitral repair  and now we re going to put in the hands of this team not only the opportunity to offer repair  but also a replacement solution that s minimally invasive  And I think there is a great opportunity for us in that space too  Both those products are enrolling here in the US  So we do plan to bring those to the US On the aortic side  we ve made investments on Portico  We knew that we needed to make some clinical and some R D investments here to increase the competitiveness of the system  and we like the data  We think there is going to be a segment of the population  segment of the market that we will be able to compete effectively  It s under FDA review  and we expect approval shortly And then finally on our Structural intervention  this is a part of the portfolio that doesn t get a lot of attention here  but it s about a quarter of our Structural Heart business  It s growing double digit  We ve got great products there  We ve seen a great ramp up with our stroke prevention technology  with PFO  our congenital business  and Amulet  which is right now under clinical evaluation in the US for treatment of LAA So I take a step back here  I said  yeah  MitraClip is a big growth driver  and we got a lot of things going right there  We re making the right investments from a clinical  from a commercial perspective  But I look at the portfolio that s been built here and I m very excited  it s very complete  it s very differentiated and there is a nice cadence  Robbie  to the launches Robert Marcus    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  I appreciate that  And maybe just a quick follow up  Alinity still hasn t really start its launch in the US  yeah  you put up 13  growth in Core Lab in the fourth quarter  How should we be thinking about the impact in 2020 from Alinity both in the US and outside the US Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  I think that we re going to continue to see this kind of rollout of the Alinity platform  The challenge we had a little bit in the US and Miles talked about the progress we made is that  when we launched it in Europe  we had a more complete kind of assay menu  And that allowed us to more    with more intentionality go after the market  the existing accounts  new accounts And then the US  we ve now achieved  let s say a critical mass of assay menu  test panel etc   that allows us to have that same kind of intentionality we had in Europe  have that same intentionality move into the US  Q4  we did have some capital sales  so that brings up the growth rate a little bit  But I think you re going to see the same kind of growth rate in the US  the same kind of ramp up that we saw in Europe Robert Marcus    J P  Morgan    AnalystThanks a lot OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley  Your line is open David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGood morning  I don t want to sound like a broken record  but I ll reiterate Miles  there s some fairly significant and unique value creation over these last 20 years  So congratulations again on behalf of shareholders  Robert and Miles just starting off with a couple of businesses that had lagged in 2019 that are actually showing some improvement here in the back half of  19  which were Neuromodulation and CRM  some pretty decent improvement  specifically in the fourth quarter  I mean  Robert  you can just talk through what specific changes have been made in those two businesses  And how you re thinking about the outlook or sustainability of those franchises into 2020  And then I have a quick follow up Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  So let s start over with Neuro then  I mean I think we had a tough year  full year in Neuro  when we came into the year  we talked about some of the challenges we were up against  And there are really two we had  obviously the sales force expansion and some of the disruption that  that created  But we felt it was important to do  to make that sales force expansion  And then some of the market declines that we saw  We re kind of seeing double digit growths and beginning of the year kind of saw that go to flat and even negative growth rate So I think the sales force expansion piece  we kind of got past that in the middle of the year  It s a unique selling model  about 30  to 35  of our sales team in the US was new  was under a year  So we spend a lot of time getting them up to speed  not only with their territories  but how to go about the selling process  etc  And I think that s    that s largely behind us  Now obviously if you look at the sales reps  the ones that have 7 to 10 years of experience  they re much more productive than the ones that have got 12 months  but we re seeing a nice steady ramp up in terms of the productivity of those new sales reps And the other thing we talked about was how innovation and new product launches could kind of fuel the market growth  And I think you saw that in Q4 not only with us  but even with some of the other players in the market come out with new product launches  at least what I see now from some of the pre announcements having kind of an impact there And so we came out with our product launch  Proclaim XR early in Q4  and I think you saw the impact of that in Q4  I think it s a modest    it was a modest improvement  we expect more  And a lot of our focus here in 2020 is going to be to ensure that this new sales team has got innovation to sell  So we re expanding our MRI portfolio  We know we need to do  We re launching a new radio frequency ablation generator  This is an important part of our customers  practices  and we felt that we weren t as competitive with our offering there So we developed a new system that will be rolling out this year  And we also believe that programming and connectivity    connectivity to devices  consumer devices is an important aspect  patient adoption of the therapy  So we ll continue to work on how we integrate to implant the device into those    those more consumer products  So we ve got a nice cadence of rollouts there And on the CRM side  we talked about this in the beginning of last year  we had    we encountered some challenges  And we felt that one of the things that we needed to do for the CRM side was to make sure  it got more focus and more attention  not only from    not only from me obviously  but from the management team  So we made an organizational structure change  Q1 of last year  which got finalized in Q2  where we separated the CRM business from the EP  Phonetic  business And we didn t do it just from a field sales perspective  we did it up really across all functions  So we have a dedicated CRM business unit with a dedicated leader  R D  etc  And I think you ve seen some of the output of that focus in the second half of the year  I would like to see a couple more quarters strung together  So that s what we re aspiring here too But I think one of the biggest impact of that focus obviously  the field has an impact  but I m more excited about the focus on the R D side  I think we had to kind of slowed down our R D innovation over here and that focus  that dedicated business unit focus  I think you ll see the output of that  not only in 2020  we have a couple of product launches in the US  new ICD  and in Europe also  but we ve got plans for a nice cadence of innovation in  21 and  22  So I m excited about kind of what we ve done there  Obviously  it s early innings in terms of this business unit we ll be creating  but I like what I see David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And just two quick follow ups for me  Just Robert on MitraClip  is there a specific embedded assumption in the guidance for MitraClip  And how acutely do you think we see that recovery in the back half  And then your margin guidance about 50 basis points is a little lower than 2019 consistent with our numbers  but if you could just highlight two or three of the examples of significant reinvestment for growth in 2020 that would be super helpful  Thanks so much Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerSo I just    on your question about MitraClip recovering growth  and I think we ve been pretty strong in our growth rate  The US has done very well  And what we saw in the international market  if that s what you re referring to  we did see that kind of impact of the    some of the studies that came out in Europe impact us in the first quarter  but every quarter sequentially flat  We ve seen improvement  and I think we ve passed    we ve passed that on Regarding the guidance  I mean we ve got a lot of growth  As I said with Libre  we ve got a lot of growth here  We ve contemplated  as I said  CMS approval  but I have been fairly consistent with the CMS approval is going to be an important aspect here  but it s not just that  right  It s the    we ve been showing really strong growth in the US even without the reimbursement  and that s a result of the investments that we ve been making both in the field and clinical perspective  And I m sorry what was the other question Brian B  Yoor    Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial OfficerIt was on    it was on margin expansion  I ll start off by saying this margin improvement is an ongoing focus for us David  it has been and will continue to be whether that s gross margin  whether that s the leverage we continue to get in SG A  And yes  notably  we did see that this year  You may be off just a little bit from our modelling  the foreign currency mix  we have a little bit of a headwind next year  but we have our gross margin expansion plan underlying But keep in mind as Robert said  with these investments that we re doing for growth  whether that s continued Libre expansion  whether that s the most recent MitraClip expansion we announced  as well as the unprecedented uptake of Alinity  that s presenting a little bit of a headwind  but that s a good news item in the short term and longer term  You ll continue to see those gross margins expand  as we look out over the years David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Thanks so much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore  Your line is open Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  guys  Congrats on a really nice springs here  Phonetic   One may be on Nutrition  the adult side has come in really strong  I know  China has been a bit of a bother with some regulation    regulatory changes a couple of years ago  Could you comment on what you re seeing in China  is Adult Nutrition back  Is    has something changed in China for you guys Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerWell  listen we achieved a pretty strong growth rate in Q4 and that s despite some of the softness that we did see in China  We talked a little bit about it in Q3  Vijay  We ve seen some improvement  but some of those dynamics are still there  whether it s the birth rate or some of the kind of competitive intensity  We have obviously developed a plan here  as were going into Q4 and going into 2020 here  a big part of that strategy to address some of those competitive dynamics there is innovation and product launches and we put a plan together here We got a nice steady stream of    cadence of launches in China  But I do think that it does point out to the strength of our Nutrition business that we re able to post this kind of growth rate despite still some continued softness in China  And I think that speaks to the strength of the business  Miles talked about we had some very strong growth in South  Southeast Asia and Latin America on both sides of the business  Pediatric and Adult  And I don t think that    I think it shows this    China is an important market for us for sure  It has our intentions    our attention  But we re not overly reliant on it Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystYeah  That s helpful  Robert  And one on Diagnostics  I know flu has been the topic du jour  Just curious what that means for Diagnostics  On the Core Lab side  Alinity  really strong trends  You spoke about continued share gains in Europe  I m just curious where we are in  on the US side  Have you    is the win rate on the US side comparable to Europe or is that something that we should be expecting for the back half heading into  20   21  Phonetic  Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  As I said  in Europe  I think we ve had kind of good success in Europe  We talked about winning new businesses at that 50  rate  The renewals of our existing business  where we re trailing nearly    nearly all of that business  And I think in the US right now  it might be a little bit too early  just because you don t we really didn t have the intentionality the launch that we had in Europe  Now that we ve got a more complete menu  I think our ability to compete and our competitive fitness  let s call it that way in the US increases to the same level that we ve had in Europe Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  Thank you  guys OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo  Your line is open Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo    AnalystGood morning  Thanks for taking the question  Congrats on another really strong quarter  And Miles  I ll echo what the other    the other comments and add that I ll miss interacting with you on these calls  always insightful and fun  Just two quick questions  One  maybe for Robert on capital allocation  I know I ve asked this on a few calls before  but you guys have paid down a lot of debt recently  Are you  Robert maybe thinking about M A a little bit differently  Should we expect more tuck ins in 2020  And I just have one quick follow up Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  I think what you ll see is the same philosophy  the same framework that we ve had for this year  which is a very kind of balanced approach  As you ve said  a lot of our focus  the last couple of years has been to pay down debt  We paid down close to  10 billion over the last two years  Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is around 1 5 now  And we ve got kind of payments that are due in the next few years and that s all kind of contemplated in our capital plan The other thing we re always going to have a mindful eye here  Larry is ensuring that a portion of that capital goes back to our shareholders  Our dividend is a big part of our identity  We ve increased our dividend for 47 consecutive years  This year we just announced a 13  increase  So    and we announced also at the end of last year  our share repurchase about  3 billion  We do that from time to time mainly to kind of offset dilution We ll also look at our growth opportunities  and we ve talked a lot about them whether it s the rollout of Alinity  whether it s the manufacturing expansion of Libre  We just announced in Q4  a new manufacturing site  a second manufacturing site for MitraClip  Those are all great returns for our shareholders in terms of the return of that capital And then on the M A side  we re now looking to do any deals right now  I think the framework that Miles has always worked is true to me  which is you know it needs to meet our threshold of it being strategic or  and at the same time opportunistic  And we ve been looking at a lot  but we re always studying  we re always looking  and I haven t seen anything crossing the radar here that kind of falls in    falls into those two    those two buckets  But we re always going to keep looking  as we ve always done Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo    AnalystPerfect  And then just one housekeeping for Brian  and Brian congratulations on your retirement and I ll miss you as well  Just FX on the    on EPS  the impact in 2020  Thanks for taking the questions Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerThe impact of what  EPS FX Brian B  Yoor    Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial OfficerFX  it s around  0 05  Larry Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks  Brian Brian B  Yoor    Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial OfficerBased on the mix  you got it OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel  Your line is open Rick Wise    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystGood morning  everybody  Maybe I ll start off with EPD  EPD  Rob  it s always a little bit of a black box to us Medical Device and after all just said to me  I won t drag everybody else into it  You re clearly doing exceptionally well  strong fourth quarter  and you re saying mid to high single digits for 2020  But maybe just give us a little update some of the key drivers  What could gets you to the upper end of your range  And maybe some of the challenges  just give us some perspective about what you re thinking about for 2020 Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  I heard this comment a couple of times now about kind of EPD or pharma business kind of being a black box or not as transparent and as not as understanding  I mean I will say here  the biggest focus of this business is taking opportunity of the geographic dynamics  right  You can either have a proprietary pharmaceutical business a little bit more higher cost versus pure generic business  which is obviously very cheap Our branded generic business kind of sits between those two book ins  I come from an emerging market  so I can tell you that when we buy medications  it s not reimbursed  So you pay for it out of pocket and you re willing to pay a little bit of a premium to ensure that what you re getting is high quality product  And I think that s what this business has been built on is taking advantage of that dynamic of this population in these markets growing with their disposable income and allocating some of that to their healthcare costs on brands that they trust  And that s what we ve been building over these years  A key driver of this strategy here is you need to be  you need to have the breadth and the depth in your therapy classes So we have comprehensive portfolios in the geographies that we re competing  They re deep in each therapy class  You need to be omnichannel  you need to be present in the doctor s office  you need to be present in the pharmacy  you need to be able to kind of communicate directly with the consumer and you need to be local  You need to have a local R D or engine organization and manufacturing to be able to move fast with the opportunities that you see  And I think that s at the core of our strategy One of the challenges in this business  as Miles has always said is the FX piece of it  but the performance growth  we expect it to be in this kind of high single digit growth  and a big driver of that is being in the right markets  with the right infrastructure  with the right products  with the depth and the focus on execution Rick Wise    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystGreat  And turning to two other areas  Heart Failure business has done a great job  How sustainable is the robust growth we ve seen  And maybe talk a little bit about the implications of the less invasive surgical approach for HeartMate 3  what that might mean  And just last maybe touch a little bit on Alere  It s been a little bit of an disappointment  What are the next steps  Help us understand what s going on  And where we go from here with Alere  Thank you so much Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  On Heart Failure  I mean we had a very successful 2019  We achieved the destination therapy indication for HeartMate 3 at the end of  18  So that rolled into  19  So you saw the growth rate of about 20  here  Rick  that growth is predominantly driven by share gains and specifically here in the US  So we exited 2019  Our estimation right now is through our internal data north of 80  So as we go into 2020  we expect that to not be at that 20  rate now and to mirror more of what the market is growing  which is we expect to be in that mid single digit range  But I do believe that we ve got a lot of opportunity  I talked about cadence of innovation in our products and one product that s comped pretty quiet  but we ve done a really good job there  which is CardioMEMS CardioMEMS is now close to  100 million  It s growing 30   We continue to enrolled in our guide HF trial that s going to be used to open an NCD  but the outcomes there are also extremely meaningful in terms of hospitalization reductions  etc  So I think that will be kind of our next driver of growth in Heart Failure  and I m very pleased with what the team has been able to build in that business Going to your question on Alere  It s been a little bit of a    we ll call it like a mixed bag here  We ve had some businesses that we brought into Abbott  and I think we ve done very well with them  We ve accelerated their performance  If I look at the infectious disease portfolio in our developed markets  that s done very well  Yeah  of course there is some opportunity there with the flu season  But I think the team has done a really good job here expanding the portfolio and looking at those that installed base beyond just a flu test  And our cardiometabolic business has done very well too  growing in the high single digits  low double digits So I think those two businesses  we ve done a really good job with  and I think the team has done a good job on the cost side with the synergies too  But you have pointed out that there are some parts in the business here  where we were not pleased with  we re not satisfied  Our emerging market Infectious Disease segment had a tough 2019  part of that is kind of NGO purchasing cycles and dynamics in certain markets  but we ve got to do better than that  And we ve implemented a strategy here to really look at other emerging markets outside of the African continent here and build the value proposition of those tests in other emerging markets In our toxicology business too  I don t think we ve been able to kind of fully maximize the value there and that one there has got a lot of attention too  So we had a good Q4  a lot of focus here  a lot of good growth in the US  and I think part of that was a little bit of the flu  But if we can get these two business here  our emerging markets and our toxicology business to execute on the plans that we put in place for them  I think you ll see that is kind of a mid growth  a mid single digit kind of growth business for us But I look at the trend and the dynamics of these products for the opportunities we have  the strategy to get into these businesses is still very much intact also  Miles talked about more and more testing move into alternative channels  We continue to see that  and we re targeting steady improvement here  But I think the long term growth opportunity because of that trend is very positive Rick Wise    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystThanks and congratulations Scott Leinenweber    Vice President of Investor Relations  Licensing and AcquisitionsThanks  operator  We ll take one more question OperatorThank you  And our final question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays  Your line is open Kristen Stewart    Barclays    AnalystHi  thanks so much for taking my question  Congratulations Miles on your retirement and Brian  I hope your next chapter is a positive one as well  Just I guess a couple of cleanup questions  In terms of the  I guess PHP product  I was just wondering if you can maybe update us on just the timelines there for expected launch And then also for Amulet as well just kind of expectations for a launch just to get some timelines  And then also  I think you Robert had also mentioned just some products within the CRM business launching there  Could you just maybe update us on expectations for that franchise  I think you mentioned a new ICD platform and some other milestones to expect within the CRM portfolio  Thanks Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerSo sure  on PHP and Amulet  I mean those are still I d say a couple of years away  So we re still in kind of clinical evaluation of that  We ll then kind of put the information together  submit to the FDA  So I d say you kind of have normal timelines over there  So you can look at it about a couple    a couple of years away On the CRM side  like I said  I think the biggest opportunity we had when we changed the structure was to kind of get the innovation going  So we ve got two product launches  we ve got a new version of    new update to our implantable cardiac monitor planned for this year  We ve got a new ICD planned again for both US and Europe  And our growth expectations here are to be    to do better than what we ve been doing  steady sequential improvement  We ve had some challenges  and I think that these products here will allow us to continue that sequential improvement  Yeah  So I ll   Kristen Stewart    Barclays    AnalystPerfect  And then  I forgot  Phonetic  Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerGo ahead Kristen Stewart    Barclays    AnalystI was just going to say and do you see any opportunities  I think Bob had mentioned this  but any opportunities just in terms of divestitures within Medical Devices or elsewhere within the portfolio or some smaller tuck in  I know you said  it didn t sound like you were going to do any larger scale M A  but just more product lines to bring into the portfolio from a more of a tuck in acquisition from technology earlier stage Robert B  Ford    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Listen if I take that and just talk about our model  we have a diversified model  I fundamentally believe in our diversified model  I think you ve seen sequential improvement in all four areas over the last couple of years from a big picture perspective  Now when you go into each one of them  can you find some areas that we can do better  and we should do better  Yeah  we can and we ve talked about some of those today  But that doesn t mean that we don t think they re great opportunities that just means that we need to focus on doing better and executing better on that  So as I look at these four businesses  I like the businesses we have Kristen Stewart    Barclays    AnalystOkay  perfect  Thank you very much Miles D  White    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  This is Miles again  I ll wrap up and close for us  So first of all  thank you all very much for your very kind comments  And on behalf of both Brian and I    well  speak and tell you that it s been a great honor and a great pleasure for us to lead our Company  It s been a tremendous experience  I feel like I ve had two or three careers here in the last 21 years and probably have Brian was estimating this morning this was our 85th or 86th earnings call  And therefore  I can t tell you that I know yeah  whether I m going to miss him  but I m sure had a lot of them  And they re always challenging  they re always interesting opportunities to converse with you about the prospects of the Company and so forth I feel like I leave the Company in perhaps its best position ever in terms of products and growth  future opportunities  etc   as I said at the beginning  I m very pleased with the succession and the management team that s here  It s not just the CEO that s changing  the CFO is changing and Bob Funck  who s our long time Abbott employee and he s been our Controller for a number of years and been in some of the most challenging jobs at Abbott and so forth  will be an absolutely superb successor to Brian You know that a lot of our management team has changed over the last couple of years as we move to a next generation of leaders and managers in the Company  And I think it s a great mix of people that are homegrown and also have come to us either through St  Jude or other outside places and we re just really happy with the team  we ve got  the pipelines we ve got  the positions we ve got  We think our success is sustainable  And I think the track record that we ve laid down over the last years has been recognized that way  and we re appreciative of the recognition that all of you have given As I commented tongue in cheek  as a significant shareholder of the Company  I ll obviously be watching closely  And especially in the    the immediate future  as the Chairman So with that  we ll close the call  Thank you all very much  and thanks for all your support Scott Leinenweber    Vice President of Investor Relations  Licensing and AcquisitionsVery good  Thank you  operator  and thank you for all of your questions  This now concludes Abbott s conference call  A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 00 AM Central Time today on

181080,402596,ABT,Why Abbott Laboratories Just Became an Even Better Buy,news,"Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  has been a great buy for many years  The healthcare stock has made investors rich in a number of ways  While it may pay a modest dividend  the annual increases to its payouts for more than 40 years has made it an exceptionally good long term buy 
The returns shareholders have earned over the years from simply holding its shares have been very strong  In 2019  Abbott s stock was up 20   a little better than the 18  returns investors would have earned by holding the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund 
As good of a buy as Abbott has been  it just got even better 
The company showed strong sales growth in 2019
Abbott released its fourth quarter earnings on Jan  22  and the numbers were very strong  Revenue of  8 31 billion was up 7 1  in Q4  which was good enough to beat analyst expectations of  8 26 billion  Meanwhile  diluted earnings per share  EPS  of  0 95 were in line with Wall Street s expectations as well 
The company s overall performance was even stronger when looking at its organic growth rate  which factors out the effect of foreign exchange as well as non core business in the nutrition segment that Abbott discontinued in 2018  Organic growth in Q4 was 8 5  and two segments were up by double digits  Medical devices rose by 11 3  and pharmaceuticals grew by 10   Medical device sales were also up 10 5  for the entire year when looking at its organic numbers 

Abbott s bottom line was even more impressive
Revenue was strong  but what really stood out was the jump in earnings  The company s net earnings of  1 05 billion were up 61  from the prior year quarter when Abbott earned  654 million  Small wins along the way  such as fewer expenses related to interest and debt  saved the company  36 million  while the net effect of foreign exchange added  2 million to its bottom line compared to a loss of  26 million a year ago  That s  62 million in cost reductions  that alone would have been good enough for a 10  improvement from last year s bottom line 
However  the biggest gains were in the company s operating income where Abbott was able to squeeze out more from its top line  Operating expenses  including cost of goods sold  rose at a rate of 4 9   slightly below the 7 1  increase that the company saw in its top line  That helped Abbott s operating income rise by  224 million 
It was the same story when looking at the company s full year results  as Abbott s revenue growth of 4 3  was well above the 1 7  increase that its operating expenses rose by  leaving more of the top line to trickle through to the bottom  As a result  full year earnings were also up an impressive 56  year over year 
It s expecting another good year in 2020
With a stellar 2019 on the books  Abbott is expecting another strong showing this year  In its full year guidance for 2020  the company is projecting that organic growth will again fall between 7  to 8   In 2019  organic growth for the year came in at 7 7  
On the earnings side  the company is expecting diluted EPS of between  2 35 and  2 45  That would be another double digit improvement from the company s diluted EPS of  2 06 in 2019  
It s hard not to like Abbott 
At a forward price to earnings ratio of 22 and a price to book multiple of around five  Abbott is not a cheap stock for value investors  However  given the growth the company has demonstrated and its numbers being weighed down by foreign exchange  there s reason to be optimstic that it can build on these results not just for one year but many years down the road 
It s a sign of good management that a company can grow sales and at the same time bring its costs down  But given that the company has been able to increase its dividend payments for decades  it may not be all that surprising that Abbott is such a quality stock to invest in  With good revenue diversification and multiple segments showing strong sales growth  the healthcare stock is a good option for risk averse investors who may be concerned that a recession is around the corner and are in search of a quality dividend ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqg8u,2074498

Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  both have large market valuations  solid dividends  and a strong track record of success  However  they operate in different areas of the healthcare market  with Abbott developing diagnostic equipment while Pfizer focuses on developing new pharmaceutical candidates 
If you had to choose between the two  however  which is the better investment 

Big changes for Pfizer on the horizon
The upcoming year is going to bring quite a few changes for Pfizer  and that has many investors on edge  The company s new CEO  Albert Bourla  is implementing a major shift in corporate strategy  focusing on higher margin products by spinning off well known drug brands that have been dragging down revenue growth 
Earlier in July  Pfizer announced that it was selling its non patent drug unit  Upjohn  to Mylan  creating a new company called Viatris in the process  Viatris will be home to a number of well known drug brands that have been decent revenue drivers  although their growth rates have slowed down  
If shedding its Upjohn drug collection wasn t a big enough change  Pfizer also announced that it will combine its consumer healthcare unit with GlaxoSmithKline s own equivalent business to create a separate entity for over the counter products  While Pfizer s consumer healthcare division wasn t that large  and it still will retain a 32  stake in the new joint venture  it will mean the loss of some well known products  most notably Advil 
Pfizer will be going back to basics  so to speak  focusing on developing new drug candidates as well as marketing its existing lineup of rapidly growing blockbuster candidates  This includes a cancer drug called Inlyta  a rare heart disease treatment called Vyndaqel  and immunology drug Xeljanz  All three drugs have seen very strong growth rates  with Inlyta up 240   Vyndaqel up 325   and Xeljanz up 40  year over year in terms of sales  
The company s best drug candidates  an anticoagulant called Eliquis and a breast cancer drug called lbrance  are also still staying with Pfizer  Both drugs are the primary revenue sources for their respective areas    internal medicine and oncology    and collectively account for 18  of Pfizer s total revenue 
Overall  Pfizer s facing a big shift  but it s likely to emerge from it as a more focused and efficient drug developer than it s been in many years 
Abbott s consistent growth from a diverse business
In contrast to Pfizer  Abbott has stayed relatively the same for the past few years  Ever since splitting from AbbVie in 2013  the company has done quite well for itself  Doubling in stock price  delivering consecutive double digit growth rates  and all the while maintaining a consistently increasing dividend is quite an impressive achievement  considering its large size 
Unlike Pfizer  Abbott isn t a new drug developer  Instead  its main revenue source comes from the sale of medical diagnostics equipment and devices  primarily in the realm of cardiovascular disease but also other conditions  such as diabetes  Thanks to some major acquisitions  including a  25 billion buyout of rival medical device maker St  Jude Medical in 2016  Abbott s medical device sales have seen high single digit growth in what s already the company s largest business segment 
While medical device sales are Abbott s bread and butter  its total revenue is split among four main business areas  One of these is Abbott s nutritionals business  which primarily provides formulas for infants and small children  The company also has its own generic drug business  which sells branded generic versions of drugs whose patents have expired  These two businesses accounted for 24  and 14  of Abbott s 2018 revenue  In comparison  Abbot s medical device segment accounts for 37  of the company s revenue  while its second largest business  diagnostics  accounted for 25  of 2018 income  
Comparing financials
Both Pfizer and Abbott are large cap stocks  with market caps around  216 billion and  154 billion  respectively  As it turns out  both companies have relatively similar financial metrics 
Looking at their price to sales  P S  ratios shows that Pfizer trades at 4 25  while Abbott comes in at 4 93  That s pretty much in line with most other large cap healthcare stocks  with Johnson   Johnson trading at 4 8 times sales  while Amgen trades at a 6 39 P S ratio  
While Abbott ended up taking on a significant amount of debt to fund its acquisitions  the company has done a good job paying off its debt since then  Long term liabilities have fallen from  27 billion in Q4 2017 to  17 6 billion in Q3 2019  a 35  decline in just two years  In comparison  Pfizer s debt has grown a little over that same period  from  31 8 billion to its current  36 0 billion  
What s the verdict 
Pfizer and Abbott have quite a few differences  despite their similarities  Pfizer is undergoing some major changes  spinning off many of its older  stagnating drug brands to focus on developing and marketing its portfolio of high growth drug candidates  So far  the drug lineup that Pfizer s holding on to right now has seen very impressive growth rates  some even in the triple digits 
On the other hand  Abbott embodies the philosophy of  slow and steady wins the race   The company has maintained a more than reasonable growth rate over a long period and is likely to continue doing what it s already doing 
There s a strong case to be made for both companies  but if I had to choose  I d lean a bit more toward Pfizer  While Abbott might be a better investment for a hands off investor looking for a safe and secure stock  Pfizer s move to focus on its high growth drug segment gives the stock major upside potential in the next year or two  Both companies  however  are good investments and should have a lot going for them in the future ",2020-01-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pccsn,2051185
181098,402614,ABT,Where Will Abbott Laboratories Be in 5 Years ,news,"Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  has been one of the better performing large cap healthcare stocks on the market  although many years ago the company was going through a major change  Back in 2013  Abbott s drug business ended up splitting off from the firm to form a separate company called AbbVie  In this split  AbbVie maintained ownership of a number of blockbuster drugs  the most notable being Humira 
Despite the loss of these blockbuster drugs and their impressive revenue figures  Abbott has grown at a steady rate  With the company s market cap more than doubling over the past few years and now reaching  154 5 billion  how much more room does Abbott Laboratories have to grow  Most would agree that the company s future remains bright  although growth might slow down 
To get an idea of where Abbott will be in five years  let s look into what s fueled its impressive growth over the past few years and what s going on now 

Abbott s track record of success
The history of Abbott Laboratories goes back to 1888  when Wallace Calvin Abbott started it as a one man operation  Forty one years later  the company went public on the Chicago Stock Exchange in 1929  Since then  it has become one of the top dividend stocks in the country  with a 95 year history of paying out dividends and a 47 year period of consecutively increasing its payouts 
Abbott s largest business is its medical device segment  which includes medical devices for patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes  This division accounted for 37  of the company s 2018 revenue  approximately  11 4 billion in total 
What s particularly impressive is that the annual growth rate of Abbott s medical device business has consistently hovered near the 10  mark  thanks to some of Abbott s recent acquisitions  The most notable one was the  25 billion St  Jude Medical acquisition in 2016  another medical device maker that created devices in the cardiovascular and diabetes markets 
Abbott s next two drivers of revenue are its diagnostics segment and nutrition business  which accounted for 25  and 24   respectively  of its 2018 revenue  However  Abbott has its own established pharmaceutical business  as well  selling branded generic drugs that  while not as exciting  still remain a lucrative market  This segment accounted for 14  of Abbott s 2018 revenues 
Recent financial results
Looking at Abbott s Q3 2019 quarterly results  there aren t any major warning signs to be found  Total third quarter revenue came in at  8 1 billion  with  5 2 billion coming from international markets  The best single business segment for Abbott has been its international medical device business  which reported an impressive 14 3  increase in organic sales  compared to Q3 2018 
Overall  all of Abbott s business segments have been doing well  with net income increasing by 70 3  over the past year from  563 million in Q3 2018 to  960 million as of the current quarter  Medical device sales rose by 10 6  compared to Q3 2018  while established pharmaceuticals  diagnostics  and nutrition all rose by 7 9   6 6   and 3 8   respectively  All these results are pretty much in line with analyst estimates  and Abbott s management expects to hit the upper end of its guidance target for the end of the year 
As for specific product lines that are doing well  Abbott s Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring  CGM  technology  which helps manage glucose levels for people with diabetes  saw sales jump by 67 6  over the past year  making it one of the fastest growing products in Abbott s lineup  The company also has a new MitraClip product  which is used by heart surgeons in repairing the mitral valve  which plays a crucial role in moving blood in and out of the heart  Sales have gone up by 31 9  since Q3 2018  
Abbott made a couple of major acquisitions over the past few years  In 2017  it paid a sum of  30 billion to buy St  Jude Medical and diagnostic test maker Alere  Since then  however  the company has continually paid off much of its long term debt  which has decreased from  27 2 billion in Q4 2017 to  17 6 billion as of Q3 2019 
Specific predictions for 2025
One thing to note is the planned departure of Abbott s longtime CEO Miles White  With 21 years under his belt as the chief executive for the company  it s reasonable to attribute a good portion of Abbott s steady success to his leadership  Replacing him will be Robert Ford  Abbott s current Chief Operating Officer  who was named by White as his top pick for who to replace him  Ford is only 48 so it wouldn t be surprising if he stays in this role well into 2025 and beyond  
In terms of specific segment predictions  medical device sales will remain Abbott s bread and butter  and will likely continue to grow at a faster rate than major competitors  Johnson   Johnson and Medtronic both have larger medical device businesses than Abbott  However  both of these company s businesses are growing at a slower rate  Johnson   Johnson saw 5 3  growth in its medical device business over the past year  excluding acquisitions and divestitures   less than half of Abbott s 10 6  growth rate  Medtronic grew even less  only a 4 1  increase in organic sales  
By 2025  I predict that Abbott will continue to gobble up market share from its larger competitors thanks to its faster growth rate  but still won t eclipse either Johnson   Johnson or Medtronic in this area just yet  Annual medical device sales of as much as  22 billion is possible by the end of 2025  but even a more conservative  17 billion would be impressive
As for its second biggest segment  established pharmaceuticals  Abbott falls quite a bit short when compared to the size of other company s established pharmaceutical businesses  such as Sanofi and Pfizer  Considering that Abbott is a medical device maker first and foremost  this isn t really surprising  What is impressive  however  is that Abbott s business is growing where others are shrinking  Sanofi s established pharmaceuticals business revenue shrank from  13 5 billion to  12 2 billion between 2016 and 2018  while Pfizer s fell from  11 2 billion to  10 5 billion over the same period  Abbott s  on the other hand  grew from  3 9 billion to  4 4 billion between those two years  
Abbott won t eclipse these drugmakers any time soon  but by 2025  it will have grown by a fair bit assuming its current growth rate stays the same  It wouldn t be surprising if revenues from this business segment cracks  7 billion annually 

What s the verdict on Abbott 
There s not much to say that s negative about Abbott  It s a large cap healthcare stock that s been around for many decades  so it s impressive that the company is growing its revenues this quickly while providing a consistent dividend 
Over the next five years  I expect the company to continue to increase sales  pay off debt  and widen its net margin  While the stock doubled between 2014 and 2019  I m not sure if it s going to do so again by 2025 or if growth will slow down a little  especially since doubling again would put the company s market cap at a whopping  300 billion  What is clear  however  is that this healthcare giant shows no sign that it will stop growing anytime soon ",2020-01-18,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjndb,2062576
181099,402615,ABT,Better Buy  Abbott Laboratories vs  AbbVie,news,"You d have to rank Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT  spin off of AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  in 2013 as one of the best corporate moves of the last decade  Since the separation  Abbott s share price has soared 184   while AbbVie stock is up 158  
Which stock is the better pick now for long term investors  Here s how Abbott and AbbVie stack up against each other 

The case for Abbott Labs
Abbott Labs focuses on four key markets  The company makes the most money selling cardiovascular and neuromodulation products  It also has big businesses that sell nutritional products and diagnostics systems  In addition  Abbott retained an established pharmaceuticals unit after its spin off of AbbVie that focuses primarily on emerging markets  
The company continues to deliver solid growth  with revenue rising 5 5  in the third quarter and earnings jumping 12  from the prior year  Abbott s biggest segment is also its fastest growing business  Its cardiovascular and neuromodulation products unit achieved 10 6  organic growth in the last quarter 
Wall Street analysts think that Abbott will be able to deliver average annual earnings growth of more than 11  over the next five years  The company has several growth drivers that should make this possible  including its Alinity diagnostic systems  HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist devices  MitraClip mitral regurgitation devices  and FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring  CGM  systems 
On top of this strong growth  Abbott also pays a nice dividend    it currently yields nearly 1 7   And in December  Abbott increased its dividend for the 48th consecutive year 
All of this great growth has given Abbott a somewhat pricey valuation  though  Shares currently trade at around 24 times expected earnings  But with Abbott s great prospects and strong dividend track record  paying a premium for this blue chip stock is to be expected 
The case for AbbVie
AbbVie claimed all of the prescription drugs with higher growth prospects when it was spun off  The most important of these drugs was Humira  which still ranks as the best selling drug in the world and is likely to remain in the top two until 2024 
However  Humira now faces biosimilar competition in Europe  with biosimilars on their way to the U S  market in 2023  AbbVie can t rely on the blockbuster drug for growth as it has in the past  The good news is that the company has a strong lineup  including cancer drugs Imbruvica and Venclexta along with new immunology drugs Rinvoq and Skyrizi 
But with analysts expecting weak average annual earnings growth of less than 4  over the next five years as Humira s sales wane  AbbVie knew it needed to do something different  That s why the drugmaker is acquiring Allergan  NYSE AGN  for  63 billion  The deal will bring the enormously successful Botox into AbbVie s arsenal along with promising newer drugs including Vraylar 
While AbbVie s growth prospects are somewhat shaky  its dividend definitely isn t  The company s dividend yield stands at a mouthwatering 5 4   making AbbVie one of the most attractive high yield dividend stocks on the market 
AbbVie s shares trade at only 9 4 times expected earnings  one of the lowest valuations among big healthcare stocks  However  the valuation isn t as appealing when looking over a longer period  with Humira facing the prospect of slumping sales in the wake of biosimilar competition in the U S  market  Still  though  with the company s terrific dividend and modest growth prospects that should be bolstered with the Allergan acquisition  many investors will likely think that the price is right for AbbVie 
Better buy
Which stock is the better pick  My answer is that it depends on your investing goals 
Growth investors will prefer Abbott Labs  The company should enjoy a big sales boost if and when the FDA clears the way for the new version of FreeStyle Libre to hit the U S  market  However  I think that income investors will prefer AbbVie s sizzling yield  Even with the company s Humira challenges  my view is that AbbVie will keep the dividends flowing and growing for a long time to come ",2020-01-19,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjxcr,2062736

 Reuters     Abbott Laboratories   N ABT  beat analysts  estimates for quarterly profit and lifted its full year earnings forecast on Wednesday  boosted by a near 64  jump in sales of its blood sugar monitoring device 
Shares rose 4  to a record high of  86 59  adding to the about 15  gain since the start of the year 
Abbott is betting on the device  FreeStyle Libre  and is working on newer versions to cushion slowing growth in some of its older products 
The continuous glucose monitor  which helps diabetics track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers  is used by more than 1 5 million people worldwide 
FreeStyle Libre 2  the next generation device  which is already approved in Europe  is now under U S  regulatory review 
To expand its reach  Abbott plans to ramp up manufacturing capacity for FreeStyle Libre by three to five times in the next few years  Reuters reported on Tuesday 
When asked on the conference call what that increased capacity could mean  Chief Executive Miles White said he sees potential for Libre to bring in annual sales of  5 billion  in a reasonable time  
Libre s sales are expected to reach  1 5 billion this year  the company has said 
Abbott is also focusing on another growth driver  MitraClip  Sales of the device used for heart valve repair jumped 26 7  to  169 million in the quarter 
Momentum continues for Abbott s key growth drivers and  we don t believe it is slowing down any time soon   BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch wrote in a client note 
Sales of FreeStyle Libre rose 63 9  on a reported basis to  433 million in the second quarter 
Total sales at the diabetes unit jumped 28 2  and helped Abbott s medical devices division report a 6 4  rise in revenue to  3 08 billion

181196,402712,ABT,Top Picks 2019  AbbVie Inc  ABBV,news,"The population is aging at warp speed  A combination of longer lives and lower fertility rates have made the US and global populations older than ever before  forecasts Tom Hutchinson  a leading income expert and editor of Cabot Dividend Investor 
About a third of the US population is already over 50  and they won t be getting any younger  In fact  the fastest growing segment of the population is 65 and older as an average of 10 000 baby boomers turn 65 every single day  
What does this mean   It means you re likely to get stuck behind drivers who pull out onto the middle of the road and become stumped  But it also means that healthcare will be a booming growth industry  as older people simply require a lot more of it  That s a beautiful thing because the sector is already defensive and adding the growth quotient makes it irresistible 
There s a lot of ways to play healthcare  You can invest in everything from high flying biotechnology companies to the more stodgy big pharmaceutical companies   I like a company that combines both   the stability and high dividend yield of big pharma and the rapid growth of biotechnology 
AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  is a US based biopharmaceutical company specializing in cutting edge small molecule drugs   The company was spun off from pharmaceutical giant Abbott Labs  NYSE ABT  in 2013  but has already eclipsed its former parent company in size and is now the eighth largest drug company in the world 
Since the stock s IPO on December 21  2012 it has provided a phenomenal average annual return of 20    An initial  10 000 investment would now be worth over  31 000  with dividends reinvested  The dividend has more than doubled since 2014 and ABBV now yields a big fat 5  
The rapid growth has been achieved from its blockbuster biologic auto immune drug Humira  which is the world s number one drug by far with annual sales of over  20 billion  Humira accounts for over 50  of sales and faces increasing competition that will erode market share  However  AbbVie has a spectacular pipeline of new drugs that should more than offset the slippage 
According to market research firm EvaluatePharma  Abbvie has the second most valuable clinical pipeline across all of biopharma  It has 20 new products slated for launch by 2020 and 15 drugs and treatments that are already currently already in phase 3  the last step before the approval process  
Earnings over the next five years are expected to be even better than the last five  With a yield of 5 0   the stock has a spectacular track record and offers more growth and a higher dividend than any other big drug company

The diversified medical device maker  whose products include blood glucose monitoring kits  nutritional healthcare products  diagnostic products and equipment  has seen strong EPS growth that s put it in the top quartile of all publicly traded companies  growth over the past two quarters and past several years  
That growth has been recognized by the fast money in 2018  as ABT s 2018 gain of nearly 27  puts it in the top 6  of price performers over the past year  it also pays a 1 8  dividend yield for even more upside   
One personal note here  I am about to get some firsthand knowledge of one very interesting new Abbot product called DRG therapy  This surgically implanted electronic stimulation device is used for chronic pain management  in my case injuries from years of martial arts  bodybuilding and military training  
The device delivers pain relief to a reported 74 2  of patients who suffer from complex regional pain syndrome  or CRPS  Hopefully  I will be in that near three quarters of patients with those positive results 
For Wall Street  the upside in Abbott has allowed it to trade well above its 200 day moving average in 2018  And despite the volatility we witnessed in most stocks during Q4  the shares ended the year back above its short term  50 day moving average at a time when most stocks were tanking 
I suspect the stock is just getting started  and in 2019  I think this healthcare standout is a good way to ease the 2018 portfolio pain  Disclosure  At the time of this writing  Jim Woods was long ABT in his Fast Money Alert advisory service

181285,402801,ABT,7 Dividend ETFs That Offer Growth In 2020,opinion,In a low interest rate environment  dividend investing has been the hot spot and seems an excellent choice for 2020  Though the strategy doesn t offer dramatic price appreciation  it is a major source of consistent income for investors in any type of market Below we highlight some solid reasons to invest in this strategy Uneven Stock Market RallyThe stock market is currently hitting new record highs but 2020 is likely to be filled with volatility backed by Middle East tensions  trade uncertainty and U S  presidential election  The dividend focused products offer safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices  read    Additionally  the Fed vowed to keep interest rates steady in 2020 after three rates cut last year  This has raised the appeal for dividend strategies Dividend Payout to Top  500 BillionThe companies on the S P 500 are expected to return more money to shareholders through dividends than ever this year  Per Howard Silverblatt  senior index analyst at S P Dow Jones Indices  the dividend payout is expected to top  500 billion for the first time  At least 330 companies on the index are expected to raise their dividends based on their history and financial condition  Among the companies that recently announced plans to raise their dividends are Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE    Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   and AT T Inc   NYSE T   Notably  the first quarter is typically the busiest period for dividends as companies roll out their annual results and reward shareholders ahead of their annual meetings Solid Inflow in Q4Investors have been showing interest in dividend strategies  In the fourth quarter  they added more than  10 billion in new money to dividend focused ETFs  the highest period of inflows for 2019  according to Todd Rosenbluth  head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA  read    Invest in Dividend GrowthAlthough dividends have increased  the yields dropped to 1 80  at year end 2019 from 2 16  at the beginning as the S P 500 surged 29   according to FactSet  As such  honing in on dividend aristocrats could be the most beneficial way Dividend aristocrats are the blue chip dividend paying companies  which have a long history of raising dividend payments year over year  These tend to skew the portfolio to less volatile sectors and mature companies  Investors should note that the dividend aristocrat funds offer more dividend growth opportunities when compared to the other products in the space but might not necessarily have the highest yields  As a result  these products provide a nice combination of annual dividend growth and capital appreciation opportunity and are mainly suitable for risk adverse  long term investors How to Play Below we have presented a bunch of dividend aristocrats ETFs that have a Zacks ETF Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold

181286,402802,ABT,Abbott  ABT  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Abbott  ABT  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 3  
Revenues are expected to be  8 26 billion  up 6 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 93  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Abbott 
For Abbott  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 59  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Abbott will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Abbott would post earnings of  0 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Abbott doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abbott-abt-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200499058,200499058

slid 0 2  on an organic basis  Rapid Diagnostics sales improved 2 7  on an organic basis in the fourth quarter  driven by infectious disease testing in developed markets and cardio metabolic testing globally  partially offset by lower infectious disease testing sales in Africa 2020 GuidanceAbbott issued its 2020 guidance For the full year  adjusted earnings from continuing operations are expected in the band of  3 55  3 65  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 61 lies within this projected range  Organic sales growth is projected in the range of 7 8   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 worldwide sales is pegged at  33 97 billion The company also provided its first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share outlook  It expects to report adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the bracket of 69 71 cents  The consensus mark of 72 cents surpasses this predicted range Our TakeAbbott exited 2019 on a mixed note with earnings meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues exceeding the same Overall  we are optimistic about Abbott s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance organically  Particularly  Abbott has been riding high on a healthy growth graph within its Diabetes Care business  The company has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship  sensor based continuous glucose monitoring system  known as FreeStyle Libre System  Also  solid contributions from the company s other two businesses buoy investors  hopes  Moreover  the company s emerging market performance has been promising on the back of several strategic developments On the flip side  increasing currency headwinds and lower infectious disease testing sales in Africa significantly dented the company s international performance Zacks Rank   Key PicksCurrently  Abbott carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Some better ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics Corporation   NYSE HAE    Hill Rom Holdings  Inc    NYSE HRC   and Smith   Nephew  LON SN

181331,402847,ABT,Abbott  ABT  Meets Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Abbott  ABT  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 84 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 75 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs would post earnings of  0 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 82  delivering a surprise of 2 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Abbott  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  posted revenues of  8 08 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 23   This compares to year ago revenues of  7 66 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Abbott shares have added about 13 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for Abbott 
While Abbott has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Abbott was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

When Muddy Waters went public with the claims  it also disclosed it was shorting shares of St  Jude Medical  which was preparing to sell itself to Abbott  The short selling firm said it believed that disclosure of the vulnerabilities could cause the  25 billion deal to fall apart  but Abbot completed the deal in January ",2017-08-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/abbott-releases-new-round-of-cyber-updates-for-st-jude-pacemakers-523513,523513

Heading into today  shares of the maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs had lost 1 61  over the past month  lagging the Medical sector s gain of 1 15  and the S P 500 s gain of 4 96  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from ABT as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be October 16  2019  In that report  analysts expect ABT to post earnings of  0 84 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 12   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  8 10 billion  up 5 81  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  3 24 per share and revenue of  31 93 billion  These totals would mark changes of  12 5  and  4 43   respectively  from last year 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for ABT  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant  ABT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Looking at its valuation  ABT is holding a Forward P E ratio of 25 56  For comparison  its industry has an average Forward P E of 26 8  which means ABT is trading at a discount to the group 
Also  we should mention that ABT has a PEG ratio of 2 33  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Medical   Products industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2 6 as of yesterday s close 
The Medical   Products industry is part of the Medical sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 85  putting it in the top 34  of all 250  industries

181356,402872,ABT,Abbott  ABT  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Abbott  ABT  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 16  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 84 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12  
Revenues are expected to be  8 10 billion  up 5 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Abbott 
For Abbott  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Abbott will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Abbott would post earnings of  0 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 82  delivering a surprise of  2 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Abbott doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abbott-abt-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200471925,200471925

181435,402951,ABT,Abbott  ABT  Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates,opinion,"Abbott  ABT  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 82 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 80 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 73 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 50   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs would post earnings of  0 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 63  delivering a surprise of 3 28  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Abbott  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  posted revenues of  7 98 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 10   This compares to year ago revenues of  7 77 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Abbott shares have added about 15  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 8  
What s Next for Abbott 
While Abbott has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Abbott was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 85 on  8 09 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 22 on  31 93 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   Products is currently in the top 33  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abbott-abt-q2-earnings-surpass-estimates-200440923,200440923
181436,402952,ABT,Abbott  ABT  Upgraded To Strong Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Abbott  ABT  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Abbott is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Abbott imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Abbott
This maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs is expected to earn  3 22 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 11 8  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Abbott  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

181453,402969,ABT,Abbott  ABT  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Abbott  ABT  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Abbott is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Abbott imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Abbott
This maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs is expected to earn  3 22 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 11 8  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Abbott  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

181503,403019,ABT,Analysis   NY insider trading ruling tests prosecutors beyond Wall Street,news,"By Nate Raymond
NEW YORK  Reuters    A court ruling that sharply curtailed the ability of prosecutors including Manhattan U S  Attorney Preet Bharara to pursue insider trading cases is increasingly testing regulators  abilities across the country 
    Defendants in California and Massachusetts have sought to take advantage of a December ruling from the 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that narrowed the definition of insider trading  making it harder for prosecutors to pursue their cases 
    The challenges raise the possibility that the 2nd Circuit decision  legally binding only in New York  Connecticut and Vermont  could be adopted by other jurisdictions nationally or could create a split among the federal courts 
    The ruling reversed the convictions of Todd Newman  a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management  and Anthony Chiasson  co founder of Level Global Investors 
    A three judge panel held that prosecutors need to prove a trader knew the original source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information  It also narrowed what constitutes a benefit  saying it must be of  some consequence  and cannot be only friendship 
    Samuel Lieberman  a defense lawyer involved in a similar challenge  said judges across the country often look to the 2nd Circuit for guidance   
     The 2nd Circuit is the leading appeals court for insider trading   he said   So disregarding it comes with some peril  
    While the pace of prosecutions had looked set to slow from the pace of recent years  the appeals court s ruling could slam the brakes on authorities  efforts to pursue future cases  The decision s effect was quickly felt in New York  where Bharara s office on Friday filed papers asking the court to reconsider the ruling 
    Bharara s office has charged 92 people with insider trading since October 2009 and had won guilty pleas or trial convictions of 86 of them  including Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and former SAC Capital Advisors trader Mathew Martoma  before the 2nd Circuit ruling 
    Many of those cases are unlikely to be affected by the ruling  because the benefits were financial and known to the traders  But some defendants have already sought to vacate guilty pleas and reverse trial convictions in light of it 
    In the first decision to follow the 2nd Circuit ruling  a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday threw out the guilty pleas of four men accused of illegally dealing in shares ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition 
     A spokeswoman for Bharara declined comment  but in court papers Friday  his office argued the 2nd Circuit ruling  threatens the effective enforcement of the securities laws  
 
    RIPPLE EFFECTS
    The ruling is having ripple effects beyond New York  U S  Securities and Exchange Commission data shows that 52 of the 66 people charged with insider trading civilly or criminally in the 2014 fiscal year were pursued outside of New York 
    In Boston  for example  authorities charged a group of friends who they said exchanged non public information about American Superconductor Corp 
    One of the men  Eric McPhail  learned secret information about the company from one of its senior executives  who belonged to a country club where McPhail was a member 
    Despite being told the information in confidence  McPhail tipped off other golfing buddies  including attorney Douglas Parigian  who reaped  300 000 in illegal profits  authorities say 
    McPhail and Parigian were indicted in July  after earlier being sued by the SEC  which reached settlements with four of the friends for  145 309 
    Both men have moved to dismiss the SEC s case and plan to do the same in the criminal case in light of the 2nd Circuit ruling  said Allison Koury  Parigian s lawyer 
    In court papers  they argue no allegations exist that the executive received what would constitute a benefit under the 2nd Circuit s decision  and that authorities failed to allege Parigian knew about the benefit 
    The U S  Attorney s Office in Boston did not respond to requests for comment  But the SEC has argued since the information was misappropriated  it has to prove a benefit flowed to McPhail  who acted as the tipper 
    The SEC said McPhail had made it clear he  was looking forward to getting paid back   Prosecutors on Wednesday meanwhile filed a superseding indictment that added a line saying he received a benefit from Parigian and others 
    In Santa Ana  California  former Advanced Medical Optics Inc CEO James Mazzo and three co defendants charged with insider trading filed papers arguing prosecutors failed to establish there was a tangible quid pro quo for allegedly tipping ex Baltimore Orioles third baseman Douglas DeCinces about a deal 
    Prosecutors say Mazzo  a close friend of DeCinces  tipped him in advance of Abbott Laboratories   1 36 billion acquisition of the company  enabling him to make  1 3 million in illicit profits 
    DeCinces  in turn  told five other people about the deal  including his business partner David Parker and real estate lawyer Fred Jackson  who made  347 920 and  140 259 respectively trading ahead of the deal  prosecutors say 
    In court papers  prosecutors said the 2nd Circuit ruling is  inconsistent  with the law of the U S  Supreme Court and the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  which covers California and other Western states  They argue that insider trading includes making a  gift  of confidential information to a relative or friend 
    Before the 2nd Circuit ruling  U S  District Judge Andrew Guilford in Santa Ana previously denied a motion to dismiss by DeCinces that made similar arguments  Late on Friday  he denied the defendants  latest motions  saying with little explanation that he was upholding his earlier decision     Lawyers for the defendants either declined comment or did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday

 Reuters    Drugmaker  Abbott Laboratories   N ABT   knocking down a report in the Financial Times  denied on Thursday that it was preparing a bid for medical device maker  St Jude Medical  Inc  N STJ  
The FT  citing people familiar with the matter  reported that Abbott has been working with advisers for several weeks to line up financing for a  25 billion cash and stock bid for St  Paul  Minnesota based St Jude  St Jude s shares  which jumped 15 percent premarket trading following the report  were up 3 4 percent at  71 72 in early trading 
The company had a market value of about  19 5 billion as of Wednesday s close 
 I can tell you that we are not pursuing an offer for St Jude   Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel told Reuters 
St Jude did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
A source familiar with Abbott s thinking said he did not believe a deal was seriously contemplated  while Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said Abbott was more likely to do medium sized deals than a big transaction 
Abbott Chief Executive Miles White said last month that he was interested in acquisitions  including in the device sector  but would be cautious because a flurry of deals in the healthcare industry had pushed up valuations 
Abbott had cash on hand of almost  4 billion as of June 30 
RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said last month that a deal in the region of  5 billion for a device maker was more likely than something larger 
Kumar and  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities  Larry Biegelsen said on Thursday they expected Abbott to strike a deal in either the medical device or generic drug industries 
Abbott shares  which had fallen about 2 percent this year up to Wednesday s close  were up 1 8 percent at  44 75

181522,403038,ABT,Delphi to contest pressure to file U S  taxes despite UK tax base,news," Reuters    Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive Plc  N DLPH  said it would  vigorously contest  pressure by U S  tax authorities to file taxes in the United States as a domestic company  when its tax base is in the UK 
Delphi  which operates out of Detroit  is one among several American companies locked in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service over the use of offshore tax shelters 
Mylan Inc  O MYL  said on Thursday it would go ahead with the purchase of some non U S  businesses from Abbott Laboratories  N ABT  despite the political opposition to tax inversion deals 
The IRS told Delphi in June that it would be taxed as a U S  company due to the sale of its assets to Delphi Holdings LLP after it emerged from bankruptcy in 2009  Delphi said in a regulatory filing on July 31    
Delphi said it was reincorporated in the UK as a limited liability partnership  which allows it to save tax  The company said it had filed U S  federal partnership tax returns between 2009 and 2011 
 We will continue to prepare and file our financial statements on the basis that neither Delphi Automotive LLP nor Delphi Automotive Plc is a domestic corporation for U S  federal income tax purposes   the company said in the filing 
U S  President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats have proposed measures to stem the flow of so called  inversions  
The IRS contends that U S  based companies operating globally are manipulating tax laws 
Under the U S  tax code  domestic companies must pay tax on total global income  including income generated in other countries  The workaround for companies is to incorporate in those countries 
Earlier  companies chose Caribbean Islands or Switzerland to set up their tax bases  but Britain is becoming increasingly attractive to companies after the country changed its laws to keep profits reported in other countries out of its tax ambit 
Delphi has also been in the news in recent months because it supplied to General Motors Co  N GM  the defective ignition switches that were linked to at least 13 deaths 

Delphi s shares were up about 1 percent at  67 87 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday

181559,403075,ABT,Obama Government Seeks Legislation To Curb Corporate Tax Flight,news,"By    The Barack Obama administration on Tuesday called for immediate legislation to prevent U S  based companies from re incorporating overseas for lower taxes  the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday 
Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew wrote a letter to Senate Financing Committee Chairman Ron Wyden on Tuesday and called for a  new sense of economic patriotism   urging Congress to clamp down on the  abuse of our tax system   He also stated that U S  based companies should not be allowed to indulge in  inversion  transactions solely for the purpose of changing their tax status 
The White House had earlier proposed similar steps in the budget and called for broad reforms in corporate taxation  In his letter  Lew added that the  President had called for undertaking business tax reforms as a way of improving the investment climate in the U S   He also stated that there was a need to lower the corporate tax rate in the country to make the investment climate in the country more  business friendly  
Many companies seek to reduce their tax burden by relocating to countries with a lower tax rate  They do so by either buying another company in the target country and adopting its domicile  or by establishing a new company in the target country  This process  known as  inversion   has been popular among many pharmaceutical companies in the U S   which have overseas cash they don t want to subject to the 35 percent corporate tax rate prevalent in the U S   which is the highest in the world 
In his letter  Lew also demanded that a legislation to limit corporate tax inversions be implemented retroactively from May 
It isn t yet clear whether the Obama administration is targeting inversion deals that were signed before but not closed by May  or only deals agreed upon since then  Such a law would apply to U S drug maker AbbVie Inc s  NYSE ABBV  deal with Ireland based Shire Plc  NASDAQ SHPG  and Mylan Inc s  NASDAQ MYL  pending deal for Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT  overseas generics business 

Fearing unfavorable legislation  many companies have reportedly been adding clauses to merger agreements that would allow them to walk away without paying a penalty if the tax advantage is suddenly taken away  About 50 U S  firms have reincorporated overseas through inversions in the last 10 years  the Journal reported

181581,403097,ABT,UPDATE 2 Solvay sees higher 2011 profit as Q1 tops forecast,news,"  REBIT 197 million euros  vs forecast 148 million
   Sales 1 67 billion euros  vs forecast 1 57 billion
   Expects higher chemicals  plastics profits in 2011
 
  Adds detail 
 By Aaron Gray Block
 AMSTERDAM  May 9  Reuters    Belgian chemicals group Solvay
 reported a 79 percent jump in first quarter operating profit 
beating estimates thanks to improved demand and price hikes  and
forecast higher full year 2011 earnings 
  In the context of the globally favourable business climate
and based on its strategy of sustainable and profitable
growth  Solvay expects to improve its annual operating result 
both in chemicals and plastics activities in 2011   it said 
 Recurring earnings before interest and taxes from continuing
operations  REBIT  was 197 million euros   275 million  
compared with a forecast for 148 million in a Reuters poll in
which the highest estimate was 165 million 
 Solvay was wxpected to report full year REBIT of 794 million
euros  ING analyst Jan Hein de Vroe said both the consensus and
his 750 million euro forecast will need to be raised in light of
the first quarter figures 
 Global chemicals firms have reported solid first quarter
earnings reflecting strong demand  especially in Asia  and
because they have been able to raise prices for chemicals and
plastics to more than offset higher costs for raw materials 
such as crude oil  used in many chemicals products 
 Industry leader BASF beat estimates after demand from
carmakers picked up  while French specialty chemicals group
Rhodia  which Solvay is buying for 3 4 billion euros  raised its
2011 forecast 
 Solvay group sales from continuing operations were 1 67
billion euros  up 23 percent from a year ago restated 1 36
billion euros  and against a forecast 1 57 billion euros 
 Solvay said sustained demand had allowed it to raise its
selling prices across its business to offset increased costs of
energy and some raw materials  adding volumes rose 10 percent
and it had raised prices 12 percent 
  The main good news is in caustic soda  where sales improved
41 percent   ING s De Vroe said  Caustic soda is used to make
detergents as well as in the pulp and paper industry 
  They are also talking about improved sales volumes for
vinyls  which is not too bad  although some of this might have
been a bit of restocking ahead of price increases  
 Solvay s plastics unit reported REBIT of 116 million euros 
beating a forecast for 83 5 million  thanks to higher volumes
for both specialty plastics and polyvinyl chloride  PVC   which
is used in construction 
 The PVC market has been problematic for Solvay in recent
quarters due to sluggish construction markets  increased
competition and higher costs 
 In the chemicals unit  record operating profit of 101
million euros also beat estimates of 78 million 
 Solvay s agreed buy out of Rhodia will lift its exposure to
fast growing markets such as China and Brazil to 40 percent and
allow it to further tap into higher margin specialty chemicals 
 Solvay s shares have risen 18 percent since it announced the
deal  as it removed persistent worries over the type of
acquisition the company might make following the sale of its
drugs unit to Abbott Laboratories in February 2010

181586,403102,ABT,What Makes Abbott  ABT  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Abbott  ABT  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Abbott basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Abbott imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Abbott
This maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs is expected to earn  3 20 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2019  which represents a year over year change of 11 1  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Abbott  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Abbott to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-03-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-abbott-abt-a-new-buy-stock-200399192,200399192

Abbott Laboratories is one of 833 individual stocks in the Medical sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  2 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks  This system has a long record of success  and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months  ABT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABT s full year earnings has moved 0 28  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Based on the most recent data  ABT has returned 10 55  so far this year  In comparison  Medical companies have returned an average of 10 46   As we can see  Abbott Laboratories is performing better than its sector in the calendar year 
Looking more specifically  ABT belongs to the Medical   Products industry  which includes 77 individual stocks and currently sits at  74 in the Zacks Industry Rank  Stocks in this group have gained about 13 70  so far this year  so ABT is slightly underperforming its industry this group in terms of year to date returns

 JPMorgan  the first major U S  bank to report quarterly
earnings  said profit rose sharply as underwriting revenue at
its investment bank offset deeper losses on credit cards and

 The Dow came within 10 points of 10 000 and was last at
that level in October 2008 
 The CBOE Volatility Index  a measure of anticipated

 By Quentin Webb
 LONDON  July 15  Reuters    Private equity owned Nycomed and
a Japanese drugs company are in the early second round of an
auction for all of Solvay s pharmaceuticals business  a person
familiar with the matter said on Wednesday 
 Analysts reckon the Belgian chemicals and drug maker s
Solvay Pharmaceuticals unit could fetch 5 billion euros   7
billion  or more  although Solvay has said it is open to other
options such as a partnership or flotation 
 Abbott Laboratories  Solvay s partner for its
cholesterol fighting blockbuster TriCor  is not seeking to buy
the whole unit  but the U S  drugmaker is interested in
acquiring TriCor and possibly other parts of Solvay s drugs
business  the person added 
 Solvay hopes to conclude a deal by the end of the European
summer  the person said  but has yet to set a deadline for
binding  second round bids  The person declined to identify the
Japanese suitor 
 Shares in Solvay rose 6 percent by 1107 GMT to 61 92 euros a
share 
 The Financial Times earlier reported Solvay had whittled
down its list of bidders to two    Nycomed  and Abbott  which
was bidding only for TriCor 
 Bidders have begun due diligence and have held initial
meetings with management  and will continue to investigate the
business  including making site visits  the first source and a
second person  also familiar with the matter  said 
 For Nycomed  whose biggest owner is Nordic Capital  Solvay
could offer big possible cost savings through European
synergies  A Japanese bidder would gain a European platform 
 Nycomed declined to comment  Abbott was not immediately
available to comment  Solvay reiterated it was conducting a
strategic review of the business but declined to comment
further 
 In Japan  spokesmen for Astellas Pharma Inc and Eisai Co Ltd
 declined to comment  A Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd spokesman
referred to a May 29 statement that the company would not bid
for the Solvay unit

181660,403176,ABT,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Abbott  ABT ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Abbott  ABT   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Abbott currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if ABT is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ABT  shares are up 1 7  over the past week while the Zacks Medical   Products industry is up 0 91  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 15  compares favorably with the industry s 4 66  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Abbott have risen 3 68   and are up 30 32  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  3 05  and 6 96   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ABT s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ABT is currently averaging 6 200 330 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ABT 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ABT s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 19 to  3 20 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ABT is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Abbott on your short list ",2019-02-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-abbott-abt-200386300,200386300

181670,403186,ABT,Abbott  ABT  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Abbott  ABT   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Abbott is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Abbott imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Abbott
This maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs is expected to earn  3 20 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2019  which represents a year over year change of 11 1  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Abbott  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Abbott to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abbott-abt-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200379983,200379983

181679,403195,ABT,What Lies Ahead For Abbott  ABT  Stock This Earnings Season ,opinion,Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   is slated to report fourth quarter 2018 results  before the market opens on Jan 23  In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 35   Moreover  Abbott delivered positive surprises in the trailing four reported quarters  the average being 1 82  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters  Abbott has been riding high on a healthy growth curve within its Diabetes Care business  The company has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship  sensor based continuous glucose monitoring  CGM  system   FreeStyle Libre System In the United States  the company received an FDA approval for a 14 day sensor with a shorter one hour warm up  making Libre the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available  Meanwhile in Europe  the company obtained a CE Mark for FreeStyle Libre 2 system  Both developments should contribute strongly to the company s top line in the yet to be reported quarter Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise   Per a recent data  the strength of Libre users has now crossed 1 million across the globe  representing an unprecedented level of patient adoption in the industry  This in turn  has firmly boosted the company s top line numbers in recent times  above 30  growth for the last four consecutive reported quarters         The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  544 million for Diabetes Care revenues indicates a surge of 31 7  from the year ago period s level In sync with the prior reported quarter  Abbott is anticipated to gain from a strong performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division  EPD  business  which has been recording operational sales growth over the last few quarters  According to Abbott  its EPD business is growing at a faster pace than the market rate across several of its priority countries including India and China  Management expects mid single digit sales growth during the fourth quarter 2018  reflecting a difficult comparison in non core other business segment in relation to the year ago quarterly figure when sales strongly soared to double digits growth Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 billion for EPD revenues shows a 1 7  slip from the year earlier period s number We are upbeat about the consistently sturdy Diagnostics business  courtesy of solid contributions from all sub segments  namely Core Laboratories Diagnostics  Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care  We are impressed by the accelerated pace of the company s Alinity launch in Europe  driven by strong competitive win rates and even more robust retention rates  This business is growing more rapidly than its market rate  Per Abbott  it is well positioned for sustainable growth in years to come based on the company s rollout of the full suite of Alinity systems across additional geographies including the United States Moreover  management estimates Rapid Diagnostics to contribute more than  2 billion in 2018  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Core Laboratory Diagnostic revenues of  1 14 billion depicts a 3 6  improvement from the registered figure in the comparable quarter last year We also encouragingly note that Nutrition is Abbott s most speedily growing business owing to aging population  increasing rate of chronic diseases and the rise of the middle class in the emerging markets  Furthermore  Abbott s pediatric nutrition business continues to thrive in the United States  For the fourth quarter  the company currently projects low to mid single digit sales growth What the Model SuggestsOur proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter Abbott has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  and an Earnings ESP of  0 25   This combination implies that the company is likely to beat on earnings this

181706,403222,ABT,Don t Be A Victim Of The Stock Market ,opinion,"Introduction
The primary objective of this article is to help the reader put this recent bad market in perspective and simultaneously provide lessons in valuation and how to think about stock prices  There have been many sage pieces of wisdom that have been provided to investors by investing greats  For example  in 1995 Peter Lynch wrote this in Worth Magazine 

 what makes stocks valuable in the long run isn t the market  It s the profitability of the shares in the companies you own  Corporations become more valuable and sooner or later  their shares will sell for a higher price  

Nevertheless  my own personal anecdotal experience indicates to me that people react to stock price movement and rarely  if ever  compare that movement to the profitability of the companies they own  I consider this a mistake  but also at the same time recognize that it is only human nature 
Consequently  the emotional response to the stock market is extremely strong  When markets are rising people are likely to get more confident and unfortunately even complacent  In contrast  when markets are falling people are likely to become fearful with doom and gloom scenarios replacing  sugar plums dancing in their heads  even during the holiday season  However  it is my contention that it is rarely as simple as prices are rising or prices are falling  Most importantly  I make it a practice to never react to price action  Instead  my approach is always to analyze and evaluate whether price volatility is justified   or not  In other words  my approach is intellectual rather than emotional 
As a registered investment advisor with more than 45 years  experience  I have often lamented that I live in money manager hell  When my clients are giddy with enthusiasm about the market  I tend to be morose and gloomy  In contrast  when my clients are miserable and frightened  I tend to be ecstatically optimistic  My experience has taught me that bull markets eventually bring risk  while bear markets bring opportunity  Therefore  instead of being caught up in the moment  I tend to be focused on what the future is likely to bring  Bad markets bring long term profits  good markets bring risk and overvaluation  Consequently  I love bad markets and hate good ones  However  my approach and attitude are predicated on understanding  within reason  what the true value of each of the companies I own truly is  Therefore  I can recognize both rational and irrational market behavior as it occurs  In my opinion  nothing is more calming during turbulent times 
I Just Don t Understand Why Investors Get So Upset by A Market Behaving Badly
Because of my perspective  I often find it difficult to understand why long term oriented prudent investors get so concerned when the market is down like it has been this December  From my perspective as a long term investor in great dividend paying stocks  short term price volatility seems totally irrelevant  Why  The answer is simple  if I do not intend to sell my dividend growth stocks today  or for that matter for many years to come  why should I worry about what the prices of the stocks are today  Nevertheless  a falling stock market  like we are seeing this December  causes a significant amount of investor angst 
Furthermore  this worry seems especially irrelevant to me when the dividend growth stocks I own continue growing their earnings and raising their dividends  People tend to be overly concerned about the performance of their portfolios based solely on price action even when their businesses are performing fantastically  Somehow  they only consider the price movement as indicative of how their portfolios are performing 
In my experience  most investors seem incapable of even considering the operating performance of the businesses they are long term investors in  In other words  their businesses can be doing great and their dividend income increasing  but if the prices are down  the investors are upset  To me this is backwards  because I only care about how my businesses are performing because I am confident that in the long run this is the only thing that will produce the rewards that I am seeking through investing in great dividend paying businesses 
To summarize  measuring the performance of my portfolio or any of my individual holdings based solely on what the price has recently done or is doing is just wrong in my opinion  Nevertheless  this is precisely what most investors do  I can t tell you how many times I ve had an angry or concerned client call me complaining about how poor a certain stock is performing when  from my perspective  it is performing fabulously  The client is measuring price action  whereas I am measuring earnings  dividend and revenue growth  To me  the only performance that truly matters is how the business is doing 
AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   a Case in Point 
The biotechnology giant and spin off from Abbott Labs  NYSE ABT  represents an excellent case in point  For all of 2018  the stock price is down almost 14   From its peak in the spring of 2018  AbbVie s  ABBV  stock price is down more than 30   Consequently  most investors would call AbbVie a performance dog for calendar year 2018  However  from my perspective as a shareholder  I consider it one of the best performing stocks that I own for 2018  The company s earnings are forecast to increase approximately 40  by the consensus of leading analysts following the stock  and thus far they have beat estimates of both earnings and revenues for each of the last three completed quarters 
Additionally  AbbVie announced that they increased their dividend by 35 2  on February 15  2018  Consequently  their 2018 quarterly dividends of  0 96 a share are on track to produce a  3 84 dividend for fiscal 2018 which is approximately 46  higher than the  2 63 dividend they paid in 2017  To me  this is simply spectacular performance   and I couldn t be happier with my holding  The fact that the price is down for the year is just typical market foolishness to me  In other words  I am ecstatic with my AbbVie holding and its true performance for fiscal year 2018  Nevertheless  it never ceases to amaze me how blinded people are regarding their true portfolio performance when short term prices are weak 

Not all Price Drops Are the Same
Another important aspect regarding short run stock price volatility is the reality that not all price drops are the same  Investors need to understand and consider that some price drops are justified while others are not  Sometimes the company s stock price falls simply because the market was pricing the fundamental value of the company too high  This is one example of a justified price drop  In another case  a company s stock price might fall because the company s fundamentals have deteriorated  This would be another example of a justified price drop 
In contrast  a company s stock price can be fairly valued or even attractively valued and drop nevertheless because of a major market selloff  This would represent an example of an unjustified price drop that is  in reality  an opportunity rather than a crisis  In other words  a great company that has gone on sale  These are important distinctions that most investors seem either incapable of or unwilling to make or consider  The price drops  the investor panics   and that is typically the end of the story 
CVS Health Corporation  NYSE CVS   a Case in Point 
In the summer of 2015  CVS Health Corporation s  CVS  stock price was significantly overvalued as seen on the following earnings and price correlated graph  Earnings growth was very strong for 2012  2013  2014 and 2015  Nevertheless  the headwinds of overvaluation soon took its toll and by October 2016  CVS s stock price fell approximately 25   However  based on previous overvaluation  I believe the correction was clearly justified 
Then along came 2017  which delivered very anemic growth relative to recent history  Consequently  with investor sentiment already negative for the past year and ca half or so  CVS s stock price has continued to slide another 18  on top of the original 25  drop  With earnings growth reemerging in 2018 stock price has recovered somewhat  Nevertheless  I would consider this company significantly undervalued based on current and expected future operating results 

It s a Market of Stocks Not a Stock Market
Recently I ve been hearing a lot of  wow the market is tanking   what do you think it s going to do   My answer is always the same  I think it will continue to fluctuate as it always has  However  I think the most important message that I want to convey is that it is a market of stocks and not a stock market  Just as all price drops are the same  not all stocks in the market are the same  They all have different operating histories and potentials  different valuations  and different reasons for whatever their prices are doing  Of course  it is certainly true that a rising tide lifts all boats and a falling tide sinks all boats   at least in the short run 
The following earnings and price correlated graph with valuation references on the S P 500 clearly illustrates that this market index has been significantly overvalued since 2014  Consequently  the recent correction has not been a surprise to me  because I have been expecting it for some time  Moreover  I think the S P 500 is now reasonably priced after this correction  However  that is not to say that it won t overshoot in to undervaluation territory if sentiment remains negative

The following video summarizes and elaborates on the important messages I am offering with this article 


Conclusions
If you are a long term investor  then my advice is to never let the stock market or short term price volatility impact your investment decisions  However  I understand the difficulty of watching your portfolio value get smaller even if it s only temporary  In my experience  for most people their financial situation comes only second to the health and welfare of their families  In other words  a person s financial security is extremely important  Consequently  it s easy to be a victim of volatile markets 
Therefore  it is also my experience that more people have had their financial situation severely impacted by reacting emotionally to markets  In other words  in too many cases I have seen people sell when they should buy and buy when they should sell  The powerful emotional responses of fear and greed are powerful adversaries to our financial health  However  when we can understand and embrace the reality that   as it relates to investing in stocks   operating performance is significantly more important than price action  only then can we protect ourselves from volatile markets  Healthy earnings  cash flows  revenues and dividend growth will eventually lead to healthy returns  Don t be a stock market victim

181707,403223,ABT,Why Abbott  ABT  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Abbott  ABT   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry 
This maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 08  
For the last reported quarter  Abbott came out with earnings of  0 75 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 74 per share  representing a surprise of 1 35   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 71 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 73 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 82  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Abbott  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Abbott has an Earnings ESP of  0 25  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 23  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-abbott-abt-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200370725,200370725

Investors will be hoping for strength from ABT as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be January 23  2019  The company is expected to report EPS of  0 81  up 9 46  from the prior year quarter  Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  7 79 billion  up 2 64  from the year ago period 
For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  2 88 per share and revenue of  30 61 billion  which would represent changes of  15 2  and  11 74   respectively  from the prior year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for ABT  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 03  higher within the past month  ABT is holding a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now 
In terms of valuation  ABT is currently trading at a Forward P E ratio of 23 58  For comparison  its industry has an average Forward P E of 24 92  which means ABT is trading at a discount to the group 
We can also see that ABT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 02  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  The Medical   Products industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2 29 as of yesterday s close 
The Medical   Products industry is part of the Medical sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 106  which puts it in the top 42  of all 250  industries

181730,403246,ABT,Abbott  ABT  Q3 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"Abbott  ABT  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 75 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 74 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 74 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 35   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of infant formula  medical devices and drugs would post earnings of  0 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 75  delivering a surprise of 1 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Abbott  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  posted revenues of  7 66 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 12   This compares to year ago revenues of  7 59 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Abbott shares have added about 22 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 5  
What s Next for Abbott 
While Abbott has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Abbott was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 66 on  7 66 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 19 on  32 05 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

181855,403371,ABT,Opening Bell  Gold  Bitcoin Struggle  Oil Remains Above  60,opinion,"Key Events
Yesterday  in what some may see as an auspicious sign for markets  on the first official trading day of 2018 all four major US indices rallied to start the new year  Three the S P 500  NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 even posted fresh records 
On Friday  the final trading day of 2017  stocks were sold off and gains made during at least 8 previous sessions were erased  Yesterday  however  investors replenished lost value  then continued to break new ground  suggesting Friday s selloff was not the first move in a trend reversal  but rather  nothing more sinister than profit taking after a spectacular year  the best since 2013 
While the strong opening session of 2018 trade may suggest that this year will bring more of the same  market internals tell a different story  Since September  fewer and fewer stocks have been participating in the headline grabbing rallies  forming a series of negative divergences  a possible prelude to a full market correction 

The S P 500 gained 0 83 percent  making both an all time high and a record close  The Dow climbed 0 43 percent  the  laggard  among the US indices and the only one to not post a new record  The NASDAQ outperformed major averages  jumping 1 51 percent  posting both a record high and close  finishing above 7 000 for the first time  while the NASDAQ 100 climbed 1 8 percent  the biggest gain for the index since October 27  Finally  the Russell 2000 advanced 1 07 percent  hitting dual records  both high and close 
On a more granular level  the Energy sector led the rally  up 1 63 percent  followed closely by Consumer Discretionary shares  which were boosted 1 49 percent  Materials   1 42 percent and Technology  which gained 1 24 percent  The weak dollar helped lift energy and material shares  which are priced in USD  The currency s weakness also affected multinational technology companies  whose products become cheaper on a softer greenback 
Among defensive stocks  Utilities led the decline  falling 0 93 percent  Healthcare was the only defensive sector that advanced  by a whopping 1 12 percent  Some individual healthcare stocks fared even better  Abbott  NYSE ABT  shares advanced 3 percent after JP Morgan upgraded them to overweight and raised their target price 
The only growth sector that lagged was Financials  which eked out a 0 04 advance  This essentially extends Friday s 0 71 decline of the sector  which led the pre weekend selloff 
As we mentioned here  albeit in a different context related to trading gold  investors seem to be betting against continued US growth and therefore rising rates  even as Fed policy makers have forecast another three hikes during the coming year 
Global Financial Affairs
Of interest given the recent slide in US financial sector shares  while financials traded on most Asian and European markets advanced this morning amid overall European market declines  Canada s financial sector shares fell 0 13 percent suggesting they may be more aligned with the US 
Energy shares were buoyed by the price of oil  which closed for the second time in three days above  60  trading near its two year high and enjoying the strongest new year opening for the commodity since 2014 

As of this writing  oil has been maintaining yesterday s gains  as it continues to sit above  60 for a third day  This can be credited to five fundamental causes 

Saudi Arabia s seriousness about production cuts and the need to maintain price stability ahead of Saudi Aramco s IPO 
The sagging dollar which makes the cost of oil cheaper 
Unchanged rig counts which remained at 747 for a second week  after US drillers paused production 
Unlike in Libya  where social unrest has affected the country s export capacity  the current  ongoing political protests in Iran OPEC s third largest producer have not had an effect on the country s exports  nor are they likely to impact production  As a rule  political unrest in oil producing countries effects sentiment  However  some speculate that should the protests escalate and become more violent  additional oil market risk could ensue  Worth paying attention to though  is the continued tension with Saudi Arabia which could escalate  thereby increasing the potential for actual supply interruption  However  with each country s economy and ruling regime completely dependent on oil exports  the conflict is unlikely to escalate beyond the current posturing 
US stockpiles extended drawdowns for a seventh week and nationwide crude supplies are forecast to decline by 5 million barrels 

This morning  investors in Asia followed their US counterparts  spurring major indices including the Shanghai Composite and KOSPI higher  Hong Kong s Hang Seng closed higher by 0 2  after earlier having hit a new intraday high 
As with US stocks  which were buoyed by a weak dollar  softer regional currencies led by South Korea s won pushed local stocks higher  Japanese markets remain closed for holidays 

European investors followed Asian bullishness as the region s MiFID II investment regulations finally take effect  Investors in Europe are expected to trade more cautiously today  as the biggest shake up to European regulation in a decade begins  The MiFID II regulations are one of the most seismic regulatory shifts in history  effecting everything from investment research to trade execution 
The Stoxx Europe 600 climbed this morning  led by retailers and healthcare stocks 

The euro fell for the first time in six days  Both European bonds and US Treasuries steadied 

Similarly  gold retreated from a near four month high  in line with a return move following an upside breakout  The recent rally in the precious metal offers some gold rush trading opportunities 

Bitcoin is moving higher right now  after the cryptocurrency fell from  15 428  pushed back below the  15 000 key level  A close within the current price level would form a bearish shooting star 
Up Ahead

US Construction Spending and ISM Manufacturing data are due later today 
FOMC December Meeting Minutes are also expected

181868,403384,ABT,3 Income Stocks That Are Saving Lives ,opinion,"I m a long term investor  Like Warren Buffett  I d love to hold a stock forever  Even if that s not likely  I do expect to keep a stock in my portfolio for five years minimum   preferably 10 
So not only do I look for great businesses  but I want to be invested in sectors with strong long term fundamentals 
I can t think of a stronger sector than healthcare 
Sure  technology is vital to our economy and is a source of growth  I like technology 
But can you think of a sector whose products will be more in demand over the coming decades than healthcare 
You may have heard this statistic  In the United States  roughly 10 000 people turn 65 every day 
One thing we know is that the older we get  the more healthcare we consume  Whether it s from doctor visits  prescriptions or artificial joints  older people and their insurance companies spend a lot on healthcare 
In fact  the average retired couple will spend more than a quarter of a million dollars out of pocket on healthcare  And Medicare and other insurance providers will spend a lot more 
It s not an understatement when we say your health is the most important thing 
So it makes sense to find the best healthcare companies to invest in for the long term  And since I m the dividend guy  I want these top companies to pay dividends as well 
Let s take a look at a few different areas within healthcare for some ideas on where to make money over the long term 

Biotech Pharma
Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  was founded eight years before the invention of the radio and is one of the leading biopharmaceutical companies in the world 
It has 30 products on the market  including blood thinners Coumadin and Eliquis  cancer fighters Opdivo and Yervoy  and hepatitis B therapy Atripla  Additionally  it has 35 compounds being studied in clinical trials 
Bristol Myers Squibb recently scored big wins with new drugs  including Opdivo and Yervoy  that should keep revenue growing for years  That will not only reward shareholders but fund future research 
The stock yields 2 5  


Medical Devices
Though it still has pharmaceuticals in its product portfolio  Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  is focusing more on medical devices  diagnostics and consumer products 
Its consumer products division makes Ensure  a nutritional drink for adults that is often used to supplement the diet of a person who is ill 
Its vascular unit has a variety of drug eluting stents  guide wires and other products 
And Abbott s diagnostic tools are used in oncology  genetic testing and infectious diseases 
The company has been around for 125 years  The stock yields 1 9  

Services
Omega Healthcare Investors Inc  NYSE OHI  is one of my favorite companies in healthcare 
It owns real estate that is leased by nursing homes and assisted living facilities  It s important to understand that Omega Healthcare doesn t operate the nursing homes  it is the nursing homes  landlord 
It is expected that roughly one third of all baby boomers will spend time in a nursing home or assisted living facility at some point in their lives 
Demand for beds in these places will be huge  Omega is poised to profit on this enormous trend 
The stock has a fat 9 3  yield and has raised its dividend for 15 years in a row 
Healthcare stocks should definitely have a place in your long term portfolio  The  silver tsunami  is one of the most significant trends that will affect the markets and the economy over the next several decades 
These stocks and others will thrive as seniors spend more on feeling good and feeling better 
And you ll feel great generating profits and dividends from these and other healthcare stocks ",2017-11-19,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/three-income-stocks-that-are-saving-lives-200266481,200266481

182001,403517,ABT,Abbott To Gain From Alere s Takeover Due For Oct 3 Closure,opinion,"Investors keen on the consolidation of Abbott Labs   NYSE ABT   with Alere may expect that much awaited good news to arrive soon  Per Abbott s latest update  with all the necessary regulatory clearances getting fulfilled for the closure  the company finally plans to complete the hugely contentious acquisition of Alere  Inc   on Oct 3  2017 
Notably  after a year s rollercoaster ride to overcome the regulatory hurdles  both Abbott and Alere had progressed with the merger process based on certain amended terms of the original agreement 
Per the amended agreement clauses  announced earlier in April   Abbott has agreed to pay  51 per common share to acquire Alere  a reduction from the earlier deal of  56 per common share in cash upon the transaction s conclusion  This results in an expected  new equity value of approximately  5 3 billion  lower than the originally estimated equity value of almost  5 8 billion 
Our Take
Abbott has stated that with the successful wrap up of this transaction  its total diagnostics sales should be  7 billion  The company also anticipates to emerge a lead player in the  7 billion point of care diagnostic space within the broader  50 billion in vitro diagnostics market with this takeover  The combined entity is expected to generate approximately  2 5 billion in point of care testing sales worldwide 
The buyout would also enable the company to gain an access to new channels and geographies  including entries into fast growing outlets  such as doctors  offices  clinics  pharmacies and at home testing  More to that  Alere s complementary portfolio of diagnostic products  comprising tests for infections such as HIV  tuberculosis  malaria and dengue will be added to Abbott s portfolio  Significantly  Alere develops simple  rapid tests  including Alere i   the molecular test for flu and strep   to deliver reports in less than 15 minutes 
Hence  the shared business will offer several options of tests in a broad array  for instance  infectious disease  molecular  cardiometabolic and toxicology testings  Also  this union would definitely expand Abbott Labs  platforms to include benchtop and rapid strep tests  Although Alere would hitherto generate over half its total sales from the United States alone  the company has a growing presence in key international markets with potential to strengthen Abbott s footprint ahead in these territories 
Price Performance

	Chicago  IL   June 21  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   NYSE         NantKwest  NASDAQ         Delek US Holdings  NYSE         Abbot Labs  NYSE        and Winnebago  NYSE        

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin Matras  

How to Uncover Institutional Buying

	One of the best ways to find stocks on the move that are grabbing the attention of investors is to screen for stocks with increasing volume 

	This is because increased volume shows investor interest  As more investors buy the stock  the stock s price should go higher 

	But the individual investor  while important to the market  doesn t really have the firepower to affect volume the way that big institutional investors do 

	And very few things can move a stock more than institutional buying 

	Why is that 

	For one  institutions have the ability of buying tens of millions of dollars worth of a stock and even hundreds of millions of dollars  And because their purchases are often so large  it typically takes weeks  if not months  for an institutional investor to build a position 

	Given this commitment  considering it will also take several weeks or months to get out  you can be sure that these institutional investors have done plenty of homework to feel good about the fundamental prospects of the company 

	This does not mean you can ignore your own analysis or the stock market as a whole  But screening for stocks with rising volume  along with prices of course  can put some fantastic stocks on your radar screen 

What Kind of Volume Increase to Look For

	I prefer to search for at least two weeks of increasing volume along with rising prices  And in my testing I have found that 3 weeks performs even better 

	One week volume spikes  however  will not get thru  as oftentimes those can be driven by one day events  Instead  it s the successive volume increase that shows true buying demand  giving this set up its value 

	The volume increase also doesn t have to be huge  We re not talking about a several hundred percent increase  In fact  often those massive increases prove to be turning points 

	What we re looking for are noticeable increases  like 10   20  or 50  increases  etc  But nothing outrageous  like a 10 fold increase  Remember  the last thing an institutional investor wants to do is call too much attention while he or she is in the midst of building a position  But if you know what to look for  you can see all of this happening in plain sight  And get in for the ride as they flesh out the rest of their position 

Screen Parameters

  Current Price greater than Price from 1 Week Ago
	  Price from 1 Week Ago greater than Price from 2 Weeks Ago
	  Price from 2 Week Ago greater than Price from 3 Weeks Ago 

  Weekly Volume greater than Weekly Volume from 1 Week Ago
	  Weekly Volume from 1 Wk Ago greater than Weekly Volume from 2 Wks Ago
	  Weekly Volume from 2 Wks Ago greater than Weekly Volume from 3 Wks Ago 

  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 3
	  Price greater than or equal to  5
	  Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares 

	The most important elements to this screen are the price and volume items  especially the volume   The Zacks Rank also helps to make sure that their earnings estimates are on the rise  The price item  however  is a personal preference as I generally don t buy stocks under  5  But it should also be noted that many institutions won t either  But if you re looking for lower priced stocks  you can of course remove this item  And lastly  the average volume item ensures there s enough trade activity on a daily basis to get in and out of the market easily 

Stocks

	Here are 5 stocks that passed this week s screen 

	 NYSE       Johnson   Johnson
	 NASDAQ       NantKwest
	 NYSE       Delek US Holdings
	 NYSE       Abbot Labs
	 NYSE       Winnebago

	All of these stocks look good fundamentally  But their successive increases in weekly volume suggest institutional buying  and warrant an even closer look 

	Get the rest of the stocks on this list and start screening for weekly volume increases to uncover institutional buying on your own  It s easy to do

182150,403666,ABT,Abbott Laboratories Agrees To Acquire Alere At Lower Price ,opinion,Finally the much contentious merger of Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   with Alere is nearing its close  As expected  the financial terms of the deal have been amended Amended TermsPer the amended terms of the agreement  Abbott has agreed to pay  51 per common share to acquire Alere  a reduction from earlier deal of  56 per common share in cash upon the completion of the transaction  This results in a new expected equity value of approximately  5 3 billion  reduced from the originally expected equity value of approximately  5 8 billion The transaction  which was inked on 1 Feb 2016  is now expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2017  subject to the approval of Alere shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including applicable regulatory approvals  Notably  the company also extended the last date of receiving necessary regulatory approvals from Apr 30  2017 to Sep 30  2017 Also  both the companies  which were engaged in legal battles with each other on issues regarding the pending merger  agreed to dismiss their respective lawsuits The Legal BattleNotably  the legal battle came into spotlight last August when for Alere filed a complaint against Abbott Labs in the Delaware Chancery Court  It wanted to force Abbott Labs to take all the necessary actions to obtain anti trust approvals and fulfill its obligations under the terms of the merger agreement Alere s accusation was based on Abbott Labs  reluctance to complete the deal  In fact  Abbott Labs even requested to call it off in Apr 2016 Abbott s version was that  it had serious concerns regarding the accuracy of various representations  warranties and covenants made by Alere in their merger agreement  It also agreed to pay the legal costs in the range of  30  50 million in respect to Alere s transaction expenses  which was rejected by the latter Against Alere s lawsuit  in December  Abbott filed a lawsuit to terminate its  5 8 billion purchase of the former quoting a substantial loss in the value of Alere s stock since they struck the deal With the legal actions finally dropped now  according to a Bloomberge article   The renegotiated price was better than many on Wall Street expected  Share Price PerformanceIn this regard we note that  Abbott s shares underperformed the Zacks classified  industry over the past month on litigation qualms with Alere  The stock lost 5 14  during this period compared with 1 65  loss of the broader industry  The resolution of the matter is likely to boost the company s stock price in the future Our TakeEarlier  Abbott Labs said that it expects its total diagnostics sales to exceed  7 billion post the closure of the transaction  The company will also become a lead player in the  5 5 billion point of care diagnostic segment We are upbeat about the fact that Alere integration will enable Abbott Labs to gain access to new channels and geographies  Although Alere generated more than half of its total sales of  2 5 billion from the U S  alone  the company has a growing presence in key international markets  which should further strengthen Abbott Labs  business in these territories  It will also add Alere s complementary portfolio of diagnostic products  which comprises tests for infections such as HIV  tuberculosis  malaria and dengue   Zacks Rank   Key PicksAbbott Labs currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Better ranked stocks in the broader Medical space include Inogen  Inc    NASDAQ INGN    Orasure Technologies  Inc    NASDAQ OSUR   and Hill Rom Holdings  Inc    NYSE HRC    While Inogen sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Orasure and Hill Rom carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Inogen gained 62 2  in the last one year compared with the S P 500 s gain of 15 1   The company reported a stellar four quarter positive average earnings surprise of over 49 08  Orasure surged 73 9  in the last one year compared with the S P 500 s gain  Its four quarter average earnings surprise was a positive 123 5  Hill Rom gained over 33 9  in the past one year  better than the S P 500 mark  It posted a trailing four quarter positive average earnings surprise of 12 03  Sell These Stocks  Now  Just released  today s 220 Zacks Rank  5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention  If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List  they should be removed immediately  These are sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments  However  from 1988 through 2016  stocks from our Strong Sell list have actually performed 6X worse than the S P 500 ,2017-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abbott-laboratories-agrees-to-acquire-alere-at-lower-price-200183121,200183121

182176,403692,ABT,Mylan  MYL  Stock Falls On Restructuring Plans  Layoffs,opinion,In an 8 K filing  generic drug maker Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   revealed restructuring programs in certain locations in an attempt to streamline its operations globally as it focuses on the integration of acquired businesses  The company expects to cut less than 10  of its global workforce  marking the first step in a series of actions The company is currently straightening out the details of the cost saving and restructuring initiatives  and will divulge more information once these plans are finalized  We note that Mylan s global workforce comprised nearly 35 000 employees as of Dec 31  2015  This implies that the layoff could affect up to 3 500 people Note that Mylan has been on an acquisition spree since 2015  In Feb 2015  it acquired Abbott Laboratories    NYSE ABT   non U S  developed markets  specialty and branded generics business  This June  it took over the non sterile  topicals focused business of privately held Renaissance Acquisition Holdings  followed by the Aug 2016 buyout of Swedish drug manufacturer Meda Pricing   Related Issues PersistMylan s shares lost 3 8  on the restructuring announcement  The company has in fact lost a substantial 26 2  since Aug 2016  ever since it started facing criticism for the massive price hike of its lifesaving allergy treatment  EpiPen  The pricing controversy even led to a congressional hearing and drew immense flak from former U S  presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Since then  Mylan has been struggling to turn the tide through initiatives like changes in the EpiPen access programs  which included raising the savings card program from  100 to  300  doubling the eligibility of the patient assistance program  and working on the upcoming launch of a generic version of EpiPen However  all of these steps have more or less failed to mitigate the situation effectively In fact  right after the pricing issue  Mylan made it to the headlines for wrongly classifying EpiPen as a generic product in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  The misclassification implied that Mylan has been vastly underpaying rebates to Medicaid for the drug for a long time than it would have if the drug was classified as a branded one As a result  in Oct 2016  Mylan agreed to pay  465 million to the U S  Department of Justice  DoJ  and other government agencies in an effort to settle the disputes regarding the misclassification of EpiPen  In the third quarter of 2016  the company even booked a  465 million charge related to the settlement  which led to weaker than expected quarterly results In addition  even though the company stated on its third quarter 2016 earnings call that it was working on finalizing the deal  the DoJ is yet to confirm if it has reached a settlement with the company Mylan s shares will be under pressure in the foreseeable future with lawmakers continuing to question the company s pricing policy and concerns related to the ongoing investigations Despite these challenges  shares of the company have outperformed the Zacks categorized Medical Generic Drugs industry  albeit marginally  The industry has witnessed a decline of 26 5  since August The industry has been under pressure as the DoJ could investigate quite a few generic drug manufacturing companies like Mylan and Endo International plc   NASDAQ ENDP   over price collusion  In fact  Mylan revealed through a 10 Q filing of its receipt of subpoenas from the DoJ in Sep 2016  seeking additional information related to the marketing  pricing and sale of its four generic products Trump s Victory   Boon or Curse The post election rally in the biotech and pharma sectors came to an abrupt halt when President elect Donald Trump clarified that his intentions were misinterpreted and that he actually plans to target excessive drug price hikes  Winner of Time s  Person of the Year  title  in an interview with Time  Trump stated   I m going to bring down drug prices  I don t like what has happened with drug prices  During his campaigns  Trump was not as vocal as Clinton about drug price hikes  As a result  upon the declaration of results  shares of the biotech sector climbed 9  Note that the drug pricing issue has been weighing on the healthcare sector since last year when Clinton s Sep 2015  price gouging tweet  led to huge sell off in the pharma and biotech stocks Given the intense public  political and media focus on branded drug prices  in addition to the ongoing investigations into generic drug pricing  the healthcare sector will probably remain under pressure going ahead Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  MYLAN NV Price and Consensus    A Key PickSucampo Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ SCMP   is a better ranked stock in the health care sector  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Sucampo s earnings estimates increased from  1 03 to  1 22 for 2016 and from  1 30 to  1 58 for 2017

	Chicago  IL   October 05  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include VIVUS Inc     NASDAQ         Geron Corporation    NASDAQ         Achillion Pharmaceuticals  Inc     NASDAQ         Anika Therapeutics Inc    NASDAQ        and ANI Pharmaceuticals  Inc     NASDAQ         

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Biotech Mergers Run the Show  5 Small Caps for Q4

	Healthcare merger and acquisition activity has gathered steam over the past few years  A few big mergers in the recent past include that of Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Wyeth  Pfizer and Hospira  Novartis AG and Alcon  Sanofi  PA SASY  and Genzyme  Roche and Genentech  and AstraZeneca and MedImmune  Consolidation helps large pharma companies gain more pricing power while simultaneously curbing competition 

	Last November  Pfizer announced that it would acquire Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  for  160 billion  However  this deal fell apart in Apr 2016 due to the new U S  tax inversion rules 

	There has been a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare space this year too  In August  Pfizer announced the acquisition of oncology focused Medivation for approximately  14 billion  The deal is expected to close this year  This was preceded by the buyout of Anacor in Jun 2016 

	Also in June  Shire acquired Baxalta to brace its rare disease portfolio further  while Aegerion Pharmaceuticals and QLT entered into a definitive merger agreement to form a new company  Novelion Therapeutics Inc 

	In April  Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  announced plans to buy St  Jude Medical in a move to bolster its share in the cardiovascular device market  In fact  the month of September probably saw higher merger acquisition activity this year  Horizon Pharma announced plans to buy California based Raptor Pharmaceuticals  This acquisition  slated to close in the fourth quarter  is likely to strengthen Horizon s orphan business in the U S  and expand it in Europe and key important markets 

	After months of negotiations  German pharmaceutical maker  Bayer AG  DE BAYGN  last month announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Monsanto  NYSE MON  in an all cash deal worth  66 billion 

	Allergan announced a string of small bolt on acquisitions last month  It announced a definitive deal to acquire Tobira Therapeutics  a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on drugs to treat non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and other liver diseases at a massive premium of 500   Also  Allergan said it will be acquiring clinical stage biotech company  Vitae  to boost its dermatology pipeline 

	Last month  Allergan also bought privately held Akarna Therapeutics to add the latter s lead product candidate AKN 083  a preclinical stage FXR agonist  being evaluated for the treatment of NASH  Allergan also added the lead gene therapy development program RST 001 of privately held  clinical stage biotechnology company RetroSense Therapeutics to its eye care pipeline last month 

	In licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly  Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing  mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time 
	Small biotech companies are open to such deals as most of them find it challenging to raise cash  thereby facing difficulty in surviving and continuing with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash 

	Merger and acquisitions  especially small bolt on acquisitions  as well as aggressive in licensing activities and collaborations are expected to increase  going forward  This in turn puts the spotlight on small cap biotech stocks 

	Biotech companies with new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates can be strong takeover targets 

	Here we have narrowed down the list of choices by focusing on five stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   Also  these are small cap biotech companies with a market cap of less than  1 billion  These stocks are well positioned in today s market environment and could see considerable upside riding on the aforementioned trends 

VIVUS Inc     NASDAQ       

	Mountain View  CA based VIVUS  Inc  focuses on developing compounds to treat obesity  sleep apnea  diabetes and sexual health  VIVUS  key product  Qsymia  targets the highly lucrative obesity market with huge commercial potential 

	VIVUS delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the past four quarters  with an average beat of 39 88   Its loss estimates for 2016 and 2017 have narrowed over the past 60 days  The company s share price has increased 13  year to date  Currently  VIVUS sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   

Geron Corporation    NASDAQ       

	Menlo Park  CA based biopharmaceutical company  Geron Corporation focuses on the development of first in class therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer  Geron s product development programs are based on its patented core technology  telomerase  which represents significant commercial opportunity  The successful development of products that target telomeres could very well change the treatment paradigm for several diseases including oncology  which represents huge commercial potential 

	Geron  which carries a Zacks Rank  1  delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the past four quarters  with an average beat of 20 78   Its loss estimates for 2016 have narrowed from 26 cents to 24 cents in the past 60 days

Abbott first announced its deal to acquire the company in the beginning of February  However  the process had been set back by Alere s choice to delay the filing of their annual 10 K report for 2015  because it was looking into the timing of revenue recognition in Africa and China during 2013  2014  and the first three quarters of 2015 
Alere plans to file its 2015 financials as soon as possible  but does not believe the revisions will make a material impact on the data  although according to their official statement did state that  the cumulative effect of reflecting these misstatements in the current year would be material to the year ended December 31st  2015  
The company also released preliminary revenue numbers  in which they indicated revenue of between  2 45 billion and  2 48 billion for 2015  Q1 2016 preliminary revenue is between  573 million and  579 million  Alere also reported preliminary net income of between  10 million to  25 million for 2015  along with between   8 million and  2 million for Q1 2016

Results were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine 
The trial is evaluating the long term effects of Victoza  in comparison to placebo  both in addition to the standard of care  in people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of major cardiovascular  CV  events 
Results from the multicenter  international  randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled trial showed that Victoza significantly reduced the risk of the composite primary endpoint of CV death  non fatal myocardial infarction  heart attack  or non fatal stroke by 13   compared to placebo  when added to the standard of care in adults with type II diabetes at high CV risk 
Results also showed that treatment with Victoza resulted in a 22  reduction in cardiovascular death  compared to placebo 
This means that Victoza can improve outcomes beyond glucose reduction and weight loss in reducing cardiovascular complications and death in people with type II diabetes NOVO NORDISK AS Price
   We note that Victoza is indicated in Europe for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes to achieve glycemic control as monotherapy  when metformin is considered inappropriate  and in combination with oral glucose lowering medicinal products and or basal insulin when these  together with diet and exercise  do not provide adequate glycemic control  The drug is also approved in the U S  as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type II diabetes 
These results bode well for Victoza  We note that Novo Nordisk has a strong presence in the diabetes care market  supported by one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry comprising drugs like Victoza  Levemir and modern insulins

182292,403808,ABT,Aegerion  QLT Ink Merger Deal To Form Novelion Therapeutics,opinion,"Aegerion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AEGR   announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with QLT Inc    NASDAQ QLTI   
Terms of the Merger
Under the agreement  Aegerion will combine with a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of QLT  Post completion  each outstanding share of Aegerion s common stock will be exchanged for 1 0256 shares of QLT s common stock 
QLT will change its name upon the closing of the proposed transaction to Novelion Therapeutics Inc  The resulting entity will have its principal headquarters in Vancouver  British Columbia  where QLT is currently located  with business operations in Cambridge  MA 
The proposed merger has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies  The transaction is expected to close late third quarter 2016 or fourth quarter 2016  Meanwhile  a broad based investor syndicate is committed to invest approximately  22 million in QLT and to vote in favor of the proposed transaction  The syndicate comprises new investors as well as existing shareholders of both companies 
Post merger  QLT shareholders  including those who are investing in QLT immediately before closing  are expected to own approximately 67   while current shareholders of Aegerion will own approximately 33  of Novelion s common shares 
Moreover  Aegerion and QLT have inked a loan agreement  whereby QLT will provide a loan of up to  15 million as working capital to Aegerion 
Portfolio for a New Entity
The proposed merger will led to the formation of a global biopharmaceutical company with focus on rare diseases  It will offer a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of Aegerion s two marketed drugs   Juxtapid and Myalept   and QLT s late stage candidate  QLT091001  zuretinol   which is being developed for the treatment of inherited retinal disease caused by underlying mutations in RPE65 or LRAT genes that prevent adequate functioning of the retinoid cycle leading to Leber Congenital Amaurosis  LCA  and Retinitis Pigmentosa  RP  
As per the companies  projection  zuretinol s approval will create a portfolio  including Juxtapid and Myalept  that can generate peak sales of  500 million annually 
How Does QLT Benefit 
QLT plans to use Aegerion s existing orphan product infrastructure to build a global infrastructure to maximize the value of its ophthalmology candidate  zuretinol  Given the resource requirements for this  the merger with Aegerion will allow QLT to reap benefits from a larger scale and diversification  apart from creating a more liquid stock QLT INC Price
   How Does Aegerion Benefit 
On the other hand  Aegerion is facing challenging marketing conditions  Launch of PCSK9 inhibitors in the U S  market hit Juxtapid sales severely and will continue to do so in the forthcoming quarters  The company also faced reimbursement hurdles for Myalept in the first quarter as prior authorizations are taking longer than expected and payers are requesting additional data  In fact  Myalept sales are expected to remain under pressure due to the payer mix 
Hence  Aegerion is looking to turn over a new leaf with the proposed merger with the ophthalmic biotechnology company   Aegerion is also looking to address its capital needs from the proposed merger and move forward with a regulatory filing for Juxtapid in Japan and a filing for Myalept in Europe for generalized liver dystrophy and severe partial liver dystrophy by the end of 2016 
The company will also get the time to reconfigure its core business to generate a positive operating cash flow in 2017  Moreover  the transaction structure does not trigger a repayment obligation with respect to Aegerion s outstanding convertible senior notes AEGERION PHARMA Price
   Our Take
The merger appears to combine two companies  each with its own set of challenges and each looking forward to nullify the same with the other s strengths  Zuretinol  which enjoys orphan drug status in both the U S  and Europe  is expected to be advanced to phase III development in the third quarter of 2016 
There are currently no approved treatments in the U S  or Europe for LCA or RP  As per estimates  there are approximately 2 000 to 3 000 RP patients and approximately 1 000 to 2 000 LCA patients on a global basis  reflecting significant need an unmet ophthalmologic condition 
While zuretinol does look promising  Juxtapid s growth prospects appear pretty bleak  especially with the launch of PCSK9 inhibitors in the U S  The companies have witnessed a significant decline in share prices in the recent past  The merger looks like a desperate attempt by the two parties to overcome existing challenges and build a strong portfolio

182352,403868,ABT,Novartis  NVS  To Stop Trial On Breast Cancer Drug Early,opinion,"Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   announced that an independent Data Monitoring Committee has recommended the early stoppage of the MONALEESA 2 trial on its breast cancer candidate  LEE011 
The trial is evaluating LEE011  a CDK4 6 inhibitor  in combination with letrozole  compared to letrozole alone  in postmenopausal women who have received no prior therapy for hormone receptor positive  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative  HR  HER2   advanced breast cancer 
The committee s recommendation came after the trial met the primary endpoint  significantly extending progression free survival  PFS  compared to letrozole alone  as observed in a pre planned interim analysis  Results showed that LEE011  in combination with letrozole  led to clinically meaningful improvement in PFS in postmenopausal women who received no prior therapy 
The trial will continue to assess overall survival data  Novartis expects to present efficacy and safety data efficacy at a major medical congress 
Recently  Novartis announced that it has split its Pharmaceuticals Division into two business units   Novartis Pharmaceuticals and Novartis Oncology  These units will form the Innovative Medicines Division at the company  The change in the divisions is primarily to reflect the integration of the oncology assets acquired from GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   
We remind investors Novartis decided to realign its portfolio and move the ophthalmic pharmaceutical business and some drugs from Sandoz s portfolio to its pharmaceutical division owing to the challenges faced by the company in 2015 
Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones bode well for Novartis as it has been facing stiff generic competition for some of its key drugs like Diovan  Additionally  its oncology drugs are facing competition from immuno oncology therapies  Moreover  its Alcon segment is facing a decline in surgical equipment sales in the U S  and emerging markets

182353,403869,ABT,Roche Gets Accelerated Approval For Immunotherapy Drug ,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG    OTC RHHBY   announced that the FDA has granted accelerated approval to its cancer immunotherapy drug  Tecentriq  atezolizumab   for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  mUC   who experienced disease progression during or after platinum based chemotherapy  or whose disease has worsened within 12 months of receiving platinum based chemotherapy before or after surgery 
Under the accelerated approval program  the FDA grants conditional approval to a drug that fulfills an unmet medical need for a serious condition  based on early evidence suggesting clinical benefit  However  continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials 
Roche is also evaluating Tecentriq in a confirmatory phase III study  IMvigor 211   in comparison to chemotherapy  in patients with bladder cancer who have progressed on at least one prior platinum containing regimen 
An approval of Tecentriq will further widen Roche s already broad oncology portfolio 
Additional  the company announced positive results from a phase III study  J ALEX  on lung cancer drug  Alecensa  Results from a pre specified interim analysis study showed that Alecensa  an oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase  ALK  inhibitor  reduced the risk of disease worsening or death  progression free survival  PFS  by 66   compared to Xalkori  in Japanese patients with advanced or recurrent  ALK positive non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  
We remind investors that Alecensa was granted accelerated approval by FDA in Dec 2015 for the treatment of patients with ALK positive NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to Xalkori 
We expect investors to focus on new drug approvals  as Roche s top line could be marred by the entry of biosimilars  expected in the second half of 2017 in Europe  for its key drugs like MabThera and Herceptin  On the other hand  new drug approvals  such as those of Cotellic and Alecensa  boosted sales in 2015

The trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of MM 151  an oligoclonal EGFR  epidermal growth factor receptor  inhibitor  in combination with Onivyde plus fluorouracil  5 FU  and leucovorin  in patients with RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer 
The trial will also determine the side effects of MM 151  when used in combination with Onivyde plus 5 FU and leucovorin  and a recommended dose for subsequent trials on this combination 
The phase I study will be solely funded by Merrimack and the company will be single handedly responsible for the execution of the trial 
Onivyde is approved for use in combination with fluorouracil  5 FU  and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  after disease progression following Gemzar  gemcitabine  based therapy  Initial uptake of Onivyde has been strong and should boost the top line  going forward 
We remind investors that Merrimack and Baxalta entered into an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and commercialize Onivyde outside the U S   except for Taiwan where PharmaEngine holds the rights to commercialize the drug  Onivyde was approved in Taiwan in Oct 2015 
We note that MM 151 was previously being evaluated in a clinical trial on patients with advanced solid tumors  At present  Merrimack depends heavily on Onivyde for growth  As a result  development of other candidates is essential for the company

182355,403871,ABT,Novartis  Cardiovascular Drug Gets Positive Recommendation,opinion,"Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   announced that its cardiovascular drug  Entresto  was given a class I recommendation  as per the updated clinical practice guidelines released simultaneously by the American College of Cardiology  ACC   the American Heart Association  AHA  and the Heart Failure Society of America  HFSA   as well as the European Society of Cardiology 
Consequently  Entresto is now a standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF  in the U S  as an alternative to an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker  ARB  
Moreover  doctors can switch HFrEF patients with mild to moderate symptoms from ACEs or ARBs to Entresto as per the latest guidelines 
The news bodes well for Novartis as the release of the latest guidelines would propel demand for Entresto  We remind investors that Entresto s uptake was considerably slow since its launch due to access barriers 
The recommendations were based on positive results from the PARADIGM HF trial  which showed Entresto significantly lowered the occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF 
Last week  Novartis announced that it will conduct approximately 40 active or planned clinical studies in a large global clinical program  FortiHFy  to generate additional data on symptom reduction  efficacy  safety  quality of life benefits and real world evidence on Entresto 
An increase in uptake of Entresto will positively impact Novartis  top line  which is presently under pressure as the company continues to face stiff generic competition for some of its key drugs like Diovan and Gleevec  Additionally  its oncology drugs are facing competition from immuno oncology therapies  Moreover  its Alcon segment is facing a decline in surgical equipment sales in the U S  and emerging markets

Results showed that Cabometyx led to significant improvement in progression free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC  compared with sunitinib  Consequently  the trial met its primary endpoint 
Safety data from the Cabometyx arm of the study were consistent with those observed in previous studies in patients with advanced RCC 
Final results of the trial will be presented at a medical conference shortly 
We remind investors that Cabometyx  the tablet formulation of cabozantinib  was approved by the FDA in Apr 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC  who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy 
Meanwhile  the European Medicines Agency  EMA  has accepted a Marketing Authorisation Application  MAA  for Cabometyx for review in the same indication  Upon a potential approval  the drug would be marketed in the EU by Exelixis  partner  Ipsen  The MAA has been granted accelerated assessment by the EMA s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP   which translates a review period of 150 days instead of the standard 210 days 
Exelixis also plans to submit results of the CABOSUN trial to regulatory authorities in order to discuss further development of Cabometyx and submission strategy for the treatment of first line advanced RCC 
As per the American Cancer Society  kidney cancer is one of the top 10 most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in both men and women in the U S  Hence  approval of Cabometyx in first line advanced RCC will boost its growth prospects significantly

We note that MabThera is approved for the treatment of non Hodgkin s lymphoma  which includes follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma  chronic lymphocytic leukemia and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  Sandoz is seeking approval of its biosimilar for the same indications as the reference product 
We are impressed by Sandoz s efforts to broaden its biosimilars portfolio  MabThera is one of the leading oncology drugs across the world and Sandoz s oncology portfolio already boasts two marketed products 
Sandoz currently markets three biosimilars   Omnitrope  a human growth hormone  Binocrit  an erythropoiesis stimulating agent  and Zarxio   in the U S  Backed by its deep pipeline of biosimilars  the company plans to make 10 regulatory filings over the 2015 2017 time frame  of which six applications have already been submitted

Quarterly Details
Zoetis manages its business across two regional operating segments  the U S  and International  Within these segments  the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals  These segment results include six additional calendar days  as the first quarter of 2016 had six additional calendar days compared with the first quarter of 2015 
In the reported quarter  sales of livestock products accounted for 58 8  of the total revenue  Approximately 40 1  of revenues in the quarter came from the sale of companion animal products  while the remaining came from contract manufacturing 
Revenues in the U S  segment increased 12  from the year ago period to  582 million  Sales of companion animal products grew 32  reflecting increased sales of Apoquel  initial sales of other products into expanded distribution relationships  and the addition of products acquired from Abbott Laboratories    NYSE ABT   Animal Health business  Livestock revenue declined 4  due to decreased sales of cattle and swine products 
Sales at the International segment were  however  down 1  to  567 million  up 13  operationally   While sales of companion animal products increased 11   up 23  operationally   sales of livestock products were down 5   up 9  operationally  in the reported quarter

Our Take
Zoetis  first quarter results were better than expected with the company beating on both top  and bottom line estimates  However  unfavourable currency movement continued to hurt the top line  Nevertheless  we are positive on the Nov 2015 Pharmaq acquisition  We expect to see more of such acquisitions deals at the company in the near future  as it continues to focus on its strategy of acquiring complementary businesses and products

182383,403899,ABT,Abbott Laboratories  ABT  Is In Oversold Territory  What s Next ,opinion,"Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   has been on a bit of a cold streak lately  but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock  And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at ABT given that  according to its RSI reading of 24 52  it is now in oversold territory 
What is RSI 
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet  ABT s low RSI value isn t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround  as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late  This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Abbott Laboratories  earnings consensus 
Over the past two months  investors have seen 11 earnings estimate revisions move higher  compared with none lower  at least when looking at the key current year time frame  And the consensus estimate for ABT has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days  as estimates have risen from  2 15 share two months ago to just  2 20 share right now 
If this wasn t enough  Abbott Laboratories also has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy which puts it into rare company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now  or holding on   as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long ",2016-05-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abbott-laboratories-(abt)-is-in-oversold-territory:-what's-next-200128322,200128322

182409,403925,ABT,Top Trade Ideas For The Week January 4  2016  ABT,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Abbott Laboratories  N ABT   had a 17 month run higher before the pullback in the market in August 2015  It took a large hit them and then suffered another body blow when Hillary Clinton declared war on drug pricing in September  It has since recovered the ground lost on the second point and been consolidating around resistance at 46 
The stock moved back over the 50 day SMA in lat October and retested that two weeks ago  Since it has been acting as support  tightening against the resistance at 46  The RSI remains in the bullish zone  drifting near 50 after a move over 60  The MACD is trending lower but crossed up as it hit the zero level last week 
There is resistance at 46 and a move over that would trigger a target to 53  a new high  on a Cup and Handle break out  Or you could call it an AB CD or Measured Move too  all point to 53  Support lower comes at 44 75 and 43 50 with a break under that targeting the prior low at 39 as a start  Short interest is low at 1 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next on January 27th 
Checking the options activity the January chain shows large open interest on the call side to the upside from 45 to 50 and then it tails off a bit but continues higher  The put side has high open interest at 45 and then the biggest at 40 below  Moving out to February  beyond earnings  sees a possible buffer at 43 in the put open interest with the call side showing volume from 44 to 50 above 
Abbott Labs  Ticker  ABT
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 46 with a stop at 45  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the January 46 Calls  offered at 23 cents late Friday  on the same trigger  Using defined risk to gain the upside 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the January 40 46 bullish Risk Reversal  17 cents   A leveraged trade for upside participation 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the February 48 Calls and sell the February 43 42 Put Spread  10 cents   A levered trade with defined risk and more time 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Thursday which  as the books closed on 2015 and we started prep for 2016 saw the equity markets showing a lack of strength at best and some weakness short term 
Elsewhere look for consolidation to rule the short term  In Gold look for consolidation in the downtrend with Crude Oil also consolidating its move lower  The US Dollar Index looks to consolidate in the uptrend while US Treasuries just continue broad consolidation sideways marking time  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue its sideways motion while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts look to move into the New Year showing further consolidation in the long run but with some weakness in the short run  especially in the SPY  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

182410,403926,ABT,Hungry For Stability  5 High Yield Dividend Stocks To Consider,opinion,"Recent market turmoil has reignited investor appetite for the safe and staid  Of course  when it comes to the markets  there s never a 100  guarantee of safety  but because they can be relatively stable and reliable  higher yield  3    dividend paying stocks are   According to the Wall St  Journal 

This year  stocks in the S P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index companies in the S P Composite 1500 that have increased their dividends every year for at least 20 years are up 1 91   including dividends  compared with a negative total return of 4 3  for the S P 500 Index  The total return on the Dow Jones U S  Dividend 100 Index  composed of stocks that offer consistent  high payouts  is negative 0 8  

Simply investing in dividend paying companies isn t a guarantee that you ll profit from the investment  And a high yield stock isn t necessarily a safe haven  Reliable is the key here  since some companies intentionally beef up their dividend yields to unsustainable levels in order to attract investors  thereby up their share price 
On the other hand  some companies are thriving  and even if their stock remains relatively flat during specific market cycles  they ve paid out and consistently raised dividends for years  That sort of past performance is a good indicator of future results 
Here s our list of the top 5 dividend stocks with high yields that have been raising dividends almost every year for at least the past 30 years 
5  AbbVie  NYSE ABBV 
AbbVie is a pharmaceuticals company focused on the research and development of biopharmaceuticals and small molecule drugs  It employs about 28 000 people and has a market cap of  90B 
Although  AbbVie has only been paying dividends for the past 3 years  it has a good excuse  it s a spin off of Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   a Dividend Aristocrat that s raised its dividend payout for 20 consecutive years  And since the acorn doesn t fall far from the tree  in this case at least  it seems fair to include AbbVie on our list  since it has continued Abbott s tradition of raising its dividend annually 
AbbVie shareholders enjoy a significant dividend yield of 4 12  along with a 43 year tradition of dividends from its  parent  company  At  56 40 per share as of yesterday s close  AbbVie also trades for a reasonable P E ratio of 13 1  compared to the industry average of 38 07 

With solid growth over the past three years  including a 14  rise in revenue in 2015  and an expected blockbuster leukemia drug set to be released in 2016  as well as the ongoing success of its best selling Humira medication which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis  ulcerative colaitis and Crohn s disease among others  AbbVie continues to look promising 
The next Ex Dividend date for AbbVie is April 13th  for a quarterly dividend of  0 57 

4  Old Republic International  NYSE ORI 
If you think you cannot possibly find reliable companies among smaller market caps  you missed this one  Old Republic International engages in the insurance underwriting  primarily in North America  The company offers a variety of insurance policies  such as automobile  travel insurance  and various specific activities 
Founded in 1887  and headquartered in Chicago  Illinois  Old Republic has a comparatively small market cap of only  4 72B  so it pales in comparison to the usual value of most Dividend Aristocrats  However  it has fully earned its place alongside them 

With an annual payout of  0 75 per share and a stock price of  18 01  the company yields 4 16   Its EPS of 1 46 also means the company sells at 12 3 times earnings  below the industry average of 15 5  The analyst consensus target price on Old Republic is  20 given potential earnings and revenue growth expectations  which would put its stock price at 10  higher than what it sells for today 
The relatively small market cap may deter some from trusting this company  but that would be a mistake  It s well worth any dividend investor s consideration 
The next Ex Dividend date for Old Republic is yet to be announced  The most recent Ex Dividend date for the quarter was March 2nd  for a quarterly dividend of  0 1875 

3  Mercury General  NYSE MCY 
Like Old Republic  Mercury General is in the insurance business  And like Old Republic  Mercury General depending on the metrics you use can be considered either a large small cap or a small mid cap with a valuation of 2 97B 
Its  3B revenue doesn t make it a powerhouse like the top two companies on this list  below   but it still has a lot to offer  How much  A 4 61  yield on its  53 85 per share price tag  It has been paying a dividend since 1986  and raising that dividend annually since the initial payout 

It has a healthy payout ratio of 95 4   meaning it is not using all its net income to fund the dividend   and though its last earnings report  released on February 8  wasn t quite as expected   0 52 EPS on expectations of  0 68   the company remains committed to its dividend raise  Luckily  the miss is expected to be a one time event  predicated on higher than expected loss frequency and severe one time events in several states  Analyst forecasts predict an EPS of  0 67 for Q1 2016  which would easily cover the dividend payout 
The next Ex Dividend date for Mercury General is March 15th  for a quarterly dividend of  0 62 

2  Chevron  NYSE CVX 
The next two companies on our list aren t really surprising  They re two of the biggest corporations in the world  First up   Chevron 
Chevron is an American multinational energy corporation  operating in more than 180 countries worldwide  It engages in everything oil and gas related  from exploration to refining through marketing and transport  With a market cap of  167 11B and revenues of   129 87B  it isn t going to disappear in the near or long term future 

But  while the company itself is here to stay  its  4 28 dividend and 4 82  yield might not be  Like the entire oil industry  Chevron has been hit hard by the recent downturn in commodity prices  The last time it hiked its dividend was in Q2 2014  and the company has said it will not raise its dividend burden until times are easier for energy companies 
For a glimpse at the possible future of this dividend payer  look no further than ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   which recently slashed its dividend by 66   Chevron isn t much of a value buy either  since it trades at a P E ratio of 36 29  well above the industry s 28 average  Overall  Chevron s dividend probably depends on a certain recovery of oil prices  because right now its 240  payout ratio  that is  almost 2 5 times its earnings  is most certainly unsustainable 
The next Ex Dividend date is yet to be announced since the Ex Dividend date for this quarter was February 16th  for a quarterly dividend of  1 07 

1  AT T  NYSE T 
When considering yields as well as continuity and consistency  one would be hard pressed to find anything better than AT T  The telecommunications company is the second largest provider of mobile telephony in the U S  With a market cap of  24 3B it is the 12th largest company on the S P 500 
Buying AT T today would secure you a 5 04  yield  an extraordinary return given current market conditions  AT T s dividend has been spectacularly stable  rising regularly for 31 years in a row  The company itself is well priced as well  with an acceptable 16 83 P E ratio compared to 23 9 for the industry as a whole  and a Price to Sales ratio of 1 5 compared to the industry s 1 74 

The return on the stock itself isn t as impressive as the dividend  and the company has been trading sideways since mid 2012  But  if it s reliable income you re after   you could do a lot worse than AT T 
The next Ex Dividend date has yet to be announced since the Ex Dividend date for the last quarter was January 6  for a quarterly dividend of  0 48",2016-03-09,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-high-yield-dividend-stocks-to-consider-200120907,200120907
182411,403927,ABT,Zoetis  ZTS   Stock Likely To Beat On Earnings In Q1 Again ,opinion,"Zoetis Inc    NYSE ZTS   is scheduled to report first quarter 2016 results on May 4  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company easily beat expectations with a positive earnings surprise of 10 26   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to ConsiderAt the time of reporting fourth quarter 2015 earnings results  Zoetis updated its 2016 guidance to reflect the impact of the European Commission s tax rulings in Belgium  foreign exchange rates as of late January  and changes related to the company s accounting for its operations in Venezuela  For 2016  the company expects earnings in the range of  1 71 to  1 81 per share on revenues of  4 65 billion and  4 775 billion 
Meanwhile  Zoetis  robust and diversified product portfolio including products for livestock and companion animals should continue to drive top line growth at the company  The top line should also benefit from the addition of products acquired from Abbott Laboratories    NYSE ABT   Animal Health business  acquired in Feb 2015   the Nov 2015 Pharmaq acquisition as well as from the performance of Apoquel and other key brands 
However  the company expects to see a greater impact from Apoquel in the second quarter of 2016 as it increases the availability of the product in the existing markets and launches it in new markets  Moreover  Zoetis doesn t expect to see the impact from new product launches in the first quarter and anticipates these products to ramp up during the year 
Considering that Zoetis  comprehensive operational efficiency initiatives  announced in May 2015  are anticipated to be largely complete in the second half of the year  the company expects to witness the positive impact from these initiatives in the second half of the year than in the first half 
On the first quarter call  investor focus will be on the company s performance as well as on the company s update on 2016 guidance 
Surprise History
Zoetis  track record has been impressive with the company beating earnings estimates consistently  In fact  Zoetis has posted a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 14 81  

Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
For the first quarter of 2016  our proven model also shows that Zoetis is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  2 44   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the shares 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  and  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  However  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of Zoetis  Zacks Rank  3 and  2 44  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season 
Other Stocks that Warrant a Look
Here are a couple of other health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Genocea Biosciences  Inc    NASDAQ GNCA   has an Earnings ESP of  2 50  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release first quarter results on May 5 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc   NASDAQ JAZZ   has an Earnings ESP of  4 58  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release first quarter results on May 10 ",2016-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zoetis-(zts):-stock-likely-to-beat-on-earnings-in-q1-again-200127325,200127325
182435,403951,ABT,Profit From Emerging Market Health Care Growth With Abbott Laboratories,opinion,"Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   its 2nd quarter 2015 results 
The company saw adjusted earnings per share grow 6 1  to  0 52 per share from  0 49 per share in the same quarter a year ago 
Abbott Laboratories left its adjusted earnings per share guidance for full fiscal 2015 unchanged at  2 10 to  2 20 per share  The company had adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of  1 98 in fiscal 2014  Abbott Laboratories outlook is for earnings per share growth of between 6  and 11  for fiscal 2015 
6  to 11  earnings per share growth actually significantly understates Abbott s real underlying business growth  On a constant currency basis  the company is expecting earnings growth of 13  to 18  in fiscal 2015 
The company s management expects headwinds from currency effects of around 7  in fiscal 2015  Abbott Laboratories is experiencing strong growth despite negative currency effects 
The company s growth would be much higher if the dollar had not appreciated so much in the last year  When this trend reverses  Abbott Laboratories stands to benefit 
Business Overview
Abbott Laboratories is a diversified health care company that manufactures and sells nutrition products  medical devices and diagnostic equipment  and pharmaceuticals 
Abbott Laboratories owns the Similac  Pedialyte  and Ensure brands   making the company  1in adult nutrition globally and  1 in pediatric nutrition in the U S 
The company operates in 4 segments  Each segment is shown below along with the percentage of total revenue generated for Abbott Laboratories in its most recent quarter 
Diagnostics generated 23  of total revenue
Nutrition generated 33  of total revenue
Medical Devices generated 25  of total revenue
Branded Generic Pharmaceuticals generated 19  of total revenue
Abbott Laboratories is truly a global business  The company generated just 31  of sales in the United States in its most recent quarter  The remaining 69  of sales were from international markets 
Safety Analysis
Abbott Laboratories has invested heavily in emerging markets  These investments are paying off  Emerging market sales grew 20 6  on a constant currency basis in Abbott Laboratories  most recent quarter 
The company has had success in emerging markets because it emphasizes manufacturing in the country where goods are sold  This reduces currency fluctuation risks and builds connections with the communities  companies  and governments the company serves 
Abbott Laboratories large international business gives it an advantage over large health care businesses that focus more on the United States  Abbott Laboratories has more exposure to faster growing markets 
One would think that too much exposure to international markets would hurt Abbott Laboratories during recessions  but that is not the case 
Abbott Laboratories managed to grow revenue  earnings  and dividends each year through the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009  Consumers and governments typically do not cut back on health care expenditures regardless of the economic climate  Abbott Laboratories stock fell just 4 95  in 2008 while the S P 500 declined 38  
Abbott Laboratories carries around  7 billion in debt and has  3 billion in cash on hand  The company generated about  3 5 billion in net profit in 2014  Abbott Laboratories is conservatively financed 
Future Growth   Dividends
Abbott Laboratories has paid increasing dividends for 43 consecutive years  excluding the effects of spin offs  The company s long dividend streak makes Abbott Laboratories a Dividend Aristocrat  
Despite over 4 consecutive decades of dividend growth  Abbott Laboratories still has a long growth runway ahead 
Abbott Laboratories  emerging market penetration gives it excellent long term growth prospects  The combination of emerging market economic growth and aging populations provide a favorable macroeconomic environment for Abbott Laboratories 
The company further increased its exposure to emerging markets with its recent acquisitions of  and  in the recent past  The company is targeting constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of around 15  in fiscal 2015 
Abbott Laboratories should continue to grow quickly over the next several years  If a global recession were to occur  management has plenty of  dry powder  to pursue further acquisitions in international markets 
Dividends should also continue to grow rapidly for Abbott Laboratories  The company has a payout ratio of just 41   Abbott Laboratories still has room to grow its dividend payments faster than overall company growth if management chooses to do so  Abbott Laboratories currently has a 1 9  dividend yield 
Valuation
Abbott Laboratories is currently trading for an adjusted price to earnings ratio of 22  This number uses adjusted earnings  not GAAP earnings  The company s adjusted earnings do not include amortization expense and other items  The adjusted earnings give a more accurate picture of Abbott Laboratories  true earnings power 
Abbott Laboratories appears to be trading at the high end of fair value  The company s price to earnings ratio is fairly high  but reflects the extreme quality of Abbott Laboratories 
The company is still growing quickly  has low debt  a shareholder friendly management  and is recession resistant  Investors should expect to pay a slight premium over the S P 500 s price to earnings multiple for a premium quality business like Abbott Laboratories 
Final Thoughts
The management teams at many publicly traded corporations talk and talk about taking advantage of emerging market growth  Abbott Laboratories  management has done much more than talk  They have positioned the company for international growth 
Over the past year  this strategy has looked somewhat foolish thanks to the rapidly appreciation United States dollar  In the long run  emerging market growth will outpace growth in the United States  Emerging markets simply have an easier path to growth and larger populations 
Abbott Laboratories has a long growth runway ahead in emerging markets  The company s shares appear to be trading near the high end of fair value  The company s stock price is up over 20  in the last year despite the strong dollar  When the dollar trend reverses  Abbott Laboratories will likely see rapid earnings per share growth 
Abbott Laboratories is among the highest quality dividend growth stocks in the health care industry  The health care industry itself is among the best industries to invest  people will always need health care  Long term thinking dividend growth investors would do well to make Abbott a core holding of their portfolio ",2015-07-26,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/profit-from-emerging-market-health-care-growth-with-abbott-laboratories-259447,259447

182458,403974,ABT,Wars And Failed Mergers Make For A Tricky October,opinion,"The data provider and analyst Eurekahedge  in its latest report  says that hedge funds posted negative returns in both September and October  Wars  elections  oil prices  and a change in U S  tax policy all figure into the reasons why 
Start with Numbers 
The Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index is down 0 24  in October  although still up 3 47  year to date 
Looking at the industry by region  Eastern Europe and Russia had the worst October   2 26    The reason for that isn t difficult to grasp  war and the rumor of war  On October 1st  after all  both a school and a bus station in Donetsk took artillery hits  and 12 people died On October 10  a qualifying match between Ukraine and Belarus in Minsk was rather rudely interrupted for the arrest of about 100 fans chanting an anti Putin slogan  This is hardly an environment beloved by investors 
The Asia ex Japan index did best  up 0 55    Managers there report gains from their exposure to China s property developers  China A share investing funds scored their sixth straight month of positive returns and are now up 9 9  YTD through October 
 Parenthetically  there s much to be said for the A share s as an investing option  They give investors exposure to China s consumer names  so if you believe that consumed in China  rather than made in China  is the next Big Trend  and you want to be ahead of that curve  you might make use of this asset  
Roller Coaster Rides 
Emerging markets were down for the month  in large part due to the political success of Brazil s president 
The Eurekahedge analysis characterizes October as having been  a roller coaster ride for the financial markets  with volatility rising sharply during the month as the CBOE VIX Index reached 26 2 at its peak  while yields on 10 year treasuries briefly fell below 2   
There was a good deal of positive economic news in the second half of the month  though  including corporate earnings reports and gross domestic product numbers 
The Federal Reserve ended its quantitative easing program  but as Eurekahedge observes   central banks elsewhere remain fully committed to tackling deflation   Indeed  they do so with the  
 
Strategy
Only two of the strategy specific indices were in the black for October  CTA Managed Futures 0 26 up  and Fixed Income 0 10  The futures managers benefitted from their short energy positions as oil prices fell  Fixed income strategies may have benefited from the  divergence in economic policies between central banks  
Long short equity managers were down only slightly  They ve been reducing their long exposures of late as a matter of risk management  the report says 
Event driven funds suffered substantial losses  and merger arb funds did still worse  Some high profile attempts at merging fell through in October  hurting funds in both those categories  For example  AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV  tried and failed to absorb Shire PLC  AbbVie is a biopharm concern  a successor to Abbott Laboratories  and best known for Humira  Shire is a rare disease specialist  It seemed a natural combination  and certain fund managers bet heavily that it would be a completed one 
AbbVie  an American drug company  thought that it would benefit from the merger with U K  based Shire in part for tax reasons  as a so called  inversion  
AbbVie s board changed its own view of the deal on October 16th  saying  the agreed upon valuation is no longer supported as a result of the changes to the tax rules  of the Obama administration in the U S 
Multi strategy  distressed debt and arbitrage funds also had scary Octobers at 0 94   0 87  and 0 76  respectively  Macro managers were down 0 61   ",2014-12-02,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wars-and-failed-mergers-make-for-a-tricky-october-234330,234330
182482,403998,ABT,Market Dynamics Changing  Time To Evaluate Your Portfolio,opinion,"Being financial reporting season  it s important to discern between results that beat Wall Street consensus and real economic growth 
Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  just announced better than expected first quarter earnings  but they weren t better than the comparable quarter of 2013  Operating earnings  earnings from continuing operations  and diluted earnings per share were all down significantly compared to the first quarter of 2013 
So  the illusion can definitely become real in hot markets  Investors are always better off ignoring headlines and going right to the financial statements  Managed earnings are just that managed 
One company that just produced a very good quarter was The Charles Schwab Corporation  NYSE SCHW   The stock broker s first quarter sales grew 15  to  1 48 billion on strong growth in asset management and administration fees 
Net earnings leapt 58  to  326 million  or 60  to  0 60 in diluted earnings per share  Top line growth and strong expense control were the reasons for the strong bottom line growth 
There s no real reason why Charles Schwab s share price should keep on appreciating near term  All the good news is priced into the shares  The company beat consensus earnings by  0 02 a share  while revenues were in line 
This reporting season  earnings are here to justify current share prices 
I d be very wary of buying corporate good news now  Market jitters aren t going away and all it takes is a small catalyst for institutional investors to pull the sell trigger again 
A meaningful correction or price consolidation would be a positive development for the longer run trend and a good opportunity to consider adding to blue chip positions 
A good deal of speculative fervor has come out of this market  but by no means are biotechnology stocks or initial public offerings  IPOs  now cheaply valued  There s a lot more room for meaningful downside so as to get back to reasonable pricing  It s just indeterminate as to when this will happen with the Federal Reserve being so committed to easy monetary stimulus 
The NASDAQ Composite is leading this market currently and this means that there s real potential for extra volatility  Wherever technology stocks go  so does the broader market 
The current environment is a great time to be re evaluating portfolio risk as well as identifying those companies you d like to own if valuations were more reasonable  I would still only buy genuine value in this market  the fact of the matter is that there s not a lot of it around 
Equity market dynamics are changing  The beginning of last year saw tremendous leadership from transportation stocks and dividend paying blue chips  then the rally slowly broadened out 
Speculative issues recently got a bit of a haircut and then there were gains in emerging markets  Looking for trends in the equity universe going forward  I suspect energy will continue to be a solid sector for investors  Despite recent gains  there is still value in the energy sector as earnings have done an excellent job of catching up to share prices 
The upside this year is with value plays  Price momentum might return to risk capital sectors  but I think we re in for an extended break now

182483,403999,ABT,Why This Institutional Favorite Tops My List Of Stocks,opinion,"One of my favorite companies for long term  income seeking investors is Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  
While pharmaceuticals are the company s anchor  its other business lines help with cash flow and dividend increases 
Investors have bid Johnson   Johnson shares tremendously in recent years  and it s difficult to consider buying the company now  as the position is up another 10 points since March 
But Johnson   Johnson is the kind of stock income seeking investors should keep an eye on for more attractive entry points  even though they may not come around all that often  The most recent possible entry points were in late September of last year and late January of this year 
My expectations for a mature company like this is for total annual sales to grow by the mid single digits  with earnings growth and dividends producing an approximate 10  total annual return 
With a 10  annual return on investment  your money doubles every seven years 
Johnson   Johnson is typically priced at a slight premium to the S P 500  but the company has earned its higher valuation by providing relatively consistent growth  reliable corporate outlooks  and a strong track record of dividend increases 
The company s stock chart is featured below 

Johnson   Johnson has typically been a good performer over the long term  but just like any large cap  it can sit and produce no capital gains for long periods of time 
The position broke out at the beginning of 2013 after a number of years of modest capital gains  Institutional investors  wanting the earnings safety and solid dividends that the company provided  bid the stock tremendously 
I still view the stock as an institutional favorite and the fact of the matter is that in this global economy  consistent business growth is a difficult thing to achieve 
But Johnson   Johnson is not a stock worth chasing  It s the kind of position one might take on and or add to during dips 
Investment risk with this brand name company is actually higher than you might think  and that s because in recent quarters  its only business unit that has been growing is pharmaceuticals 
And that s what you are buying if you re considering shares in this company  Consumer products and medical devices are material but slow growth business lines 
A long term  diversified equity market portfolio is well served by having exposure to the healthcare area and Johnson   Johnson would be a top pick among blue chips 
There are plenty of competitors in the marketplace from which to choose  but I like this company for its diversified business lines  even if they are mature operating units 
Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  is another diversified pharmaceutical company that s broken out on the stock market 
This enterprise is a pure play pharmaceutical business with a number of other lines  including diagnostic tests  nutritional products and veterinary care products 
It s a solid  dividend paying large cap  but it s only a fifth of the size of Johnson   Johnson s market capitalization 
Second quarter earnings season is here and Johnson   Johnson reports this coming Tuesday  July 15  The company usually increases its quarterly dividend every second quarter and recently did so  payable on June 10  2014 
On any share price retrenchments  this company is worthy of consideration

182501,404017,ABT,Near Term Catalysts  High Insider Ownership Makes GTx An Attractive Buy,opinion,Today  we are going to take a comprehensive look at a small cap biotech company with several near term catalysts  a strong cash position  and high insider ownership  I feel with all factors considered  this company can see very good price appreciation heading into its near term catalyst  GTx  GTXI  specializes in developing synthetic hormones to achieve certain therapeutic effects in the body  Hormones are extremely important in controlling certain cellular and intracellular activities in our bodies and drugs that manipulate these hormones can have a very powerful effect  Many of our body s cells have specific receptors  where certain molecules with the correct stereochemistry and conformation can activate or inhibit a response  GTx develops drugs termed  nonsteroidal selective receptor modulators  that facilitate control of androgen and estrogen receptors by binding to the receptor instead of the natural hormone  These nonsteroidal selective receptor modulators  SRMs  are important because they are able to interact with the hormone receptors that usually only allow the four fused chemical ring structure of a steroid to bind  even though they do not contain the same chemical structure  This is significant because it allows GTx s drugs to control these vital hormones and stimulate their beneficial characteristics  while also minimizing the unwanted side effects of synthetic steroidal compounds  GTx is currently in two pivotal Phase III trials  termed Power 1 and Power 2  for enobosarm  Ostarine  GTx 024   which is used for the  with non small cell lung cancer and for other muscle wasting diseases  Additionally  GTx is conducting a Phase II trial for its estrogen receptor alpha antagonist  Capesaris  GTx 758    GTx s Platform and Pipeline  Selective Receptor Modulators  SRMs  GTx s SRM platform is potentially very powerful because it s able to maximize the benefits of a drug  while minimizing the side effects  Steroidal hormones have been used for years to treat certain diseases and conditions  however  use of these hormones has been rather limited due to the unwanted side effects that steroids cause  This is of particular importance because steroid usage causes very noticeable side effects that include potential stimulation of prostate cancer  aggravation of existing benign prostatic hyperplasia  acne  hair growth  virilization  and gynecomastia  GTx s platform allows scientists to harness the power of some of our body s strongest hormones to stimulate tissue growth  development  and function  without using steroids  Whether the desired effect is to be an agonist  stimulating a biological response  or antagonist  blocking a biological response   scientists can have better control over the treatment of select tissues Enobosarm Enobosarm  also termed Ostarine or GTx 024  is in two Phase III clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   These trials are of the utmost importance for patients with muscle wasting because there is currently no approved treatment  Muscle wasting is a common problem for patients with non small cell lung cancer and it can be quite debilitating  In fact  88  of patients report they have difficulty doing everyday activities such as climbing stairs  This muscle loss is a common cancer symptom that can be caused by the underlying condition or the side effects of several chemotherapy drugs  Nearly half of NSCLC patients present severe muscle loss and 70  have muscle loss before death  So far  previous trials for enobosarm have gone well and met primary endpoints    To date  GTx has evaluated enobosarm in eight clinical trials involving approximately 600 subjects including three efficacy studies  A four month Phase IIb enobosarm clinical trial enrolled 159 patients with NSCLC  colorectal cancer  breast cancer  non Hodgkin s lymphoma  or chronic lymphocytic leukemia  The study met its primary endpoint of absolute change in total lean body mass  muscle  compared to placebo and the secondary endpoint of muscle function  performance   The incidence of serious adverse events  deaths and tumor progression were similar among placebo and the treatment arms  The most common side effects reported among all subjects in the trial were fatigue  anemia  nausea and diarrhea  So many NSCLC patients live with a lower quality of life  due to the fact that there is currently no approved treatment  The FDA recognizes this unmet need and gave Fast Track Designation for this indication of enobosarm  If Phase III trial results are positive  it will be a huge success for patients and investors alike  Capesaris GTx is also working on developing GTx 758  Capesaris   which is in Phase II clinical trials  Capesaris is a selective estrogen receptor alpha agonist  which is being tested for use in treating men with advanced prostate cancer  It is thought that by increasing the sex hormone binding globulin and reducing serum free testosterone  patients will see a significant decrease in prostate cancer cell growth  On March 15  2013  GTx presented its Phase II Trial Data in advanced prostate cancer at the 28th Annual European Association of Urology Congress and was selected as   Near term catalysts  GTx is expecting to release topline data from the two pivotal clinical trials termed POWER 1 and POWER 2 soon this year  Both of the pivotal trials are placebo controlled  double blind  and were fully enrolled by the 4th quarter of 2012    Chief Executive Officer of GTx  We are pleased that the DSMB  Data Safety Monitoring Board  has recommended that GTx continue as planned with our clinical studies of enobosarm under the existing protocols  The extensive safety database GTx is compiling from the numerous clinical studies of enobosarm will be a critical component of GTx s application for marketing approval  which we hope to submit following receipt of topline data from our Phase III clinical trials in the 3rd quarter of 2013  In both trials  patients with stage III or IV NSCLC were randomized at the time they began first line chemotherapy and were either treated with placebo or 3 mg of enobosarm  The study measured the response rates of enobosarm vs  placebo  on maintaining or improving total lean body mass  To test this  doctors had patients perform a stair climb to assess the individual s power at day 84 of treatment  Additionally  the study used dual x ray absorptiometry  DXM  to measure the patient s bone mineral density at five months of treatment  GTx s indication for enobosarm deals with muscle loss  however there are some big name pharmaceutical companies that produce therapies for patients with non small cell lung cancer  One of these companies is Pfizer  PFE   which currently markets Xalkori  crizontinib   Xalkori is a protein kinase inhibitor that binds to the ATP binding pocket of target kinases  About 4  of NSCLC patients have an abnormality to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase  ALK  gene  which can cause cancer growth in the lung  This approved drug causes 90  of tumors to shrink at least 30  50  in clinical trials  The purpose of this comparison is not to highlight a competing product  because GTx s indication has no current treatment and thus there is not competition   but to show that the market for products that help treat NSCLC is large and profitable  Future Catalysts  GTx also has several catalysts in the future that could drive share price significantly higher   that it would be initiating a Phase II  open label study of enobosarm to treat ER positive metastatic breast cancer  The primary endpoints for this study will be clinical benefit and will be assessed within 6 months time  Moreover  GTx is currently enrolling a  to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lower doses of Capesaris to treat men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and expects to receive topline data from this study later this year  Financial Position  GTx is in a very strong financial position for a developmental biotech company  The company engaged a public offering on June 23  2011 of 10 000 000 shares priced at  4 75 per share  totaling about  47 5 million  Currently  GTx has  56 09 million in cash  and no debt  so it s not likely the company will have a need to dilute anytime soon as its cash position should be able to last through next year  Share Structure   Similar to many of the other biotech companies that I have covered  GTx has a favorable share structure  They only have 20 57 million shares in the float  which means when the stock does move  it will move quickly and decisively  Furthermore  there is no significant outstanding warrants that would act as an overhang to limit the share price from appreciating into the anticipated release of Phase III data  Insider ownership   From the same table above  we can also see the bullish sentiment of the GTx insiders  Currently  insiders hold 69 28  of the shares  which is a large position for a developmental biotech company  Joseph Hyde  the former Chief Executive Officer of Autozone and director of the FedEx Corporation  is currently on GTx s board of directors and is the largest shareholder  He holds 9 405 014 shares of GTx  with a current market value of over  42 500 000  Jack Schuler  the former President and Chief Operating Officer of Abbott Laboratories  ABT   also owns 6 954 144 shares  with a current market value of over  31 500 000  It s important to note that neither of these heavily invested insiders has sold a single share within the last year  In fact  they have continually added  with the most recent acquisition as close as March 31  2013 by Joseph Hyde  Small cap developmental pharmas that show positive results in clinical trials dealing with unmet need markets are often acquired by larger pharmas  especially when the small cap company has former executives from large cap companies with significant insider ownership  Often times these former top executives help engage acquisition discussion as they are well  connected  with their former companies    Abbot might very well be interested in acquiring GTx if the upcoming data release is positive  Prolar Biotech  PBTH  is a recent example of a company being bought out by an insider with a large stake in the company  Opko Health  OPK  CEO Dr  Phillip Frost owned about 20  of PBTH at the time and on April 24  2013 Opko Health announced that it would be  The level of insider ownership in GTx is also similar to that of OPK  which has insiders holding 55 35  of the shares  Dr  Frost continually bought shares before the stock ran from  4 50 to  7 50  Charts and Indicators   From the above daily 50 day chart  we can see that GTXI is gaining interest as the catalyst approaches  The chart had a classic  flagging  continuation pattern  in which share price falls slightly and consolidates before the next run  Using the Fibonacci Retracement indicator  we can see that the stock retraced between the 38 2  and 50  levels and has began its next wave run  In terms of timing  this could indicate that we start to see a higher push very soon  In addition  the 20 day simple moving average crossed up through the 50 day simple moving average  This is a bullish sign for the intermediate term  as it signals that the stock might be ready for another run  From a volume standpoint  we can see from the pink average volume line that investors have begun to take their positions for the upcoming months  Looking at the indicators from the same time frame  we can see bullish sentiment going forward  The Relative Strength Index is in a general uptrend  still has a bullish reading on the scale  and is below the 70  overbought  reading  The accumulation distribution line made a vicious reversal from lows on April 15 and is now in a nice uptrend as well  The Money Flow Index also shows nearly the same trend as the RSI  indicating bullish sentiment going forward as well  With combined factors considered  GTx could have a run similar to that of Array BioPharma  ARRY   which ran from about  4 00 in mid March to about  6 20 at the end of April  Array BioPharma develops small molecule drugs to treat patients with cancer and is partnered with Novartis  NVS   InterMune  ITMN   and AstraZeneca  AZN   Array is expecting results this summer for its   Conclusion  GTXI should see a significant run in the next coming months  as investors anticipate date release from its Phase III trials  The company s strong cash position  heavy insider interest  and bullish chart are indicators of this  If GTx produces positive data here  investors will be significantly rewarded as the drugs associated with the data address large unmet need markets  My short term price target is  6 25 per share  Before data release  my target is  7  and on a good data release  I believe GXTI can reach  10 per share  Disclosure  I am long GTXI Disclaimer  This article is intended for informational and entertainment use

182527,404043,ABT,How Not to Get Big Pharma To Change Its Ways,opinion,Earlier this week the Justice Department announced a  3 billion settlement of criminal and civil charges against pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline  GSK    the largest pharmaceutical settlement in history   for improper marketing prescription drugs in the late 1990s to the mid 2000s The charges are deadly serious  Among other things  Glaxo was charged with promoting to kids under 18 an antidepressant approved only for adults  pushing two other antidepressants for unapproved purposes  including remedying sexual dysfunction  and  to further boost sales of prescription drugs  showering doctors with gifts  consulting contracts  speaking fees  even tickets to sporting events  3 billion may sound like a lot of money  but during these years Glaxo made  27 5 billion on these three antidepressants alone  according to IMS Health  a data research firm   so the penalty could almost be considered a cost of doing business  Besides  to the extent the penalty affects Glaxo s profits and its share price  the wrong people will be feeling the financial pain  Most of today s Glaxo shareholders bought into the company after the illegal profits were already built into the prices they paid for their shares Not a single executive has been charged   even though some charges against the company are criminal  Glaxo s current CEO came on board after all this happened  Glaxo has agreed to reclaim the bonuses of any executives who engaged in or supervised illegal behavior  but the company hasn t officially admitted to any wrongdoing   and without legal charges against any of executive it s impossible to know whether Glaxo will follow through The Glaxo case is the latest and biggest in a series of Justice Department prosecutions of Big Pharma for illegal marketing prescription drugs  In May  Abbott Laboratories settled for  1 6 billion over its wrongful marketing of an antipsychotic  And an agreement with Johnson   Johnson is said to be imminent over its marketing of another antipsychotic  which could result in a fine of as much as  2 billion The Department says the prosecutions are well worth the effort  By one estimate it s recovered more than  15 for every  1 it s spent But what s the point if the fines are small relative to the profits  if the wrong people are feeling the financial pinch  and if no executive is held accountable  The only way to get big companies like these to change their behavior is to make the individuals responsible feel the heat An even more basic issue is why the advertising and marketing of prescription drugs is allowed at all  when consumers can t buy them and shouldn t be influencing doctor s decisions anyway  Before 1997  the Food and Drug Administration banned such advertising on TV and radio  That ban should be resurrected Finally  there s no good reason why doctors should be allowed to accept any perks at all from companies whose drugs they write prescriptions for  It s an inherent conflict of interest  Codes of ethics that are supposed to limit such gifts obviously don t work  All perks should be banned  and doctors that accept them should be subject to potential loss of their license to practice ,2012-07-06,Robert B.

182530,404046,ABT,Short Squeeze   Speculation Could Push Onyx And Ligand Higher,opinion,When I last covered Onyx Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ONXX  on June 19th  the company was trading at a market capitalization of approximately  3 billion dollars ahead of a review of Kyprolis  carfilzomib  by the FDA s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee  ODAC   Anyone who read the article and was bold enough to get long in anticipation of a favorable vote by ODAC was rewarded with a 43  rally the next day based on the 11 0 vote in favor of approval  Onyx s business partner for Kyprolis  Ligand Pharmaceuticals  LGND   also saw a massive rally  about 28   over the next two trading days In the other article  I also mentioned the 11  of shorts that were likely betting on an unfavorable ODAC decision  The short interest is now down to about 9 3  of float  which still allows for big short squeeze potential after the recent FDA approval for carfilzomib in the treatment of multiple myeloma for patients who had failed two previous therapies The FDA decision  which was issued on July 20th  limits the downside of Onyx  and partner Ligand  due to the lack of alternatives in the treatment of multiple myeloma  There is also ever present takeover speculation for Onyx  which may grow now that Kyprolis has its approval in hand  We are expecting Bayer to be the buyer  if it happens  due to the existing partnership for the drug regorafenib between the companies  Regorafenib has also recently received FDA priority review designation  which establishes the PDUFA action date four months close  to October 2012 instead of February 2013  Multiple myeloma  which is a particularly nasty and fatal plasma cell cancer that is very rare  with about 1 4 cases per 100 000  has historically been very difficult  and unprofitable  to treat  This is why we are expecting Kyprolis to have great drug penetration rates and bring Onyx  and Ligand  some better financial figures when the drug gets brought into the market In addition to Kyprolis  Onyx has the   300 000 year oncology drug Nexavar which has been approved for the treatment of liver and kidney cancer in the US and EU  Onyx is working towards expansion of its clinical applications  with phase III trials still underway in thyroid and breast cancer   which provides more catalysts down the road for the company to grow in value Even after major jumps in ONXX and LGND following developments in Kyprolis  there could be some additional upside left in the near term for traders who are willing to wait for shorts to shake out of their positions  which seems quite likely   These companies are both beginning to enter the  profitability  zone  and the 5 9 million shares betting against ONXX and the 1 3 million short on LGND are likely stuck in the red hoping something goes wrong Speaking of Ligand Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ LGND   there was important news for the stock during Wednesday s session  Ligand announced that its partner GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK  has been granted priority review from the FDA for the supplemental new drug application for Promacta  to treat thrombocytopenia caused by the hepatitis C  HCV  virus  Thrombocytopenia is a shortage of platelet cells  which help with blood clotting and as biotech investors know  stocks tried to the treatment of hepatitis C have seen valuations increase dramatically during the past year given that the hepatitis epidemic continues to spread The bullish Hepatitis space s activity  including moves from Gilead Sciences  Inc   NASDAQ GILD  paying  11 billion in cash for Pharmasset and Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  snagging Inhibitex for  2 5 billion in cash  The strong volatility seen for hepatitis c players Idenix Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ IDIX  Achillion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ACHN   Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  and Merck   Co   NYSE MRK  is understandable given the suspected infection cases in more than 5 million people in the United States  and perhaps as many as 200 million around the world This priority review designation is given to drugs that if approved  offer major advances in treatment  or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists  Under the Prescription Drugs User Fee Act  the goal for completing a Priority Review is six months Recently  Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated a Buy rating on LGND and raised its price target from  19 to  24  It will be interesting to see if that firm increases their price target on the stock given the latest developments Earlier the same day  the firm had announced that it plans to report second quarter 2012 financial results on Wednesday  August 8  2012  Recently  Ligand  reaffirmed fiscal 2012 revenue guidance to be approximately  30 million and we know that one of Ligand s core goals is to produce a bottom line that supports a sustainably profitable business Technically speaking  LGND shares have a real opportunity to break past some resistance that has kept prices in check lately  As followers of the stock point out  the shares appear poised to say goodbye to the teens  but the  18 to  18 15 mark has proven tough to break through  It has withstood some positive news events  but is worth watching because the stronger the resistance  the greater the reaction when the resistance is crossed  In turn  that resistance usually becomes strong support All of these factors makes us particularly bullish about LGND in the short and long term ,2012-07-29,Myriad

182554,404070,ABT,DCF Model Confirms,opinion,RECOMMENDATION  Reiterate  STRONG BUY    MINIMUM PT   1 01  58  upside   Just yesterday  Gould Partners  investor to aggressively buy shares in      This bullish call was reiterated by other analysts and now  in our view  confirmed by favorable business momentum   The developer of lab sample equipment recently entered into a JV agreement with Sage N Research to create software for Pressure BioSciences  innovative pressure cycling technology  PCT   This news comes off of two other favorable announcements  namely that  1  the company is ramping up its distributors and  2  partnering with the Henry C  Lee Institute of Forensic Sciences to evaluate PCT  We view  2  as putting the company into play  since  around 3 weeks ago  Abbott Labs    entered into an agreement with the University of North Texas Science Center to evaluate a forensic solution  Scientists at the University of North Texas and Florida International University have already expressed how PCT has helped them improve DNA yields  And more than 100 independent publications have backed this positive consensus  As Pressure BioSciences begins to aggressively commercialize operations through increasing marketing staff  international distributors  and partnerships  it is well positioned to surge in value  A discounted cash flow analysis of the stock demonstrates that Pressure BioSciences is on the verge of heading skyward  It is only a matter of time before investors pick up on the fundamentals The company finished 2010 with  1 34M in revenue  In the second half of 2011  the top line spiked 66  off of the first half  Fourth quarter consumable sales were up 77  sequentially  Despite these impressive figures  for the sake of being safe  Gould Partners conservatively models a 12 8  per annum growth rate in revenue over the next six years  This projection is in line with consensus expectations for peer company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc  TMO   But  since Thermo Fisher has a much larger base to grow off of  our projection significantly understates PBIO s potential Cost of goods sold has also fallen drastically over the last reported three years  from 47 1  of revenue in 2008 to 28 4  in 2010  We expect this figure to trend from 25  to 20  over the next six years as R D hovers around 6  to 1   and SG A holds steady at 27  We then factor in taxes  net increases in working capital  and debt while adjusting for depreciation  Taking a perpetual growth rate of 2 5  and discounting backwards by an overly high rate of 15   our bearish price target for PBIO is  1 01  This implies 58  upside  As noted above  this calculation is overly reserved on revenue projections and the discount rate  Reason thus calls for a  strong buy  recommendation With the stock trading 10  book value  we believe firms like Abbott and Thermo Fisher are most likely considering a takeover  Pressure BioSciences already has over 150 customers under its belt  demonstrated the efficacy of its products  and proven supportive demand  Access to a wider client base would significantly catalyze revenue  If an outright buyout does not emerge  we anticipate the firm to receive multiple partnership requests  It should be noted that these partnerships could  in turn  develop into an acquisition With  910K capital backing from leading federal agencies  ie  NIH and DoD  in 2011  a strong IP profile  critical diversification in three different markets  ie  mass spectrometry  forensics  histology   and industry acclaim  PBIO may very well be the hottest stock of 2012 This is a company that  again  we see  at a minimum  yielding double digit returns  When the Street picks up on all of this  and we hope to alert professionals   understand that this stock is heading up DISCLAIMER  The distributor of this research report    is not a licensed investment adviser or broker dealer  Investors are cautioned to perform their own due diligence as information contained within this report has been derived from public sources and cannot be guaranteed by us to be fully accurate  We are a consultant to a third party EAG  representing Pressure BioSciences and have received one thousand dollars for independent research  Always discuss investments with a licensed professional before making any financial decision  Statements made herein are often  forward looking statements  as stipulated under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933  Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934  and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  Since these statements are uncertain  actual results may be materially different from those expected ,2012-03-26,Takeover Analyst,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dcf-model-confirms-118141,118141

182556,404072,ABT,Best And Worst Sector ETFs  And Mutual Funds ,opinion,The best ETFs and mutual funds have high quality holdings and low costs  There are few funds that have both good holdings and low costs  There are lots of cheap funds  but there are too few funds with high quality holdings    I think there are at least two causes for this disconnect  First  there is  in general  a lack of independent research on ETFs and funds  Second  I think it is fair to say that there is a severe lack of quality research into the holdings of mutual funds and ETFs  There should not be such a large gap between the quality of research on stocks and funds  which are simply groups of stocks    After all  investors should care more about the quality of a fund s holdings than its costs because the quality of a fund s holdings is the single most important factor in determining its future performance    The following is a summary of my top picks and pans for all sector funds  I will follow this summary with a detailed report on each sector    Figures 1 shows the best ETF or mutual fund in each sector as of April 13  2012    For a full list of all ETFs and mutual funds for each sector ranked from best to worst  see my free     Figure 1  Best ETF or Mutual Fund by Sector Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsOnly one sector fund gets my Very Attractive rating  Health Care Select Sector SPDR  XLV   Over 30  of this fund is allocated to Very Attractive stocks  including Merck   Co   Inc   MRK  and Abbott Laboratories  ABT   Another 35   is allocated to Attractive stocks  About 28  is in Neutral stocks while less than 3  is in Dangerous or worse rated stocks One of the fund s top holding is MRK  With positive and rising economic earnings and a valuation that implies at permanent 10  decline in profits  MRK offers teriffic risk reward Figure 2 shows the worst ETF or mutual fund for each sector as of April 13  2012 Dangerous or worse rated funds have a combination of low quality portfolios  i e  they hold too many Dangerous or worse rated stocks  and high costs  they charge investors too much for the  lack of  management they provide  Figure 2  Worst ETF or Mutual Fund by SectorSource New Constructs  LLC and company filings   Fidelity Advisors Series VII  Fidelity Advisor Biotechnology Fund  FBTAX  is the worst health care fund and gets my Very Dangerous rating  The Portfolio Management rating for this fund is Dangerous and the Total Annual Cost Rating is Dangerous  resulting in a lose lose value proposition for investors  The managers at FBTAX have a lot of nerve charging an investor over 8  per year over 3 years    One of my least favorite stocks in this fund is SIGA Technologies  Inc   SIGA   It gets my Very Dangerous rating because of misleading earnings and an expensive valuation  The company s ROIC is     28   well below its cost of capital  To justify its valuation  the stock at  3 implies the company will grow its profits at 50  compounded annually for 15 years  Good luck    Traditional mutual fund research has focused on past performance and low management costs  The quality of a fund s holdings has been ignored  Our Portfolio Management Rating examines the fund s holdings in detail and takes into account the fund s allocation to cash  Our models are created with data from over 50 000 annual reports  This kind of due diligence is necessary for understanding just what you are buying when you invest in a mutual fund or an ETF    Figure 3 shows the best ETF or mutual fund based on our Portfolio Management Rating for each sector as of April 13  2012    Attractive or better rated funds own high quality stocks and hold very little of the fund s assets in cash   investors looking to hold cash can do so themselves without paying management fees  Only 2  of funds receive our Attractive or Very Attractive Portfolio Management ratings  so investors need to be cautious when selecting a mutual fund or ETF   there are thousands of Neutral or worse rated funds    Figure 3  ETF or Mutual Fund With Highest Quality Holdings by Sector  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsFigure 4 shows the worst ETF or mutual fund based on our Portfolio Management Rating for each sector as of April 13  2012 Even ignoring costs  many ETFs and mutual fund do a poor job investing money for their clients  These funds are not worth owning at any cost Figure 4  ETF or Mutual Fund With Lowest Quality Holdings by Sector Source   New Constructs  LLC and company filings   Investors should care about all of the fees assocated with a fund in addition to the quality of the fund s holdings  The best ETFs and mutual funds have both low costs and quality holdings   and there are plenty of low cost funds available to investors    Figures 5 shows the best ETF or mutual fund in each sector according to our Total Annual Costs Rating    Total Annual Costs incorporates all expenses  loads  fees  and transaction costs into a single value that is comparable across all ETFs and mutual funds  Passively managed ETFs and index mutual funds are generally the cheapest funds    Figure 5  ETF or Mutual Fund With Lowest Costs by Sector  Source   New Constructs  LLC and company filings   The most expense fund for each sector has a Very Dangerous Total Annual Costs Rating  Guggenheim Investments Electronics Fund   RYELX   the most expensive Industrials mutual fund  charges investors a Total Annual Cost of 7 7   Investors should avoid these funds and other funds with a Very Dangerous Total Annual Costs Ratings because they charge investors too much  For every fund with a Very Dangerous Total Annual Costs Rating there is an alternative fund that offers similar exposure and holdings at a lower cost  Investors have plenty of alternatives to these over priced funds    Figures 6 shows the worst fund in each sector according to our Total Annual Costs Rating    Figure 6  ETF or Mutual Fund With Highest Costs by Sector  Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsDisclosure  I receive no compensation to write about any specific stock  sector or theme ,2012-04-18,David
