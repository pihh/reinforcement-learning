107079,328594,ITT,ITT announces plans to lay off 270 employees amid low oil prices,news,"Investing com    ITT Corporation  NYSE ITT  said on Friday afternoon that it expects to lay off roughly 270 employees in the coming months in response to persistently weak energy prices 
In an 8 K filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   the company said it has finalized several restructuring actions in order to reduce the overall cost structure of the business  stemming from the  negative impact of weak oil and gas prices  on expenditures for its customers  As a result  ITT expects to incur pre tax cash costs of  12 to  13 million primarily in severance payments  relating to the restructuring plan  On a long term basis  ITT anticipates to realize annual pre tax cash savings of roughly  19 million from the initiative 
Last month  ITT said adjusted organic revenue fell by 2 5  over the first quarter  while its adjusted segment operating income dropped by 10  over the prior 12 months  due in part to the negative impacts from unfavorable foreign exchange translation 
On a GAAP basis  however  the White Plains  New York based technology solutions company saw its revenue increase 3 5  to  609 million  In addition  ITT reported flat EPS of 0 42  reflecting the impact of the company s acquisition of Wolverine Advanced Materials and Hartzell Aerospace 
 In the first quarter  ITT continued to confront a challenging macroeconomic environment that presented headwinds across a number of areas  including foreign exchange and the oil and gas and mining markets  For ITT  we realized the benefits of our balanced and diverse portfolio as the market headwinds we faced were offset by solid revenue growth in key global transportation markets  We also continued to drive an intense focus on corporate cost containment   ITT CEO Denise Ramos said at the time  ITT expects to complete the restructuring plan before the end of the year 
Shares in ITT inched down 0 01 or 0 03  to 32 84 in after hours  ITT closed the regular session at 32 84  down 3 51 or 9 65  ",2016-06-24,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/itt-announces-plans-to-lay-off-270-employees-amid-low-oil-prices-410575,410575

107179,328694,ITT,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Crane  CR  Stock For Now,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Crane Co    NYSE CR   on Jan 8  A well diversified business portfolio  synergistic benefits from acquired assets and priorities of rewarding shareholders handsomely will prove advantageous for the company  However  headwinds related to regulatory compliances  industry competition and segmental weakness might restrict its growth momentum in the near term Crane currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  5 4 billion The company s financial performance was better than expected in the last four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 3 40   The stock s Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  5 00 for 2018  representing growth of 1 cent from the tally 60 days ago Also  market sentiments have been positive with the stock yielding 13 1  return in the last three months  This gain is above 0 3  decline of the it belongs to Below we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring CraneBusiness Diversification a Boon  Crane serves customers in various end markets like aerospace  electronics  hydrocarbon processing  petrochemical  chemical  power generation  automated merchandising  transportation and other markets  Such diversification prevents the company from losses in the event of loss of business from any particular customer  Furthermore  international diversity has played a major role in Crane s profitability over time  The company primarily operates in North America  South America  Europe  the Middle East  Asia and Australia The company businesses are carried out through four reportable segments   Fluid Handling  Payment   Merchandising Technologies  Aerospace   Electronics and Engineered Materials  The company anticipates increase in demand for productivity solutions in Payment   Merchandising Technologies segment  high growth programs in Aerospace   Electronics  recovering of orders in Fluid Handling and strengthening of end markets in Engineered Materials in the long run  Average organic growth will be at least 2 4  for Fluid Handling  3 5  for Payment   Merchandising Technologies  3 5  for Aerospace   Electronics  and equal to GDP growth for Engineered Materials Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities  Acquired assets have over time helped Crane leverage benefits from easy penetration into unexplored markets and expanded product offerings  In this regard  the acquisition of Westlock Controls   specializing in manufacturing and distribution of switchboxes  position transmitters and other solutions for use in networking  monitoring and controlling process valves   in May is worth mentioning In addition  in December  it agreed to acquire Crane Currency  which designs and manufactures secure and highly engineered banknotes as well as engages in substrates manufacturing and providing advanced micro optic security technology to its customers  This buyout  when completed  will strengthen the company s foothold in the currency and payments market as well as add roughly 15 cents to earnings per share in the first year post completion  This accretion is projected to increase to  1 by 2021  Further  the company believes that this transaction will enable it to grow its earnings per share by more than 10  in the years ahead Shareholders  Return and Promising Guidance  Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for Crane  In the first nine months of 2017  the company paid dividends totaling  58 8 million and repurchased shares worth  25 million  Over the long term  the company targets achieving a total payout ratio of 40 50  For 2017  Crane anticipates adjusted earnings guidance to be  4 45  4 55 per share  It predicts 2018 earnings  excluding the impact of Crane Currency buyout  to be within the  4 85  5 05 per share range  Core sales are estimated to increase in the 2 4  range Over the long run  the company aims at achieving 10  average annual earnings per share growth  Free cash flow conversion will likely be 100  or more of net income Factors Working Against CranePoor Valuation   Fourth Quarter Weakness  On a P E  TTM  basis  Crane s shares look overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 20 9x and 19 5x in the last three months  Also  the stock is trading above the median of last three months P E multiples of 19 3x  This makes us cautious on the stock The company predicts sequentially lower sales in Fluid Handling and Payment and Merchandising Technologies segments in the fourth quarter  Also  the ebbing impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements is predicted to be offset by higher commodity and input costs Threat From Domestic Compliances and International Expansion  Crane has to comply with many governmental regulations in its homeland

Aerospace Business  A Catalyst
Of late  ITT s Control Technologies  which manages some of the company s leading brands like Enidine  Turn Act and Aerospace Controls  has been benefiting from favorable conditions in the aerospace and defense markets  This business segment is on a constant lookout to elevate its position in the infrastructure  energy  automation and aerospace markets 
Currently  this segment is focusing on expanding in the higher margin aftermarket business by concentrating on low cost technological solutions  It is steadily shifting several of its product lines to a low cost region to optimize cost structure  We perceive that innovative technology  diligent restructuring efforts and favorable market trends will be conducive to the top line performance of  Control Technologies  going forward 
Macroeconomic Headwinds Thwarting Prospects

107193,328708,ITT,ITT Corp   ITT  Q3 Earnings Meet  Stock Hit By Guidance Cut,opinion,"ITT Corp    NYSE ITT   posted adjusted earnings of 58 cents per share in third quarter 2016  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the figure was down 7 9  from the year ago tally of 63 cents 
The company s dismal earnings performance as well as downward revision in full year 2016 guidance miffed investors  sending share prices down by 2 7  to  33 26 on Friday 
The bottom line decline is largely attributable to higher tax rate and foreign currency headwinds  Moreover  tepid sales proved to be a drag 
Inside the Headlines
ITT Corp  s third quarter revenues came in at  581 7  down 3 4  on a year over year basis  However  the metric came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  While contributions from the previously acquired Germany based advanced material manufacturer   Wolverine   proved beneficial  persistent weakness in the oil and gas sector  chemical   industrial and mining markets played spoilsport  Moreover  currency fluctuations and unfavorable soft short cycle pump activities also added to the company s challenges 
On an adjusted basis  organic revenues decreased 10  year over year due to project declines and softness in short cycle pumps 
Segment wise  Industrial Process revenues plunged 27 9  year over year to  195 0 million  Challenging conditions in the oil   gas sector  mining  chemical   industrial markets  as well as softness in short cycle pumps and aftermarket businesses  weighed down the sales performance of this segment  Also  currency fluctuations compounded the fall 
Revenues at the Interconnect Solutions segment were down 5 1  year over year to  78 6 million  Sluggish oil and gas markets  along with currency fluctuations proved to be a drag on the segment s performance 
Control Technologies revenues inched up 1  to  70 5 million on a year over year basis  This segment primarily benefited from impressive performance of the industrial energy absorption markets  
Motion Technologies revenues surged 32 7  year over year to  238 7 million on the back of significant share gains and market growth from stellar sales of automotive brake pads to both OEM and aftermarket customers  Also  the Wolverine buyout proved conducive to the sales growth of this segment 
ITT Corp  s adjusted segment operating income declined about 19 4  year over year to  72 8 million  mainly hit by lower pump volumes  pricing headwinds and lackluster profitability on complex projects at Industrial Process 
Axtone Acquisition
Concurrent with the earnings release  ITT Corp  announced that it has entered into an agreement to buy engineered and customized components manufacturer   Axtone   which provides components for railway and other harsh environment industrial markets  The transaction represents a cash consideration of approximately  118 million that will be primarily funded from the ITT Corp  s foreign cash  This buyout is expected to be completed in first quarter 2017 after meeting customary closing conditions 
Headquartered in Kanczuga  Poland  Axtone projects to generate 2016 revenues of approximately  80 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately  14 million  ITT Corp  believes that this acquisition will be complimentary to its KONI brand  This  in turn  will fortify its foothold in the transportation industry   including railway  aerospace and automotive 
Precisely  this strategic buyout will boost ITT Corp  s thriving Motion Technologies business and aid it gain a higher share in profitable aftermarkets  ITT expects the deal to be accretive to its earnings in the first full year of operations after its conclusion ITT INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Liquidity and Cash Flow
As of Sep 30  2016  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  475 8 million  up from  433 3 million at end of Jun 30  2016 
For the nine month period ended Sep 30  2016  net cash from operating activities totaled  146 7 million compared with  147 1 million in the year ago period 
Share Repurchase
Year to date  the company has executed share repurchases of  70 million 
Guides Down
Concurrent with the third quarter earnings release  ITT Corp  lowered its top  and bottom line guidance  The company currently projects adjusted EPS in the range of  2 20  2 30  instead of the earlier guidance of  2 34  2 46  The downcast outlook is a result of lower project profitability and unfavorable foreign exchange at Industrial Process  Also  a higher tax rate is likely to have an adverse effect on the adjusted EPS 
In addition  the company expects GAAP revenue decline for 2016 in the range of 5 6  as against the previous guidance of 3 5   Also  organic revenue decline is estimated to be in the range of 9 10   compared with the earlier guided range of 7 9   The downward revision of revenue guidance is attributable to lower short cycle pump and project activity across all key end markets 
To Conclude
Prolonged weakness in the oil and gas sector as well as chemical and mining markets has taken a toll on ITT Corp  s financial performance over the past few quarters  Based on unfavorable oil price movements  the company anticipates decline in revenues of oil and gas segments in 2016  As upstream oil projects are the most vulnerable to decline in oil and gas prices  the company forecasts sharp revenue decline  Also  project delays lower capital expenditure on part of clients  high cost of projects and pricing pressures are adding to the ITT Corp  s challenges 
Decline in short cycle upstream oil and gas connector business is expected to aggravate slowdown in the upstream business  Moreover  an anticipated softness in midstream and downstream markets due to delayed project activity  pricing pressure and overall market uncertainty add to the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s concerns 
Despite these challenges  ITT Corp  has been diligently following its restructuring actions since the commencement of the market downturn  which has led to tangible productivity improvements  of late  The company s transportation business is reaping significant benefits of these restructuring actions  We believe that these actions  along with effective capital deployment and risk mitigation strategies will assist the company steer past some of these headwinds

107219,328734,ITT,These 3 Soon To Be Public  Spin Off Stocks Could Pay Huge Dividends,opinion,Last year was a record year for spin offs  with deals worth an estimated  116 billion completed  There are even more expected in 2012    Spin offs occur when companies want to shed units that are performing poorly  undervalued or unrelated to the main business  Instead of selling to a rival  companies can make a tax free distribution of the business to investors that often increase shareholder value  In return  the newly spun off company is often able to innovate and grow  leading to better returns for shareholders    Unlike IPOs  which get lots of media attention  spin offs often fly under the radar  This means investors can buy shares before the spin off is well known and often lock in above average yields    A case in point is Exelis  NYSE  XLS   This  6 billion defense business was spun off from ITT Corp  NYSE  ITT  last year  Exelis hit the ground running in 2011 by delivering 12  growth to  5 4 billion in funded orders and free cash flow of  489 million  Exelis shares currently yield 3 6  and have a 23  payout that provides very comfortable dividend coverage    Several big deals were announced last year that will close this year  Here are three spin offs that should appeal to dividend investors      1       Abbott Laboratories  NYSE  ABT  Yield  3 4  Abbott plans to spin off its  18 billion research based pharmaceutical operations from its more stable  22 billion medical products business  The parent company  which will sell nutritional products  branded generic drugs  medical devices and diagnostic products  will keep the 124 year old Abbott name  The spin off  which has been named Abbvie  gets to keep a top selling arthritis drug  Humira  which has almost  9 billion in projected sales  as well as drugs like Lupron  for prostate cancer and Synagis for respiratory disease    Investors were worried about Abbvie s growth prospects because the patent on Humira expires in 2016  but these fears have eased since the company launched a promising new arthritis drug in February and advanced a new Hepatitis C treatment in clinical trials  Abbott is on track to complete the spin off by year end    Abbott has a 22 year history of dividend growth  The last increase was 9  last May to a  1 92 annual rate  The company is guiding for 2012 earnings that will exceed  5 00 a share and provide better than two fold coverage of the dividend  Both Abbott and Abbvie will pay a dividend  with payout being split between the two spin offs  2       ConocoPhillips  NYSE  COP  Yield  3 6  ConocoPhillips is spinning off its refining   marketing business as Phillips 66  an already well known brand  Shares of Phillips 66  NYSE  PSX  will be distributed on April 30th  with current shareholders receiving one share of Phillips 66 for every two shares of ConocoPhillips currently owned    ConocoPhillips has long been a favorite of dividend investors for its 13  yearly dividend growth and yields that have consistently exceeded 3  in the last five years    Going forward  the company intends to pay out 20  25  of cash flow as dividends every year  That means dividends may rise to  4 billion this year from  3 6 billion last year  ConocoPhillips also plans to make  10 billion in share repurchases  which will reduce the share count and further enhance dividend growth per share      Phillips 66 has a similar commitment to dividend growth  This company will pay a  0 80 annual dividend and plans to grow payments by 5  a year  The initial dividend is roughly 20  of Phillip s annual cash flow and very affordable  Phillips shares began trading in mid April in a  35  36 price range and have a 2 3  yield    3  Sara Lee Corp   NYSE  SLE  Yield  2 1  plus special  3 00 dividend   Sara Lee is splitting into two companies and will pay a special  3 00 dividend to shareholders in June  Shares currently trade near  21  so the special dividend will deliver a 14  yield  Sara Lee also plans to continue paying a  0 46 annualized dividend that currently yields 2 1     One company will retain the Sara Lee name and consist of the North American packaged food and meats business  The second company  named D E  Master Blenders  will operate the international coffee  tea and beverages business  Sara Lee is a classic example of the individual pieces being worth more than the package and a spin off being done to unlock hidden value  Analysts peg the break up value of the packaged food business at  7 a share and the coffee business at  16 a share  Include the  3 dividend and that s a  26 value for the spin off  Shares currently trade for less than  22    D E  Master Blenders will trade on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Amsterdam  The business generated operating income  before corporate overhead  of  452 million last year  and analysts think the stand alone business will easily produce more than  380 million of income this year    D E  Master Blenders and Sara Lee will pay dividends and have investment grade credit ratings  Sara Lee has a 65 year track record of paying dividends  but recent dividend growth has been weak at just 1  a year    Risks to consider  ConocoPhillips bases its income projections on  flat  gas prices and in the short term will be partially funding the dividend from cash on hand and asset sales  This limits future flexibility and means a dip in oil prices could hurt the dividend  In addition  while both Sara Lee businesses will pay a dividend  the company hasn t disclosed initial rates  payout targets or dividend growth policy    My top pick is ConocoPhillips because of the company s excellent dividend track record and transparent plan for future dividend growth  Abbott is also a strong choice for dividend investors who want a safe payout and steady growth  Sara Lee is appealing as a value play with modest income growth by Lisa
