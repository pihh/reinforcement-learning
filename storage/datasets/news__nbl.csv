3651,225166,NBL,Noble Energy  NBL  Reports Q3 Loss  Lags Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Noble Energy  NBL  came out with a quarterly loss of  0 10 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 11  This compares to earnings of  0 27 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9 09   A quarter ago  it was expected that this oil and gas company would post a loss of  0 13 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 10  delivering a surprise of 23 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Noble  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  posted revenues of  1 12 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 25   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 27 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Noble shares have added about 11 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 22 7  
What s Next for Noble 
While Noble has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Noble was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is   0 08 on  1 16 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and   0 38 on  4 37 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States is currently in the bottom 40  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/noble-energy-nbl-reports-q3-loss-lags-revenue-estimates-200483346,200483346

Note  This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger  Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas 
Holmes  I bought shares of  Noble Energy  Corp  NYSE NBL  on October 1st  How do you feel about that trade 




Blue Harbinger  It s an energy E P company  Holmes  It trades with a pretty high correlation to oil prices  And the entire energy sector has been out of favor this year  as we saw in the earlier energy ETF chart  Why d you buy it 
Holmes  I purchased for technical reasons  Specifically  I am a dip buyer  and I like to buy attractive pullbacks  as you can see in the chart above 
BH  I see the pullback you re talking about  and it looks attractive so long as you believe the fundamentals are sound and oil isn t going permanently out of style 




Holmes  Wrong and wrong again  You re wrong twice  As a technical trader  with a holding period typically around 6 weeks  I don t care too much about long term fundamentals or the long term price of oil  I ll be out of this trade long before the long term  Why  Do you think carbon based energy is going permanently out of style 
BH  Probably not in my lifetime  And for the record  I do care about fundamentals and the price of oil  I think Noble is interesting at these levels  but I also like other energy stocks too  such as  BP   LON BP  and Shell  LON RDSa   as I recently wrote about  and   I guess I am a bit of a dip buyer too  Anyway  thanks for sharing this trade  Holmes 
Road Runner  Interesting discussion guys  I recently purchased shares of Atlassian Corp  NASDAQ TEAM  on 9 30  Any comments or questions 




BH  Why d you buy  Atlassian is an workflow management software company  And if you recall from earlier in this report  software stocks have been out of favor with the market lately  Are you also a dip buyer 
RR  I like to buy attractive momentum stocks in the lower end of a rising channel  as you can see in the following chart 




BH  Ok  It seems the dip that you bought has only lasted about month  and it exists within a rising channel  
RR  That s correct  There are a lot more data points that go into each trade  But essentially  yes you got it 
BH  Okay  I think that s a decent trade  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Athena any trades to share this week 
Athena  I bought shares of Tandem Diabetes  NASDAQ TNDM  on October 1st 




BB  That s a healthcare stock  they make diabetes equipment   and healthcare stocks have been out of style this year  Are you betting on a rebound 
Athena  I look for stocks having strong positive trends and then select only those with the very strongest trends   king of the hill    constantly replacing the ones with weaker trends  It should not surprise anyone that I bought Tandem  A quick look at the chart should make the strength of the trend fairly obvious  And I generally continue to hold my positions until either the strength of the trend abates or a stock with an even higher trend strength comes along  I don t have a set  holding period  for a position  I will exit only when either a stronger stock comes along or if market conditions dictate a strong potential for loss   capital preservation remains the key driver in all situations 
BH  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Emerald Bay  What out of style stock did you buy recently 
Emerald Bay  I bought shares of Vulcan Materials  VMC  way back on July 10th  And it s not out of style at all  It s a construction materials company 




BH  Wow  that s quite a trend line  It looks like these shares have been rising steadily in a very tight channel for months before and after you purchased 
EB  I seek exposure to the highest momentum names in our large cap equity universe  adjusted for volatility  Specifically  I like to base my position sizes on volatility with more capital invested in the less volatile stocks 
BH  You ve been doing quite well with this position  And that sounds like quite an interesting and attractive strategy  Thank you for sharing 
Conclusion
The market doesn t necessarily repeat itself  but it does rhyme as it rotates through market cycles  And sometimes  it s better to buy in anticipation of the future rotation instead of based exclusively on what happened in the past  The challenge is knowing when the big market rotations are coming  and how much longer you can ride the current trends  Disciplined yet malleable strategies can help you navigate the rotations  Have you been buying under performing energy and healthcare stocks  or are you sticking with momentum trades for now

BH  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Emerald Bay  What out of style stock did you buy recently 
Emerald Bay  I bought shares of Vulcan Materials  VMC  way back on July 10th  And it s not out of style at all  It s a construction materials company 




BH  Wow  that s quite a trend line  It looks like these shares have been rising steadily in a very tight channel for months before and after you purchased 
EB  I seek exposure to the highest momentum names in our large cap equity universe  adjusted for volatility  Specifically  I like to base my position sizes on volatility with more capital invested in the less volatile stocks 
BH  You ve been doing quite well with this position  And that sounds like quite an interesting and attractive strategy  Thank you for sharing

The market doesn t necessarily repeat itself  but it does rhyme as it rotates through market cycles  And sometimes  it s better to buy in anticipation of the future rotation instead of based exclusively on what happened in the past  The challenge is knowing when the big market rotations are coming  and how much longer you can ride the current trends  Disciplined yet malleable strategies can help you navigate the rotations  Have you been buying under performing energy and healthcare stocks  or are you sticking with momentum trades for now ",2019-10-08,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-exchange-these-styles-will-come-back-200471345,200471345

3659,225174,NBL,Noble Energy  NBL  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"Noble Energy  NBL  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  140 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 12 billion  down 11 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 100  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Noble 
For Noble  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  10 76  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Noble will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Noble would post a loss of  0 13 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 10  delivering a surprise of  23 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Noble appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/noble-energy-nbl-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release-200480923,200480923

191153,412669,NBL,Jordan parliament passes draft law to ban gas imports from Israel,news,"By Suleiman Al Khalidi
AMMAN  Reuters    Jordan s parliament on Sunday approved a draft law to ban imports of Israeli gas to the country just days after they started under a multibillion dollar deal struck in 2016 which is opposed by much of the population 
The motion was passed unanimously by Jordan s 130 lawmakers and will be referred to the cabinet to be made law  although legal hurdles may prevent it coming into force 
The government has previously said it was a deal between companies rather than a political matter 
The  10 billion supply deal was originally struck between Jordan s state owned utility and a U S  Israeli consortium led by Texas based  Noble Energy   NYSE NBL   to provide gas to the country s power plants for electricity generation 
It was not referred to parliament for approval 
Although U S  ally Jordan has a peace treaty with Israel the deal  which supplies Jordan for 15 years  has faced much popular opposition  with lawmakers arguing it makes the kingdom dependent on its neighbor for energy 
Many Jordanians are also the descendants of Palestinians who moved to the country after the creation of Israel in 1948  and view Israel as an erstwhile enemy that expelled their ancestors from their homes 
The Jordanian government said after the agreement was signed in 2016 that securing stable energy prices for the next decade could achieve annual savings of at least  500 million and help reduce a chronic budget deficit 
The import of Israeli gas has become a major focus in Jordan and sparked protests and calls for both the deal and the peace treaty to be scrapped 
 The gas of the enemy is an occupation  Down with the gas deal   placards carried by protesters said 
Jordan s ties with Israel have come under increasing strain since the gas deal was struck as Israel has moved to the right and since Donald Trump replaced Barack Obama as U S  president

191184,412700,NBL,Israel Egypt  15 Billion Deal Boosts Energy Hub Prospects,news," Bloomberg     A  15 billion deal to export Israeli gas to Egypt is moving forward after months of talks  bringing the Jewish state a step closer to becoming an energy exporter to the most populous Arab country 
 Noble Energy  Inc  NYSE NBL   and Delek Drilling LP said they plan to supply around 64 billion cubic meters of natural gas over 10 years to Egypt s Dolphinus Holdings Ltd  from Israel s Tamar and Leviathan reservoirs  Shares of Israeli gas companies soared the most in nine years on Monday  The deal needs regulatory and governmental approvals in Egypt and Israel 
The move could add an economic plum to a relationship that has focused on security since the two countries signed a peace accord that changed the face of Middle Eastern politics nearly four decades ago  Tavy Rosner  an analyst at London based  Barclays   LON BARC  Plc  said he expects more agreements to follow  including the sale of Israeli gas to Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc  which operates a liquefied natural gas plant in northern Egypt 
 This is the first time since signing the peace treaties in the Middle East that substantial export deals are struck between the countries   Israel Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said  The contract will  position Israel as a central player in the regional energy sector  
The deal with Egypt follows an agreement to sell gas to Jordan in 2016  Egypt  for its part  is trying to leverage the discovery of the giant Zohr field to attract investment and foreign currency  Egypt has idle liquefaction plants such as Shell s  making it a suitable location for a regional hub 
 This paves the way for further deals and cements Egypt as a regional energy hub   Yossi Abu  Delek Drilling s chief executive officer  said in a phone interview   This will be an engine for both the Egyptian and Israeli economies alike  We re proud to be part of this moment

Security Risks
Questions remain  including how Noble and Delek will transmit the gas to Egypt in a region rife with security risks  Egypt used to supply Israel with gas but the pipeline was sabotaged repeatedly by Islamist militants in the Sinai Desert 
Cairo had frozen talks on a gas deal after an international arbitration court ruled Egyptian companies must compensate Israeli electricity providers for that past deal  EMG  which operates the pipeline that used to bring Egyptian gas to Israel  also is seeking damages 
Executives at Dolphinus couldn t immediately be reached for comment  Egypt s oil ministry said it will take decisions that help it achieve its goal of becoming a regional gas hub  and that Egypt is keen to settle any disputes 
Egypt s oil ministry said in an emailed statement that receiving Israeli gas is one possible solution to the arbitration dispute between Egyptian and Israeli companies 
 Egypt is proceeding with its plan to achieve self sufficiency in natural gas by the year end and a surplus in 2019  and moving ahead with its strategy to become a regional hub for energy   the ministry said   This includes receiving gas from countries in the East Mediterranean  including Israel and Cyprus  
Cyprus Deal
Cyprus s energy minister said Tuesday the country is close to an agreement to sell natural gas to Egypt from its Aphrodite field 
The area from Cyprus to Lebanon and Egypt may contain additional gas riches  and countries in the region are eager to develop export plans  The United States Geological Survey estimates the area could hold more than 340 trillion cubic feet of gas  more than U S  proven reserves 
The emerging wealth is also threatening to spark conflict  Israel and Lebanon have traded threats in recent weeks as the two countries disagree about where their border should be 
It s not clear how the new deal fits into Egypt s plans to export gas from its giant Zohr field  Italy s Eni aims to pump 2 7 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Zohr by end 2019  Delek has said that even at full production Zohr won t be able to keep up with rising demand

Delek said it will begin talks with EMG over use of its pipeline  Another possibility could be to use an existing pipeline that connects the Israeli transmission system with the Jordanian one  they said

The cuts were steeper than expected  Analysts at Bernstein Energy had forecast an average 2016 spending cut for the sector of 38 percent 
The reductions show budgets may shrink more this year than they did last year  when spending fell between 20 percent and 50 percent  Output at some companies may fall for the first time ever 
 It s very rare to have spending decline two years in a row   said Mike Breard  oil company analyst with Hodges Capital Management in Dallas   Any budget you see published now is going to be much lower than last year  
But last year many operators managed to lift output as they devised new ways to coax more oil from rock  a feat that seems unlikely to be repeated 
In a sign that a reckoning has come  Continental admitted it will pump about 10 percent less oil this year as it can no longer afford or innovate and sell more oil at depressed prices 
The U S  government projects domestic crude output to fall by about 700 000 barrels per day  bpd  by the end of this year to around 8 5 million bpd 
Depressed spending typically means fewer drilling rigs  All three companies said they would cut the number of rigs boring new wells in U S  shale oil fields across Texas  North Dakota and elsewhere 
 If you cut your budget 60 percent  you may drill 40 percent fewer wells and your production is going to drop a considerable amount   said Breard 
Continental  North Dakota s second largest oil producer  said it would slash its 2016 capital budget by 66 percent  The company made the risky move of getting rid of hedges in the fall of 2014   L2N15A2MB  Led by billionaire wildcatter Harold Hamm  Continental plans to spend  920 million this year  down from  2 7 billion in 2015 
Oklahoma City based Continental said it will not become profitable until oil prices return to  37 per barrel  U S  oil prices closed Tuesday at  31 45 per barrel   
Meanwhile  New York based Hess plans to spend  2 4 billion in 2016  down 40 percent from  4 billion last year   L2N15A1U5 
Noble cut its quarterly dividend 44 percent and said it will cut spending about 50 percent this year   L2N15A2MJ 
On the other end of the spectrum  Pioneer Natural Resources  known for its aggressive hedging program  said this month it would spend between  2 4 billion and  2 6 billion this year 

Though Pioneer will fund its 2016 budget in part from a  500 million asset sale  the modest increase from  2 2 billion in 2015 makes the company a relative outlier at a time when most companies are trimming capex by amounts similar to last year s drastic cutbacks ",2016-01-27,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-shale-firms,-struggling-to-profit-with-$30-oil,-slash-spending-more-381889",381889
191234,412750,NBL,Israel s Netanyahu defends gas deal in rare Supreme Court visit,news,"By Steven Scheer JERUSALEM  Reuters    Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel s top court on Sunday the country must forge ahead with developing a large natural gas field  with billions of dollars worth of potential exports  for both economic and security reasons  In an unusual step for an Israeli prime minister  Netanyahu testified  at his own request  in the Supreme Court to defend a framework gas deal after opposition parties and non government organizations filed petitions to block plans to develop the Leviathan field off Israel s Mediterranean coast  Critics  including the anti trust authority  have argued that planned control of the country s gas reserves by one consortium will limit competition and keep prices high  Under the deal  Texas based  Noble Energy   N NBL  and Israel s Delek Group  which discovered Leviathan in 2010  would retain control of the field but are being forced to sell other  smaller assets such as the nearby Tamar field that began production in 2013  Netanyahu argued the blueprint provided major opportunities for Israel s foreign relations and that any delay in its implementation could lead to the deal s collapse and cause  long term significant damage  to the country s security and economy  Holding estimated reserves of 622 billion cubic meters  Leviathan will cost at least  6 billion to develop  It is meant to begin production by 2020 and supply billions of dollars worth of gas to Egypt and Jordan  and possibly Turkey and Europe  Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab states to have signed peace deals with Israel  Gas exports could help shore up ties between Israel and its neighbors to the east and south   There is no realistic alternative to the gas deal   Netanyahu said   If we reverse course  we will fall into the chasm once and for all   After years of political infighting Netanyahu signed a framework deal that gave long awaited approval for Leviathan s development  Netanyahu had defended the deal in an affidavit to the Supreme Court last week and requested appearing in front of the judges before they make their final  binding ruling   Last year  parliament narrowly approved the deal but the anti trust commissioner resigned in protest  The deal still needed anti trust approval or for the economy minister to sign a waiver to bypass the Anti Trust Authority  The minister  Aryeh Deri  refused and ultimately resigned and Netanyahu took over as economy minister  In December  he invoked a never before used clause in the anti trust law that allows for decisions of the Anti Trust Authority to be overridden in the name of security and international diplomacy  Last month  the Leviathan partners signed a deal to sell  1 3 billion of gas over 18 years to Edeltech Group and its Turkish partner Zorlu Enerji for power plants they plan to build in Israel   Other deals with Jordan and BG are pending while Israel is in talks with Greece and Cyprus to build a natural gas pipeline to Europe

191235,412751,NBL,Energy companies spend big to fight Colorado ballot initiatives,news,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON  Reuters    Energy companies in Colorado are spending millions of dollars to derail a push by environmentalists to put measures on November s ballot that would stifle oil and gas drilling in the state  according to a Reuters review of campaign finance records 
Environmental groups are now gathering signatures for two statewide initiatives that would transfer regulatory control of oil and gas development to local governments and create more stringent setback requirements to keep oil and gas activities away from occupied structures 
The state s Supreme Court this year struck down fracking bans approved by voters in the cities of Fort Collins and Longmont 
A study by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission  a state agency tasked with encouraging energy development  found that 90 percent of the surface acreage in Colorado would be unavailable for oil and gas development under the new setback laws  which would require all new development facilities to be 2 500 feet from occupied structures and areas of interest  such as parks 
In the last three months alone  energy companies including Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC    Noble Energy   NYSE NBL  and Whiting Petroleum  have together donated more than  6 7 million to Protect Colorado  a industry backed coalition fighting the initiatives  according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance disclosures 
The heavy spending comes despite a severe crash in oil and gas prices that has forced many energy companies to slash jobs  dividends and investments 
Opponents of the proposed ballot initiatives say they would have a calamitous impact on Colorado  which is the country s seventh largest oil and gas producing state  with vast untapped fields 
Anadarko Petroleum since early April has donated nearly  3 million to the group  bringing its total aggregate contribution to more than  4 million 
A spokesman for the company said the initiative would be  devastating for Colorado  
Noble Energy donated  2 5 million to Protect Colorado at the end of April  Noble said the initiatives would harm the economy and cause job losses  and reduce funds for schools and other public services 
In June  Bayswater Exploration and Production  DCP Midstream  an affiliate of Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   Synergy Resources Corp and Whiting Petroleum Corp gave a combined  785 000 to Protect Colorado  Independent producer PDC Energy has given more than  1 million to the organization since it registered as an issue committee in 2014 
The initiatives each need 98 492 signatures collected by Aug  8 to qualify for the November ballot 
Todd Ely  on the faculty of the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver  said there is no limit on donations the companies can make because the coalition formed around an issue 
 The outcome is critical to existing and future investments in Colorado and elsewhere  especially for a cyclical industry   he said 
Coloradans Resisting Extreme Energy Development  among the groups collecting signatures  declined to comment on the number gathered thus far  But Lisa Trope of Food   Water Watch said she was optimistic the measures would get on the ballot ",2016-07-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/energy-companies-spend-big-to-fight-colorado-ballot-initiatives-414475,414475

191254,412770,NBL,ANALYSIS Impact of Israel s natgas windfall to be limited,news,"By Tova Cohen
 TEL AVIV  Jan 19  Reuters    The discovery of large amounts
of natural gas in Israeli waters could boost the country s
economy for years but analysts say its future remains in high
tech rather than energy and it will have to keep importing fuel 
 A U S  Israeli exploration group led by Noble Energy said on
Sunday it had found more than 88 billion cubic metres  bcm  of
natural gas 90 km from the port of Haifa in northern Israel 
 That is three times more than a site off Israel s southern
coast  already in production  that is expected to be depleted
within five years 
 The group plans to carry out production tests and additional
verification drills in the next few months before making a final
decision on whether to go ahead with an investment expected to
reach  1 5 to  2 billion 
 While National Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer
called the discovery an  historic moment  for Israel  the
country will still need foreign sources of fuel  albeit at a
diminished rate 
  This is a very significant event  which will allow Israel
to reduce its dependency on natural gas imports and achieve
better energy security   Amit Mor  chief executive of energy and
environmental consulting and investment firm Eco Energy  told
Reuters 
  Nevertheless  it is important that Israel continue with its
plans to secure diversified sources of gas  Israel is not
turning into Saudi Arabia and people should not be euphoric  
 Mor said Israel should advance a project to procure
liquefied natural gas  LNG  and continue negotiations with BG
Group to buy gas from a field off the shore of Gaza 
 Analysts expect such a major discovery will encourage others
to explore the offshore Eastern Mediterranean rim 
 
 HIGH TECH STILL RULES
 Yedioth Ahronoth commentator Sever Plocker said the impact
of this discovery on Israel s trade balance is far less than the
effect of a new Intel chip plant in southern Israel  which
improved the balance of payments by  1 5 billion a year 
  High tech is Israel s oil and gas  it is our main source of
energy  Because of high tech we thrived and we need to continue
to invest in it   Plocker wrote in Monday s newspaper 
 The natural gas is estimated to be worth a total of  15 
billion to  16 billion over a 15 year period starting in 2013 
 Still   1 billion a year is about half a percent of Israel s
gross domestic product 
  It s nothing comparable to the high tech industry  no one
is thinking in those terms or even in terms of the chemicals
sector in Israel   said HSBC economist Jonathan Katz 
  But half a percent contribution per year over 15 years is
significant  We are talking of GDP growth for 2009 of 1 percent 
so another half percent is significant  
 The gas will reduce Israel s import bills  thereby improving
its balance of payments  and will be positive for the shekel 
  It s a nice little perk but nothing that will change the
fundamentals of the macro picture in Israel   Katz said 
 About 30 percent of Israel s electricity is now produced
from natural gas  with an aim of reaching 40 45 percent by 2020 
when about 5 10 percent will come from renewable energy  mainly
solar  and the rest from coal 
  Mor forecast that aggregate demand for gas in Israel from
2009 2030 will be 200 250 bcm  80 percent for power generation
and the rest for industrial and other users 
 Besides the natural gas from the country s south 
state owned Israel Electric Corp is buying 1 7 bcm a year from
Egypt under a 15 year contract with an option for five more
years at  2 75 per million British Thermal Units  well below a
price of  10 in Europe and  6  8 in the United States  Mor said 
 The gas is not flowing regularly  partly due to economic
reasons  Analysts say Israel s discovery will strengthen its
bargaining power if Egypt seeks to boost its gas prices

 By Greg Roumeliotis
 AMSTERDAM  Aug 19  Reuters    Dutch maritime engineering
group SBM Offshore reported a 12 percent rise in first half net
profit on stronger margins and said it was expecting new
contracts to boost its shrinking order book 
  Despite low order intake  bid activity has been high and
there are serious opportunities for securing new orders in the
second half of the year   Chief Executive Tony Mace said in a
statement on Wednesday 
 The group  which builds and operates floating production 
storage and offloading platforms  FPSOs  for oil companies  said
net profit rose to  95 5 million  compared with an average
forecast for  98 million in a Reuters poll in which estimates
ranged from  95  118 million 
 SBM repeated its forecast for net profit in the range of the
2008 result of  228 million  and that it was targeting two new
major orders in the second half of 2009 
 SBM s competitors include Italy s Saipem  Tokyo based Modec
 and Norway s Prosafe 
 Analysts at Petercam warned in a note that FPSO firms are
very eager to win contracts in the current market  and this
could have an impact on their bidding discipline 

 NEW PROJECTS
 Among the contracts the company is targeting in the next
twelve months are an FPSO project in Angola for BP Plc under a
 sell  structure  and another FPSO project for Noble Energy in
Equatorial Guinea under a lease 
 SBM will also bid for the full construction and
commissioning contract in the Gazprom led floating production
unit project for the Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea with
Aker Solutions and Technip  with which it has already won a
front end engineering study contract for the project 
 Other schemes that SBM is bidding for are a mooring system
and FSO unit for ExxonMobil in Indonesia and FPSO projects of
Petrobras in Brazil 
 The company also said it expected demand to pick up in the
mid  to long term as new oil and gas reservoirs are developed 
 As the availability of project finance becomes scarcer  SBM
will look to export credit funds and the capital markets for
alternatives  the company said 
 SBM s shares were up 4 percent at 13 94 euros at 1336 GMT 
outperforming the Amsterdam blue chip index which was down 1 05
percent 
  We are at a turning point for the business of SMB
Offshore   said SNS Securities analyst Danny van Doesburg   We
have had more than a year of negatives but with the oil price
higher and the economy improving we see offshore activity
picking up  
 SBM said its order book stood at  8 2 billion at the end of
June  down 13 7 percent from a year earlier  Revenue fell 4 1
percent to  1 43 billion in the first half  The firm expects
revenue for 2009 to come in at  2 9 billion 
 Due to its reliance on the banking market for its project
finance operations  the company saw its net financing costs in
the first half swell to  30 5 million from  23 million a year
earlier as loan margins increased  It said its 2009 net interest
charge is expected to be 50 percent higher than in 2008 
 The company has 17 lease FPSOs and 70 percent of its
cashflow is generated from long term leases  Van Doesburg noted

191274,412790,NBL,Earnings Preview  Noble Energy  NBL  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Noble Energy  NBL  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  175  
Revenues are expected to be  1 10 billion  down 8 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 55 56  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP

For Noble  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  8 41  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Noble will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Noble would post a loss of  0 11 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 10  delivering a surprise of  9 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Noble doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-noble-energy-nbl-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200504942,200504942

191332,412848,NBL,Analysts Estimate Noble Energy  NBL  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Noble Energy  NBL  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 12 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  65 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 17 billion  down 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 52 69  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Noble 
For Noble  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 12  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Noble will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Noble would post earnings of  0 16 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 27  delivering a surprise of  68 75  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

191347,412863,NBL,Apache Joins Strategic Alliance With EPIC   Noble Energy,opinion,"Apache Corporation   NYSE APA   recently agreed to participate in the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline  run by EPIC Midstream Holdings  LP  The strategic alliance also includes Noble Energy  Inc    NYSE NBL    The pipeline will connect southeastern New Mexico to Corpus Christi  TX and transport crude from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale  The under construction pipeline will help to clear the infrastructure bottleneck caused by excessive production in the Permian  resulting in lower prices 
The Strategic Alliance 
Being one of the largest acreage holders in the prolific Permian Basin  Houston  TX based Apache s commitment of 75 thousand barrels per day  MBbl d  in the pipeline is expected to secure the project s future  Noble Energy  headquartered in the same area  also secured 100 MBbl d in the pipeline  Per the agreement  Apache and Noble Energy hold an option of acquiring as far as 15  and 30  stake in the pipeline  respectively  These options can be exercised by the first three months of 2019 
Oil producers in the Permian Basin have recently seen their product price decline due to the increase in production  which overwhelmed the infrastructure that ships crudes to ports  The situation is alarming for the producers in the area  as their profit margin is threatened by the discounted crude prices  The strategic alliance thus gives Apache  as well as Noble Energy a chance to improve margins 
About the Pipeline 
The pipeline is expected to have an initial oil transport capacity of 590 thousand MBbl d  Around 74 6  of the total capacity will come from the Permian Basin while the rest from the Eagle Ford  The pipeline will have an option of upsizing to a 30 inch line that will further increase the shipping capacity from the Permian Basin to 675 MBbl d 
Incorporating Apache and Noble Energy s committed acreages  more than 500 000 acres were devoted to the pipeline and at least 10  of its total capacity is planned to be kept for uncommitted shippers 
The 730 mile crude pipeline will run beside EPIC s natural gas liquids pipeline  Construction of the pipeline is anticipated to start in the October December period of 2018 and it will come online in 2019 s second half  The EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline has the capital commitment support from funds managed by Ares Management  L P  s   NYSE ARES   Private Equity Group

What s Next for Noble 
While Noble has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

191403,412919,NBL,Shale Revolution Leads A New Oil Boom  MLPs Will Benefit,opinion,"In our recent blog   we described the success of America s shale producers in the face of OPEC s intention back in 2014 to bankrupt them with lower oil prices  The recent agreement on reductions in output was a concession that this strategy had failed  see    America s private sector had bested countries representing more than a third of global oil production 
The Permian Basin in West Texas represents this success more clearly than just about any other region in the U S  It chiefly consists of two areas  the Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin  with several plays within each region  The Permian has been a source of crude oil production in the U S  for decades  The first commercial oil well was completed there in 1921  As the Shale Revolution took hold over the last ten years  Permian output rose along with other plays  But such is the opportunity  combined with continued technological improvements in drilling  that output barely dipped in 2015 even while other shale regions saw cutbacks  Today  almost half the active drilling rigs in the U S  are in the Permian Basin  This is driven by the productivity of Permian wells  where production from new wells has more than tripled over the past three years 


The Energy Information Administration s  EIA  recent Annual Energy Outlook 2017 forecasts Permian crude production to increase by around 40  over the next five years based on current futures prices  If crude oil trends higher  the Permian holds the potential for significantly greater output than that 
The irony of this is not lost on an investor in Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs   We were originally led to expect stable income that grew steadily each year  The Shale Revolution added excitement and substantial upside to this originally rather pedestrian story  but also exposed the frailty of the more recent investor base  The bear market of 2015 was so clearly a problem of MLPs confronting growth opportunities whose capex needs exceeded their current cashflow 
The collapse in MLP prices led energy infrastructure businesses to achieve greater alignment between their funding and investment opportunities  Energy Independence  never previously attainable  came into view as a realistic goal within less than a generation  Adapting our existing energy infrastructure network to support this vision is creating substantial opportunities for today s leaders  Being an MLP investor today inevitably requires studying the markets for oil  Natural Gas Liquids  NGLs  and natural gas  Sales made by investors in late 2015 early 2016 will rank up there among the biggest missed opportunities of all time 
The Permian is now the target of a veritable land rush as some of the world s biggest oil companies seek to increase their presence  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  just agreed to pay  6 6BN for 275 000 acres  Noble Energy  NYSE NBL  bought acreage for  2 7BN  The region has seen over  25BN in acquisition activity since June 
Memories of the global glut caused by North American production are still fresh  Now that U S  production is increasing again  there are fears of a repeat  The world needs 6 million barrels a day of new supply each year to replace depletion from existing wells and new demand  We don t think a second collapse is likely  but in any event U S  shale producers have shown that they re better able to withstand such an outcome than others  Meanwhile  in China for example  oil output has entered long term decline  creating one new source of extra demand for imports 
Growing Permian output will use up some of the extra take away capacity  including for Plains All American  NYSE PAGP  who estimate they could see up to  600M in increased EBITDA as output grows

191404,412920,NBL,Will 2017 Be The Year Of Energy IPO Revival ,opinion,"Following two dismal years of near zero initial public offerings  IPO  activity in the energy market  2017 is expected to be the year that sees oil and gas listings return to the centerstage 
A Dry Spell for Energy IPOs
Oil s horror show saw black gold s price come down from some  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb last year as investors worried about the oversupplied market  The commodity s collapse threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and pummeling producer s profit margins  As oil sales floundered  producers and service providers got fewer revenues  To survive the period of weak profits  they scrambled to streamline costs while taking more debt to shore up balance sheets  Some overleveraged companies were forced to declare bankruptcy  while sharp fall in share prices in others meant that a number of investors saw their investment dollars going down the drain 
However  the one positive to emerge from the oil bust was the wave of industry consolidation  with high cost producers being washed out of the market in favor of healthier companies that are on much sounder footing  Throughout the downturn  energy players worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques  With these efforts  many oil companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices 
The eventual  survival of the fittest  has left only the fundamentally solid companies   having deep pockets   with their heads above water  And equity investors have been eager to tap some of them in the form of potential new offerings 
OPEC Led Uptick Broke the IPO Drought
A historic OPEC production cut agreement  together with help from non OPEC producers and slashing investments  in existing and new wells  saw oil prices more than double from their February lows to end 2016 around  54 
Encouraged by the uptick and stabilization of crude prices at around  50 a barrel level  Denver based Extraction Oil   Gas Inc    NASDAQ XOG   became the first IPO for a domestic energy explorer in more than two years when it debuted in Oct  Prior to this  Independence Contract Drilling Inc    NYSE ICD   was the last oil and gas IPO in Aug 2014  when crude was trading just below  100 
Noble Midstream Partners L P    NYSE NBLX     a partnership from Noble Energy Inc  NYSE NBL     was the only other energy related firm to tap the public market in 2016 before Extraction raised about  633 million 
In quick succession  Houston based independent oil and natural gas company WildHorse Resource Development Corp    NYSE WRD   and Centennial Resource Development Inc    NASDAQ CDEV   joined Extraction as 2016 s new upstream companies  Oilfield services company Mammoth Energy Services Inc    NASDAQ TUSK     carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   also hit the public market in Oct last year  mopping up  116 million  You can see  
Positive Start to 2017
With hope offered by the biggest oil deal in a decade and a new pro fossil fuel administration in the White House  investors have been counting on 2017 to turn the tides 
In fact  it was speculated that almost 40 oil and gas companies   from drillers and service providers to pipeline operators   might debut during the year  as stable commodity prices incentivize energy entities to churn out more 
As it turned out  oilfield services provider Keane Group Inc    NYSE FRAC   became 2017 s first IPO raising more than  500 million in Jan  It was followed by Permian focused oil producer Jagged Peak Energy Inc    NYSE JAG   and hydraulic fracturing supplier ProPetro Holding Corp    NYSE PUMP   
After the Initial Flurry  New Listings Dry Up
For the first couple of months of 2017  oil prices found themselves locked in a sideways trading range  as the tug of war over two powerful  opposing supply narratives continued 
Reports indicated an impressive 90  compliance level from the OPEC producers who pledged output cuts in an effort to tackle the three year supply glut  However  a burgeoning rig count   pointing to the ever increasing shale drilling activities   kept prices in check and within a band between  50  55 a barrel 
And then prices broke below the psychologically important  50 threshold after U S  government data showed that supplies   building since the beginning of the year   rose to record levels amid an increase in production 
Concerns over the future direction of oil prices led the IPO market to cool off so much so that North American well completion company FTS International and hydraulic fracturing water solutions provider Select Energy Services have deferred plans for a public listing of their shares   The companies were planning to get listed in the first quarter  but postponed the move owing to a sluggish market  
Canada s STEP Energy Services Ltd  and Source Energy Services Inc  pulled their proposed March public offerings too  as oil fell below  50 
What Lies Ahead 
Oil prices have since reclaimed the  50 per barrel mark following U S  military action in Syria and expectations that OPEC could exercise an option to extend its production cut pact by another 6 months to the end of 2017 
However  it remains to be seen whether the recent recovery can restore investor confidence  and with it a rise in IPOs  new as well as those deferred  in the energy space  On our part  we expect oil and gas companies to gradually seek public market access again as crude prices turn stronger

191438,412954,NBL,4 Need To Know Things About Oil  Gas And Middle East Turmoil,opinion,"1  ISIS Losing Oil Revenue
According to   ISIS has lost a significant amount of the oil revenue it used to count on  Before losing control of oil fields near the city of Tikrit  it is believed that ISIS used to bring in somewhere around  20 million in  a month  Nearly 80 ISIS oil tank trucks were also destroyed in U S  airstrikes targeting ISIS s oil smuggling network  The Syrian Army and Kurdish forces have also made some gains in capturing key points along important oil pipelines that had fallen under ISIS control  The current strategy to cut ISIS off from its oil revenue seems to be having some impact   at least in Iraq  In   however  ISIS continues to expand and threaten oil resources there  At the end of 2014  ISIS reportedly  enough oil fields to produce as much as 75 000 barrels per day  Since then  the amount has been reduced  as has ISIS s oil transport system  but how much is unclear 

2  Will Oil Guarantee Kurdistan s Future Independence 
The Kurdish people do not have an independent country  but there is much talk of that possibility arising out of the mess of the current regional destabilization  The successful future of any potential independent Kurdistan would depend  in large part  on its access to oil  In June 2014  just as ISIS seized control of Tikrit and nearby areas of Syria  the Kurdistan Regional Government  KRG  moved in to take control of key oil resources from the Iraqi government in northern Iraq  specifically the city of Kirkuk and its surrounding oil fields   Although Baghdad demanded the Kurds return the oil and the city to central Iraqi control  the Kurds refused  and continued to hold the city against  ISIS forces  Recently  the Kurds seem to have  in this fight  Controlling these oil resources would provide a potential independent Kurdistan with a major oil industry  Reports indicate that the area the Kurds currently or may eventually control could  contain 50 billion barrels of proven oil  80 billion barrels of unproven oil  and 8 10 trillion cubic tons of Natural Gas  When the future of post ISIS Iraq is decided  the KRG will have a stronger hold on the region because of its own military presence and opportunity from the native oil resources  As it stands now  the Kurds have significantly increased the territory and resources they need for independence  If they maintain control  they may declare an independent Kurdistan in an oil rich country 

3  Natural Gas Brings Egypt and Israel Together
Meanwhile  development of offshore natural gas resources is heating up in the Mediterranean  with Egypt and Israel cooperating to turn the area into a natural gas powerhouse  Egypt recently secured a significant investment from Italy s ENI  MI ENI  to  in its offshore Zohr natural gas field  Energy companies  after significant domestic legal delays in Israel  are finally pursuing development of Israel s offshore Leviathan gas field  The nearby Tamar field has been producing since 2013  and new  expect Tamar to produce over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day when it reaches peak production in 2017  It should eventually also produce over 1 000 barrels of condensate a day  Leviathan will likely come online in 2019 and  at peak production  produce 2 1 billion cubic feet per day  Leviathan will  Israel s precarious fuel situation by providing enough gas to cover Israeli electricity demand with a surplus to export natural gas to Egypt 
Israel and Egypt were even able to resurrect a stalled  10 billion deal between Egypt and Noble Energy  NYSE NBL   which owns a 40  stake in Leviathan   Egypt had threatened to cancel the deal when an international court ordered the country to pay a  1 73 billion fine to Israel for  cancelling its natural gas exports to Israel in 2012  In   however  Israel conceded to accept half that amount in exchange for reviving Noble s natural gas deal with Egypt 

4  After Attempted Coup  Turkey and Russia Move Forward on Pipeline

191475,412991,NBL,Brian Hicks Shares His Plans For Creating The Ultimate Resource Fund,opinion,"You may want to rethink those tickets to Hawaii  and instead spend the summer basking in the opportunities developing in three different sectors of the oil market  In this interview with   U S  Global Resources Fund Manager Brian Hicks shares the names of the juniors that could benefit from the current volatility  Plus  he reveals the dramatic shift he made in the fund this year that allows him to get paid to wait for the market to catch fire 
The Energy Report  Summer means driving season  which is good news for oil and gas prices  U S  Global Investors recently published an article that says Americans are driving and flying more than ever  Will energy investors who  sell in May and go away  kick themselves later  when they look at the stock charts for their favorite companies 
Brian Hicks  The summer driving season is a supportive time for crude oil  Refineries are at very high utilization levels  ramping up production of gasoline  and that creates extra demand for crude oil  We have begun to see inventories come down  which creates physical demand in the marketplace and helps offset high domestic inventories  This is a seasonally strong period for oil  which should alleviate the storage overhang heading into the summer months 
TER  Oil has been above  60 barrel   60 bbl  recently  Do you believe we ve hit a bottom in oil prices  What can we expect going forward if history is a guide 
BH  I think we have hit a bottom  Clearly  oil prices below  50 bbl are not sustainable  We simply can t replace global production at that price  It is way below the marginal cost of production  which we think on a long term basis is somewhere around  75 bbl  Even at  60 bbl  we have more upside to go to reach an equilibrium price  We have come up a ways since the lows set earlier this year  Perhaps we are entering a holding pattern before the next leg up in the back half of the year  But who knows  We are starting to see production growth decline and inventory levels receding  so we could see prices maintain these levels  or get even stronger  if declines accelerate into the summer 

TER  What are rig counts telling you 
BH  Rig counts coming down over 50  bodes very well for the price of crude oil  The resetting of global crude oil prices resulted in less drilling  particularly in the U S  That s why we are starting to see a production response 
From a historical standpoint  this is the point in the cycle when you want to look at energy stocks  We believe we are in a trough  and heading into 2016 we are going to need to see the rig count come back up certainly not to the peaks that we had previously  but higher than current levels  As we see production growth decline and demand pick up  inventory levels are going to head down further 
TER  Are you buying and selling based on Q1 15 results  or are you looking out at Q2 15 or Q3 15 expectations and beyond 
BH  We re trying to look forward  Obviously  some useful data can be gleaned from current financials  but we re trying to look ahead of the noise and over the horizon to see where oil prices will settle out and the prices that energy stocks are discounting in their valuations  We feel good that energy stocks have found a bottom and have started to come up  We think there is more upside as we get closer to 2016 
TER  How are you protecting the fund from volatility 
BH  We are a diversified  long only mutual fund  so it s not a core strategy for us to short crude oil or energy stocks  But we do try to mitigate volatility through diversification  That means holding companies across the market cap spectrum  in different geographies and with different commodity exposure  to derive a portfolio that is not highly correlated 
TER  I understand you started investing in some larger caps this year  What prompted that 
BH  As part of that diversification  and because there was heightened volatility coming into the year  we were trying to find value in stocks that paid a dividend and offered lower volatility 
In a new energy cycle  the stocks that typically move first out of the trough are the larger caps  We made investments in some major integrated oil stocks  some of which were paying dividend yields as high as 6   which really helped buffer the portfolio from excess volatility  We were able to pick up some income in the meantime  Historically  when you can buy large companies with high dividend yields  that s a signal of the value to be had 
One of the companies we added to the portfolio is Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa   RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE   When we purchased the stock  it was yielding over a 6  dividend  and the acquisition of BG Group  LONDON BG   BRGYY OTCQX  BG LSE  was a nice bonus  We re very encouraged by that acquisition  We feel it strategically places the company very well  BG Group puts Shell in regions of the world that look interesting from a growth standpoint  namely in Brazil and Australia  We feel like that s going to be a good platform for Shell  and for a company of its size  to get more growth 
TER  Are you expecting more merger and acquisition  M A  activity as we move through this phase of the cycle 
BH  I think we are going to see the cream rise to the top  and companies that have high quality assets or are strapped with excess debt will become targets  In many cases  at this time in the cycle  you can buy oil reserves in the ground for less than the price of drilling for new reserves  Many market upswings begin with an M A cycle  similar to the late  90s  when Exxon s  80 billion acquisition of Mobil Oil marked a bottom in the energy cycle 
We recently saw Noble Energy Inc   NYSE NBL NYSE  buy Rosetta Resources Inc  NASDAQ ROSE   That gives Noble exposure to new  prolific oil and gas basins of the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian Basin  I think this is a trend that will continue  as companies look to reduce costs and for strategic bargains  I think we ll see more M A activity into the summer perhaps a takeout of a larger independent by a major oil company which would highlight the long term value embedded in energy shares at this point in the cycle 
TER  Your fund s sweet spot has always been the juniors  Are you finding bargains in the junior space  What are you adding to the portfolio right now 
BH  That has been our core historically  The junior names that look interesting to us are those that  despite cutting capex  are still managing to grow through the drill bit  Other names look attractive simply because their assets are burdened by debt or undercapitalized  On the whole  we re seeing very attractive valuations on a full cycle basis  which make us quite optimistic 
TER  Can you name some of the companies that you re optimistic about 
BH  They are primarily in Canada  The first name is Legacy Oil   Gas Inc  TO LEG   This company has significant value  It s not a name that most folks are looking at because it has excessive debt on the balance sheet and is actively trying to manage that debt and still grow production  But it has high quality oil assets  and a lot of operational and financial leverage to the price of crude oil 
We think  on a sum of the parts basis  Legacy looks very interesting at current prices  If you look at the proven reserves in the ground and you discount them over the reserve life  and then net out the value of long term debt  the stock could double from current levels based on a normal full cycle oil price 
In addition  it looks as though there are some large institutional shareholders that are trying to unlock more immediate value by breaking up the company  divesting assets or perhaps even replacing management  That could offer additional catalysts 
TER  Is there another company that reported Q1 15 results you like 
BH  We re always intrigued by companies that are able to grow through the drill bit with low capex spending  One name we like is RMP Energy Inc   TO RMP   also in Canada  It has very interesting oil assets and plans to grow production 10 15  this year despite a capital cutback  At current oil prices  the company should be generating some free cash flow  which could be used to lower its debt  although its balance sheet is relatively strong  There are a lot of options for the company and we expect to hear further good news on improved well completion techniques that could unlock further value  We also are encouraged by the robust wells being drilled at its Ante Creek project  When we come out of this low period  it s this type of company that will thrive  It s a company that can increase shareholder value above and beyond just an increase in crude oil prices 
TER  What will it take for the market to recognize the potential and rerate RMP 
BH  I think execution is the main thing  The company recently issued a production report that showed it is on the right track  In fact  the estimates seemed fairly conservative given where RMP is producing right now  It is experimenting with some new completion techniques that look like they re enhancing the productivity of the new wells  We think there is positive operational and drilling momentum for the company  It looks as though production estimates are more than achievable  Companies that execute are the names that should outperform 
TER  How about a dividend paying Canadian explorer and producer 
BH  We have been involved in royalty trust companies for some time  It s a model that works well with the right kind of company  Whitecap Resources Inc   TO WCP  is a bellwether name with high quality assets and a strong management team  It recently made an acquisition  which further increases its overall growth profile  It pays a dividend of around 5   so you get paid to own this name as oil prices begin to recover  This is another company that has historically executed on its drilling plan and should continue to offer value for shareholders 
TER  How  specifically  would Whitecap s acquisition of Beaumont Energy Inc  help to create value 
BH  This is a textbook acquisition for Whitecap  It is going in when there are difficult times and making an acquisition in a core area in West Central Saskatchewan  It gives the company upside via some basic water flood developments  helps enhance its overall core area as well as its growth profile  and helps offset declines 
This type of acquisition is probably something we ll continue to see with Whitecap Resources  especially since the company has the financial firepower to look for strategic opportunities  This is the time in the cycle when Whitecap can enhance its overall platform and increase its production on a per share basis  while others in the industry are starved for capital  It s an opportune time for shareholders in Whitecap Resources to create some value  and in the meantime there is an attractive dividend yield 
TER  How about one more standout junior in the portfolio right now 
BH  We have owned BNK Petroleum Inc   TO BKX for some time  It s a little different in that the company has assets with proven oil reserves in Oklahoma  But it has also been doing some exploratory drilling in Poland looking for shale gas  which has come with some challenges and has weighed on the share price  When you couple those challenges with the volatility we ve seen in the small cap space  the shares have been punished to the point where they are trading below present value of future production and reserves booked in the ground  This is rare  But if you back out the liabilities from the PV10 value of this company  you could easily make a case that it could be a double from here in a normalized pricing environment especially if you consider the role the company could potentially play in Eastern Europe s quest to find an alternative to Russian natural gas  This is another name we ve added at lower levels during the energy selloff in the first quarter  and it s beginning to pay off this quarter 
TER  We have talked before about   Are you still finding that they are profitable in this environment  Are there some that really stand out to you 
BH  Some investors would think it s a little early to look at service stocks  We would probably agree when it comes to fracking companies and some of the other service providers  but we think it may be an interesting time to look at drilling companies  We are starting to see market share being overtaken by higher quality  higher horsepower rigs that can drill multiple wells per pad  as well as rigs that can move much more quickly to different drilling locations  Their drilling days are shorter  which creates a tremendous amount of efficiency and lowers costs for operators  These are the kinds of drilling rigs that operators are looking for  especially in a low commodity price environment 
Patterson UTI Energy Inc  NASDAQ PTEN  is starting to garner market share in this space  We think over the next 12 24 months  this market share will continue to grow  The utilization of higher end rigs should be well over 90  maybe even sold out in this particular category over the next 24 months which implies higher day rates for these higher spec rigs  The three or four companies with this capability should do well and should be buffered by any weakness in the oil services space  Then  as oil prices begin to recover and move back up  operators will increase their capital budgets  and they re going to want these premium rigs  The companies we re looking at  such as Patterson  should thrive 
TER  What advice do you have for investors looking to take advantage of opportunities over the summer without getting burned 
BH  Investors need to focus on the long term  I know it s difficult to think that way when we re bombarded with negative short term data points  But current crude oil prices are not sustainable at these levels  We cannot replace global production  Demand continues to grow outside of the developed markets in the emerging world  That does not appear to be changing  If we do not see a higher oil price  we re not going to be able to offset the global decline rate in current production or meet future demand 
We believe that we are in the early innings of a recovery in this energy cycle  The companies that are able to withstand the volatility are going to do quite well  and get bigger  There s a tremendous amount of opportunity in the energy space right now  We re very encouraged  It s not to say that we couldn t see more volatility  but I would look at that volatility as an opportunity to add to positions because  over the long run  we will see higher commodity prices and higher share prices within the energy patch

191476,412992,NBL,Shale Oil Companies Beware  Your Day Of Reckoning May Be Here,opinion,"The day of reckoning for America s shale oil producers finally may be just around the corner  After surviving for nearly a year on crude oil prices too low to cover operational costs  the Wall Street financiers that have kept firms alive with lines of credit  generous financing  and deferred interest payments are getting ready to call in the loans 
Federal regulations dictate that creditors must re evaluate the worth of the companies they actively loan money to twice a year   in June and October  Last June  oil was trading for around  60 barrel  October is coming and oil prices are just pushing  45 barrel This is bad news for oil companies  many of whom haveunflattering balance sheets and could find their loans labeled  troubled   Once a loan is marked  troubled  by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  OCC   a bank must set aside additional capital to cover the credit risk  This is basically the kiss of death for an energy firm  because it destroys the likelihood of securing any further financing from national banks 
How are energy companies responding 

Raising as much cash as they can by selling assets  W T Offshore Inc  NYSE WTI  is putting a Texas shale oil field up for sale for only  376 1 million  This is half of what it was valued at last year  Still  this cash would only benefit the company marginally  as its  600 million line of credit has already been cut twice this year  In July  Comstock Resources Inc  NYSE CRK  sold assets in Burleson County  Texas  and Austin Exploration  ASX AKK  is on the hunt for buyers for a 5 000 acre oil and gas property in the same region  Look for other assets like pipelines  natural gas fields  and even idling oil rigs to go on sale at cut rate prices  Private equity firms will be the first to snatch them up 


Selling shares to raise cash  The Wall Street Journal reports that publicly trading firms in the U S  and Canada have raised  21 billion by issuing shares this past year  RSP Permian  NYSE RSPP  raised  232 million this way over the summer  and Encana Corporation  NYSE ECA  and Noble Energy Inc  NYSE NBL  got a jump on reducing their debt early in 2015 by issuing shares in February and March and raising  1 billion each  But this avenue seems to be drying up as offerings slowed to a trickle in August  Investors should be cautious with firms that are currently looking to raise capital in this way  The healthier firms already took advantage of this strategy earlier in the year 


Negotiating with creditors ahead of the October review  Halcon Resources Corp  NYSE HK   which has already lost 90  of its market value since 2014  renegotiated its agreement with creditors over the summer  but it had to relinquish a stake in its oil and gas assets and accept 13  interest rates in exchange for some debt forgiveness  Yes  13   Sandridge Energy Inc  NYSE SD  has refinanced  525 million in debt  but has approximately 4 billion of outstanding loans  Magnum Hunter Resources  NYSE MHR   after defaulting briefly this summer  arranged for a fifth extension with its lenders  These companies are in bad shape  A successful renegotiation with a creditor might give them a positive headline  but these moves are just bandages designed to stave off default a little longer in hopes of a sale or other fortuitous events 

All of this sounds like doom and gloom for the energy sector  but it really is not  Investors and lenders can learn a lot right now about which companies will thrive  How and when shale oil companies deal with their debt is key to predicting which companies will survive in an era of low oil prices  and which companies will not 
Firms that ignored many of the experts last winter and anticipated a long lasting downturn in crude prices already moved to pay down debt  consolidate loans  or raise capital earlier  Those prescient firms are now much better positioned to weather the coming credit crunch  On the other side of the equation  private equity firms are now approaching a feast of oil asset opportunities that could offer the potential for quick turnarounds ",2015-09-17,"Ellen R.

191490,413006,NBL,Investors Place Their Bets On Russia s Fate,opinion,"Tensions between Russia and other major world powers just went into overdrive 
As I mentioned on Tuesday  Russia s ability to survive independently makes it essentially impervious  Well  the country is beginning to prove it 
In response to recent sanctions  Russia announced that it has banned all dairy  meat  fruit  vegetable  and fish imports from the United States  European Union  Canada  Australia  and Norway 
This puts the EU in an even tighter spot than before 
Do they dare apply even harsher sanctions and face an energy supply disaster 
The answer could ultimately lead to a massive windfall for one energy player in the area 
Europe s Hypocritical Stance on Russia
During the summer months  the dependence on Russian energy isn t a pressing issue 
Winter is coming  however  And countries like Austria and Turkey import 60  of their Natural Gas from Russia 
Check out the chart below to see just how precarious the situation is for Europe 

Now  the story gets a bit more complex when you consider that Russia is in the midst of building major gas pipelines to Europe 
The South Stream project will run under the Black Sea through the exclusive economic zones of Russia  Turkey  and Bulgaria  The onshore pipeline will cross Bulgaria  Serbia  Hungary  and Slovenia   with final destinations like Austria and Italy 
On July 24  Turkey signed off on the Environmental Impact Study for the project  as it pertains to Turkish territory   with the first pipe laying vessel to commence operations in 2015 
So  let s get this straight 
While the EU is pondering sanctions  countries in the region are signing billion dollar deals with Russia to build the pipelines 
If it seems strange to you that the same people who want to punish Russia are also shelling out big bucks to import more gas from the Kremlin  you re not alone 
You d think that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the downing of the Malaysian jet would be enough to torpedo the project  But that just isn t the case 
Now  even though it seems like Europe can t pick a side right now  that doesn t mean you can t 
Time to Place Your Bets on Russia s Future
The biggest winner of the deal is none other than Russian energy giant Gazprom  OTC OGZPY   The company has seen its share price decimated in recent months  falling 10  since the downing of the jet 
Investors are writing the company off based on the news headlines  Yet behind the scenes  the company is continuing its strategic mission to export natural gas out of Russia to energy dependent countries in Europe 
So if you want to bet on a Russian rebound  look no further than Gazprom 
On the other hand  if you want to bet against the Russian sphere of energy influence  then a better bet might be Noble Energy  NYSE NBL  
The company is developing huge fields off the coast of Israel  Along with LNG  these gas supplies will ultimately make their way to Europe 
In other words  Noble could seriously help lessen Europe s dependence on Russian natural gas 
Granted  there isn t enough natural gas to eliminate the dependence entirely  but there is an adequate amount to make a sizeable dent  This would at least force the Russians to behave  politically and militarily  
The only way to impact the Russians is to hit them where it hurts   and that s in the energy market  which supports about 70  of the country s economy 
The question is whether or not the Europeans are willing to spend a lot more in the short term to teach the Russians a lesson 
However  based on recent events  it appears the Europeans are more worried about their economic costs than their moral standing 
And  the chase  continues

191491,413007,NBL,Where Will Europe Find Energy This Winter ,opinion,"Vladimir Putin has a death grip around Europe s neck  and he could deliver the final squeeze at any moment 
As you likely know  Russia provides about one third of all the fuel used by Europe  fuel that Putin can cut off whenever he pleases 
In other words  there s very little that Europe can do to stop Russian forces from advancing on Ukraine 
Now  Putin has called for a  political solution  to the situation in Ukraine  and EU leaders have put off any further sanctions against Russia at this time 
But as these peace talks ensue  what options do Putin and EU leaders have going forward 
The Choking Point
In the short term  the Russians are in the driver s seat 
Ukraine is a major conduit for Russian energy to Europe  It s a country blessed with rich farmland   a regional breadbasket of sorts  Russian Natural Gas passes through pipelines in Ukraine to customers all over Europe 
Some countries   like Bulgaria  the Czech Republic  Hungary  and Slovakia   are wholly dependent on energy from Russia 
Europe cannot put the screws on Russia by halting energy imports  as it currently has no alternative  Especially when the temperature drops and energy demands rise in the coming months 
At the same time  Russia would be foolish to stop energy exports to Europe  as it would only hurt their coffers  According to Eurostat data  Russia supplied some  250 billion worth of coal  oil  and gas to Europe  That s around two thirds of the government s revenue 
Putin does have another option  however  By deliberately disrupting energy exports  he could trigger a winter of discontent and further torpedo any hope of economic recovery 
If Russia did decide to take the route of deliberate disruptions  it would be able to survive the financial shortfall as it sits on nearly half a trillion dollars in reserves 
That s not to say Europe is completely out of options  though 
Just as the United States learned an important lesson during the Arab Oil Embargo   the real beginnings of major independent oil and gas exploration within its borders   the Europeans will have to source its energy from providers more friendly to their long term needs 
Indeed  the Russians will force Europe to respond in four ways  three of which present immediate profit opportunities for perceptive investors 
European Response  1  Boost Imports From Other Sources  Europe will increase energy imports from companies like Norway s Statoil  NYSE STO   which currently supplies 14  of the natural gas used in Europe  Statoil cannot replace all the gas coming from Russia  but it can boost production and its bottom line  STO stands to benefit the most in the near term 
European Response  2  Going Nuclear  Europe will have to turn its attention to nuclear energy again   just a couple of years after the region began shuttering nuclear plants after the Fukushima accident in Japan  This bodes well for companies like Cameco  NYSE CCJ   the global uranium powerhouse  Uranium prices are guaranteed to rise at the first hint of a reversal in policies regarding nuclear energy 
European Response  3  New Natural Gas Resources  It will also need to tap into fresh natural gas reserves  like the fields off the coast of Israel and potentially   a region I visited last year   Companies like Noble Energy  NYSE NBL  are developing these massive fields in the Mediterranean  NBL isn t ready to supply the region just yet  Pipelines and liquid natural gas facilities are still lacking  But those issues are being addressed  and natural gas could be flowing from the Mediterranean to Europe within the next three years 
European Response  4  The Long Term  Yet Least Profitable  Solution  The fourth option is renewable energy  such as wind and solar  Of course  producing renewable energy is still way too expensive compared to fossil fuels  The economies in Europe just aren t strong enough to support the subsidies needed to make a difference 
None of these solutions will prevent a winter that will probably be devastatingly expensive to Europe this year  But the Russians have provided a very loud wake up call to Europe   and the world  A wake up call that will lead to profits for investors willing to bet on a future that confronts Russia s imperial ambitions 
And  the chase  continues

191492,413008,NBL,Turkey s True Potential Set To Be Unleashed,opinion,"It s located just miles away from some of the richest oil and gas fields in the world 
Just off this country s southern border  a 27 billion barrel oil field is in production  And further south  a 30 trillion cubic foot reserve is pumping out natural gas 
The country is the same size as Texas   with similar geologic formations as those found in the Texas and Oklahoma energy basins  Yet  despite its prime location  this  Ground Zero of the Next Energy Boom  has only drilled 4 400 wells since 1940  compared to over 1 5 million in Texas 
In other words  its massive energy reserves are almost entirely untapped 
Fair warning  though  this country s true potential will be unlocked very soon  And two companies promise to be at the forefront 
Confirming Turkey s Vast Potential
Last year  I visited Cyprus during the financial meltdown that was taking place 
The primary reason for my trip was to research the potential for gas development off the coast of Cyprus  in the Mediterranean 
Well  I confirmed that Turkey boasts massive oil and gas potential   both onshore and offshore 
Turkey controls half of Cyprus and has been clear about its intention to claim the potentially huge discoveries that may be found off the coast 
Noble Energy  NYSE NBL  is developing the Leviathan and Tamar gas fields off the coast of Israel  As I alluded to above  the fields are estimated to contain more than 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas  putting Israel on the map as the 25th largest in terms of reserves in the world  And those formations are thought to extend north into Turkish territorial waters  as well as onshore into the southern part of the country 
No wonder Royal Dutch Shell A  NYSE RDSa  and Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM    along with a host of minor companies   are champing at the bit to drill for oil and gas  and apply new fracking technology on Turkey s land 
The Next Big Energy Juggernaut
The Turkish Petroleum Company is working with Shell on four joint ventures on the Dadas formation in southwestern Turkey 
Geologists compare this formation to the prolific Oklahoma Woodford shale gas play 
Located on the Arabian plate  the formation is also thought to include as much as 100 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents   hence the deep interest by U S  and foreign energy majors 
The region has barely been explored  and results from test wells are due to come in over the next few months 
Previous test results showed hydrocarbon formations and have struck oil and gas   but not in commercial quantities  The newer tests will incorporate more recent advances  such as fracking  which should result in much better returns 
Bottom line  While Turkey is currently a net importer of both oil and gas  it has the potential to become the next global energy juggernaut  It s located between Europe  Asia  and the Middle East   with easy delivery routes by land and sea 
Indeed  Turkey could be a future source of energy for a starving Europe that s reliant on places like Russia for more than a third of its energy needs 
To top it off  Turkey has some of the most favorable tax treatments for exploration and production   with a 12 5  royalty to the government and a flat 20  corporate tax rate 
Ultimately  if the reserve estimates are proven correct  the big winners here will be the major oil companies   led by Royal Dutch Shell  which could possibly be sitting on the biggest find on its books 
And  the chase  continues

191499,413015,NBL,5 Oil And Gas Companies Analyst Joel Musante Really Digs,opinion,Many observers believe that the best days of domestic oil and gas production are long gone and they may be right  But that doesn t mean there isn t a lot more petroleum product to be found right here in North America  even in fields that have been previously worked  In this interview with The Energy Report  Joel Musante  a senior research analyst at C  K  Cooper  profiles several companies that are still coming up with some impressive numbers  The Energy Report  If your outlook hasn t changed much since your last    Quality Oil and Gas Stocks Are on Sale   let s jump right into specific companies you follow that look interesting right now  Joel Musante  One name I like a lot is Gulfport Energy Corp   GPOR   which recently established a pretty sizeable position in the Utica shale play  The Utica is one of the newest shale plays  and Gulfport has a sizeable leasehold position there totaling about 128 000 net acres  Based on early well results  production rates for Gulfport look very strong and much better than other companies in the play  I think it s safe to say it is in the sweet spot  TER  Is that by pure luck or by great engineering  JM  When you re going into a new area where there hasn t been a lot of drilling  you have to come up with a geologic interpretation of what s going on there  Gulfport leased most of its acreage where there had been little oil and gas development in the past  The company believes the formation on its leasehold is over pressured because it had been sealed by an impermeable geologic barrier  By comparison  Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK  leased most of its acreage in the play to the north of Gulfport s leasehold  where there had been some shallow oil and gas developed historically  By focusing its leasing efforts on areas with historical development  Chesapeake seemed to be targeting prospective areas  But so far  Gulfport s wells have shown stronger results with better reservoir pressures  In any event  Gulfport s interpretation of the geology has led the firm to lease the more prospective acreage  Based on early production data from wells drilled to date  Gulfport has had very solid results across most of its leasehold  Gulfport s third party reserve engineering report reaffirmed the strong production data when the engineer calculated the reserves for one well at 1 8 million barrels oil equivalent  which we thought was a good number  TER  So how many more wells are going to be drilled there  JM  The company has identified about 850 gross well locations  but there could be a lot more depending on the drainage pattern of the wells  Gulfport plans to drill 50 wells this year and 70 wells over the next two years  Those are early estimates and as it drills and gets infrastructure in place  those numbers can be increased  TER  Is it conceivable that all those wells could have similar reserves or was that just the first one  JM  That particular well was called the Wagner well  and was on the gassier side of the Utica play  Usually gassier wells have more reserves  but because gas is sold at a lower price than oil on an equivalent basis  the reserves may not be worth as much  Reserve estimates for wells containing more oil and natural gas liquids may be lower  but because these liquids sell for a higher price than gas  the returns may actually be higher  Based on what the company has achieved so far  we are expecting good results from Gulfport s Utica development program  I have a 12 month  60 price target on Gulfport  We are expecting to see a significant ramp up in production this year  You don t see wells like this every day and the finding costs are extremely low  TER  What else are you following that looks interesting  JM  Evolution Petroleum Corp   EPM  is a small company whose main asset is an interest in the Delhi field in Louisiana that s operated by Denbury Resources Inc   DNR   That field had already been produced on a primary basis a long time ago  Now Denbury  a company known for CO2 recovery  is doing enhanced tertiary recovery there in phases  The first couple of phases have ramped up production from nearly zero to over 6 000 barrels per day  6 000 b d  in the field  TER  That s a significant ramp up  Is that going to fall off pretty quickly  JM  No  It s still going through this development phase and will be for the next couple of years  so we expect the production to actually get up to over 12 million b d on a field wide basis  Denbury owns most of the field  but Evolution owns a meaningful interest  Evolution s agreement with Denbury allows Denbury to recover its capital costs before Evolution receives its reversionary working interest of about 20  of the production  We expect Evolution s oil production to nearly triple later this year when this reversionary working interest kicks in  after Denbury recovers its initial development costs  TER  That should give the stock a decent kick  JM  Right  We think that Evolution s management will put the company up for sale after this reversionary working interest kicks in  The increase in production would likely make the firm a more attractive takeover candidate  Evolution Petroleum shares trade at about  10 10 now and we have a 12 month price target of  14  TER  That s pretty decent upside  Speaking of which  last time we talked about PDC Energy Inc   PDCE   which was in the low twenties after having been hit and you had a  45 target on it  Now it s almost at that price  That s done a nice double here in only nine months  What do you think is going to happen from here  JM  It had some perceived tight liquidity issues  which is why it was in the low twenties  A couple of things have happened since then  First  there have been some positive developments announced by several operators in the Wattenberg field  Most notably  Noble Energy Inc   NBL   a leader in the Wattenberg field  increased its estimate for horizontal drilling locations to 32 wells for one square mile section  This was a big value driver for many of the companies that operate in the Wattenberg field  including PDC  which has a substantial leasehold in the area  Noble began drilling horizontal wells in the Niobrara B formation in the Wattenberg field a few years ago with great success  Since then  the company began testing tighter well spacing in the Niobrara B  Niobrara A and Codell formations  So far  horizontal development of these formations also looks very promising  TER  What was the other point  JM  PDC put some of its liquidity issues to rest when it announced the sale of its Piceance and NECO gas fields for  200 million   200M   The company was not doing very much in terms of development with these fields  and by monetizing the assets it could now reinvest the proceeds from the sale into high return development projects in the Wattenberg field  PDC also has a sizeable leasehold position in the Utica shale play in Ohio  The company will still need to derisk the majority of its acreage by drilling wells in new areas to prove its potential for commercial development  We think there is a lot of upside potential for the stock if results are good  TER  So  what do you think the prospects are for the company at this point  Does the stock still have some upside from here  JM  I think the stock still has upside from here  It looks cheap compared to other Wattenberg focused companies  We have a  56 price target and the stock is  46  TER  Are there any other new ones you d like to talk about that look interesting  JM  Things look like they re going pretty well for Abraxas Petroleum Corp   AXAS   We ve had a  3 25 price target and it s currently trading at about  2 03  It s becoming a much more focused company  It s selling non core assets  paying down debt and reinvesting the money into its two main areas  which are its operating Bakken acreage position and its Eagle Ford acreage position  The company announced last week that it s going to sell its non operating Bakken properties  which amounts to about 14 000 acres  and Abraxas can then reinvest that money into its operating Bakken acreage and drill more wells on its Eagle Ford acreage  TER  What amount could Abraxas stand to gain from that sale  JM  We re estimating probably  50 70M  With that  it can pay down a lot of its debt and have money to drill more wells and grow faster  TER  How expensive are these new wells to drill  JM  Depending on how many net wells it drills  it works out to be about  8 9M per net well  TER  Any other companies you re watching now  JM  Saratoga Resources Inc   SARA  is in the shallow state waters of the Gulf of Mexico  The stock s very cheap right now due to some operational problems  which have caused some liquidity issues  After Hurricane Isaac  it lost some production  causing it to borrow some money to keep its drilling program going  The stock sold off with all these events and now it s trading around  3  The value of its reserves are much more than that  It hasn t yet come out with a new reserve report for 2012  but last year s reserves were worth about  9 per share  So we think there s a lot of upside there  but the company s going to have to show the market that it can bring on some low risk projects  If it does that  we re looking for a rebound in the stock  TER  Do you have any other thoughts you d like to leave with our readers  JM  Last year  we began to see a much more disciplined approach to natural gas development after prices fell below  2 per British thermal unit  Many companies that were drilling noncommercial wells to hold acreage changed their strategies  slowing development and allowing their lease terms on some acreage to expire  While there is still an oversupply of natural gas  storage levels have returned to more normal levels  As a result  we think there is less downside to natural gas prices than there has been in the past  Many of the stocks I discussed today have a balanced mix of natural gas and liquids production  which could be a good strategy if the development economics offer attractive returns under conservative pricing assumptions  TER  Thanks for speaking with us today  Joel  JM  Thanks    CFA  is a senior analyst in the Research Group for C  K  Cooper   Company

191500,413016,NBL,Raymond James Analyst s Contrarian Forecast  Potential Oil Glut  ,opinion,Stepping away from the pack  Andrew Coleman of Raymond James Equity Research is making a contrarian forecast for an oil glut in 2014  Shale oil production is on the ascent  with the United States joining Saudi Arabia on the supply side  while China s hunger for oil may be sliding and demand in developed countries remains in decline  In this interview with The Energy Report  Coleman explains his thinking and names the producers best positioned to capitalize on the turbulence ahead  The Energy Report  Why are you expecting an oil glut in 2014  Andrew Coleman  Because of the evolution of North American shale oil plays  we are on track to add about 3 million barrels  3 MMbbl  of new supply over the next five years  Yet we know oil demand has been falling across the developed nations and is still weak coming out of the global financial crisis  Those developments point toward a glut  TER  Saudi Arabia surprised you last year by cutting production when oil was more than  110 per barrel   110 bbl   Why would Saudi or other suppliers not do that again  AC  What hurt production outside the U S  last year and helped keep the demand side a little more in balance was that Saudi cut 800 000 barrels a day  800 Mbbl d  in Q4 12  sanctions in Iran reduced exports by about 800 Mbbl d as well  conflict in Sudan took 300 Mbbl d offline and the North Sea average was lower by about 130 Mbbl d  These reductions kept last year s supply more balanced than we thought it would be  Going forward  Saudi s ability or willingness to cut is certainly going to be tested  because by our model the country may need to cut 1 5 million barrels a day  1 5 MMbbl d   about double what it cut last year  It would have to do that for a longer period of time  given the amount of excess storage that could show up on the global markets  TER  But  as you just pointed out  Saudi Arabia s cut came in the context of actions by other players  The other players are going to be as unpredictable as they were last year  aren t they  AC  Certainly  That s a big risk to our call  The other players are very unpredictable as well  I think Saudi has two years of foreign currency reserves at its current spending level  The country doesn t have a deficit right now  so the question is  would it be willing to tolerate a deficit  Most other countries have deficits  but that doesn t mean Saudi will  It is hard to predict because we re dealing with personalities and governments  as opposed to hard numbers  We re going to keep watching  and we ll adjust our forecast if some of those scenarios play out  TER  Was Saudi Arabia s production cut driven by a policy change  AC  Saudi Arabia cited internal demand issues in its production cut  The cut may also reflect an adjustment to offset the start up of Manifa  which occurred last month  TER  If the glut does occur  which benchmark crudes will be most affected  whether by going up or going down  AC  In the U S   production of light oil will dramatically increase due to the shales  Without the ability to export  we are already seeing prices of West Texas Intermediate  WTI  reflecting that  stranded  lighter barrel  We see light imports being backed out of the U S  as early as this summer as well  Finally  as infrastructure bottlenecks are removed onshore  we see risk to Gulf Coast prices  e g   Light Louisiana Sweet   With much of the U S  refinery infrastructure having been geared to process heavier barrels  the large growth in light barrels has already driven WTI prices to a discount with Brent  Risks to Brent could come down the road if European and Chinese demand remains tepid  TER  Will Venezuela s production decline continue  AC  With Nicolas Maduro running things down there now  we see Venezuelan production remaining flat for the next couple of years  Volumes declined each of the past four years  TER  What role will other players in the oil space have in either creating or preventing the glut  AC  Prior to about 2009  we were in a world where there was one marginal producer of oil  Saudi   and one marginal buyer of oil  China   Now we re in a world that has two marginal suppliers of oil  those being the U S  and Saudi  We have not added any new marginal buyers of oil  The question remains  is that marginal buyer of oil China as hungry for oil as it has been in the past  We also know that as economies develop  they become less energy intensive  And  factoring in the potential growth of natural gas consumption  that drives our caution  TER  Denbury Resources Inc   DNR NYSE  depends heavily on CO2 flood for its production  Will that be economically feasible if a glut occurs  AC  Yes  Denbury is profitable in the  50 per barrel   50 bbl  range  Most of its current production comes from older oilfields that it owns on the Gulf Coast  The company s CO2 is also on the Gulf Coast in fact  the company has the only naturally occurring CO2 source outside the Rocky Mountains  And it has the advantage of a pipeline that ties those CO2 assets to its producing fields on the coast  Because the oil is produced next to the infrastructure used to refine it  Denbury doesn t have to spend a lot of money on transportation  which helps the economics  I m not worried about Denbury being able to economically produce oil because it is cycling CO2  an injection process by which the company puts CO2 in the ground  displacing  and producing  oil as it goes  The company doesn t have to drill hundreds of wells every year to increase production  All it has to do is get the facilities working and then maintain them  versus continually deploying a lot of new capital in the ground each year  TER  CO2 flooding is not necessarily more expensive than drilling brand new wells  is that correct  AC  Correct  The two processes present different sets of challenges  If you are going to drill new wells  you need to come up with the drilling rig  well tubulars  hydraulic fracturing fluids and frack sand  and you must build roads and pipelines to connect those wells  If you are going to do a CO2 project  you ve got to get the CO2  which costs a little bit of money  and you need injection pumps  Much of the initial infrastructure  roads  wells  etc   is already in place  It is a slightly different business model but is still based on extracting additional barrels from historically large accumulations  Finding risk is very low  leaving the bulk of the costs as development in nature only  It s a business model that you don t see a lot in the exploration and production  E P  space  Most players with CO2 assets   the ExxonMobils  XOM NYSE   the Chevrons  CVX NYSE   the ConocoPhillips  COP NYSE  of the world have those assets embedded in much larger organizations  as part of their core businesses  Most of the E Ps that we focus on  because of their growth nature  are drilling wells on a continual basis to replenish and add to production  TER  With rare exceptions  Denbury has been stalled below  20 share for more than four years  You bumped your target price from  23 to  24 based on your pricing model  If the model says Denbury can reach that level  why hasn t it done so before  AC  A few years ago  the company was bringing on one of its biggest fields  Tinsley  It was the largest project the company had undertaken up to that point and some operational hiccups caused it to miss some production targets  As a result  management initiated a stock buyback program  and added to the technical team by bringing in Craig McPherson from ConocoPhillips  Over the last couple of years the company has put more process in place and structured its operations and technical teams to manage its multiple large scale CO2 floods  aptly titled  Operations Excellence    Over the last 18 months  management has slowly inched up its tertiary production outlook and now is saying it s going to come in at the high end of guidance  The guidance has slowly trended up as the company has been able to get more control on the operational side  That is why the stock has risen from where it was a couple of years ago  from  11 12 share to where it is now   18   To get into the twenties  it would be helpful to have a little bit of oil price support  It would also be helpful to see production growth expectations pick up as the company brings on more of its large scale fields  Management has also been discussing ways of accelerating cash flows from the build out of its tertiary oil business  The creation of a master limited partnership  MLP  is one way  though management hasn t decided yet  If you look at how some E P MLPs are structured  you could make a case in which Denbury would trade from the mid twenties to the low thirties  My price target reflects continued execution as well as the potential of a little more color on how an MLP might work for the company  TER  Do you think converting to an MLP would increase the value of the stock  AC  Potentially  Assets with low maintenance capital do well in an MLP  Maintenance capital is the money needed to keep production flat  If you think about the CO2 floods  they might fit nicely because drilling capex is low  Once you get those facilities up and running  then incremental costs involve getting more CO2  as opposed to getting rigs and steel and frack sand  etc  While Denbury may not  at this point  grow 40 50  like some of the premier shale players  growing in the 10 15  or maybe 15 20  range could be attractive for an E P MLP  Investors would have long term visibility on production growth and the company would be relatively stable  so it could then project the cash flow stream that could be dividended out to investors  TER  Energy XXI  EXXI NASDAQ  has posted disappointing results recently and management has announced a  250 million   250M  buyback program  What does management hope to accomplish  AC  Management is trying to draw attention to the fact that it expects to have free cash from the asset that it produces from  which is not something we ve seen a lot of companies focus on historically in the E P business  Most E P companies are growth companies  with historically high levels of reinvestment of cash flows to fund future growth  With Energy XXI recently taking production guidance down to 10  for the next 12 months  it s going to have a little more capital available to buy back shares  By my model  assuming the oil price is around  95 bbl net  the value of the company s proved reserves alone is somewhere in the  30 share range  If the company buys back shares for  25 share  that is 15 20  cheaper than what the assets are worth  That gives the company no credit for any future drilling potential  too  Gulf Coast players tend to trade at some of the most conservative multiples in the E P peer group  but that doesn t reflect the fact that they generate a lot of cash flow  TER  What s behind the disappointing results  AC  The company had some exploration wells that didn t pan out  That happens when you drill wells with chances of success that are 30  or lower  The offset is when a high potential well of that magnitude works  it covers the cost of the past unsuccessful tries and then some  If you look at Energy XXI s capital budget  it has roughly  500 600M of base capital for its base assets  It is going to spend  100 200M on higher risk  higher potential exploration stuff  So 15  of its annual program is directed at these high risk high potential wells  Over the last two or three years  management spent a lot of money on the Ultra Deep Shelf  UDS  and it has recently started to balance that by adding exploration drilling around its existing fields  It signed joint ventures with Apache Corp   APA NYSE  and ExxonMobil and will test some play concepts that were generated in house  as well as working with its partners  McMoRan  MMR NYSE  and Plains Exploration   Production  PXP NYSE  on the UDS  Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc   FCX NYSE  recently completed its acquisitions of McMoRan Exploration and Plains Exploration  The reason Energy XXI missed production numbers was also partly due to lingering weather impacts from last fall s storm season  TER  Energy XXI s initial strategy was to grow through acquisition  and it did have five large acquisitions  the last one completed in 2010  How well has it performed with the acquired assets  AC  The acquired assets are probably 60 70  of the inventory the company can drill now  Getting assets from Exxon  and a couple of years before that from Mit Energy Upstream  Energy XXI was able to high grade and increase its inventory  Hopefully the company is done integrating the assets  but it s a continuous process to high grade a portfolio  drill your best projects and optimize those projects as you go  I look to see that continue  In fact  Energy XXI recently brought its reserve engineering in house  Over the last few years  partly because the company was smaller  it let third party engineers handle 100  of its reserves for year end reporting  Most larger companies do that in house  and then use reserve engineers to audit the process for consistency  By bringing the engineering in house  Energy XXI is trying to show the market that it has a bigger organization that it has the bigger skill set and it wants to be more in tune with taking prospect sizes and prospect targets that match its capital program with expectations  TER  What is the company s strategy now  Is it still planning acquisitions or it is going in new directions  AC  The strategy continues essentially unchanged  First  it wants to invest in as many high IRR capital projects as it can  The CEO has said that for every dollar invested in the current year  he expects to get  1 50 2 00 in cash flow out of the ground  From that standpoint  the company can continue to spend money to get more returns  but it must balance that with trying to find the next company makers those bigger projects that support multiple well developments and new platforms  For the organic portfolio  the company also has to manage whether it can buy assets that would consolidate parts of its fields in the Gulf of Mexico and do that at an attractive price  Energy XXI is always looking at acquisitions  It s always looking at optimizing the drilling program  With the share buyback  the company has tried to put a little more emphasis on the fact that it recognizes the value of cash flow to investors beyond the growth side of the E P business  TER  Bonanza Creek Energy Inc   BCEI NYSE  has been a strong performer for you  but its recent earnings report was a miss right across the board  You ve cut its target price from  41 to  40  What caused that miss  AC  Coming out of last year and into Q1 13  Bonanza Creek had a slowdown in activity due to its rig schedule and winter weather  The company is in the right play in the Niobrara oil shale formation  where it is a small cap player surrounded by Noble Energy Inc   NBL NYSE  and Anadarko Petroleum Corp   APC NYSE   It was getting its program ramped up in earnest  but the slowdown caused it to come in below expectations for the quarter  In all fairness  at Bonanza s analyst meeting in April  management discussed the slower start to the year  Fundamentally  Bonanza stock still is underleveraged  Its debt is less than current cash flow  it s going to grow north of 60  this year  it continues to have access to inventory  and it is testing multiple zones to increase its inventory potential  From that standpoint  the stock still looks compelling and still has lots of growth in front of it  That is why I only took the target down by a dollar  TER  You make it sound like growth is simply built into the company s current direction  Does Bonanza not need to improve something in operations to get results  AC  Not really  Bonanza Creek s going to drill 70  wells this year in the Niobrara  It is testing 5 acre downspacing in the Cotton Valley  it is testing long laterals in the Niobrara B bench and it is testing the Codell zone for the Niobrara as well as the C bench in the Niobrara  It doesn t need to do anything more than continue drilling and hit its targets in terms of ramping the rig count  With four operated rigs presently  the company is doing everything that management said it would do and that allows Bonanza  based on my bottom up activity model  to hit my  40 share target  Additionally  across the play you ve got the LaSalle Plant  which DCP Midstream Partners  L P   DPM NYSE  is building  The plant should come on line at the end of the summer  That provides additional capacity to enhance volume growth for players in the basin  The Niobrara is a play that works  You ve got sufficiently large companies in the play to keep capital and facilities growing  Bonanza Creek is falling right in line there  and keeping up with its peers  TER  What other companies are you excited about right now  AC  My favorite stock is Anadarko  The biggest story for Anadarko will be the resolution of the Tronox Inc  bankruptcy case  After that  the company has numerous operational catalysts on the horizon  including 1  an ongoing process to partially monetize some of its Mozambique gas assets  2  its Yucatan exploration well  operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE  in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico  3  the sale of its Brazilian assets  and 4  ongoing drilling testing of its extensive onshore shale inventory  e g  Niobrara  Eagle Ford  Marcellus and Utica   The company has established itself as a premier explorer  and with the Tronox case resolved  Anadarko is also an attractive takeout candidate  In our net asset value  NAV  model  I see its shares as worth up to  130 each  but have assigned a  105 price target given visibility on near term cash flows  TER  Do you have any parting thoughts on the oil and or gas markets that you d like to share  AC  Yes  From our macro view  we re cautious about the oil outlook  We ve got a lot of production  and we re unclear about the strength of demand on the oil side in the next 6 18 months  going through 2014  On the gas side  after bottoming last year  gas looks like it is poised to be higher down the road  which makes us more constructive there  We have to see more evolution on the demand side  be it in the short term with power plant construction or in the longer term with the quest for use of compressed natural gas as a transportation fuel  If the price spread between oil and natural gas remains wide  we ll see continued evolution toward natural gas use across our economy  That will be good for everybody  It should help unlock value for the manufacturing space  It should also unlock value for consumers  who won t have to spend quite so much to heat their homes and fuel their cars  It would ultimately kick start the next big wave of economic expansion on the back of affordable natural gas in the U S  TER  Andrew  thank you for your time  AC  My pleasure   joined Raymond James Equity Research in July 2011 and
