3944,225459,WYNN,Explainer  Bribery scandal casts shadow on Japan s big casino gamble,news,TOKYO  Reuters    Japanese prosecutors have arrested a ruling party lawmaker previously in charge of casino policy on suspicion he accepted bribes from a company seeking to build a casino   The arrest of a member of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s Liberal Democratic Party is likely to harden public opposition to the unpopular plan to allow casinos in the world s third largest economy  The following are some key points about the scandal and its implication  WHAT IS THE SCANDAL  Tokyo prosecutors arrested Tsukasa Akimoto on Wednesday on suspicion of accepting bribes from employees of a company that wanted to set up a casino in Japan  Akimoto was up to last year a senior vice minister in the Cabinet Office who oversaw policy on casinos  He is suspected of taking 3 million yen cash   27 500  and a family holiday valued at  6 500 from three suspects despite knowing their company wanted help with a casino  prosecutors said  The three were also arrested  Akimoto has denied wrongdoing  Prosecutors did not name the company  but public broadcaster NHK and other Japanese media say it is Shenzhen  China based 500 com  The online gambling firm had indicated interest in opening a casino in Japan  the Nikkei and other media reported  New York listed 500 Com has not responded to requests for comment   For a factbox on the company  see   WHAT S AT STAKE  The arrest is likely to be seen as another black mark against casinos  still a contentious issue after lawmakers last year finished legalizing them following years of debate  Japan wants to allow several  integrated resorts   Las Vegas style complexes that include casinos  shopping arcades and conference centers  Hamstrung by a shrinking economy  population and tax base  Japan is pushing to boost overseas tourism  especially after the Tokyo Olympics end next year  Some analysts say the casino market could be worth around  20 billion annually or more  thanks to an affluent population and the proximity to Asia s wealthy gamblers  WHAT S THE CASINO CONTROVERSY  The casino development law is unpopular with the public  given concerns large scale gambling centers could lead to a rise in addiction  along with crime and corruption   An opinion poll in October by Jiji news found 57 9  opposition to integrated resorts versus 26 6  support  Gambling has a seedy image in Japan  with none of the glamor associated with spots like Las Vegas  Many Japanese identify gambling with the noisy  garishly lit pachinko pinball parlors that dot neighborhood shopping streets  Many are skeptical of the benefits and argue it would create mostly part time and low paid jobs   WHAT DOES THE SCANDAL MEAN FOR THE GOVERNMENT  The government s chief spokesman  Yoshihide Suga  said Akimoto s arrest would not impact the process to select casino host cities  Given Akimoto is no longer a member of the cabinet office  analysts say his arrest is unlikely to weigh on the process   If this involved a prominent politician  it would be an enormous problem  but you can t say he s that prominent  so the impact won t be that large   said Tomoaki Iwai  political science professor at Nihon University  But Iwai said the scandal had worsened the image of the Liberal Democratic Party  which is also fending off allegations that Abe used party funds to sponsor a party for supporters  WHERE WILL THE RESORTS BE BUILT  The government has authorized licenses to build three resorts  and is expected to officially receive bids from interested localities in 2021  Potential bidders include Tokyo  Yokohama and Osaka  Japan s three largest cities  and smaller ones including Nagasaki and Wakayama  Hokkaido had expressed an interest  but bowed out last month  WHICH FIRMS ARE BIDDING  MGM Resorts International has indicated its intention to develop a casino resort in Osaka  Other global names including Las Vegas Sands Corp  Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN  Ltd  and Galaxy Entertainment Group have indicated a preference to build in Yokohama  Caesars Entertainment has said it will not pursue a license ,2019-12-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/explainer-bribery-scandal-casts-shadow-on-japans-big-casino-gamble-2048319,2048319

156356,377872,WYNN,Hong Kong  s Melco cooperating with Japan casino bribery probe  source,news,"By Tim Kelly and Nathan Layne
TOKYO  Reuters    Hong Kong casino operator Melco Resorts   Entertainment Ltd  O MLCO  is cooperating with Japanese prosecutors in a widening bribery investigation of a senior Japanese ruling party lawmaker  a source said on Wednesday 
 Tokyo prosecutors sent Melco a letter and visited the office on Jan 17 after receiving no reply   said the source  who was briefed on the matter  Melco s office was empty that day  but it is now cooperating with investigators  he said 
The source  who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media  also confirmed the authenticity of a photograph seen by Reuters that showed a notice from prosecutors taped to Melco s office door 
Melco declined to comment on whether it is under investigation  A spokeswoman at the prosecutors office said it did not comment on individual cases 
The widening probe could bolster opposition in Japan to gaming companies vying for licenses to open casino resorts in Japan after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last year eased gambling restrictions to allow integrated resorts like those in Macau or Las Vegas 
Prosecutors last month arrested Tsukasa Akimoto  a former vice minister in the Cabinet Office in charge of casino policy  on suspicion of accepting more than  50 000 worth of money and gifts from employees at a company that wanted to set up a casino in Japan  Akimoto has denied the bribery allegations 
Prosecutors did not name the company  but public broadcaster NHK and other Japanese media identified it as China s 500 com 
The Shenzhen based company said in December it had formed a internal committee to investigate the allegations and that Xudong Chen  Chairman of the Board  had resigned 
Other companies interested in building resorts in Japan include MGM Resorts International  N MGM    Las Vegas Sands  Corp  N LVS    Wynn Resorts Ltd   O WYNN  and Galaxy Entertainment Group  HK 0027  
Japan is viewed as one of the world s largest and most promising untapped casino markets  Melco and other operators have said building a casino resort there would cost  10 billion or more 
In a bid to overcome gambling s seedy image in Japan  Melco has collaborated with Tokyo University of Arts to promote Japanese culture  and offered vacations for students living in areas hit by Japan s 2011 earthquake 
Public support for Abe s casino plan  however  has waned with backing for casinos as low as 30  in some polls 
Japan has authorized licenses to build three resorts with Tokyo  Yokohama and Osaka among the cities expected to bid for them 
That process  may be pushed back beyond next year because of the bribery scandal involving Akimoto  the Asahi newspaper reported on Tuesday  citing government and ruling party sources ",2020-01-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hong-kong-s-melco-cooperating-with-japan-casino-bribery-probe-source-2070087,2070087

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorWelcome to the Wynn Resorts  Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call   Operator Instructions   If you have any objections  you may disconnect at this time  I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings  President and Chief Financial Officer  Sir  you may begin Craig S  Billings    President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerThank you  operator  Good afternoon  everyone  With me today in Las Vegas are Matt Maddox and Marilyn Spiegel  Also on the line are Ian Coughlan  Ciaran Carruthers  Frederic Luvisutto and Brian Gullbrants  I want to remind you that we may make forward looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws  and those statements may or may not come true  I will now turn the call over to Matt Maddox Matt Maddox    Director and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Craig and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call today  To kick it off  I d like to start in Macau  So  we are currently focused almost solely on the health and safety of our employees  our customers and the Macau community at large right now in Macau  I d like to commend the Government of Macau and China  in fact  for the quick and decisive action that they take and continue to take to contain the coronavirus  We are in daily conversations with the government  it has been extremely transparent and they have been terrific partners with us  as we focus on the safety of everyone in Macau In fact  on February 5th  at midnight  we worked closely with the government of Macau and all of the operators in Macau to cease our casino operations  on    at midnight on February 5th  It was a controlled and organized closure of the casino  We do still have our hotel and a couple of restaurants open for the few remaining guests that are in Macau  but during this time  while the casino is closed  our operating expense burn rate is roughly  2 4 million to  2 6 million a day And that s largely comprised of payroll to our 12 200 employees  Looking back to fourth quarter  we generated  347 7 million of EBITDA and like the past quarters  we experienced quick growth in core mass coupled with compression in the VIP segment  As we reported on the third quarter  October was actually quite strong  generating EBITDA of a little over  4 million a day  but we began to see deceleration leading up to the 20th year celebration handover of Macau back to China in mid    on December 20th  just like the entire market However  while it s a short period of time  we did notice that beginning on December 23rd through January 10th  in a somewhat normal operating environment  our business jumped right back to  4 million a day in EBITDA between the two properties on a normalized basis  Moving to Las Vegas  we made  80 million in EBITDA with a  20 million negative hold impact during the quarter  On a full year  just to put it in perspective  in 2019  our baccarat volumes were down roughly 30  in 2019 compared to all of 2018  And that contributed to more than a  15 million decline in EBITDA year over year  Our domestic business continues to be up in the casino and in non gaming  REVPAR was up over 3  in the fourth quarter and our retail revenues were up double digits We re excited about 2020 in Las Vegas  we have a 430 000 square foot convention center that s opening in weeks to great fanfare  We have three new restaurants that will be more social dining focused and high energy that will be opening throughout 2020 and we ll begin the remodel of Wynn Las Vegas  the 2 700 rooms here  in the summer of this year and completing before the end of 2020 So we have a lot going on in Las Vegas and we feel really good about all the segments of our business as we continue to monitor the Far East segment as it relates to Las Vegas  Looking at Encore Boston Harbor  we doubled our EBITDA from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to  15 million  Our table games business remains healthy  We opened    and table games is healthy and it continues to grow and to be quite strong actually  And all of the programs that we re putting in place for our slot    for our slot win  we launched the Wynn Rewards program  which is a first for us in North America  which is a tiered card program We re starting to see those things work in    at Encore Boston Harbor  In fact our win per unit on the slot floor was up a little over 14  compared to the third quarter and we re continuing to see incremental growth on the slot floor  In 2020  we re focused on continuing to match our food and beverage concepts with our customers  So destination dining  for the overnight visitors as we re ramping our hotel business there and providing more quick serve options for the daily visitors So we feel good about the progress that we re making at Encore Boston Harbor  as we continue to ramp that property throughout 2020  With that  I ll turn it over to Craig Craig S  Billings    President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerThank you  Matt  As noted in our release  our Macau operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of  347 7 million on  1 1 billion of operating revenues  The quarter was characterized by strength in mass with combined property win in the mass segment  up 6  year over year  Our results in Macau were positively impacted by higher than normal direct VIP hold percentage  which increased the EBITDA by approximately  17 5 million from a normalized level with the hold impact weighted more heavily to Wynn Macau at approximately  12 5 million The team in Macau has done a great job of controlling cost at both properties  At Wynn Palace  our operating expenses excluding taxes were down both year over year and sequentially  which drove a 40 basis point increase in normalized EBITDA margin compared to Q3  despite the topline pressure experienced market wide  At Wynn Macau  opex was flat year over year and sequentially despite incremental payroll expense incurred to staff up the Lakeside casino  We are well prepared to drive strong operating leverage when the market returns to normal Our Las Vegas Operations produced adjusted EBITDA of  80 1 million in the third quarter on operating revenue of  368 8 million  our results were negatively impacted by lower table games hold in both baccarat and domestic tables costing us about  20 million of EBITDA as Matt mentioned  While baccarat was soft year over year on a tough comp  we saw 4  growth in non baccarat table drop and slot handle On the hotel side  REVPAR increased approximately 3  year over year to  288 driving  120 3 million of hotel revenue  Bad debt expense in Las Vegas was  4 1 million compared to  1 million in the prior year quarter  costing us  3 million in comparable EBITDA  The team in Las Vegas  also did an excellent job controlling costs in the face of upward pressure on payroll with operating expenses excluding tax and bad debt down slightly year over year We spent approximately  49 million in project costs on the group space at Wynn Las Vegas in Q4 2019  taking our spend to date to roughly  351 million  Construction is now complete and the expansion is slated to open in a few weeks  Encore Boston Harbor produced  15 3 million in EBITDA on a  169 3 million in operating revenue  Table games hold was in the normal range  As Matt mentioned  we have a number of initiatives in play in Boston designed to drive revenue growth and we expect those initiatives will bear fruit over the course of 2020  We have also carefully managed our expense base there  and operating expenses excluding gaming tax in Boston were down approximately 11  quarter over quarter We anticipate making additional investments in the property throughout the year  particularly in food and beverage  While we are not yet ready to quantify the budget for those initiatives  we expect they will be relatively modest  Turning to the balance sheet  during the quarter  we successfully completed a  1 billion  10 year senior notes offering in Macau with strong support from Asia based  long term investors We intend to use the proceeds from the notes offering to repay a portion of our term loans in Macau  As a result  this will reduce our senior secured debt and related leverage ratio while extending our maturity profile at an attractive rate  We ended the quarter with total debt of  10 4 billion inclusive of the  1 billion of recently issued Macau bonds We also had total cash and investments of  2 36 billion including approximately  1 8 billion at Wynn Macau and total Companywide revolver capacity of  1 25 billion  Our liquidity position  particularly in Macau is very strong  Finally  during the quarter  we returned over  100 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend payment With that  we will now open up the call to Q A  Operator Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions   Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank  Your line is now open Carlo Santarelli    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHey guys  and thanks for the comments  I kind of  I hate to be generic and more general  but if you can  just big picture  how do you guys think about things here in the near term and certainly appreciate the color  Matt on kind of the cost per day here during the closure  How do things look over there at present  What are you hearing in terms of the potential to reopen after the two week window And most importantly  what do you foresee kind of on the back end of this Matt Maddox    Director and Chief Executive OfficerSo Carlo  I think it s a little early to try to say when exactly we will reopen  We are again the team on the ground is working with the government on a daily basis and watching very carefully if there will be any continued outbreaks of the virus  And so far  we feel like things are fairly well contained  and we re just watching it very carefully  In terms of Macau in general  I think the way we look at it is  there s been so much investment in the region and all the new infrastructure that was just coming to fruition with the high speed rail coming into Macau and the light rail launching and it was really set up for a quite extraordinary 2020 We were quite excited about it  So I m not    I don t want to predict when operations will be back to normal  they will be eventually  we re not exactly sure when  but Macau is set up for a really great rebound  Tourism was one of the first things that rebound in events like this  because people want to get out and move around and get back to normal  So we do feel good about the long term aspect of Macau as soon as the virus is completely contained Carlo Santarelli    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  thank you very much OperatorOur next question comes from Joe Greff from J P  Morgan  Your line is now open Joseph Greff    J P  Morgan    AnalystGood afternoon  everybody  I mean there s a lot of uncertainty in Macau and I appreciate your comments on it  can you just spend a little bit of time what you re seeing from that Far East player going into Las Vegas  Can you share with us maybe your experience this past Chinese New Year  I know that segment has been challenged for a while as you alluded to a couple of different times on this call Marilyn Spiegel    PresidentSo  you know  we don t really comment mid quarter on what really happened during the quarter  but so far so good  We had our Far East come in  We had a party  We ve taken appropriate precautions  The Far East who are in town  they can t get back to China and so they are traveling from one location to another location  And so if they were here  first  they may have gone to another casino and we expect them to come back as they continue to play  But clearly  based upon the results  you can see from the fourth quarter  it s still a very choppy market Joseph Greff    J P  Morgan    AnalystAnd then  can you also remind us sticking to Las Vegas  your expectations for room pricing this year with convention center and some of the other amenity build outs in Las Vegas  I guess  maybe  some of which might be impacted by the room refresh this summer  How are you looking at room pricing for the two boxes in Las Vegas  and how much of a multi year ramp is that both on occupancy and on price  when you think about it longer term  And that s all from me  Thank you Marilyn Spiegel    PresidentYeah  Joe  I mean the room pricing and occupancy in Las Vegas is a street fight every day  right  And so our convention business is very solid  We feel great reception to our product  We have leveraged our hotel rooms for the domestic casino growth that we are experiencing or that you re seeing  The rooms that will be out of order from June through the beginning of November are going to depress hotel revenue  but we will be sure to eliminate the low end Leisure business that often comes to market in the third quarter and so it was really planned for that particular time in terms of what will we end up with  occupancy or with rate that s a story to be written Matt Maddox    Director and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Joe  we re still focused  as we ve been saying for about a year now that Wynn as a convention center stabilized and we re seeing lots of interest in it as people are touring  it is booking quite fast  The four points to six points of incremental occupancy is still the target as we get into late  20 and into  21  I think we ended the year at roughly 87  occupancy  and we want to be in the low 90 s  six months from now Joseph Greff    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  thank you very much OperatorOur next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays  Your line is now open Felicia Hendrix    Barclays    AnalystHi  there  Thank you so much  So  Ian for you  I was just curious did the West Casino renovation open up at the end of the year Ian M  Coughlan    PresidentIt s opened up in mid November  44 tables and did exceptionally well  lifted premium mass was incremental business for Wynn Macau  the marketing and operations team did a great job launching it and we were looking forward to a great Chinese New Year  It had done very well up to that point  And so we re encouraged for the future  We still have elements of the facility to open in the first quarter  So we have two restaurants coming on board  six retail outlets and support areas  So it s an exciting development in Macau  Plus  we have all our Encore rooms back after their renovation OperatorOur next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America  Your line is now open Shaun Kelley    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  good afternoon  Maybe for Matt or Ian  just wanted to get your sense on  I think obviously the market was a little disrupted in Macau in December given the President s visit  But was kind of curious on maybe your bigger picture view on maybe some of the implications of that    of that visit  there were some    I think some really positive reads about what that might have meant for kind of the near or medium term  And then any kind of just initial reads on the new Chief Executive  and how those    kind of how some of those relations are going Matt Maddox    Director and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So I ll kick it off and then Ian  you can chime in  But as I said before  we thought Macau was really set up for a great 2020  We re very optimistic about the new Chief Executive  and the direction that he s taking in Macau  We feel good about all the infrastructure that s coming in place  Clearly the visit in December by President Xi was wildly lotted  Phonetic  around  really all throughout China as Macau has done a great job with the one country and two systems So we feel    we feel really good about Macau s position going forward  Ian  do you have any thoughts on that Ian M  Coughlan    PresidentWe    two years ago when the Greater Bay Area was being discussed at the governmental level  Macau was described as having a seat in one of the VIP carriages as the greater Bay Area moved forward after President Xi s visit  it s now positioned Macau in a leading role which is wonderful for everybody in Macau business and community And secondly  on the new Chief Executive  he barely sat in his seat and he has this huge virus maelstrom  He s being quite amazing in his clear concise pragmatic communication with the community  and also with business  We ve been in daily dialog with government and it s been quite remarkable  And the decision making that he s done in his first few weeks OperatorOur next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley  your line is now open Thomas Allen    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  thanks  So a couple of questions on Macau  how is business interruption insurance going to work  And then also with covenants  I know you ve been well under them and obviously you have a ton of cash  but will there be concessions given  And then finally  the cost containment was really impressive  Can you just talk a little bit more about how you re able to achieve that  Thank you Craig S  Billings    President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerSure  Thomas  it s Craig  I ll take the first two and then we can talk about the latter  So generally speaking  business interruption insurance    business interruption insurance relate    must relate to a physical event that caused the business interruption  so a storm or some type of damage  That obviously isn t the case here  So we don t expect material business interruption coverage  proceeds from the coronavirus event To your question on covenants  the vast majority of our debt stack is comprised of long dated unsecured bonds with no maintenance covenants  The two bank facilities do have maintenance covenants  The US facility has more than ample covenant headroom to sustain a very prolonged period of suppressed business volumes in Macau and the Macau facility does have a maintenance covenant that is sensitive to Macau EBITDA and as I suspect several concessionaires do  We ve already have a game plan in place to manage that to the extent that the shutdown is extended  but it would have to be quite extended And as you rightly pointed out  we have a ton of liquidity  we have a couple of billion dollars of availability between cash and revolver in Macau and that s more than sufficient to last for really any period of closure  Ian  did you    would you kindly comment on the opex controls Ian M  Coughlan    PresidentSure  It s just a team effort to collectively look at variable expenses  we were able to bring headcounts down  We have a hiring freeze in place and the teams did a good job and parsing expenses were not hurting the quality of service and the quality of product and facility OperatorOur next question comes from Harry Curtis from Instinet  Your line is now open Harry Curtis    Nomura Instinet    AnalystHi  Yeah  good afternoon  My question goes back to the comments that you made about the light rail system  Was it    was it an operation long enough to get any sense of whether or not it would    it would be effective transporting more visitors to your properties Ian M  Coughlan    PresidentSo  Harry  this is Ian  And it had only been in operation for three weeks and still going through testing mode  It s a great vehicle transfer situation for us with two stations right outside our property and    but it s too early to tell in terms of traffic movement  etc OperatorOur next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies  Your line is now open David Katz    Jefferies LLC    AnalystHi  Afternoon  If I can just ask you to go back on one detail  You did make some mention and showed some evidence of good cost containment  Can you talk a bit more about what levers and a bit more specificity around what you can do with cost  Are you encouraging vacation or any of those sorts of things that may mitigate some cost impact And then secondly  I wanted to change the subject and talk a bit about Encore Boston  and just sort of get your updated view about what a ramp to a payback period might be over time and how you re envisioning that  Thank you Matt Maddox    Director and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So this is Matt  For    on the cost containment side in the normal operating environment  I think in all of our properties  we ve been doing a very good job focusing on costs and being smart and efficient  Right now in Macau  the roughly  1 8 million to  1 9 million a day of payroll  we are not looking at cutting that at all  Now is the time when you invest in your people  you don t do something short term that will hurt the culture or cause any distraction So we re investing in the community right now because we know this will be temporary  and we think that it s the right long term investment  For Encore Boston Harbor  when we laid out the program  when we opened to Analyst Day  we talked about a two year ramp period  Admittedly  it has launched softer than we thought  and particularly on the slot side  And so we re doing a lot of work  What we realized was  we didn t have quite the right food and beverage program in particular around quick serve for the daytime slot customer  It s actually the same thing that we went through at Wynn Palace  And when we opened  we realized we needed more quick serve restaurants in Wynn Palace  we immediately closed a third of the casino  We built Red 8  we built five new restaurants in the meantime  And so we re going through that process in a very fast way at Encore Boston Harbor  because when we see a problem we fix it So I think we re still in that two year ramp up mode Operator Operator Closing Remarks  Duration  23 minutesCall participants Craig S  Billings    President  Chief Financial Officer and

156359,377875,WYNN,3 Stocks Gaining Momentum As Virus Fears Escalate,opinion,"Global financial markets were whipsawed this week  with Wall Street suffering its most crushing selloff in about four months on Jan  27  as concerns grow over the coronavirus outbreak centered in Wuhan  China 

The number of total confirmed cases in China surged to 4 515 as of Tuesday and this figure could continue to rise as the virus s ability to spread is strengthening according to China s National Health Commission  There have been  resulting from coronavirus  though none have been reported outside China 
 

A small number of cases linked to people who traveled from Wuhan have been confirmed in more than 10 countries  including the United States  Canada  France  Japan and South Korea 

As the virus expands its reach  concerns mount about the potential influence on global travel  Related stocks in the airline  cruise operation  casino and hotel industries are already sharply lower 
Since Jan  21  Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   and  Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS   stocks with large operations in China  have dropped 12 30  and 7 35  respectively  While United Airlines  NASDAQ UAL  fell 12 32  from Jan  21  
However  companies producing safety equipment for high risk workers and vaccines for infectious diseases are likely to gain in the short term as demand for these products shoots higher 
Further escalation of the outbreak would spur even greater need for safety equipment and vaccine development  Here are 3 industry leaders in particular that stand to gain  
1  Lakeland Industries  Leading Hazmat Suit Manufacturer
 Lakeland Industries   NASDAQ LAKE   based in Ronkonkoma  New York  makes infection control gear  such as firefighting and heat protective apparel  disposable protective clothing  as well as chemical protective  clean room and hazmat suits 

The company has seen its shares surge 27 6  since news of the virus outbreak sent shockwaves across financial markets on Jan  21  The stock  which has rallied 30  YTD compared to the S P 500 s 1 4  gain  closed at  14 00 on Tuesday with a market cap of  112 1 million 
The stock reached a fresh 52 week high of  16 28 on Monday and enjoyed a similar spike in late 2014  amid panic over an Ebola outbreak in Africa 



With the coronavirus threatening to turn into a full blown epidemic  demand for this medical protective equipment maker s products could grow 
Its customers are mainly industrial companies and governments from 40 foreign countries including China  the U S   Canada and Europe  Additionally  the protective clothing provider is a vendor to federal  state and local governments  such as the United States Department of Defense  United States Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control 
2  Alpha Pro Tech  Go To Protective Face Mask Producer
 Alpha Pro Tech   NYSE APT  is in the business of protecting people  products and environments  The company  which operates entirely in the U S  but supplies to the global market  makes protective clean room suits  infection control gear and air filtration face masks that have become a common sight on the streets of China 

Shares are up a whopping 62 8  since Jan  21  YTD and hit a 52 week high of  7 86 on Monday  The stock  which ended at  5 70 last night  has jumped 66  in 2020 and has a valuation of  74 2 million  Similar to Lakeland  Alpha Pro Tech also rose in late 2014 due to concerns over the Ebola outbreak in Africa 


After making its name during the SARS  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  MERS  and Ebola outbreaks Alpha Pro Tech has become the go to name in times of global health crises  We ve already seen face mask shortages become more common across the globe  There has also been an increase in demand for eye shields and shoe covers for health care workers in China exposed to infected patients 
3  Vir Biotechnology  Vaccine Prospects Drive Gains
Vir Biotechnology  NASDAQ VIR  is a clinical stage immunology company focused on combining immunologic insights with cutting edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases 

The San Francisco based biotech firm  which went public in October 2019  has soared 30  since Jan  21  The stock settled at  21 31 yesterday with a market cap of  2 34 billion  Shares  which are up nearly 70  YTD  climbed to an all time high of  27 48 on Monday 


Vir Biotech is well positioned to benefit from the coronavirus outbreak as it has four technology platforms that it is leveraging to develop treatments for infectious diseases  including influenza and tuberculosis  Investors perceive that it may have the ability to develop a vaccine given that it has already provided antibodies for other coronavirus strains in the past ",2020-01-29,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-gaining-momentum-as-virus-fears-escalate-200502496,200502496
156360,377876,WYNN,Wix  Wynn Resorts  Beyond Meat  Owens   Minor And Advantest Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 4  2020    Shares of Wix   NASDAQ WIX   as the Bull of the Day  Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND    Owens   Minor   NYSE OMI   and Advantest   OTC ATEYY   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Enterprises around the world are moving to the internet and are in need of a smooth transition  Wix com is well positioned to take on the growing digital demand  Wix has traded all over the board the past 52 weeks but since Christmas these shares have surged over 20   Analysts have been guiding their EPS estimates upward on this enterprise of the future and pushing WIX into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  The BusinessWix com is a subscription service that provides users with a one stop cloud based platform for all of their website needs  Wix is based out of Tel Aviv and has been going strong for 13 years  The company provides services to over 160 million users in 190 countries The platform enables anyone  no matter their technical or coding background  the tools to develop  create  and contribute  Wix s product offering gets your business online  whether you are an artist  an entrepreneur  developer  or IT professional Wix Editor offers a drag and drop website creating software to design and edit any website with no coding background needed  Wix s Artificial Design Intelligence  ADI  is the first ever AI backed program that can design a website for you based on your needs  The firm offers a much broader portfolio of products that could solve almost any website need PerformanceWix has built out its product offering substantially since it started back in 2006  and its customer base has grown along with it  The total user base has close to doubled  while its premium paying customer base has more than doubled  Registered users hit 160 million in Q3  with premium users sitting at 4 4 million Wix s subscription based model enables it to demonstrate quarter over quarter growth since the company went public back in 2014  The firm hasn t seen a quarter with year over year growth of less than 25   and analysts are estimating this will continue through 2020 Wix has seen tremendous customer retention  and its ability to progressively drive up average revenue per user gives this business reliable revenue streams  Despite Wix toeing the line of profitability  the company has been able to grow its free cash flow  FCF  year over year consistently  with management anticipating  125 million full year FCF for 2019  23  growth   This steady growth in cash flows and  776 million in cash gives Wix financial flexibility that most growing firms are unable to achieve The company currently employs zero salespeople with the entire growth of the company occurring naturally through word of mouth  and other organic ways  Wix doesn t need a sales team because the platform sells itself Wix is an innovation driven company  with 50  of its employees being found in the R D department  The company continues to drive out new products which further propel its product offering to the top of its space Wix s growing international penetration gives this enterprise a head up on its competitors because not only does this hedge the firm s bets  but gives it a massive addressable market Competition includes tech powerhouses like Square  NYSE SQ  s Weebly and Shopify  both of which enhance companies  online presence Sell side analysts like this stock with 12 out of 16 analysts calling this a buy right now Look for Wix s final 2019 report before the bell on Wednesday  February 19th  Analysts are estimating an EPS of  0 27 on sales of  205 million  according to Zacks Consensus estimates  This would represent top line growth of 25  but an EPS decline of 36  Take AwayWix com has proven an uncanny ability to drive steady and reliable growth globally  The website making space is saturating quickly  but Wix has been able to stay ahead of the curve  Its ability to retain customers while at the same time increases revenue per user gives me confidence in this stock as a long term play  Wynn Resorts has been on a wild ride since the beginning of the US China trade war due to its excessive exposure in the region  The coronavirus has only exacerbated its issues in the country  as the tourist market has effectively shut down till this virus can be contained  WYNN analysts are pricing in the problem and have been dropping their EPS estimates  pushing this stock into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Wynn Resorts has a substantial presence in Macau  the Las Vegas of the East  In fact  roughly 70  of the company s sales are driven by this region  The coronavirus has empty this party capital and its casinos during the city s busiest time  Chinese New Year  also referred to as Spring Festival   The full impact of this virus on the overly exposed WYNN is still yet to be seen Shares have fallen 15 3  since coronavirus anxiety began roughly two weeks ago  The stock has broken down 34 5  since the US China trade war started in the summer of 2018  WYNN appeared to be rallying up until the virus shut down its primary profit driver The coronavirus has now infected roughly 17 500 with 17 308 on the China mainland  almost 3 times the figure one week ago  and there is little sign of the dissemination of the disease slowing down  It could be months before this widespread disease is under control  and Wynn Resorts casinos in Macau will be re opened  This will cost the company tens if not hundreds of millions  and I think these shares have more room to fall Take AwayWYNN is a sell in the short term due to the obvious concerns surrounding the coronavirus  Once the dust settles and the quantitative implication of this disease can be understood  these shares can adequately price in the impact  This stock still has long term potential  but its short term risks may outweigh this potential at the moment Additional content Beyond Meat Now Beyond ExpectationsWhile recent news coming out of Beyond Meat is mixed  it s weighted toward the positive side That s why investors weren t completely put out with the unsuccessful trial at Restaurant Brand International s Tim Hortons outlets in Canada  The Beyond Burger apparently wasn t quite what their customers wanted  So  following a scale down in September to two provinces  Ontario and British Columbia  the chain parted ways It was always meant to be a limited period item to help management separate the demand from the hype  But it was a big disappointment for Beyond Meat investors  because the company was expecting to get into 4 000 of its 4 800 locations in the U S  and Canada  However  both parties said they might collaborate again later This bit of bad news came at around the same time as some good news  It was reported that the family Diner Denny s had concluded a very successful trial in its Los Angeles restaurants  after which the company decided to bring the Beyond Burger  called  Denny s Beyond Burger  to all its 1 700 locations across the U S  and Canada The company is touting the same advantages over beef to those wanting to go  flexitarian   more protein  less saturated fat  no cholesterol  and as far as vegetarian sourcing goes  no soy  no gluten  no GMO  What s more  participating restaurants were offering guests a free Beyond Burger with the purchase of any beverage between 11 00 a m  and 10 00 p m as part of a single day promotion campaign And that isn t all  Perhaps the most important news is that KFC  also thrilled with the reception the company s Beyond Fried Chicken received at its first trial location in Atlanta  has decided to expand the test to 63 more locations in and around Nashville  Tennessee and Charlotte  North Carolina  The broader test is designed to help it determine the uptake at its other locations across the U S The companies have particularly focused on taste and texture with the vegan fried chicken offering  as taste is what gives KFC its popularity and texture is very important in a chicken offering because of the way that meat falls apart when bitten into  KFC can take Beyond Meat international  as the company has 23 000 stores in 140  countries and is the number one fast food chain in China  Denny s is already a done deal and KFC looks like it s getting ready for a big launch  So the question then is  will the company be able to serve up this big order  Turns out  it anticipated a surge in demand in 2020 and so  in November  tripled its pea protein supplies for the year Last month  it extended its agreement with French pea protein supplier Roquette for an additional period of three years  Now  Roquette is also scaling up its capabilities  It s investing more than half a billion euros over five years to expand its existing facility in France and open a new one in Manitoba  Canada It s also making acquisitions to boost its textured protein capabilities  Pea protein is the primary source ingredient  so it makes sense to corner supply  The fact that it seems to have succeeded in this  says a lot about its growth prospects this year Beyond Meat s valuation makes it impossible to recommend buying the stock  The shares have all the good news priced in and then some  Investor optimism seems ludicrous at this point  Okay  the company seems to be doing everything right  it s winning deals and all  but everyone seems to be discounting the upcoming competition from traditional meat producers  other vegan meat producers and lab meat producers that will very soon flood the market with alternatives So even if the product is better than the competition  the fact that there ll be more competition will have an effect on prices  and therefore  its profitability  Prices have to come down or growth has to catch up  or a little bit of both  So if you ve already put in money  hold tight  because this ship is unlikely to move much lower  But if you haven t  the risk to picking up shares is significant

What s Next for Wynn 
While Wynn has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

156413,377929,WYNN,Why Wynn Resorts Stock Popped 14 9  in December,news,"What happened
Shares of Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN  jumped 14 9  in December  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  following a positive development in the casino stock s key Macau market 
So what
To be sure  the bulk of Wynn s gains last month came after the People s Bank of China announced it would increase the daily limit individuals can wire from their accounts in the country to 80 000 yuan  or just over  11 400     a whopping 60  increase from the previous limit of 50 000 yuan  As fellow Fool Eric Volkman noted last month  the move will almost certainly increase gambling and spending habits in Macau  considering mainland Chinese citizens are easily the single largest group of visitors to the region 

The increased limits could serve as a tailwind to Wynn  which generated nearly 68  of its operating revenue in the Macau region last quarter  The company is also planning to build a new  2 billion expansion with construction starting in 2021  at its Macau based Wynn Palace  dubbed The Crystal Pavilion complex  including two hotel towers  gardens  a performance space  and interactive art exhibits  
Now what
Even so  we may not see the impact immediately considering Macau casinos as a whole ended 2019 on a down note  But if growth resumes with the help of China s increased daily wire transfer limits and a broader economic rebound in the country  Wynn should be nicely poised to benefit ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pf5x8,2054598

156477,377993,WYNN,Macau s casinos count cost of Hong Kong s escalating protests,news,"By Farah Master
HONG KONG  Reuters    Growing protests in the Asian financial center of Hong Kong are weighing on the neighboring Chinese territory of Macau as some visitors steer clear of the world s biggest gambling hub  worried over transport disruptions and safety concerns 
Hong Kong  a former British colony  has suffered a wave of sometimes violent protests since June as initial opposition to a now suspended extradition law evolved into a direct challenge to the government and calls for full democracy 
 When you have hundreds of flights canceled out of Hong Kong and some reluctance to travel  I do think that s impacting the premium end of the business   Matt Maddox  chief executive of Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   which runs two Macau casinos  said this week Macau is an hour away by ferry from Hong Kong or a 30 minute drive from its international airport  Nearly a third of Macau s visitors arrive by sea or a recently built bridge 
The protests are hitting Macau s gaming revenues just as it grapples with slowing economic growth in mainland China  which contributes the bulk of its gamblers  an escalating trade war between China and United States that is deterring VIP spenders and tighter government regulations   
Australia and the United States are among the nations that have raised travel advisories as Hong Kong reels from almost daily demonstrations that have spread across the city and occasionally hit a normally efficient transport network 
Casino executives and analysts said the protests were likely to affect gaming revenue for the next few weeks at least  in what is typically a busy period in the former Portuguese colony 
July s fall of 3 5  in gaming revenues was sharper than analysts had anticipated 
Vitaly Umansky  an analyst at Sanford C  Bernstein  said not much could be done to deflect headwinds for gaming revenues  as Chinese visitors have canceled trips 
Macau s Government Tourism Office told Reuters it was closely monitoring the situation and had told representatives to report on any plans and change of trips to Macau 
The government is urging tour groups to choose Macau as the first stop of their itinerary  paired with the coastal Chinese city of Zhuhai  rather than Hong Kong 
At Hong Kong s Shun Tak Center  where travelers board ferries for Macau  tour groups said the protests had caused their business to drop 30 percent or more from previous months 
The area around Shun Tak in the district of Sheung Wan near Beijing s representative office  has been a hotspot for protests with police firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators and forcing the center to close for safety reasons 
 We are worried about the social problems in Hong Kong  both the customers and us hope it can end soon   said a worker at one ferry company  Cotai Jet  She gave only her surname  Lau ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/macaus-casinos-count-cost-of-hong-kongs-escalating-protests-1949041,1949041
156478,377994,WYNN,Japan s Yokohama says to join race to host newly legalized casino,news,"TOKYO  Reuters    Yokohama  Japan s second largest city  raised its hand on Thursday to host a casino resort  a newly legalized industry the government hopes will stimulate the economy and tourism 
Yokohama  facing Tokyo Bay and located a short train ride from the capital  joins other candidates such as Osaka  Nagasaki and Wakayama vying to host integrated resorts  IR  expected to attract more tourists and investment 
 We must look to Yokohama s future  the 20 30 years ahead   Mayor Fumiko Hayashi told a news conference streamed on the city government s website  announcing its preparation of an official bid   I ve come to the conclusion that in order to achieve growth and development  we need IR  
Japan is widely seen as a prize market for casino operators due to its affluent population of 128 million and proximity to Asia s wealthy gamblers  The government is expected to allow casino resorts in three sites initially 
Japanese lawmakers finished legalizing casinos last year after a series of controversial bills and years of debate  with opponents citing risks of increased gambling addiction and organized crime activity 
Prolonged discussions meant no resorts will be open in time for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics  with the government yet to pick hosts and operators 
But new casino resorts are expected to help Japan maintain growth in tourism and investment after the Summer Games are over  Some analysts have said the casino market could be worth around  20 billion a year  or even more when opened in three cities

156479,377995,WYNN,StockBeat  Las Vegas Sands Climbs on Deutsche Bank Upgrade,news,"Investing com    Las Vegas Sands  climbed on Monday after   Deutsche Bank    DE DBKGn  upgraded its outlook on the casino operator  citing an  attractive  long term entry point  
The current odds are not in favor of gaming stocks  which have seen activity stutter in the key gambling region Macau  pressured by the Hong Kong protests and ongoing U S  China trade  But for  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   the weakness in the region creates an  attractive  long term entry  with the bank upgrading  Las Vegas Sands  to buy from hold  sending Las Vegas Sands  NYSE LVS  more than 2  higher  
A little over a week ago  data showed gross gaming revenues in Macau fell in August for the second straight month  Gaming revenues from Macau  the world s largest gambling hub  declined 8 6  in August year on year  
As well as the ongoing U S  China trade war and protests in Hong Kong  competition from Asian casino operators in Macau has also kept a lid on growth for U S  gambling companies  
Against the backdrop of headwinds in Macau  U S  gaming companies have found a semblance of support in the expansion of U S  sports betting following the repeal   in May last year   of the Professional and Amateur Sports Provision Act of 1992  which paved the way for individual states to introduce legislation permitting sports betting

156489,378005,WYNN,Will Wynn  WYNN  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   which belongs to the Zacks Gaming industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This casino operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 33  
For the most recent quarter  Wynn was expected to post earnings of  1 42 per share  but it reported  1 44 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 41   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 59 per share  while it actually produced  1 61 per share  a surprise of 1 26  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Wynn  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Wynn currently has an Earnings ESP of  32 55   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-wynn-wynn-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200471203,200471203

156491,378007,WYNN,Earnings Preview  Wynn Resorts  WYNN  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This casino operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  45 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 67 billion  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 15 18  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wynn 
For Wynn  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  8 36  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Wynn will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Wynn would post earnings of  1 42 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 44  delivering a surprise of  1 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

156563,378079,WYNN,MarketPulse  Canada Goose  MGM Resorts Dent Consumer Discretionary Stocks,news,"Investing com   Canada Goose shares plunged midday Thursday  despite blowout earnings  leaving Wall Street watchers a bit puzzled as to why this high flying stock was shot down 
Shares of Canada Goose  NYSE GOOS  fell nearly 12  
The apparel maker reported fiscal third quarter earnings of C 0 96 a share on revenue of C 399 3 million  beating estimates compiled by Investing com for earnings of C 0 61 on revenue of C 269 86 million 
The strong results  which sent shares up premarket  seemingly played second fiddle to signs U S  consumers may be starting to tighten their belts after retail sales dropped by the most in nine years 
Department store sales were of particular concern  dropping 3 3  in December  the most since January 2016 
The United States accounts for roughly a third of Canada Goose s total revenue 
Some also pointed to the company s ambitious expansion plan in China as a potential headwind as it comes at a time when China s economy is showing signs of a slowdown 
Consumer discretionary was also stifled by a drop in MGM Resorts as investors punished the company for posting a surprise loss 
MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM  posted a reported earnings of  0 14 a share on revenue of  3 05 billion in the fourth quarter  exceeding estimates from Investing com for earnings of  0 13 on revenue of  2 99 billion 
The company s outlook for 2019 was  prudent  but  reasonable   according to Union Gaming 
 We believe management delivered an upbeat but prudent picture for 2019 that pinned  1 773m of Consensus EBITDA for the Las Vegas Strip as a reasonable forecast today   Union Gaming analyst John DeCree said in a note 
But the mixed report did draw cheers from some analysts on Wall Street 
 We see a potential rejuvenation at MGM s Las Vegas resorts and at the regional operations   said CFRA  an independent research provider   Also  MGM seems poised to consolidate its market share gains in China

156572,378088,WYNN,How To Profit Off Of The Gambling Capital Of The World,opinion,"The gambling capital of the world  Macau  China  a region that brings in more than 5 times the gambling revenue of Las Vegas  has American casino investors at the edge of their seats  Within the most populous country in the world  Macau is the only place in which casinos are allowed and they are booming  Some of the largest US casinos bring in a majority of their income from Macau operations
Macau just released its strongest year over year growth figures all year for June causing US casino stocks like Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    MGM International   NYSE MGM   and Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS   to jump this week  So far this week WYNN is up 6 2   LVS is up 5   and MGM is up 0 8   with these returns aligning with each companies  Macau exposure 
WYNN is the most exposed to China with over 75  of its EBITDA being driven by Macau  followed by LVS which derives almost 60  of its EBITDA from Macau operations  and MGM is the least exposed with 24  of its EBITDA coming from this region  Macau is driving that majority of all three of these firms growth with this region s total gambling revenue growing strong double digit figures in the last 2 years 
Below is Macau s year over year casino revenue growth by month  2017 and  18 both saw robust expansion while 2019 has seen a slowdown  The past 2 months Macau has experienced positive growth and these casinos are hoping this growth can continue 

 Gambling Performance
The US China trade war is impacting these highly exposed casinos indirectly  Gambling firms typically have a high betas because they generally do well when the overall populous is doing well  If the general population has extra discretionary spending as well as positive income outlook they feel much more comfortable gambling with a portion of it  This trade war has caused a bit of uncertainty about future income for the Chinese  leading gambling revenues in Macau to experience a deceleration 
Over the last 52 weeks the least exposed casino to China  MGM  has performed the best while the most exposed  WYNN  has performed the worst  This trend has reversed since the start of 2019 with WYNN seeing returns of over 35  as the Chinese gambling outlook continues to brighten 

Valuation
LVS and WYNN are both trading at enterprise values that are 10x their forward EBITDA  EV EBITDA   which is on the lower end of their 5 year trend with highs around 14x and lows around 8 5x 

Wynn Resorts is the most volatile of the three both because of its substantial amount of leverage combined with its excessive China exposure 
MGM  WYNN  and LVS all pay out a yield of 1 8   3   and 5  in dividends annually  These dividend yields are a nice cushy fixed income for stocks that experience a considerable amount of volatility 
Take Away 
As the trade war subsides and China s economy stabilizes  these China exposed casinos could show investors a sizable return 
LVS is the largest publicly traded casino in the world and is my casino pick  It has the international exposure to drive growth in the future but less leverage than WYNN  It is able to boast reasonable valuation multiples with both forward EV EBITDA and P E falling below the industry average and both multiples are sitting on the lower side of this firm s 5 year trend  The massive 5  dividend yield that LVS hands out to investors annually gives me some peace of mind about jumping into such a volatile stock 
All of these stocks hold a significant amount of risk and I would limit exposure  but they have a place in a well diversified portfolio

156597,378113,WYNN,US China Trade Tensions Re Escalate  7 Vulnerable ETF Areas,opinion,"The U S  China trade tensions flared up all over again with the Trump saying in a Sunday afternoon Twitter post that the current 10  tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods will jump to 25  on Friday  He also said to levy 25  levies on an extra  325 billion of Chinese goods  shortly     Following the latest tweet  China is reportedly mulling over  
Investors should note that President Donald Trump announced a delay in the increase of tariffs on about  200 billion worth of Chinese goods in late February  citing  substantial progress  in trade talks with Beijing 
A group of market watchers believe that Trump s decision to more than double the tariff rate on  200 billion of goods was intended to warn China not to start negotiations with more  empty offers   per CNBC 
Following are the ETF areas that are in the risk amid escalating trade tensions between the United States and China 
China   Asia
Chinese markets slumped more than 5  in the morning trading session of Monday  reacting to the U S  threat  China ETFs like China A iShares MSCI ETF   CSOP FTSE China A50 ETF   NYSE AFT   and Asia Pacific ETFs like iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF    andiShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF    are likely to come under pressure 
Dow Jones   Industrials
Since the trade tensions would leave a significant negative impact on the industrial and manufacturing sector  such stocks may slump  SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average  NYSE DIA  ETF   V DIA   and Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLI   may thus slip 
Global Markets  Mainly Emerging Asia 
U S  China trade spat was a bother for almost the entire world  The IMF had also previously cautioned that a full scale trade war could impede global growth  All world ETF iShares MSCI ACWI ETF  and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  NYSE EEM   may also be in the red in the near term 
Semiconductor
U S  chipmakers have the largest sales exposure to China  So  renewed tariff tensions with China could bring back pain in the semiconductor space iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  is thus in a vulnerable position 
Auto
U S  auto companies earn about 12  revenues from China  With Beijing slamming tariffs on U S  auto imports  First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund  would come under pressure  read    
Casino
U S  casino companies like Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN     Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS   and MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   have considerable exposure to China  The former two have respective revenue exposure of about  to China  Along with these stocks  casino gaming ETF VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF  should thus suffer 
Agriculture
Agricultural products like yellow and black soybean had faced retaliatory tariffs from China  Notably  China purchases about half of the U S  soybean and is the second largest buyer of American cotton  So  Teucrium Soybean ETF  and the broader agriculture ETF Invesco DB Agriculture   MI DBA   may face risks  read

Of all the ETFs we track  BJK has generated the biggest average April return of 5 3   according to data from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  Further  it s one of the few funds that have ended April in the black at least 80  of the time over the past decade 

The shares of BJK have added nearly 10  so far in 2019 but recently ran into a wall in the  38 region  This level has acted as a roadblock for the ETF since October  and also represents a 38 2  Fibonacci retracement of the fund s fall from its May highs to its Dec  26 lows  Further  the formerly supportive 160 day moving average has descended into the area and contained BJK s rally attempt in late February  At last check  the ETF was trading around  36 25  Another 5 3  bump from current levels would place the shares around  38 17  right around its February highs

Steve Wynn sold 4 1 million shares of Wynn Resorts at  180 per share  the filing showed  which now makes him the third biggest shareholder in the company  behind his former wife Elaine Wynn and The Vanguard Group Inc  according to Thomson Reuters data 
Wynn Resorts  shares dipped 0 8 percent to  177 50 in trading ahead of the opening bell 
The casino mogul s share sale comes a week after Wynn Resorts said Steve and Elaine Wynn  who has a 9 26 percent stake  had scrapped a shareholder agreement that prevented them from selling their stakes 
Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of the Las Vegas based company last month  following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances  He has denied the accusations 
Analysts have said Wynn Resorts may become a takeover target following the departure of Steve Wynn  who was a strategic visionary and the chief diplomat for the company 

Elaine Wynn said in a regulatory filing earlier this week that she may hold talks with Wynn Resorts shareholders and management regarding the company s strategy  capital structure and allocation  and board composition  among others ",2018-03-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/casino-mogul-steve-wynn-lowers-stake-in-wynn-resorts-to-78-percent-1354011,1354011
156739,378255,WYNN,Forget Wynn  Buy This Growth   Income Casino Stock Instead ,opinion,"Casinos are often popular dividend paying picks  but the industry has come under significant pressure these year amid sluggish performances in key gambling hotspots 
This was underscored on Wednesday afternoon with the latest earnings report from Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    The casino giant posted profits of  1 68 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nine cents  and warned of a  slowdown  in Macau 
A downtrend in Macau is concerning for Wynn  which depends on the Asian gambling destination to attract premium players  Management suggested traffic from high rollers was also soft in Singapore and Las Vegas 
Shares of the already struggling stock plummeted about 12  on Thursday as a result of this tepid outlook  Wynn currently holds a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Weak performances in Macau and Las Vegas extend to many other casino giants  so this probably was not great news to hear if you are at all interested in gambling stocks  That said  there are some better options out there in this space 
For instance  Gaming and Leisure Properties   NASDAQ GLPI   is a REIT that owns regional casino properties and leases them to operators like Penn National Gaming   NASDAQ PENN   and Boyd Gaming   NYSE BYD    Buying a regional gambling property owner solves two problems  it moves you away from the trouble areas of Vegas and Macau  and it protects you from needing to fret over short term trends regardless 
GLPI has witnessed a strong uptick in its projected funds from operations  FFOs   but shares have been stuck in a rut lately  This presents an interesting buying opportunity  as we expect share prices to eventually follow the uptrend in FFOs 
Moreover  GLPI is an interesting growth pick because it has a remarkable acquisition history  This is buoying its top line  as evidenced by its projected revenue growth of 21  next year  Plus  its status as a REIT gives investors a much bigger dividend  GLPI consistently raises this payout and currently presents a yield of 7 5

156742,378258,WYNN,MGM Versus LVS  Which Casino Stock Is Worth The Gamble Now ,opinion,Operators of integrated casino  hotel and entertainment resorts seldom fail to build businesses as demand for casino services is relatively inelastic  This is because casinos attract a particular set of consumers whose preferences remain more or less similar in adverse market conditions In addition to this  the legalization of sports betting outside Nevada has widened the scope for casino operators since illegal betting is valued at billions of dollars annually in the United States  Further  casino operators are collaborating with the hospitality sector  setting up luxury hotels and generating high margin non gaming revenues  Subsequently  backed by discretionary spending and a stable demand for casino services  the industry is poised to witness long term growth But the industry has its share of hurdles to overcome  Slowdown in Macau gaming revenues continues to be a concern for the industry in the short run  Moreover  a trade war between Beijing and Washington is hurting casino operators in Macau  Though gaming revenues from Macau increased for the 27th consecutive month in October  the growth rate has softened since the second quarter  Additionally  waning property price in China impacted the high end VIP segment Against such a backdrop  leading casino companies like Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    Penn National Gaming  Inc    NASDAQ PENN    Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   and MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   are continuously devising strategies to drive revenues and profits  In response to a rapidly evolving and dynamic market  Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts are capitalizing on the significant profit associated with the business  Both the companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and have respective market capitalization of  40 4 billion and  13 6 billion  You can see Let us find out which stock is set to serve better returns to investors Price Performance and Earnings   Revenue EstimatesArguably  earnings growth is of the utmost importance for determining a stock s potential as surging profit levels indicate solid prospects  and stock price gains   For 2018  Las Vegas Sands  earnings are expected to grow 10 9   Moreover  its 2018 year over year sales growth is projected to be 6 7   MGM Resorts  2018 earnings and sales are likely to improve 5 9  and 8 3   respectively MGM Resorts  shares have lost 21 1  in the past year while Las Vegas Sands  shares declined 20 8   Meanwhile  the  recorded collective decline of 30 7  ValuationSince casino stocks are debt laden  it makes sense to value those based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just its equity but also the level of debt on a company s balance sheet For capital intensive companies  the EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is unaffected by changing capital structures and ignores effects of non cash expenses on a company s value  The trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of MGM Resorts is 26 82 while that of Las Vegas Sands is 14 06  With the industry average being 19 82x  Las Vegas Sands has an edge over MGM Resorts Debt RatioSince the sector has high financial leverage  debt to asset ratio comes into the picture  Both the companies  excessive reliance on debt financing is a concern  As of Sep 30  2018  cash and cash equivalents of MGM Resorts were  1 3 billion compared with a much higher long term debt of  14 7 billion  For Las Vegas Sands  unrestricted cash balance was  4 8 billion as of Sep 30  2018  However  total debt outstanding   including the current portion  and net of deferred financing costs and original issue discount   was as high as  12 billion By looking at debt to asset ratio  we can have a sense of a company s ability to meet its long term debt  Leisure stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios  implying higher proportion of the company s assets over the long term  Las Vegas Sands  debt ratio is 51 3 compared with the industry s 55 8 and MGM Resorts  48 9 Return on Equity   Net MarginLas Vegas Sands delivered a return on equity  ROE  of 34 2  in the trailing 12 months compared with 4 5  growth recorded by the industry  MGM Resorts  ROE is 4 5   This indicates that Las Vegas Sands reinvests more efficiently than MGM Resorts Traditionally  gross margin for the hospitality companies is comparatively higher as majority of expenses come from the cost of operations  However  the sector s profits are not very high  which is evident from the net profit margin or net margin  The industry s trailing 12 month net margin is 3 2  while that of Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts is 27 7  and 16 8   respectively Bottom LineWhile Las Vegas Sands  projected earnings and margins are more promising than MGM Resorts   the latter s debt ratio is encouraging  However  Las Vegas Sands surpasses MGM Resorts in terms of valuation  ROE and share price movement  Please take a look at the following table to compare the two gaming giants Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP

U S  stocks moved sharply higher in morning trading Wednesday  as Wall Street saw what it expected from the midterms and investors could collectively move past the uncertainty of the election cycle 
This broad rally did not guarantee gains for those on the earnings front  however  A number of notable companies that reported either Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning were plummeting in morning trading  with investors apparently only willing to reward the strongest beat and raise quarters 
For instance  video game headset maker Turtle Beach   NASDAQ HEAR   notched revenue growth of 107  and said that it has captured 490 basis points of market share so far this year  But investors were not convinced  and the one time momentum darling fell about 13  in morning trading today 
Another company witnessing similar volatility is Match Group   NASDAQ MTCH    The Tinder parent company reported a comfortable earnings beat and saw its top line improve by 49  from the prior year quarter  but soft guidance for the current quarter battered shares to the tune of an 18  early morning loss 
Luxury brand Michael Kors   NYSE KORS   is also watching its stock sell off after reporting before the bell Wednesday  The company topped earnings estimates  and even though its pending of acquisition of Versace should open up key growth avenues soon  a rare revenue miss sent shares tumbling about 15  shortly after the open 
Nevertheless  things were not all bad for the trendy stocks  Cloud based automated messing service Twilio   NYSE TWLO   was absolutely skyrocketing in morning trading after its report  as the young firm reported better than expected results and guidance  Shares of the San Francisco based company added more than 30  in morning hours 
This type of positive post earnings momentum will hope to be matched by those reporting after the bell today  including Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   and Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM    Interested in hearing more about these upcoming reports  or the stocks that are moving dramatically after already reporting  Make sure to check out today s episode of Free Lunch

Macau s Lower Than Expected Gambling Revenues
Gambling revenues from Macau increased 12 1  to 25 5 billion patacas   3 16 billion  in May  The metric not only lagged analyst expectations but also declined 0 9  from the figure registered in April  Although gambling revenues were up for the 22nd straight months  it still remains below the highest level achieved in 2012

As a result  footfall declined at the local casinos  leading to a constant decrease in gaming revenues  A slowdown in China  tighter visa policies  political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes  Nevertheless  Macau s gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016  with new resorts attracting high rollers and leisure gamblers 
MGM Resorts to Buy Empire City Casino
MGM Resorts and MGM Growth Properties LLC have reached an agreement to buy Empire City Casino s race track and casino  If Empire City gets a license for live table games on or before Dec 31  2022 and MGM Resorts accepts it by Dec 31  2024  then the latter will pay an additional amount of  50 million to the former  Valued at  850 million  the deal is expected to close in first quarter 2019 
On completion of the deal  MGP will acquire the developed real property related to Empire City from MGM Resorts and will lease it to a subsidiary of the same  MGM Resorts subsidiary will control the property  The deal will help the company solidify its position on the East Coast  where MGM Resorts has been constantly increasing its presence over the past two years  
MGM Resorts said that  With Empire City s approximately 40 percent share of gross gaming revenues in the market  we believe there are significant opportunities for MGM Resorts to further drive growth   The company expects the deal to be value assertive within the first year of closing  In 2017  Empire City recorded net revenues of nearly  230 million and  70 million in adjusted EBITDA 
We believe this latest buyout will be a major growth driver for the company  This is because Empire City Casino not only has 5 200 slots and electronic table games but also offers live and simulcast horse racing  besides numerous dining outlets

What s Lies Ahead for Wynn Resorts 
Wynn Resorts generates a solid share of its revenues from Macau resorts  Apart from the gaming business in Macau  the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non gaming revenues  Given the decent visitation pattern in Macau  infrastructure development and government s efforts to boost tourism in Macau  non gaming sources are expected to drive revenues moving ahead 
Moreover  the company s full scale integrated resort in Cotai  Macau  is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term  This  in turn  should fortify Wynn Resorts  position in the Cotai strip 
Notably  such projects are expected to draw business and leisure travelers  and provide a solid platform for growth  In fact  building resorts in Asia should help the company capitalize on strong consumer spending trend in the region  Meanwhile  in Wynn Palace  the company is working on two new restaurant concepts that are expected to add significantly to the non gaming business 
Also  the government of China is considering measures to support Macau s economy and introduce favorable policies  which are expected to improve visitation pattern and increase tourism and traffic in the region  These stratergic initiatives include approval of Macau s maritime expansion plans that is expected to boost shipping and tourism  Also  the government has allowed mainland Chinese cities to offer multi entry permits

156799,378315,WYNN,Wynn Resorts Stocks Take A Hit After Missing Revenue Target,opinion,"Investors in Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN  are feeling the heat after the casino behemoth saw its stocks take a tumble following bad news from Macau  one of the gambling capitals of the world  A late June slowdown in business has seen gaming revenues emanating from Macau plummet  with dire results for casino stocks around the market  Few companies have been hit as badly as Wynn Resorts  however  which has been struggling all year 
Here s how Wynn Resorts are shaping up after recent disappointing results  and what would be investors will want to know about the company s dire straits before throwing their money behind it 
Revenues are up  but not by enough
Wynn Resorts has much of its business tied up in Macau  where the gaming industry is in a peculiar spot right now  technically speaking  gaming revenues in Macau actually swelled by some 25 9 percent in June  for instance  Nonetheless  casinos that rely heavily on revenue streams from Macau are hurting  primarily because that 25 9 percent figure was short of the 26 8 percent growth that was actually expected by industry analysts  The disappointing financial results have had wide ranging consequences around the market  and hit Wynn Resorts and other Las Vegas giants particularly hard 
The slump in expected revenue growth was likely due to a visit to Hong Kong my Chinese President Xi Jinping  which caused weekend revenues in casinos to slump thanks to a decline in tourism  Wynn Resorts has two hotels in Macau  and has previously relied on revenues from Macau to fund expansion projects  An ambition to open up an additional strip hotel in Las Vegas was primarily borne of profits from Macau  for instance  This could be worrying to some investors  because future geopolitical events in the region could disrupt revenues from Wynn Resorts holdings in Macau in the near future  too 
Some analysts also consider the hefty amounts of attention and money the World Cup is receiving right now to be partly responsible for the decline in attention being paid to gambling resorts in Macau  As China s only legal casino hub  it s essentially a vital artery in the gaming industry  and companies like Wynn Resorts simply can t afford additional bumps in the road when it comes to future income derived from Macau based holdings 
On the bright side  Wynn Resorts may have an easier time with authorities in Macau in the near future  That s because Steve Wynn  the former chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts  has resigned from his position in disgrace after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him  While this was bad news for the company s image  he had a poor relationship with authorities in Macau that could perhaps be mended now that he s out of the picture 
Wynn Resorts needs to calm investors
If Wynn Resorts wants to prevent this bad news from seriously hampering its stock performance in the long term  it needs to do more to reassure investors that their financial futures are safe and sound  Stocks plummeted by more than 8 percent at one point thanks to the bad news from Macau  after all  so it s more than fair to say that many shareholders are likely anxious about how the company s executives will respond to the recent dip in revenue 
Future hotel expansions and casino online projects could be indefinitely delayed if revenue continues to slump  although Macau s gaming industry as a whole does seem to have a fairly bright future ahead of it  The only good news for Wynn Resorts amidst all this Macau madness it that many of its competitors are feeling the heat  too  MGM Resorts and Las Vegas Sands are two major competitors of Wynn Resorts  and both are faring poorly on the market after the recent revenue woes  too  Thus  investors concerned about Wynn Resort s unique situation are thus likely to be relieved by the fact that this problem isn t unique to Wynn alone 
The gaming industry as a whole has many reasons to be optimistic about the future  too  After all  sports gambling was recently legalized  which could usher in a new era of gaming spending that could buoy companies like Wynn Resorts  who are well positioned to exploit this recent legal development  If traditional Las Vegas titans like Wynn Resorts can capitalize on the rapidly emerging sports gaming market  they re likely to see additional sources of revenue that could help offset losses in Macau  If China s gambling hub continues to see dire days  however  Wynn Resorts and other mainstays of the Las Vegas strip are likely in for a grim performance in the market  Don t look too much into the recent dip in Wynn Resorts  stocks  the lackluster figures from Macau aren t the end of the world  and aren t likely to repeat themselves  Similarly  new opportunities opening up in the gaming industry present companies like Wynn Resorts with plenty of opportunities to win back lost business ",2018-07-04,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wynn-resorts-stocks-take-a-hit-after-missing-revenue-target-200329278,200329278

156821,378337,WYNN,Should You Buy Wynn Resorts Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   experienced marginal gains on Monday  just one day before the company is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results  This climb is part of a larger 9  surge over the last four weeks  which might suggest that investors are expecting big things from the resort and casino giant in Q1 
Wynn looks like it could be set for even more changes on top after Elaine Wynn recently demanded that the company   She asked that one of Wynn s directors overseeing the internal investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn be removed  noting he is too closely allied to Mr  Wynn 
This move could go a long way in further distancing Wynn from its embattled former CEO  But beyond a positive public relations move  investors will want to understand what to expect from Wynn s first quarter to see if the stock might be worth buying before the company reports its Q1 results on Tuesday afternoon 
Latest Outlook   Valuation
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Wynn s revenues to climb by 15 5  to  1 70 billion  Investors might be even more pleased to note that the company s earnings are projected to reach  1 96 per share  which would mark a 58  expansion from the year ago period 
Of course  top and bottom line growth estimates are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Wynn reports its first quarter financial results  We can also turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file to help prepare 
The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts 
According to these consensus estimates  Wynn is on track to report Macau revenues of  638 million in Q1  This would mark a roughly 34  climb from the year ago period  in a unit that is quickly becoming one of the resort giant s most important businesses  Last quarter  Wynn reported  618 6 million in Macau revenue  which marked a 24 1  jump 
Heading into Monday  Wynn was trading with a Forward P E of 23 2  which marked a slight premium to the  Gaming  industry s average of 21 3  With that said  the company is currently offering investors strong comparative value against its median Forward P E of 25 1  Wynn also sits well below the 29 3x forward earnings it was trading at near the end of January   
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to understand what chance Wynn has to surprise with better than expected earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Wynn is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and holds an Earnings ESP of 5 45   The company s Most Accurate Estimate the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment calls for earnings of  2 07 per share  which comes in 11 cents above our current consensus estimate  Therefore  Wynn is a stock that could be ready to top Q1 earnings estimates 
Surprise History
Wynn s earnings surprise history and the effect that these surprises have had on its share prices are two other important factors to consider ahead of the casino power s first quarter earnings report Wynn Resorts  Limited Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   We can see that Wynn has posted strong earnings results over the last year  posting an average earnings surprise of 22 43  during this period  However  these beats haven t always led to positive momentum immediately following Wynn s quarterly earnings release 
We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report  Wynn stock has turned negative in two of these windows over the last four quarters 
Wynn is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results after market close on Tuesday  April 24  Investors will want to pay close attention to Wynn s Q1 performance as other industry giants  including Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS   and MGM Resorts   NYSE MGM    report their quarterly financial results later this week 
Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-buy-wynn-resorts-stock-ahead-of-q1-earnings-200308065,200308065

156865,378381,WYNN,Can Cost Cut Efforts Favor Extended Stay  STAY  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Extended Stay America  Inc    NYSE STAY   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 26  after market close 
While the company s expense containment and cost saving measures are expected to have favored first quarter earnings  revenues in the quarter might have been affected by a shift in Easter date  Also  limited international presence continues to be a headwind for the company s revenues 
Notably  shares of Extended Stay have gained 17  in the past year  underperforming the  s growth of 30 9  in the same time period

Tricky Top Line Scenario
Extended Stay looks to drive its revenue per available room  ReVPAR  by providing suitable services to value conscious business travelers  In 2017  its ReVPAR increased 1 7  from the prior year quarter on 1 1  growth in Average Daily Rate  ADR  and 40 basis points  bps  expansion in occupancy  Management believes that this upside trend will continue in the first quarter of 2018 by 1 3  
However  the company predicts 50 75 bps negative impact on ReVPAR due to a shift in Easter date  Moreover  the company s lack of exposure in emerging markets might limit its revenue growth potential 
The consensus estimate for revenues in the first quarter is pegged at  289 78 million  reflecting a decline of 0 4  from the prior year quarter 
Our Quantitative Model Predicts a Beat
Extended Stay has the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat

Latest News
Former Wynn CEO Steve Wynn  who resigned recently amid sexual assault and harassment allegations  now  intends to sell all or a portion  of his stock in the company  Mr  Wynn is currently the company s largest shareholder  holding roughly  of outstanding shares 
Mr  Wynn could potentially sell up to 12 1 million shares of Wynn stock  which would be valued at roughly  2 2 billion  based on Wednesday s price  However  the company noted in Wednesday s SEC filing that  no assurance  can be made on whether Mr  Wynn will elect to sell his stock or how he will choose to do it 
This news comes after two months of stories and legal battles surrounding Mr  Wynn s sexual misconduct allegations  Mr  Wynn has denied these allegations  despite reaching a  7 5 million settlement with at least one accuser 
It seems that Wynn shareholders are unclear how to feel about this potential move  which could temporarily devalue their stock if over 12 million shares flood the market  On the other hand  if Mr  Wynn does indeed sell some or all of his stock  the company could be headed for a potential takeover  which some investors might welcome amid these uncertain times 
However  in spite of the allegations against the former CEO and the possibility that he might sell a large chunk of the company  Wynn is expected to perform rather well in 2018 
Looking Ahead 
Wynn s Q1 revenues are projected to surge over 14  to reach  1 68 billion  while the casino giant s full year sales are expected to climb by 10 2  to hit  6 95 billion  The company is also expected to see its earnings soar 
Wynn is projected to see its quarterly earnings skyrocket 54   while its fiscal 2018 EPS figure is expected to jump by 43 2  to reach 7 82 per share  These bottom line expansion projections might ease some worries while Wynn faces public scrutiny 
Analysts have also turned more positive recently regarding Wynn s 2018 financial outlook  Wynn has earned multiple earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter  the following quarter  the current full year  and the following full year  with 100  agreement to the upside all within the last 60 days 
Bottom Line 
Wynn stock might be one investors consider buying up  as Mr  Wynn s alleged misconduct doesn t look like it will hurt the company s performance in the near term  Wynn is also currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system

156902,378418,WYNN,Japan s Universal accuses founder Okada of improper loan,news,"By Nathan Layne  Reuters     Universal Entertainment  Corp  T 6425   a Japanese maker of slot machines  said on Thursday it was investigating what it suspects was an improper transfer of funds by Kazuo Okada  its founder and chairman  to a company he controls   In a statement on Universal s website issued under the name of the company s president  Universal said it had found the possibility of  fraudulent acts  related to a 2015 loan of HK 135 million   17 31 million  to an unnamed third party   The statement says that all but HK 5 million of the loan was subsequently transferred to Okada Holdings Limited  a company controlled by Okada and his son  and that the purpose of the loan was  to achieve personal benefit for Chairman Okada   Okada Holdings holds a majority stake in Universal  whose shares fell 6 1 percent to 3 250 yen Friday morning in Tokyo  The statement says the transfer was carried out by Okada and another director  Yoshinao Negishi  A week earlier  the company said both men would not be reappointed to the board at its annual shareholder meeting this month   Okada could not be reached for comment  David Krakoff  a lawyer who is representing Okada and Universal Entertainment in an unrelated U S  civil legal proceeding  did not respond to an email or phone call requesting comment   Negishi did not respond to messages to a social media account seeking comment   No one at Universal could be reached  The statement was released in the evening Tokyo time after normal working hours  The company s president  Jun Fujimoto  could not be reached for comment   Universal Entertainment said it has established an investigative panel composed of three external lawyers to further probe the transfer of funds  with an interim report expected to be completed around the end of June   Okada  who founded the predecessor of Universal in 1969 and ranks among Japan s wealthiest people  has focused much of his time recently on a  2 4 billion casino resort that opened earlier this year in the Philippines  Okada has billed the ambitious project as a way to tap into the growth of Asian gaming and to diversify Universal s revenues beyond its mainstay business of selling machines for pachinko  a mix of slot and pinball that is the dominant form of gambling in Japan   It is not the first boardroom drama involving Okada  who was ousted as a director of U S  casino operator Wynn Resorts  O WYNN  in 2012 based on allegations by Wynn s board that he had wined and dined Philippine gaming officials in possible violation of U S  anti bribery laws  Okada has denied these allegations and is fighting Wynn in a civil lawsuit in Nevada alleging his ouster was wrongful   Separate from the boardroom battles  Okada and his companies remain under investigation by the FBI over a  40 million payment to a Manila based consultant in 2010  The FBI s probe is focused on whether the payment was aimed at helping Universal gain tax and ownership concessions for the casino from the Philippine government  according to people with knowledge of the matter   
Universal and Okada have denied any wrongdoing and filed a defamation lawsuit against Reuters in 2012 for its reporting on the payments  The Tokyo District Court ruled in 2015 that Universal s case was without merit  Last year the Tokyo High Court upheld that ruling  dismissing Universal s appeal  Universal has appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan ",2017-06-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/japan’s-universal-accuses-founder-okada-of-improper-loan-493598,493598

156913,378429,WYNN,Mattel Hit By Toys  R  Us Bankruptcy  Underperforming Brands,opinion,"Mattel  Inc    NASDAQ MAT   is grappling with the impacts of Toys  R  Us bankruptcy  sluggish performance of brands and pressure on margins 
The company s fourth quarter 2017 results missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the earnings and revenues front  Both the metrics also declined significantly on a year over year basis 
Additionally  Mattel has a dismal surprise history with the company missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 192 68  
In a year s time  the company s shares have lost 34 6  against the  s gain of 38 4  

 
Toys  R  Us Bankruptcy Continues to Hurt Revenues
The Toys  R  Us  Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in September  2017 has been an added concern for the already suffering toy industry players  Mattel s gross sales decreased 9  in 2017 compared with the 2016 figure  Reversal of roughly  47 million of gross sales associated with Toys  R  Us bankruptcy filing led to the decline 
Mattel  Inc  Revenue  TTM 
    
Major Brands Continue to Underperform
Continual sluggish performance of key brands is another strong reason behind decline of revenues in 2017  In fact  Mattel s all the major brands have witnessed a decline in gross sales in the year compared with 2016  While revenues at Mattel Girls   Boys Brands declined 4   the same at Fisher Price Brands  American Girl Brands and Construction and Arts   Crafts Brands were down 11   21  and 29   respectively 
Margins Remain Under Pressure
Due to a simplified cost savings initiative that included write downs of excess owned inventory and impairment of assets  the company s adjusted gross margin contracted 850 basis points  bps  in 2017 
Moving ahead  costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives  and cleaning up inventories coupled with the development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure  Thus  the company pushed out its longer term target of achieving the low end of the 15 20  operating margin range from 2018 until 2019 
To Conclude
Although the company continues to make strategic investments in its brands and focus on improving its point of sales  POS   it will take some time for all the brands to show consistent improvement  However  given the strong product line up that includes core brands  licensed brands and lucrative product associations  Mattel remains well positioned for growth in the long term

156943,378459,WYNN,Wynn Resorts  Stock And Importance Of Corporate Governance,opinion,"The  metoo movement is now coming to corporations  After a year of success  Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN  has seen its value fall by nearly 20 percent in two days since the Wall Street Journal reported that casino mogul Steve Wynn had sexually harassed or assaulted multiple women  Wynn has denied the allegations and remains CEO of Wynn Resorts  but was forced to step down as the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee 
If investors wish to divest themselves of Wynn Resorts because they find the allegations against Wynn credible and do not wish to associate themselves with the company for ethical reasons  there is nothing wrong with that  But there are also practical reasons to believe that the allegations no longer make Wynn Resorts a value investment 
Wynn Resorts could be attacked on multiple fronts  from losing Steve Wynn s genius to facing a backlash from consumers to facing government investigations of their licenses  Furthermore  other companies have to look at Wynn Resorts  struggles and gain a newfound appreciation of proper corporate governance and taking a firm stance against sexual harassment 
Wynn Resorts and Wynn
Steve Wynn has been in the casino business for 50 years and built multiple casinos before founding Wynn Resorts in 2002  But because he is such a titan in the casino industry  Wynn Resorts would suffer far more without his genius than other companies would upon losing their CEO  According to   J P  Morgan analyst Joseph Greff wrote that  a scenario where  Wynn resorts  doesn t have Steve as a CEO is not good for the company   Wynn Resorts sets itself apart from its competitors largely through Steve Wynn s leadership  Without him  they are just another casino chain 
However  Wynn Resorts may not lose Wynn  As noted above  Wynn has denied the allegations and there is currently no indication that he plans to resign  But if Wynn does stay  Wynn Resorts faces an even more serious problem of having their gambling licenses reexamined  Most gambling licenses require their owners to exhibit good character  and multiple U S  states such as Massachusetts and Nevada have announced that they are reviewing his gaming license 
What probably has Wynn Resorts most worried is not the United States  but Macau  Most of Wynn s adjusted earnings come from Macau  the only area of China where gambling is legal  In Wynn Resorts  most recent earnings report last week  they beat expectations in earnings per share and net sales on the strength of their Macau properties despite a decrease of sales in Las Vegas 
Wynn Macau  HK 1128  shares in Hong Kong fell  though not as much as the United States  There have been some suggestions that because the  metoo movement is not as large in China compared to the United States  Wynn Resorts will be able to rebound through their Macau casinos 
But on Tuesday morning  the  reported that Macau regulators will  seek more information about sexual misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire  and were concerned about the reports  This is incredibly bad timing for Wynn since he will have to renegotiate their licenses in 2019  While China will probably not drive Wynn s businesses away  they will almost certainly hope to use these allegations as leverage to squeeze Wynn more  This is especially true given high Chinese levels of debt as well as the fact that Wynn has lost political leverage due to his RNC resignation 
Corporate Governance and Wynn
The fundamental question which those interested in Wynn Resorts have to answer is this  how badly will the company be affected by the sexual harassment allegations  Remember that Las Vegas based Wynn is the first public CEO since the rise of the  metoo movement to be accused  and the company will likely lose customers  companies as a result  Remember that as noted above  Wynn Resorts  Las Vegas sales fell last quarter even before these allegations came out 
But the buck may not stop at just Steve Wynn  as the board may be at risk of civil lawsuit for failing to act earlier  The board may argue that they are not responsible for tracking Steve Wynn s personal conduct  but that may not fly as well in an environment of growing concern about sexual harassment 
Some investors may look at Wynn Resorts  drop  conclude that the hullabaloo over Steve Wynn s actions will blow over  and aim to buy low  But there are more reasons to believe this will materially hurt Wynn Resorts  If Steve Wynn leaves  the company will suffer  If Steve Wynn stays but they risk losing a license or paying more to the Chinese  the company will suffer  If the board faces a civil lawsuit  the company will suffer 
The  metoo movement means that corporations cannot just brush aside sexual harassment allegations and bounce back easily  Corporations everywhere will have to review their corporate governance and sexual harassment standards to make sure that they do not end up like Wynn Resorts  and investors should not consider investing into this company now ",2018-01-30,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wynn-resorts-stock-and-importance-of-corporate-governance-200285171,200285171

156984,378500,WYNN,Closing A Great Year For Global Stocks  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"For the Global Week Ahead  let s visit Reuter s five top world market themes 
These are the ones likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week  It s been a great year for stocks outside the U S  We are about to move into a New Year with fresh share price momentum    everywhere 
 1  The Bank of Japan  BoJ  Will Be in Midweek Headlines
The Bank of Japan holds the last of this year s major central bank meetings 
Japan s economy is now into its best period of expansion this century  the labor market continues to improve  and bank lending is booming  Yet the BOJ s stimulus remains pretty much at full throttle  having already ballooned its balance sheet to the same size as Japan s GDP 
Keeping the yen from appreciating and thus disturbing the cyclical tailwinds of growth seems to have become a major reason why the BOJ is a laggard on policy  normalization  Some BOJ policymakers have been dropping subtle hints to prepare markets for an eventual exit from its policy    one that keeps short term rates negative and pegs the 10 year yield to zero percent    but investors expect little guidance around that exit plan at next week s meeting 
The first changes may come via a small rise in the 10 year yield target  they suspect  but even the odds of that are low so long as wage growth is subdued and inflation remains well below the BOJ s 2 percent target  
 2  Fresh U S  Housing Data   Pay Attention to the Details
Fresh U S  figures on existing home sales and housing starts could point to a continued deceleration going into 2018 
On a 12 month percentage change  dating back to 2000  both data series reveal how the housing market is softening 
The Federal Reserve s interest rate cycle has been a major factor    in particular  short term mortgages  where interest rates on floating rate home loans have risen the most  making life harder for some would be buyers 
One of the conundrums though is that the White House wants to juice up the economy with tax cuts while the Federal Reserve wants to keeping raising interest rates so they get back to more normal levels  
 3  A Snap Election in the Catalan Province of Spain
On Thursday  a snap election takes places in Catalonia  The Spanish government hopes the vote will put an end to the wealthy region s independence bid 
One recent poll suggested pro independence parties may fail to retain an absolute majority of seats in the Catalan parliament  with pro unity parties poised to increase their vote share 
Failure to win a majority in the regional parliament would be a blow for Catalan separatists who have billed the Dec  21st election as a de facto plebiscite on Madrid s decision to impose direct rule in October following an independence referendum  Spanish bonds and stocks markets  both unnerved by the political crisis  have recovered ground 
Any signs that the election will bring calm to the Eurozone s fourth biggest economy should cheer investors    and give them plenty of time focus on elections likely to be held in Italy early next year  
 4  Pay Attention to South Africa s Presidential Election
On Sunday  South Africa s ruling African National Congress  ANC  party is expected to anoint its next leader 
But whoever wins  the chances of the party splitting in two have grown 
The bruising battle to choose the successor to President Jacob Zuma between business friendly Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma  a former cabinet minister and ex wife of President Jacob Zuma  is too close to call 
The rand has performed well in recent weeks on expectations that Ramaphosa will clinch the victory  But the complexity of the leadership contest means the outcome is far from certain 
So investors who had been hoping for political stability and a chance for the country to enact some much needed structural reforms could be disappointed  
 5  Will This Be the Best Year for Global Stocks Since 2013  or 2009 
There s just one full trading week left to the end of the year 
Perhaps one of the few remaining issues to decide markets wise is this  Was this the best in year in global stocks since 2013 or 2009 
Right now 2017 is vying with 2013  with gains just above  20  year to date seen in both  The crash recovery year of 2009 clocked up more than  30  and stocks are well shy of that  
Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks 
Asahi Kasei   OTC AHKSY    This is a big  18 billion in market cap diversified Japanese chemical maker  The stock is trading at about  26 a share after a strong run 
The global chemical markets are a key bellwether to watch  and the strong rank here is good news for global growth centered in Asia 
NVR   NYSE NVR    This is a  13 billion in market cap building products home builder  U S  housing figures out this week can move Zacks  1 Rank stocks like this NVR  Inc  operates in two business segments  homebuilding and mortgage banking  Again  this is a stock already on a big momentum roll this year  in a hot industry 
Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    This  16 billion market cap casino stock keeps going up  And the Zacks  1 Rank says the business is getting more and more profitable Will final tax bill passage keep these types of gaming stocks on a roll  I bet it does

156998,378514,WYNN,Wynn shares fall 4  after opening of Macau resort delayed until August,news,"Investing com    Shares in Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  fell sharply on Monday after the multinational casino announced plans to postpone the opening of the previously delayed Wynn Palace resort in the Cotai area of Macau to August 
The announcement marks the second time Wynn officials have delayed the opening of the 1 700 room   4 1 billion project in the Chinese gambling hotbed due to construction delays  The complex  which is replete with gondolas  a lake with a fountain and a spa  was initially expected to be complete on March 25  Wynn officials now expect to complete construction in July  before hosting a variety of staff training courses over the next several weeks  If completed on time  the Wynn Palace resort is scheduled to open on August 22 
 The company expects that the opening of Wynn Palace will help launch a new era of prosperity for Macau  attracting more international tourists to the city and further supporting its development as a world center of tourism and leisure   Wynn Resorts said in a statement 
In April  overall casino revenue declines in Macau fell by 9 5   considerably less than analysts  expectations  as resorts bolstered revenues with a revamped strategy to cater to tourists and casual gamblers  Still  gross gaming revenues in the Chinese island resort have fallen for nearly 24 consecutive months  amid heightened anti corruption efforts from regulators and slowing economic growth in mainland China 
Last November  Macau s travel authority offered downbeat forecasts for 2016  while projecting annual gaming revenues of  25 billion  which would amount to the lowest level since 2010 
Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn criticized Macau gaming authorities in October for placing on the number of table games the casino can offer at the new resort  describing the regulations as stifling revenue for the new project

If this isn t enough  latest earnings from two industry bellwethers came in favorable  
Inside Earnings 
Wynn Resorts Ltd    NASDAQ WYNN   posted solid results for third quarter 2017  with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Wynn Macau revenues increased 15 3  year over year owing to higher casino revenues while casino revenues from Macau operations jumped 16 2  
Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   reported better than expected third quarter 2017 results with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Per management  this solid performance was primarily owing to a full quarter of operations for The Parisian Macao and stronger results at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore  However  net revenues from Las Vegas operations were down 1 6  year over year  owing to a 9  decline in casino revenues 
This means that despite all worries about the crackdown on illegal money transfer and economic slowdown  the mecca of casino gaming is returning to life 
Market Impact 
Thanks to Nomura s upbeat report  casino stocks moved northward  Las Vegas Sands gained 3 1   Wynn Resorts added 4 5  and MGM Resorts International MGM  ticked up 2 6  on Oct 31  Overall positive sentiment can surely be felt for the pure play ETF VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF  which added 1 8  on Oct 31 
In any case  the Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 32   The fund has a sizable exposure to the afore mentioned stocks  While investing in a single stock is always an option  investors can take advantage of the recovery in Macau and reassuring earnings via BJK or the basket approach 
BJK in Focus
The fund looks to track the MVIS Global Gaming Index and provides investors direct exposure to the casino gaming market  The fund has so far attracted  23 4 million in assets and invested that in 40 holdings  The product is expensive as its net expense ratio is 67 bps 
All the three abovementioned companies have created places in the top 10 holdings of the fund with a considerable share  Both companies  Las Vegas Sands and Sands China  have about 15  exposure in BJK  MGM Resorts International and  MGM China Holdings call for about 8  of the fund  Wynn Resorts Ltd and Wynn Macau also account for about 8  of BJK  The fund has about 38 4  exposure to the United States followed by 14 7  in China and 14 1  in Australia  see  here

corruption in China compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau  Consequently  this lowered footfall at local casinos  A slowdown in China  tighter visa policies  political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes However  Macau s gambling revenues have been rising since the second half of 2016  with new resorts attracting high rollers and leisure gamblers Also  efforts undertaken by Macau operators to revive revenues by wooing tourists and recreational gamblers with family friendly resorts and more non gaming facilities have started yielding results  This is evident from revenue growth in the past 15 months Thus  it seems that the worst is over for Macau s gambling industry and a complete rebound in the region may be in the cards 2     According to the Nevada Gaming Control Board  gambling revenues in the state increased nearly 3 3  in September 2017 from the year ago period to  979 9 million  Particularly  casino revenues in the Las Vegas Strip   which account for more than half of Nevada s total revenues   were up 4 7  year over year in the month  Reno recorded a 9 2  rise in casino revenues as well  In fact  revenues in the region have been mostly strong over the past few months 3     Melco Resorts  third quarter earnings of 31 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents by 34 8  Also  the bottom line increased significantly from the prior year quarter s figure of 13 cents  owing to higher revenues Notably  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s net revenues of  1 38 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 29 billion by nearly 4  and also increased 19 5  on a year over year basis  This improvement in the top line was primarily driven by higher rolling chip revenues at City of Dreams and the initiation of rolling chip operations at Studio City in November 2016  You can see  Adjusted Property EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  and amortization  was  400 2 million in the quarter under review  up 38 4  year over year  The upside was prompted by improved performance in the group wide rolling chip segment  read more     4     Eldorado Resorts posted third quarter 2017 earnings of 36 cents  which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents by 12 5   However  net revenues of  444 9 million decreased 1  year over year and lagged the consensus estimate by over 1   The year over year decline in this Zacks Rank  3 company s results reflects the decline in revenues at the Midwest  the South and the East segments  partially offset by a rise in the West segment Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major gambling stocks over the past week and the last six months Over the last five trading sessions  share price movement of the major gambling stocks was positive  Melco Resorts gained the maximum at 9 6  followed

For Wynn s third quarter  which ended in late September  its net revenue dropped sharply to  996 3 million for the period in comparison with  1 37 billion in the third quarter of 2014  The decline  according to the company  stems from a 38  decrease in revenues from its Macau operations  along with a 4  decline in its Las Vegas operations

Casino revenues in Macau have lagged over the last year since the Chinese government cracked down on gambling by introducing stricter regulations meant to deter high stakes players from traveling to the region  As a result  Wynn s daily room rates in the area dipped 3 1  to  317  while occupancy rates fell to 95 9  from 98 5  a year earlier 
CEO Steve Wynn remains uncertain on how further Chinese regulations could impact Macau revenues  telling reporters on Thursday that he hasn t quite seen a situation like it in  45 years in the business  
 None of us are really clear as to what our environment will be going forward   Wynn said in a conference call on Thursday afternoon   It makes planning and adjusting almost a mystical process

Corp   NYSE       and Hanesbrands Inc   NYSE    NYSE HBI       Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  U S  Consumers Most Confident in 13 Years  Top 5 PicksAmerican consumers are gaining confidence in the economy  Consumer confidence crushed expectations and soared to the highest level in October since 2004   A decline in gas prices  record low jobless rate and series of highs for the stock market buoyed optimism on household finances and the economy The economic expansion  after eight years  is finally noticeable  The U S  economy has started to expand close to the range expected by President Trump and some other Republicans  while both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month Since Americans gained optimism on the economy  things have been looking up for consumer stocks  Stocks of consumer discretionary companies are poised to grow on the signs of renewed consumer spending strength Confidence in American Economy Highest in 13 YearsAccording to the University of Michigan  the U S  consumer sentiment index touched 101 1 in October  up from 95 1 in September  The key economic indicator that measure attitudes on future economic prospects reached its highest level since 2004 Americans think the economic scenario right now is  as good as it gets   There were big gains in both the index for present economic conditions and consumer expectations  The index for current economic conditions rose to 116 4 from 111 7  while the index of consumer expectations increased to 91 3 from 84 4 What Drove the Confidence Household optimism was largely driven by falling gas prices  labor market health and the U S  stock market s record breaking run   The average price of a gallon dropped by 43 cents over the last five weeks after it had climbed after Hurricane Harvey impacted the Gulf Coast refinery outlets A clearer view of last month s labor market data  in fact  showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside  the U S  employment scenario is continuing to tighten  The unemployment rate declined to 4 2   the lowest since February 2001 and wages increased 0 5  to an average of  26 55 an hour  per the Labor Department data  In fact  in the last 12 months  hourly pay increased 2 9   up from 2 7  in the prior month and also in line with a post recession high U S  stocks  in the meanwhile  continue to extend their winning streak  with the Dow and the S P 500 rising for five straight weeks  So  what has driven the indices higher  Investors cheered the first step toward enacting major tax reforms later this year after the Republican controlled U S  House of Representatives approved a 2018 budget resolution The House of Representatives  led by Speaker Paul Ryan  passed a  4 1 trillion budget legislation that paved the way for them to rewrite the much awaited tax code later this year  The budget aims to repeal Obamacare and also contains  1 1 trillion in non entitlement outlays  including nearly  622 billion for defense  The far reaching plan will trim taxes for corporates as well  which will offset the revenue loss and not add to national debt that is now above  20 trillion Solid second quarter earnings also provided a fillip to the U S  equity market despite political turmoil  both at home and abroad  Meanwhile  a similar shot in the arm is expected in the third quarter earnings season  read more    Why Does Consumer Confidence Matter Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been  historically  good at predicting consumer spending for the next three to six months  More the confidence households generate  the more will they spend  Notably  consumer spending accounts for roughly 70  of the U S  economy  which isn t a petty number These numbers influence companies  production schedule  particularly big ticket items like cars  appliances  etc  In fact  the consumer discretionary sector is mostly affected as spending plays a major role in determining revenues  Automobile stocks often track these numbers and so do appliance manufacturers  retailers  consumer discretionary manufacturers  big ticket entertainment providers  jewelry retailers and cruise line operators  to name a few 5 Stocks to Gain as Consumers Gain ConfidenceSince the aforementioned sector is positioned to benefit from this stellar reading on confidence level  picking stocks from the same will be a smart move  We have  thus  selected five consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Such stocks also boast of a  of A or B  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics

157059,378575,WYNN,Casino Stocks Fall  Is North Korea Tension To Blame ,opinion,"Shares of some casino industry powerhouses fell across the board on Thursday  many of which have ties to Macau  the world s newest gambling Mecca  However  with tensions surrounding North Korea escalating  the hotspot s close proximity to the tumultuous region might possibly hurt stock prices 
Lower travel numbers could spark trouble for U S  based companies that now operate in Macau  The area s success has helped the gaming industry gain over 21  year to date  outpacing the S P 500 by almost double  according to our Zacks Industry Rank data 
Shares of Melco Crown Entertainment   NASDAQ MLCO    which receives the majority of its revenue from Macau  fell 2 22  on Thursday  Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS   also has a presence in the region  and the company s stock price fell 1 07  
Wynn Resorts  Limited   NASDAQ WYNN   and MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM    both of which own casinos in Asia s gambling capital  sank by around 3  
June travel to Macau rose 0 86  year over year according to an Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation report  Mainland Chinese visitor rates to the gambling destination increased by 0 8   But travel from nearby Hong Kong fell by 3 9   and Taiwanese tourism dropped by 9 9  
The report cited expensive transportation costs and pricey accommodation as possible reasons for June s slowdown in tourism 
But it seems for now casinos can breathe easy if June numbers hold  as visitor rates weren t down across the board  The number of overnight visitors to Macau grew for the 23rd month in a row 
Japanese tourism increased by 13 5  and South Korean numbers skyrocket by 42 2  according to the OCBC report  However  June was a long time ago in terms of the geopolitical climate  If the North Korea situation keeps getting worse  which seems like a strong possibility  travel to Macau could slow and in turn help bust some casino stocks 
Investors should keep a close eye on these numbers from Japan and South Korea  two U S  allies that have a lot at stake in the current climate  If tensions continue to increase  fear could keep tourists at home

157062,378578,WYNN,MGM Resorts Rides On Solid Domestic Business  Risks Prevail,opinion,On Aug 31  we issued an updated research report on global hospitality company MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   Though the company has solid long term growth potential but the risks from near term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum Domestic VenturesMGM Resorts  Las Vegas business is doing well on the back of the ongoing economic recovery and growing tourism in the region  It is expected to continue growing over the long term  driven by a strong convention calendar and the completion of several capital initiatives on the Las Vegas Strip Notably  the acquisition of full ownership of Borgata Hotel Casino   Spa   Atlantic City s top casino   complements MGM Resorts  increasing presence in the Northeastern United States and should continue to drive top line growth Meanwhile  MGM National Harbor  a casino resort that opened in December 2016 is off to a great start  Another casino resort in Western Massachusetts is set to be developed on roughly 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield  MA  the construction of which is slated to be completed in late 2018  Both these resorts include a number of gaming as well as non gaming amenities Thus  the company is expected to witness increased occupancy and better pricing in the domestic markets as a result of these efforts and openings  This  in turn  should drive incremental revenues at the company s properties in the region  Moreover  these projects demonstrate this Las Vegas  NV based company s commitment toward diversifying its business Macau s Recovery   Regulatory IssuesA tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016  However  Macau s gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers  In fact  Macau s gaming revenues were up in July  thus marking the 12th consecutive month of gains and signaling the casino hub s recovery Markedly  after been mostly weak for the last two years  the VIP business in Macau has started to recover  Meanwhile  the main floor gaming has also been mostly faring well in the recent times  Additionally  MGM China is undertaking initiatives to increase revenues and junket productivity in Macau as it anticipates a positive trend buoyed by upgrades to main gaming floor products and marketing initiatives  MGM Cotai s construction too is in the final stages and is expected to boost revenues when it opens in the fourth quarter of 2017 Thus  though it seems that the worst is over for Macau s gambling industry  it will still take some time for the company to fully capitalize on the rebound in Macau gaming revenues  This is evident from the company s weak results at MGM China in the second quarter  Notably  revenues declined 1  in the quarter due to lower revenues from main floor table games   However  the Macau government recently joined hands with the mainland authorities to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing and beefed up its anti money laundering framework with a much wider scope and stringent compliance measures  Macau s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau  DICJ  is increasing its audits of the junket industry  over worries of money laundering as well Thus  this latest crackdown may hamper Macau s revenue growth and reverse the 12 month streak of year over year gains  thus weighing down on MGM Resorts  performance Bottom LineMGM Resorts  Profit Growth Plan continues to bear fruit as being reflected in improving profits  Evidently  the second quarter of 2017 marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double digit EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  and amortization  growth at the company Nevertheless  the company faces stiff competition in the markets of Las Vegas and Macau due to increased hotel openings and promotional activities  In fact  the company s upcoming project in the Cotai Strip is expected to face competition from several Chinese casino operators and the Sands Cotai Central project of Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS    Wynn Resorts Ltd    NASDAQ WYNN   also opened a full scale integrated resort  Wynn Palace  on the Cotai Strip in August 2016 Despite the headwinds  we note that MGM Resorts  shares have rallied 19 4  in

157081,378597,WYNN,Here s Why Casino Stocks Gained Today,opinion,"Shares of some of the world s largest casino companies including Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS    and MGM Resorts   NYSE MGM   were gaining in morning trading Thursday after the latest Macau revenue numbers pointed to a continued recovery in the gambling hotspot 
Revenues in Macau grew 24  in the month of May  beating estimates and marking the tenth straight month of growth in the region  Gambling specific revenue in China s special casino hub was up 22 7   according to regulators  Industry analysts were expecting May s growth to fall between 15  and 20  
Another impressive month for Macau serves to confirm that VIPs are back in the area and revenues have recovered from their five year lows hit in 2014 when China launched an anti graft campaign that targeted some wealthy gamblers 
Shares of Wynn Resorts  which is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   gained more than 3 3  in morning trading Thursday  Wynn s new Macau property  the Wynn Palace  recently completed its second full quarter of operations  lifting the company s revenue figures 48  year over year  also read    
Other Vegas giants with properties in Macau gained as well  Las Vegas Sands was up more than 2 8   while MGM Resorts moved nearly 2 2  higher 
Melco Crown Entertainment   NASDAQ MLCO    which gets the majority of its revenue from Macau  spiked more than 4 4  early Thursday  but shares eventually slumped back down towards a gain of 2   Melco Crown is also a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Macau s recovery may see some pushback in the near future  as new regulatory initiatives are starting to be implemented in the world s largest casino hub  Last week  Macau regulators joined forces with Chinese officials to launch a new anti money laundering program 
There are new security measures in the area  including facial recognition at ATM machines a move meant to enforce a withdrawal limit  Regulators are also trying to crack down on junkets  a form of middlemen that offer credit to high rollers 
Nevertheless  Macau is also attempting to transform into an all ages  family friendly tourist destination  so investors should look for that to become more of a factor there soon

According to the Las Vegas Sun  Chinese investors are bankrolling a chunk of a shiny  415 million luxury  nightclub themed  resort  the SLS Las Vegas  located on the struggling North end of the Strip  About a quarter of the investment for the newest SLS outpost comes from foreign investment  most of which is Chinese  But it s not just the SLS  Chinese money is backing other endeavors  Together with the famed Cirque de Soleil acrobatic performances and Celine Dion s residency at Caesars Palace  a new Chinese backed show   Panda   has also taken the stage with the help of Chinese investors  And another at the Venetian s Palazzo is a Chinese style acrobatic and martial arts performance that also features a giant cartoonish panda 
But while the flow of Chinese money is good news for the Strip  new regulations imposed by China s government have stifled business in the other world famous casino town  Macau  the ex Portuguese city colony next door to Hong Kong 
Macau  also known as the  Las Vegas of the East   is a special administrative zone on an island where gambling is legal  unlike on mainland China  Macau has seen its own share of Vegas level investments  coming from Chinese billionaire Stanley Ho and Americans Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn  founder of Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN   among others  

According to a report by Businessweek  shares of the six largest publicly traded casinos  including Adelson s Las Vegas Sands  NYSE LVS  and Wynn s Wynn Macau  HK 1128   are struggling  Collectively  the six companies  shares dropped 20 percent last Friday  with Wynn Macau dropping 8 5 percent  the most in more than two years of being listed in Hong Kong  The decline is seen as a result of an announcement by Chinese authorities  saying they would tighten regulations on Chinese gamblers  ultimately limiting the amount of money that can be brought to the territory 
China s limitations are prompted by concerns by the central government that tens of billions of yuan in illegal funds are being taken outside of China and laundered through casinos in a scheme called  card swiping   According to a report by the South China Morning Post  mobile users of the state backed UnionPay payment service have been able to illegally obtain funds and use them for unauthorized dealings  while still making them appear as domestic transactions  avoiding local currency controls  Current restrictions allow tourists to bring 20 000 yuan  or roughly  3 200  into Macau and withdraw as much as 10 000 yuan a day at cash machines with each card they have  In order to skirt regulations  people pretend to buy luxury items at pawnshops using their debit cards  like the ones provided by UnionPay  and immediately resell them for local Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollars  effectively bringing in additional funds  
However  Macanese casinos are now hoping to strike gold with a new marketing plan focused on a  premium mass  market  rather than just China s elite of wealthy people  Bolstering a market for ordinary gamblers  instead of just high roller VIPs  could help shoulder revenue shortfalls caused by the new regulations  Bloomberg reports that Adelson s Sands China  HK 1928  has already converted 20 percent of its VIP tables to cater to middle class gamblers ",2014-05-13,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chinese-money-goes-to-las-vegas-(and-leaves-macau)-283757,283757

Chinese territory races to build eight new resorts in the next three years  labor strains look set to intensify  workers are demanding higher pay and threatening strikes at a time when operators face a labor shortage   Las Vegas kingpins Sheldon Adelson at Las Vegas Sands Corp  N LVS  and Steve Wynn at Wynn Resorts Ltd  O WYNN  together reported unexpected costs of  50 million   29 6 million last quarter for labor related compensation at their Macau casinos   Casino industry analysts expect the other four licensed operators in the world s biggest gambling hub   Galaxy Entertainment  HK 0027   MGM Resorts  N MGM   SJM Holdings  HK 0880  and Melco Crown Entertainment  6883 HK    to announce similar cost pressures when they post earnings this month   Located on China s south coast  Macau is the only place in the country where casino gambling is legal  The special administrative region boasts 35 casinos and relies on gaming taxes for more than 80 percent of government revenues   Home to a population of just over 500 000 people  the former Portuguese colony has one of the world s lowest jobless rates at 1 7 percent  Rigid labor regulations that prohibit foreigners from working at the gaming tables mean casino operators have little choice but to raise wages to attract and retain staff   Workers at Galaxy were planning a protest for Tuesday at the company s flagship golden turreted resort after a Macau trade union last week submitted a petition alleging its salaries were  disrespectful  to some employees   More than 1 000 workers protested last week outside Adelson s showpiece Venetian  accusing the company of poor wages and unfair promotions  Both Galaxy and Sands China  HK 1928  have expressed concern and vowed to resolve the problem    For both Galaxy and Sands we are not ruling out a strike   said Ieong Man Teng  a baccarat dealer and president of the Forefront of Macao Gaming  the labor group behind the recent protests   Local media have reported the Venetian s anniversary on Aug  28 as a potential date for workers to strike   BARGAINING POWER  Dealers in Macau earn an average of 17 000 18 000 patacas   1 262    1 337  per month  about half the  4 000 that Las Vegas dealers get  according to U S  based industry analysts   Morgan Stanley said in a July report that labor competition would intensify in the near term  pressuring margins and increasing start up losses for the new resorts  It estimated a shortfall of 13 800 local employees by 2017  a figure unlikely to be met solely relying on local supply    We think the bargaining power of casino

strip   Macau s labor troubles come weeks ahead of the expected re election of local leader Fernando Chui at the end of this month  Highly sensitive to further protests  the government is keen to pacify discontented workers and has said it is paying close attention to the needs of casino workers   Secretary for Economy and Finance Francis Tam said the government was focusing on gaming workers  requests for improved salaries and promotions  according to a statement published on the government website on July 24   Government officials conducted a two hour  closed door meeting with workers from Sands China and union representatives from the Forefront of Macau Gaming on July 28  according to local media   Macau s labor unions have been rapidly gaining strength over the past year  garnering support from young people who have grown accustomed to job security and government handouts   Last October  more than 10 000 casino dealers took to the streets in one of the territory s biggest protests  dragging traditional Chinese coffins to symbolize the demise of local jobs and calling on the government to safeguard local workers after casino operators publicly despaired at the difficulty of expanding while adhering to Macau s labor conditions   The job of a dealer  who runs baccarat tables for eight hour shifts  has become highly coveted among local citizens as it requires little technical experience and the salary is more than double that in the manufacturing industry   The government has been quick to reassure workers  saying the ban on foreign workers will not change in the near term  Yet the tussle highlights the challenge authorities face in appeasing protectionist forces and helping Macau develop into an international tourist destination   BEST SHOT  Casino

corruption in China  This compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau Consequently  this lowered footfall at local casinos  A slowdown in China  tighter visa policies  political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes   In fact  the anti graft corruption drive undertaken by the Chinese government is still keeping VIP gamblers at bay However  the industry has finally started to stabilize after a protracted slowdown as evident from gambling revenue

157136,378652,WYNN,Here s Why Casino Stocks  MGM  LVS  WYNN  Are Gaining Today,opinion,"Shares of some of the largest casino brands with operations in Macau  including MGM Resorts   NYSE MGM    Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS    and Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   were up on Friday after the Chinese gambling hotspot limited daily ATM withdrawals by less that was originally reported 
By mid day  MGM was up about 2 4   while LVS and WYNN were up about 2 9  and 2 5   respectively  Friday s gains come just a day after the stocks dropped suddenly on a Chinese media report that Macau would halve its 10 000 patacas daily cap on ATM withdrawals 
In fact  the Macau Monetary Authority has not adjusted the daily limit at all  Instead  the regulatory body will limit ATM withdrawals for China UnionPay cardholders to 5 000 patacas per transaction  The daily cap of 10 000 patacas remains the same 
The state of Macau s gambling business has been in flux since the Chinese government decided to crack down on corruption last year  which targeted some of the area s highest rollers  However  we ve seen Macau revenues return a bit this year as the enclave has begun to transform from gambling hotspot to family friendly tourist destination 
Regardless of Macau  the Asian gambling industry could be in for a major shakeup as Japan looks to enter the fray  The nation is reportedly close to legalizing gambling throughout the country  opening up an estimated  40 billion a year industry  Also read

All Is Not LostInvestors  however  need not sweat bullets just yet as there are still certain players in the casino industry  who seem to be untroubled by the recent ordeal Here  we are emphasizing on the regional players in the casino space as more local exposure should insulate these companies from losses facing the Macau focused operators  They should also continue to cash in on the favorable trends of an improving employment rate and positive tourism numbers in the Las Vegas region One such company that stands out is Monarch Casino   Resort  Inc    NASDAQ MCRI    which through its subsidiaries  owns and operates Atlantis Casino Resort Spa  a hotel casino facility in Reno  NV  and Monarch Casino Black Hawk in Black Hawk  CO  Amid all the concerns around Macau  the company s shares lost just 0 8  of its value yesterday and had a regular trading session  Monarch Casino   Resort sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Interestingly  in the last six months  the stock has surged nearly 16   Moreover  the company has been seeing an upward trend in earnings estimate revision  Over the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 and 2017 earnings increased 7 9  and 6 8   respectively  Further  for full year 2016  sales growth is expected to be 6 7  while earnings per share  EPS  are expected to grow a solid 14 3  Another stock that worth s having a look despite having a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  is Boyd Gaming Corporation   NYSE BYD    It in fact gained 3 6  in yesterday s trading session  Headquartered in Las Vegas  Boyd Gaming is a leading diversified owner and operator of 22 gaming entertainment properties located in Nevada  Illinois  Indiana  Iowa  Kansas  Louisiana  Mississippi and New Jersey Notably  in the last six months  the stock has returned nearly 8   Upward estimate revisions for 2016 and 2017 earnings add to the optimism  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 and 2017 EPS improved 6 3  and 11 1   respectively  over the last 60 days  Moreover  for full year 2016  EPS is projected to grow a decent 7 3  Bottom LineChina s capital controls measures have certainly raised questions on the fate of the Macau gambling industry in the near term  However  keeping in mind the rosy forecast for some of the regional players  investors should not shy away from putting money into the casino space and cash in on the bountiful opportunities Zacks  Best Investment Ideas for Long Term ProfitToday you can gain access to long term trades with double and triple digit profit potential rarely available to the public  Starting now  you can look inside our stocks under  10  home run and value stock portfolios  plus more  Want a peek at this private information ",2016-12-09,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/don't-panic-about-macau,-focus-on-these-casino-stocks-200169271",200169271

The Chinese government is imposing a 50  cut in withdrawals permissible to holders of China  ATM cards  effective Saturday  Investors should note that  nearly  of Chinese customers in Macau use UnionPay ATM withdrawals as one source of cash for gaming   
Such restrictions on currency usage in the world s largest gambling market is surely to hit the casino stocks  Investors should also note that gaming revenue in Macau is still in a fragile state having witnessed 26 months of declines before turning around from August on an annualized basis  November saw the fourth consecutive month of revenue growth  read    
Since several big U S  casino companies have huge exposure in Macau  there was a bloodbath in the casino industry on December 8 following the news  Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   lost about 12 8   Wynn Resorts  Limited   NASDAQ WYNN   plunged over 11  and MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   shed over 4 3   To reflect the impact on global casino stocks  the casino gaming ETF  VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF    retreated over 3 3  
Inside the Crackdown
As per   the step to lower the daily withdrawal limit from 10 000 to 5 000 patacas  taken after the revelation that  as much as 10 billion patacas in China UnionPay ATM withdrawals were made in one month alone  
The Chinese government intensified its measures to restrain the capital outflows as its yuan currency dropped  to over eight year lows at the end of November and its foreign exchange reserves fell far more than expected in the month to  3 05 trillion  the lowest level in nearly six years   as per  
Even previously  China enacted a clamp down on this territory  Check on illegal capital flight especially in VIP gaming from mainland China to Macau  firmer regulations over junket operators and phone betting  and monetary authority s orders to  and pawnshops on casino floors to eliminate UnionPay debit card terminals are not new to Macau  read    
However  some analysts view the latest move as  the  capital control measure that directly targets Macau and hence may be viewed as a meaningful signal   In this light  investors should keep a close watch on casino ETF BJK which may see rough trading in the coming days

Rationale BehindChina UnionPay is the country s state sponsored domestic bank card organization and is used by nearly half of mainland China gamblers to withdraw money in Macau  Notably  the move to cut the daily withdrawal limit comes on the back of the finding that as much as 10 billion patacas in China UnionPay ATM withdrawals were made in one month alone The Monetary Authority of Macau s new limit is thus part of an effort to halt illegal outflows from the country  In fact  China tightened its capital controls in recent months as the yuan experiences depreciation pressure  Notably  the country s foreign exchange reserves have also been declining of late Our TakeThe huge drop in the stock prices of casino companies following the ATM withdrawal news might seem as an overreaction  However  if this leads to additional crackdown on capital heading to Macau  there could be huge implications on the Macau gaming market which may dampen investor sentiments further Notably  China s capital controls come at a time when the industry is vulnerable  Though  these policies could be helpful in the long run  these could restrict gaming revenues in the near term  This may reverse the trend for the Macau gambling industry which has finally started to stabilize after a protracted slowdown MGM Resorts  Melco Crown and Las Vegas Sands sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  while Wynn Resorts currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Zacks  Best Investment Ideas for Long Term ProfitToday you can gain access to long term trades with double and triple digit profit potential rarely available to the public  Starting now  you can look inside our stocks under  10  home run and value stock portfolios  plus more  Want a peek at this private information ",2016-12-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-may-cut-atm-withdrawal:-are-casino-stocks-at-risk-200169256,200169256

157149,378665,WYNN,2 Stocks To Follow In 2017  WYNN  ZG,opinion,"As Recommended By Analysts  Here Are Growth Stocks That Are Worth Considering In The Coming Year 
Uncertainty surrounds the future as the new year looms  but that doesn t mean that long term investors should change their trading and investing tactics  After all  purchasing stocks of good companies at practical prices and holding them for a long period is the key to the success in investing  This is especially better if these companies have excellent growth potential 
There are two growth stocks that are appealing right now as 2017 is just days away  Keep these shares in mind for the next year 
Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN 
Investors  radars this January should include high end casino and resort operator Wynn Resorts  WYNN shares have performed well in the year  but over the past three years  the stock dropped by nearly two thirds 
One of the company s struggles was the waning casino revenue in China  which is mainly an effect of its GDP growth slowdown and worries in the US that subpar GDP growth would affect its business in Las Vegas  But based on the most recent earnings result  Wynn seems to be sailing safely 
Previously in August  Wynn Palace was opened in Macau a high end casino and resort that possesses 100 new table games and will have a total of 150 in place by year 2019  Wynn Resorts ended up netting  164 6 million in revenue during a partial third quarter from the Macau based luxury casino resort  In the coming year  with a full year of revenue from Wynn Palace  the company s revenue could grow by almost  900 million from 2016 
Although there continues to be a steady decline in Wynn Palace as China s wealthiest adapt to the country s somewhat slower growth pace  the charm of a new luxury hotel could more than surpass the recent year over year  YOY  casino revenue downticks and the decline in revenue per available room  RevPAR  in Macau 
Improving economic outlook in the US inclusive of higher interest rates and a new peak in the US stock market could brighten the prospect for gamblers in Las Vegas  There may be benefits that have improved outlook in Wynn s top line results  Room revenues in Las Vegas added more than 9  in third quarter 2016  while RevPAR added 6 6   Should traffic head once again in Vegas s way  it s just a matter of time before Wynn witnesses better results from its smaller contributing US operations 
Wynn has the potential to boost its EPS growth from roughly 10  in 2017 to possibly 20    25  yearly by the end of the decade  according to Wall Street  To boot  investors also get a 2 2  yield while they wait for Wynn Palace to prosper in Macau 
Overall  Wynn appears to be a solid growth play worthy of any investor s consideration in January  In the last session  WYNN ended at  87 08  down by  1 16 or 1 31  
Zillow Group Inc  NASDAQ ZG 
Zillow Group shares have climbed over 60  year to date with only three days left before the year ends  including a 36  burst in May  The online real estate giant  however  is just marking the beginning for its gains 
Previously in early November  Zillow sustained its routine of crushing Wall Street s estimates after it set a fresh company record with revenue up 35  YoY to  224 6 million  These figures had beaten the guidance for  217 million to  220 million  Adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization more than doubled over the same time frame to  59 5 million  topping guidance for  48 million to  53 million

157168,378684,WYNN,4 Things To Watch When Wynn Resorts Reports Earnings On Thursday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   which develops  owns and operates destination casino resorts in the United States and China  will report Q3 2016 earnings on Thursday October 20th  after the market closes 


1  Earnings and Revenue
Wynn is expected to report EPS of  0 77 on  1 13 billion in revenue  After two years of declining EPS and revenue  Wall Street is expecting to see renewed growth in both  at a little over 5  year over year 

2  Macao Resurgence 
Wynn s troubles started two years ago in Macao considered the world s biggest casino market when the Chinese government decided to harden its stance on corruption and money laundering  That decision led to uncertainty and fear among high rollers  who then opted to avoid potential trouble by skipping the Chinese special administrative region  heading instead to other Asian gambling destinations such as Singapore and South Korea  Twelve months trailing  for Q2 2014  the resort s revenue was  6 2 billion  while its EPS was  8 21  Two years later the numbers are down to  4 3 billion and  3 24 EPS  meaning the company lost 30  of revenue and 60  of its profits  The stock price fell accordingly  from a high of  247 in February 2014 to a low of  50 in October 2015  a spectacular 80  drop in value 
On August 22  after a six year construction period  the company opened its brand new   4 2 billion Wynn Palace resort  doubling its presence in the area  This is expected to boost WYNN s growth in the third quarter  But don t get too optimistic 
First  Chinese authorities have limited the number of gaming tables Wynn Palace can host  The new resort was allocated only 100 tables  compared to 520 at the Wynn Macao  the company s older resort in the region  Recently  the company was told it would get an additional 25 tables beginning 2017 plus 25 more a year later  In addition    WYNN will reallocate 250 tables from its older property  bringing the total number of gaming tables at the new casino to 350 
Still  with fewer tables at each resort effectively cannibalizing its casino floor revenues it will take a lot more time for Wynn to recoup their initial investment  as well as grow revenue 

3  Asian Competition
Alongside the lack of growth within its own resort network  WYNN also faces relatively stiff local and regional competition from other  Macao based casino resorts as well as additional regional gambling hubs  The Chinese government s crackdown on money related crimes  particularly within the gaming industry  which began in 2014  has driven away a lot of gamblers from Chinese borders  sending them to other Asian destinations such as the Philippines or Singapore 
While Macao is still regarded as Asia s most luxurious gaming destination  the last couple of years have made the gambling population more aware of regional competitors  As a result  some business might never come back  And Wynn is hardly the only casino business operating in Macao  where the competition is stiff  Melco Crown  NASDAQ MPEL  opened its brand new  movie themed Studio City last October  The Las Vegas Sands  NYSE LVS  officially opened The Parisian  just last month 

4  Wynn Las Vegas
Unfortunately  there is little to report on the Las Vegas front  Once considered the world s sin capital  the city s reputation has dimmed and revenues from local casinos have largely stagnated  including from WYNN s two Las Vegas properties  Revenues from the US operation dropped 1 percent year over year for Q2  Change to the company s bottom line was marginal 
As a rule  strong casinos are the result of a strong economy  The gaming industry in the US has not yet seen the benefits of the slowly strengthening US economy 
Conclusion
A casino s performance is affected by many factors monetary regulations  gambling regulations and the strength of the local and even global economy all have the potential to make or break a casino  That s been clearly demonstrated by the decline of Macao s casinos over the past couple of years  As such  it s always better to invest in the gaming business at a discount rather than at a premium 
With a current stock price of  95 52 as of yesterday s close and a P E ratio of 29 55  Wynn Resorts is hardly trading at a discount  especially with the Las Vegas Sands trading a bit more cheaply  at  58 16 and a P E ratio of 28 32 at time of writing 
Could Wynn Resorts reclaim the heights at which it was trading in early 2014  above  200  With everything going its way plus a home run with the new Wynn Palace  probably  However  at this point  that s far from certain  Already up nearly 100  from its early 2016 bottom of  52 76  it s likely those who jumped on the stock during the early days of the most recent dip have already seen the benefits a hefty discount and have made their money  In our view  now is probably not the time to take a position in Wynn Resorts ",2016-10-20,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-things-to-watch-when-wynn-resorts-reports-earnings-on-thursday-200157386,200157386

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories  1     Gross gaming revenues  GGR  for the month of October rose 8 8  on a yearly basis to approximately  2 7 billion or 21 8 billion patacas  per the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau  This third successive rise in October  after 26 months of decline  continued the revival in Macau Notably  new resorts including Wynn Resorts  Wynn Palace  opened on Aug 22  and Las Vegas Sands  subsidiary  Sands China Ltd  s The Parisian  opened on Sep 13   continued to attract tourists and leisure gamblers  giving a boost to revenues  Moreover  the rise compared favorably with the 7 4  increase recorded in Sep 2016 Meanwhile  GGR in Macau for the first 10 months of 2016 were down 5 8  year over year  Notably  gaming revenues in Macau have been falling since Jun 2014  given the crackdown on corruption in China  This compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau Consequently  this lowered footfall at local casinos  A slowdown in China  tighter visa policies  political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes   Nonetheless  efforts undertaken by Macau operators to revive revenues by adding new resorts and more non gaming facilities in order to attract tourists and recreational gamblers have finally started yielding results  This is evident from gambling revenue growth in the past three months 2     Las Vegas Sands  third quarter earnings of 72 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents by over 22   Also  earnings increased 9  year over year due to higher revenues and profits Quarterly net revenue of  2 97 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 77 billion by 7 2  and inched up 2 6  year over year due to a somewhat better performance in Macao  On a consolidated basis  adjusted property EBITDA increased 8 6  year over year to  1 14 billion during the quarter owing to higher revenues This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company stated that the operating environment in Macao continued to improve during the quarter  especially in the mass segment  as the

Consensus Estimate of 79 cents by 5 1   Further  earnings decreased 12 8  year over year mainly due to a lower operating income margin  Net revenue of  1 11 billion failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 billion by 1 8   However  revenues increased 11 4  on the back of improved performance by Las Vegas Operations and the Wynn Palace opening  partly offset by lower revenues from Wynn Macau Despite consistent efforts to boost tourism and traffic in Macau  this Zacks Rank  3 company failed to turn around its operations in the region  Also  cannibalization at Wynn Macau

surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 billion by 1 8   Moreover  the figure improved 22  on a year over year basis  primarily driven by contributions from Studio City  launched in Oct 2015  as well as higher casino revenues at City of Dreams Manila  These upsides were  however  partially offset by lower casino revenues at City of Dreams Macau and Altira Macau Adjusted Property EBITDA was  289 2 million in the third quarter  up 22  year over year  read more    5     Meanwhile  Boyd Gaming s third quarter adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents by 16 7  but decreased 48 1  on a year over year basis owing to lower revenues  Net revenue of  532 million failed to beat the consensus mark of  542 million by nearly 2  and declined 2 6  year over year An increase in room revenue growth was more than offset by a decrease in gaming  food and beverage and other revenues  Total adjusted EBITDA was  121 9 million  down 2 6  year over year  Boyd Gaming carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    6     Century Casinos posted third quarter adjusted earnings per share of 8 cents  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents by 11 1  and declining 27 3  from prior year quarter figure Net revenue of  34 5 million lagged the consensus mark by nearly 4  but improved 3  from the prior year quarter  The results reflect a decrease in Canada revenues

Notably  gaming in Macau has been under pressure since   on credit crunch issues in mainland China  check on illegal money transfers especially in VIP gaming and a broad based slowdown in China  However  the industry finally started to stabilize after a protracted slowdown  Against this backdrop  casino stocks reported earnings results in the last few days 
Here we highlight earnings of the three big casino and hotel companies  MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM    Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   and Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    
Among the three  the latest to report was MGM Resorts  On November 7  before the opening bell  MGM Resorts posted adjusted earnings of  0 58 per share  significantly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 08  Total revenue of  2 52 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 37 billion by around 6  and jumped 10 3  year over year  The upside reflects a significant increase in Las Vegas operations 
On November 3 after hours  Las Vegas Sands Corp  beat on both lines  Adjusted earnings per share of  0 72 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 59 and grew 9  year over year due to higher revenues and profits  Quarterly net revenues of  2 97 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 77 billion and inched up 2 6  year over year due to relatively a better show in Macao 
On November 2  2016 after hours  Wynn Resorts Ltd  reported lower than expected third quarter 2016 results  Adjusted earnings of  0 75 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 79 by 5 1   Further  earnings decreased 12 8  from the year ago figure due to lower operating income margin   Wynn Resorts  revenues of  1 11 billion failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 billion by 1 8  but increased 11 4  on the back of an improved performance by Las Vegas Operations 
Market Impact
While MGM and Las Vegas Sands amazed investors this quarter  Wynn Resorts failed to do so  Needless to say  MGM and LVS added post earnings while WYNN lost  In the key trading session  MGM stock gained over 2 9  on November 7 while LVS added over 1 7  in the last five days  as of November 7  2016  and WYNN was off over 7  
The mixed impact on the industry can be verified by the five day return of VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF  which has sizable exposure to the afore mentioned stocks  In the last five days  as of November 7  2016   the fund added about 2 1   If we rule out WYNN Resorts  a buoyancy is noticed in the industry and often a rising tide lifts all boats in an industry  Moreover  the Zacks Industry Rank of these casino companies is in top 18  at the time of writing 
MGM and WYNN has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  while LVS has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   While investing in a single stock is always an option  investors can take advantage of the sluggish return of Macau via BJK or the basket approach 
BJK in FocusThe fund looks to track the MVIS Global Gaming Index and provides investors a direct exposure to the casino gaming market  The product has so far been overlooked by investors as is evident from its paltry volume of about 6 000 shares daily The fund has so far attracted  19 7 million in assets and invested that in 41 holdings  The product is expensive as it charges 66 bps in fees per year All three abovementioned companies have created places in the top 10 holdings of the fund with a considerable share  Both companies   Sands China and Las Vegas Sands   have about 17  exposure in BJK MGM Resorts International  7 62   and MGM China holdings  about 1 34   call for about 9  of the fund  Wynn Resorts Ltd  2 55   and Wynn Macau  1 53   also account for more than 4  of BJK  see  here   Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox

157173,378689,WYNN,Here s Why Japan Could Become The Next Gambling Hotspot,opinion,"Gambling revenues from the traditional hubs of Las Vegas and Macau have rebounded after a period of difficulty  but the big casinos are already shifting their attention away from these locations and on to Japan  which is currently debating legislation that would legalize gambling in the country 
The push to legalize gambling in Japan started this summer when the Liberal Democratic Party  led by President Shinzo Abe  won a decisive majority in the Japanese legislature  Unlike China  which limits gambling to Macau  Abe and the Liberal Democrats are looking to legalize the business throughout Japan 
The fate of Japan s current gambling legislation is still up in the air  but we do know that top executives from Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS    MGM Resorts   NYSE MGM    and other casino powerhouses have made presentations to Japanese lawmakers recently 
MGM has been an outspoken proponent of Japanese gambling legalization  and CEO James Murren has promised that the company would spend anywhere from  5 billion to  10 billion on an integrated resort somewhere on the Japanese mainland 
Las Vegas Sands and its enigmatic CEO Sheldon Adelson have been advocating for gambling in Japan for years now  with Adelson pledging back in 2014 that his company would  spend whatever it takes  to get a foothold in the country 
Obviously these casino giants would be pleased to see any new gambling market open up  but their eagerness for Japan is due to the sheer size of the country s potential market  Some analysts have estimated Japan s casino market opportunity to be as high as  40 billion a year  That would make the country s gambling business nearly 40  larger than Macau s 
Japan has a population of about 126 million  and its negative birth rate means that its populace is comprised of adults who could be ready to gamble  Nearly 38  of the country is between the ages of 25 and 54  and that s a prime target for the casinos 
It s also worth noting that Tokyo is set to host the 2020 Summer Olympics  This is a factor for a pair of reasons  First of all  promoting additional tourism is advantageous for the Japanese government  as more tax revenue could help offset the enormous costs of preparing for the Games  Also  casinos will want to get in and start building as soon as possible because the Summer Olympics will see a massive influx of tourists to the country  and that s good business 
There s certainly no guarantee that the gambling legislation passes in this current round of voting  but the pro gambling sentiment in Japan seems to be growing  and that could mean that the world will soon have another casino hotspot

political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes    Nonetheless  efforts undertaken by Macau operators to revive revenues by adding more non gaming facilities in order to attract tourists and recreational gamblers  have finally started yielding results  Further  Las Vegas Sands  subsidiary  Sands China Ltd  s new Macau resort  The Parisian  which is set to open on Sep 13  2016  will likely attract more mainstream visitors and help drive mass market growth  going forward  2  According to the Nevada Gaming Control Board  Nevada gambling revenues in Jul

Casinos posted lower than expected first quarter fiscal 2017 results with earnings of 26 cents lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents by 10 3   Meanwhile  earnings witnessed a decline of 7 1  on a year over year basis owing to lower revenues  Net revenue of  240 9 million decreased 2 4  year over year due to a fall in casino  rooms and food  beverage  pari mutuel and other revenues  Moreover  the top line missed the consensus mark by 2 5   4  Iao Kun Group Holding Company recently announced that given the continuing testing VIP gaming environment in Macau  the company is undertaking an all inclusive strategic review of its VIP gaming room operations therein  Notably  in order to cut costs  the company has shut down its VIP gaming room at the Sands Cotai Central Casino in Macau  effective Aug 31  It expects the closure of the facility to bring in annual overall savings of roughly  750 000  Moreover  once the review is complete  the company may close a couple of VIP gaming rooms to boost operating earnings  Interestingly  with this restructuring  the company aims to enhance its operating performance  Price Performance  The following table shows the price movement of the major gambling stocks over the past week and the last six months  Over the last five trading sessions  share price movement of the major stocks was encouraging  Melco Crown gained the highest

157256,378772,WYNN,Can The Gambling Industry Survive ,opinion,"When one thinks of gambling  the first images that come to mind are of the vibrant  colorful  tall buildings that paint the Las Vegas skyline  The multi billion dollar industry is as controversial as it is illustrious  and it has made some rich while bankrupting others 
The 21st century has been characterized by unprecedented technological innovation  and with that has come a change in consumer demands as well  The gambling industry has seen slowed growth in the last few years  and it is doing everything in its power to evolve and find new growth catalysts  However  the main question has become whether these changes have been too little and or too late 
Is the business of gambling climbing onto its deathbed  or expanding into an even larger beast  Well  let s take a look at what the major players in the industry have doing to see if their bets will pay off moving forward 
The Newfound Importance of Macau
Although Las Vegas was the epicenter of the gambling industry for decades  recent years have seen an eastward shift towards China s Special Autonomous Region  SAR  of Macau  In 2002  the Macau government ended casino tycoon Stanley Ho s monopoly in the region  bringing in competition from major Las Vegas players such as Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS    and MGM Resorts   NYSE MGM    amongst others 
Since then  these companies have come to derive a majority of their income from Macau  For the aforementioned companies  sales from Macau account for more than each of their respective Las Vegas operations  However  recent changes in the region have caused a decline in gambling activity 
Chinese President Xi Jinping s anti corruption efforts have decreased the amount of traffic Macau  since it s hard to spend your hard earned illegal cash from behind bars  Wynn CEO Steve Wynn stated in the company s most recent earnings call that decreased traffic in Macau cost the company  150 million 
A Business Insider  reported that Macau gaming revenue has fallen as much as 50  in recent months  and companies in the region have felt the burn  LVS announced their  on July 25th  in which they missed earnings  citing a difficult operating environment in Macau 
The companies believe that the hard times in Macau have bottomed out for now  but some are still mixing things up in order to increase profitability 
Changing the Rules
In a call with investors on Thursday  Steve Wynn said that the company had changed the layout on their floor  moving high yielding games in high traffic areas while moving more low risk games to less popular parts of their casinos  The CEO also announced lower winnings odds for their games 
It s a daring strategy to openly announce that you ve decreased the odds of customers winning your games  but those changes allowed them to increase profit margins and beat their Q2 2016 earnings expectations  even with a Macau that isn t pulling its weight right now 
Wynn s newest Macau location will open on August 23rd after a few delays  while LVS will open a new location on September 13th   Although these companies believe that demand is stabilizing in the region  it also isn t growing  and that coupled with the rise of online gambling could pose a threat as well 
The Rise of Online Gambling
Whereas older generations that wished to gamble did so in casinos  younger consumers are doing so online  In recent years  fantasy daily sports leagues like DraftKings and Fanduel have drawn in over 100 000 players and are each valued over  1 billion  Another new concept is that of skill based gambling games  which combine both chance and skill in videogame style slot services 
Although these ventures represent a new avenue for the gambling industry  they still fall in the gray area in the slow moving world of legislation  Online gambling is technically illegal in the United States  but isn t prosecuted or strictly regulated either  While these companies still continue to operate and generate revenue  a strike down from the courts could destroy them 
Furthermore  these online gambling businesses threaten brick and mortar establishments  as many prefer to get their fix from the comfort of their own homes 
Bottom Line
The world of gambling remains as controversial as ever  with many continuing to look unfavorably on the industry  Decreased revenue from Macau coupled with the rise of virtual gambling services put current moguls in an awkward position 
Although outlook appears grim  stabilizing demand and new locations give hope to companies like Wynn and LVS  However  whether they pay off remains to be seen  Things are a bit shaky for the gambling industry  but it appears poised to continue its questionable existence in the years to come ",2016-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-the-gambling-industry-survive-200145101,200145101

157297,378813,WYNN,MGM Resorts  MGM  Tops Q1 Earnings  Misses On Revenues,opinion,"MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   posted mixed results for the first quarter of 2016  wherein its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  but revenues missed the same 
Performance in Las Vegas and regional resorts improved  However  MGM China continued to underperform due to weakness in Macau  a key operating region for the company 
Earnings and Revenue Discussion
MGM Resorts posted earnings of 16 cents per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents by 23 1   Reported earnings  however  declined 38 5  from the year ago quarter 
 On the other hand  total revenue of  2 21 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 31 billion by 4 4  and declined 5 2  year over year  The downside reflects a significant decline in revenues from MGM China  The company owns 51  of MGM China Holdings Limited  the owner of MGM Macau resort and casino  and is developing a gaming resort in Cotai 
Gambling revenues in Macau were sluggish throughout the first months of the quarter as high stake gamblers have been reducing their spending amid the ongoing economic weakness in China  The region has also struggled due to the Chinese government s anti graft corruption drive  which has reduced footfall at the casinos  Also  credit growth concerns  tighter restrictions on visas and a partial smoking ban in casinos have impacted revenues in the region 
Gross gaming revenues in Macau declined throughout the quarter 
Other companies that are bearing the brunt of a weak gambling business in Macau include Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS    Wynn Resorts Ltd    NASDAQ WYNN   and Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd    NASDAQ MPEL   
Adjusted property EBITDA at MGM Resorts  wholly owned domestic resorts was  485 million  up 24  year over year  The Profit Growth Plan that commenced in Jul 2015 is apparently paying off  reflected by improving profits 
MGM China
MGM China net revenue plunged 26  year over year to  469 million due to lower revenues from both VIP gamblers and main floor table games 
Main floor table games revenues dropped 8   while VIP table games revenues plunged 41  due to a lower VIP table games turnover of 34   However  the hold percentage contracted 30 basis points  bps  year over year to 3  
MGM China s adjusted EBITDA tanked 23  to  114 million due to weak sales 
Domestic Operations
MGM Resorts owns and operates several properties in Las Vegas  Apart from this  it has a number of assets in Mississippi and Michigan 
Net revenue at wholly owned domestic resorts was up 3   Excluding Circus Circus Reno  Railroad Pass  and the company s properties in Jean Nevada that were sold in 2015  revenues grew 4   Casino revenues from wholly owned domestic resorts improved 4  due to higher table games revenues 
Table games hold percentage was 22 4   up 230 bps year over year  Room revenues climbed 7   primarily attributable to an 8  rise in Las Vegas Strip RevPAR and a 6 6  increase in average daily rate 
Food and beverage revenues were up 1 8  supported by an improvement in the convention and banquet business  Meanwhile  Entertainment revenues dropped 6 1  owing to lower revenues generated from in house shows 
Operating income at the company s wholly owned domestic resorts surged 33  
Management and other operations generated revenues of  121 4 million  down 2 3  year over year 
Income from Unconsolidated Affiliates   CityCenter Holdings
MGM s urban complex  CityCenter  located in Las Vegas  with 50  owned by the company   operates through two segments   Resort and Residential  Under the Resort operations  the company has four properties  namely Aria  Crystals  Vdara and Mandarin Oriental 
Net revenue from CityCenter declined a marginal 0 2  year over year to  301 5 million  Adjusted EBITDA jumped 22 9  to  91 million

Notably  Macau   a Chinese territory   is one of the largest casino gaming destinations in the world  Credit crunch issues in mainland China  check on illegal money transfers especially in VIP gaming and a broad based slowdown in China led casino operations to doze off 
Though this long criticized zone recorded a 9 5  decline in gambling revenue in April  the fall was less than expected  This definitely sparks off hopes over positive developments in the region  Investors should note that April numbers revealed the  drop in revenues 
Against this background  casino stocks reported earnings in the last few days  Investors might be interested in knowing how badly casino earnings were hurt due to the sagging Macau business or how smartly these companies navigated the troubles  and definitely their impact on the casino ETF Q1 Earnings in DetailMGM Resorts International    NYSE MGM    posted first quarter 2016 earnings of  0 16 per share on May 5  Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 13 but were lower than the year ago earnings of  0 26 
Revenues were down 5 2  to  2 21 billon and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 31 billion  The downside reflects a significant decline in revenues from MGM China  VIP gambling continues to be a drag in China   
However  net revenue at wholly owned domestic resorts was up 2 6   MGM shares gained about 1 9  on May 5 
In late April  Las Vegas Sands Corp     NYSE LVS    came up with first quarter 2016 earnings per share of  0 45 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 61  Adjusted EPS declined almost 32  year over year due to lower revenues and profits  Quarterly net revenue of  2 72 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 88 billion and declined 9 8  year over year due to weak performance in Macau 
LVS stock was down about 14 8   as of May 5  2016  since it reported earnings on April 20 Wynn Resorts Ltd     NASDAQ WYNN    posted mixed first quarter 2016 results  Adjusted earnings of  1 07 per share were 52 9  higher year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83  Revenues of  997 7 million missed the consensus mark of  1 007 billion and slipped 8 7  year over year  owing to a 13 8  decline in Macau partially made up by 0 7  rise in revenues in Las Vegas 
WYNN resorts gained about 2  after hours of May 5  after reporting earnings  see   ETF Impact

Ambarella  Inc   NASDAQ AMBA   which had a double top up around 125 28  came down hard into the low 30 s  It appears that it built a nice base  and the declining topsline has been taken out  It has been up now for ten days in a row  Tuesday s action was very positive in that it was up another 1 92 to 48 47  or 4   on 1 6 million shares  With 10 5 days to cover  we may yet get to see this stock get up to the 52 4 range  maybe more than that  If this is a breakout  the downtrend may have been reversed

157332,378848,WYNN,This Gaming Play Is Breaking To The Upside,opinion,"Many in the investing and trading world love to go to Las Vegas  It strikes me as completely insane that people who spend their day managing risk like to gamble when they know the odds are stacked against them  Maybe it s just for the rush or entertainment 
What interests me about the casinos are their stock price charts  While many have been trading and following Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN  over the past few weeks i ve been watching another Vegas play that has been doing well  Boyd Gaming  NYSE BYD  has been rising fast since making a low in February  In fact  it s on the verge of making a new 8 year high 

It may be counterintuitive  but stocks making new highs are the best place to look for trade and investment ideas  If you can t wrap you head around that look at Boyd s short term chart  It shows a pullback from an early November high followed by a rebound that started February 12  This has seen a near straight ride higher and the price is now back at that November high  Thursday s price action looks to be breaking a short consolidation to the upside 
One could look at this as a cup and handle pattern triggering with a target to 28    or a as bullish flag break on the most conservative measure to 22 25 or more loosely to 25  The point is that the price action is rising and looks to continue  Momentum has been running hot  so one might see a pullback or further consolidation along the way

157335,378851,WYNN,Gaming Stocks Reporting Earnings On May 5  CZR  MGM  WYNN,opinion,"The going has not been very easy so far in the first quarter for the gaming sector  Nevada based Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS    one of the biggest players in this sector  reported dismal results for the quarter  wherein both its earnings and revenues missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and recorded year over year declines 
Boyd Gaming Corporation   NYSE BYD    on the other hand  beat the consensus mark for earnings  while revenues missed the same  A Nevada based company  Monarch Casino   Resort Inc    NASDAQ MCRI   posted in line earnings for the quarter  but managed to beat revenue estimates  Another gaming company  Penn National Gaming Inc    NASDAQ PENN   was able to surpass estimates for both earnings and revenues this quarter 
The operating scenario in Macau continued to be difficult in the first quarter of 2016  thereby hurting earnings and revenues for these companies  Gross gaming revenues in Macau continued to decline through all the months of the quarter  The anti graft corruption drive undertaken by the Chinese government is keeping VIP gamblers at bay  thereby hurting Macau revenues  Moreover  China s crackdown on illegal money transfers  credit growth issues and tighter restrictions on visas have had a negative impact on revenues in this region  The weakening yuan further dented Macau s gambling revenues as it is making bets more expensive for Chinese gamblers  Also  the ongoing slowdown in the Chinese economy is hurting the mass market segment 
Nevertheless  a comparatively better performance at the main floor and non gaming segments is somewhat compensating for the slowdown in the VIP gaming business in Macau 
Improving demand in Las Vegas due to rising employment rates  low energy prices and tourism growth have been helping casinos in the region  Moreover  the Las Vegas Strip  where gaming companies enjoy a significant foothold  has been recording high occupancy rates over the past year  which should boost their revenues  Further  diversification of resort portfolios and non gaming options should benefit these companies 
This week  we expect earnings releases from major casino operators like Wynn Resorts Ltd    NASDAQ WYNN    Caesars Entertainment Corporation   NASDAQ CZR    and MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM    Let s take a look at how these companies are placed ahead of their scheduled announcements 
Wynn Resorts is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  after the market closes  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 39 19   However  the casino operator has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 4 60  over the trailing four quarters  Wynn Resorts currently has Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  4 82    Read   

Caesars Entertainment is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  after the market closes  Last quarter  the casino operator posted a negative earnings surprise of a massive 128 57   The company has posted a negative average earnings surprise of 6 88  over the four trailing quarters  Caesars Entertainment carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an  of 0 00    Read   
MGM Resorts is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company posted a substantial negative earnings surprise of 114 29   However  the company has recorded positive surprises in three out of the trailing four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 106 49   MGM Resorts carries Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of  46 15    Read   
Nevertheless  we believe not all hope is lost for casino stocks  as an improvement in the Las Vegas economy is mitigating the slump in Macau

The going has not been very easy so far in the first quarter for the gaming sector  Nevada based Las Vegas Sands Corp      NYSE LVS     one of the biggest players in this sector  reported dismal results for the quarter  wherein both its earnings and revenues missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and recorded year over year declines  Boyd Gaming Corporation    NYSE BYD     on the other hand  beat the consensus mark for earnings  while revenues missed 

The operating scenario in Macau continued to be difficult in the first quarter of 2016  thereby hurting earnings and revenues for these companies  Gross gaming revenues in Macau continued to decline through all the months of the quarter  The anti graft corruption drive undertaken by the Chinese government is keeping VIP gamblers at bay  thereby hurting Macau revenues  Moreover  China s crackdown on illegal money transfers  credit growth issues and tighter restrictions on visas have had a negative impact on revenues in this region  The weakening yuan further dented Macau s gambling revenues as it is making bets more expensive for Chinese gamblers  Also  the ongoing slowdown in the Chinese economy is hurting the mass market segment 

Nevertheless  a comparatively better performance at the main floor and non gaming segments is somewhat compensating for the slowdown in the VIP gaming business in Macau 

Improving demand in Las Vegas due to rising employment rates  low energy prices and tourism growth have been helping casinos in the region  Moreover  the Las Vegas Strip  where gaming companies enjoy a significant foothold  has been recording high occupancy rates over the past year  which should boost their revenues  Further  diversification of resort portfolios and non gaming options should benefit these companies 

This week  we expect earnings releases from major casino operators like Wynn Resorts Ltd     NASDAQ WYNN     Caesars Entertainment Corporation    NASDAQ CZR    and MGM Resorts International     NYSE MGM     Let s take a look at how these companies are placed ahead of their scheduled announcements 

Wynn Resorts is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  after the market closes  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 39 19   However  the casino operator has posted an average negative earnings surprise of 4 60  over the trailing four quarters  Wynn Resorts currently has Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  4 82    Read    

Caesars Entertainment is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  after the market closes  Last quarter  the casino operator posted a negative earnings surprise of a massive 128 57   The company has posted a negative average earnings surprise of 6 88  over the four trailing quarters  Caesars Entertainment carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an  of 0 00    Read    

MGM Resorts is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company posted a substantial negative earnings surprise of 114 29   However  the company has recorded positive surprises in three out of the trailing four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 106 49   MGM Resorts carries Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of  46 15    Read    

Nevertheless  we believe not all hope is lost for casino stocks  as an improvement in the Las Vegas economy is mitigating the slump in Macau

157338,378854,WYNN,Wynn Resorts  WYNN  Tops Q1 Earnings  Macau Still Weak,opinion,"Wynn Resorts Ltd    NASDAQ WYNN   posted mixed results for first quarter 2016  with earnings outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same for the sixth consecutive quarter  Meanwhile  the company registered year over year declines in both fronts 

Earnings and Revenue Discussion

	Adjusted earnings of  1 07 per share in the quarter plunged approximately 52 9  year over year due to a decline in revenues  Further  it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents by 28 9  





	Adjusted earnings exclude pre opening cost  a drop in swap fair value  higher redemption note fair value  and net and property charges 

	Wynn Resorts  revenues of  997 7 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 billion by 0 9   Reported revenues also dropped 8 6  due to sluggish performance in Macau  partly offset by higher revenues in Las Vegas 

	Adjusted property earnings before interests  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  declined 7  year over year to  300 3 million on lower revenues  Total operating costs and expenses declined approximately 13 8  to  839 4 million as due to lower casino  and general and administrative expenses 

	The company owns and operates casino hotel resorts in Las Vegas and the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People s Republic of China 

Macau Operations

	Wynn Resorts reports its Macau table games results under two segments   VIP and mass market 

	Wynn Macau revenues tanked 13 8  year over year to  608 2 million in the quarter  owing to lower revenues at both segments 

	Notably  gross gaming revenues in Macau declined throughout all the three months of the quarter  In fact  gross gaming revenues have been declining since Jun 2014  The region is struggling due to the Chinese government s anti graft corruption drive  which has lowered footfall at the casinos  Also  credit growth concerns  tighter restrictions on visas and a partial smoking ban in casinos were responsible for the decline in revenues from the region 

	Table games turnover in the VIP segment plunged 21 4  to  13 5 billion due to a sluggish Macau VIP market  VIP table games win rate  based on turnover  was 2 81   up 10 basis points  bps  but within the projected range of 2 7  to 3  

	Table drop in the mass market segment was  1 21 billion  down 5 6   Table games win in the mass market category amounted to  247 5 million  down 11 5   However  mass market win rate was 20 5   up 130 bps 

	Revenue per available room  RevPAR  fell 5  in the quarter due to a 270 bps decline in occupancy rate and a 2 1  slip in average daily rate  ADR   Non casino revenues before promotional allowances tanked 13 2  to  76 7 million  In the quarter  adjusted property EBITDA was  160 1 million  down 33 6  due to weakness in the gaming segment 

	Wynn Resorts is focused on developing the Wynn Palace Project on the Cotai land in Macau  The resort is scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2016  Currently  the company expects the project to cost around  4 2 billion  of which around  177 5 million was already spent in the first quarter 

Las Vegas Operations

	Wynn Resorts  revenues from Las Vegas operations inched up 0 7  to  389 4 million supported by higher non casino revenues and increased room revenues  Table games win percentage was 26 3   up 260 bps  and above management s guidance range of 21 25  

	Total non casino revenues  before promotional allowances  increased 0 5  year over year  Room revenues were up 5 5  to  105 1 million backed by an increase in ADR  During the quarter  RevPAR grew 3 4   while ADR went up 5 3   However  occupancy rate fell 130 bps to 81 7   In the quarter  adjusted property EBITDA was down 1 5  to  109 million 

Bottom Line

	A weak operating environment in Macau once again hurt revenues for the casino operator  partially offset by an improvement in the Las Vegas segment  Other companies that are suffering from weak performance in Macau are Melco Crown Entertainment Limited   NASDAQ MPEL    Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   and MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM

157362,378878,WYNN,Betting On Red In Wynn,opinion,"Steve Wynn has a had a tough 2 years  The stock of his casino company Wynn  O WYNN  has fallen from over  240 down to the current price around 80  That is tough  The last week it has looked like things might be looking up  But maybe that is not a good bet 
The chart below shows a long consolidation period that started in September and continues today  The move that began last week has taken the stock back up to the top of the consolidation range  Now they stock stands at the falling 200 day SMA 

The small candles of consolidation are a signal of digestion  Often this is a signal of consolidation before another move higher  The case for Wynn is that it is more like a bearish rising pennant than a bull flag  This can be seen as the price is slowly rising while the volume is falling  Add to this picture that the RSI is venturing into overbought territory and the MACD leveling and you have a set up for a short trade  Look for a fall back from resistance to trade short via puts or short sale

157383,378899,WYNN,Wynn Surges On Inside Buy,opinion,"Wynn Resorts  O WYNN  is having an incredible day in the market today after a big move by Steve Wynn  Wynn made the decision to purchase a massive amount of shares in his own company  Today  we ll talk about why insider buying is important to watch  the stake Steve Wynn recently purchased in Wynn Resorts and what we can expect to see from WYNN moving forward 
Why Insider Transactions Are Important To Watch
As investors  we only know as much about a company we invest in as the insiders choose to disclose  While legalities require some information to be disclosed  we simply don t get the full picture  Therefore  it s important to watch insider transactions  Ultimately  when an insider makes the decision to sell a massive stake in a company  investors can expect that some kind of bad news is on the way  Adversely  when an insider makes the decision to purchase a large stake in a company  as we saw with WYNN  we can expect that good news is on the horizons 
Steve Wynn Purchases More Than 1 Million WYNN Shares
Today  we got news that Steve Wynn made a very large purchase of shares in his own company  The Chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts unloaded  63 8 million in exchange for more than a million shares in Wynn Resorts  The purchase took place on the NASDAQ open market starting on Friday and ending on Tuesday  The shares purchased ranged in price from  62 41 to  64 44 per share and the total number of shares purchased came in at 1 003 977  This is a huge purchase that shows that Steve Wynn has faith that the struggling stock is likely to pick up soon 
How The Market Reacted To The News
Any time we see a massive insider purchase  it insinuates to investors that the insider is confident that the stock is going to climb  As a result  investors get excited and we tend to see overwhelmingly positive movement in the stock as a result  That s exactly what we re seeing from Wynn Resorts  Currently  10 19   WYNN is trading at  70 18 per share after a gain of  8 38 per share or 13 56  
What We Can Expect To See From WYNN Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from WYNN  Throughout the year  China s Macau district has been a major cause of concern for the company  causing declines that led to a 58  loss on the year  Nonetheless  I believe that we ve seen the worst of the declines so far  While Wynn did struggle with tight regulations in China s Macau district  those regulations are starting to weaken  We re also seeing more gaming here in the United States and we should remember that WYNN plans on opening Wynn Palace Pin Macau in the Cotai region in China in 2016  All of this points to a stronger company with a stock that s likely to match over the long run  All in all  WYNN seems like a great investment at the moment  especially for those looking for long run gains throughout the year 2016 ",2015-12-09,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wynn-surges-on-inside-buy-375143,375143
157384,378900,WYNN,Wynn Resorts Ltd  Potential Double Bottom,opinion,Despite the market s sell off on Friday  the stock closed the session with a 13 34  gain on its heaviest positive trade since October 2  If we could see a V bounce like we witnessed in October  the stock could run towards 68 70 levels  which could mean  20  gains  From a technical standpoint  there is a possible double bottom formation evident on the daily chart  Plus  all three technical indicators are showing positive divergences by not falling below their October 2015 lows  The immediate bias is bullish and a break of Friday s high of 59 12 will lead to some big momentum  Keep in mind  Wynn Resorts Limited  O WYNN  CEO has purchased 1 Million shares between Dec 4 and Dec 8 at prices well above the current levels  On Watch ,2016-01-18,António Costa,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-potential-double-bottom-here-380439,380439

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 78 and revenue of  966 44 million  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates
Wynn Resorts Limited  O WYNN  is battling headwinds in Macau  Asia s Las Vegas  as Gross Gaming Revenues have declined year over year since 2014 
The development of WYNN Palace in Macau could generate up to  700 million in revenue
Wynn Resorts  the developer and operator of luxury hotels and casinos  is scheduled to report Q4 2015 earnings February 11  after the market closes  The company currently operates in Las Vegas and China s mainland peninsula  Macau  In the past year WYNN shares have declined 59  from economic turmoil in China impacting tourism and consumer spending  This quarter  the Estimize community is calling for EPS of  0 78  4 cents higher than Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  962 94 million  only  2 million ahead of the Street  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY decline in EPS and revenue of 34  and 14   respectively 
The city of Macau  otherwise known as the  Las Vegas of Asia   heavily depends on gaming traffic and Gross Gaming Revenues  GGR  to support its economy  In January  GGR fell 21  YoY to  2 3 billion and has declined every month since June 2014  To make matters worse  analysts are expecting the Macau economy to fall 14  in 2016 due to struggling gaming revenues  
Wynn has been working on its struggling operations in Macau and is prepared to launched a new luxury hotel to stimulate growth in the region  Company guidance is projecting Wynn Palace to gross over  700 million in annual revenue  That said  the forecasted figure is contingent on regulations regarding gambling tables and non gambling space 
Despite strong headwinds in Macau and struggling share prices  Wynn has been generous in returning to shareholders  In the past 2 months  CEO  Steve Wynn  issued an expansive stock buyback program where he repurchased  63 9 million in shares in December 2015 and  31 9 million in shares in January 2016  Wynn s exuberance is a possible indicator that company is poised for a bounce back year ",2016-02-11,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-can-wynn-bounce-back-384283,384283
157386,378902,WYNN,The Latest Oversold Period Ends With A JP Morgan Chase Bottom,opinion,"T2108 Status  23 0   ends a 1 day oversold period T2107 Status  15 2 VIX Status  25 4General  Short term  Trading Call  bullishActive T2108 periods  Day  1 over 20   ends 1 day oversold and under 20    overpriod   Day  29 under 30   Day  45 under 40   Day  49 below 50   Day  64 under 60   Day  405 under 70 
Commentary FINALLY  The market delivers a more typical oversold period  Perhaps  just maybe  market sentiment is starting to turn  In deference to market hope  I focus more on the positives in this post 
 Oversold  trading conditions occur when T2108 drops below 20   T2108 quantifies the percentage of stocks trading below their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   The typical oversold period lasts just one or two days  T2108 closed on Friday at 23 0  and left behind a 1 day oversold period 
This frequency  distribution  chart for oversold duration shows that over half of oversold periods last just one or two days 

Mean and Median Duration Below Given T2108 Threshold
 relies on the short lived nature of oversold periods for its biggest successes  This behavior explains why I prefer the aggressive strategy to jump right into the pool as soon as T2108 dives into oversold territory  Since August  the market  via the S P 500  has twisted and churned through some intense oversold periods with sellers maintaining a lot of influence and control  The more intense oversold periods require a secondary strategy that includes triggering subsequent trades off the volatility index  the VIX  When the VIX surges during an oversold period  invariably  a bottom is at hand  This year s oversold periods have not experienced true surges  Instead  bottoms have occurred at or near resistance for the VIX  This resistance sits  coincidentally   at the intraday high from 2012 
The VIX has consistently failed to push through resistance this year 

ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  N UVXY  gaps down along with the drop in volatility 
The chart of the VIX shows that the August Angst delivered a true volatility surge  It also sets the bar for the next true surge in volatility  Note that pushes well above the upper Bollinger  Band  BB  are sufficient to define a true surge 
The frequency of the oversold periods since August has presented another challenge  Trades coming out of the oversold periods have generally become unsustainable  Traders have had to apply quick triggers to lock in profits  I have increasingly considered more bearish positions outside of oversold periods  Coming out of this latest oversold period  the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  N SPY   is barely trading off 2 year lows  In other words  these oversold periods are inflicting steady damage on the index  The failure of buyers to sustain momentum has provided sellers the opportunity to sink the index ever lower  Since December  each oversold period has started with the S P 500 trading at a lower level 

The S P 500 is still breaking down 

The NASDAQ is still trapped in a downward trending channel as it struggles to print a bottom 
This year started with a vicious downtrend channel for the S P 500 and the NASDAQ  A declining 20DMA quickly capped the subsequent rally out of oversold conditions for both major indices  Coming out of the last oversold period  I had targeted the 50DMA as resistance before the next oversold period  Now  I can only look to the 20DMA as a first upside target or around 1900 on the S P 500 
The currency pair AUD JPY   the Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  N FXA   versus the Japanese yen  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  N FXY     has well mapped the on going deterioration in market technicals  AUD JPY last peaked in May right along with the S P 500  The 50DMA and 200DMA have alternated as stiff resistance for the currency pair  AUD JPY printed an impressive recovery from the latest lows  but buyers have a long way to go to prove that move did not completely exhaust them 
AUD JPY is attempting to print a steep bottom at 3 1 2 year lows 
The most intriguing evidence of a bottoming underway comes from the financial sector  Of course  this past week  I finally turned my attention to using the bearishness in this sector as a complement to my set of hedges against bullishness  Jamie Dimon  CEO of JP Morgan Chase  N JPM   must have heard me  My posting was clearly his signal to step up and load up on shares  Dimon purchased a cool  on February 11  2016  The news sent JPM gapping up to a whopping 8 3  gain that neatly placed the stock right back in the middle of the churn that has defined trading since mid January 
Did CEO Jamie Dimon ignite a major bottom in JP Morgan Chase  JPM  
More importantly  the move left behind what technicians call an  bottom  This pattern sets up a major bear trap and the potential for a major bottom  The first move is a gap down that ignites fear and panic  weak hands dump stock and shorts chase  JPM gapped down on February 11th to a 4 5  loss  The subsequent gap up delivered an instant loss to bears and started the pressure to cover  Holders who sold in a panic the previous day feel the pressure to buy back out of fear of getting left behind  This abandoned baby bottom is particularly severe  the 8 3  gain may have already absorbed the majority of the buying panic  This bottom now serves as a VERY important line in the sand for bears and bulls  I have to assume the bulls have won until sellers at least manage to close the gap up 
I will never forget how Dimon s  in late July  2012 marked a major bottom  At that time  Dimon boosted his ownership in the bank to 18   I jumped into the stock quickly but also took profits too quickly several weeks later  In three years  JPM doubled in value  I am NOT saying the same outcome lies ahead  but I definitely put the bearish corners of my brain on notice 
In the last T2108 Update  I noted that I held onto my Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  N XLF  puts despite the big gap down and downdraft  I am continuing to hold the puts as an important hedge with an expiration in March 
Dimon s major insider buying reverberates throughout the financial sector  Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  prints its own abandoned baby bottom 
An abandoned baby bottom in the financial sector coming out of an oversold period presents a very powerful signal  Despite my growing wariness  I have to stick to the rules and assume this is a major bullish sign until sellers prove otherwise  I am putting a complete freeze on further bearish positions and sticking to the bullish side for future trades  This includes any subsequent dips into oversold territory 
One major insider purchase that has not received vindication is in Wynn Resorts Ltd   O WYNN   The stock soared on Friday by 15 8  in post earnings trading  but the stock is still below the close on the day news went out that CEO Steve Wynn had loaded up on 1M shares  Additional buying interest from here would finally mark a potential turn in sentiment with a first upside target at declining 200DMA resistance around  79  Otherwise  WYNN offers a cautionary tale for automatically chasing insiders who use their riches to buy more of their company s stock 
Wynn Resorts Ltd   WYNN  returns to flat for 2016 but has yet to add momentum to Wynn s insider purchase in December 
With oil surging 12  on Friday for its biggest one day  intraday    commodities are also in major focus  Rumored production cuts presumably drove this latest buyer s panic  However  this is yet one more classic example of bear market trading action where traders over react to every little tidbit of rumor  Let s get those production cuts before we get too excited  United States Oil  United States Oil  N USO   barely benefited from the surge  managing only to print a 4 2  gain  A bigger move would have given me confidence that USO approximately confirmed the bottom from January  So far  this latest bottom in USO looks set to end a LOT sooner than I expected 
USO barely benefits from the big one day run up in oil and leaves a confirmation of a bottom in doubt 
Until some real evidence shows up of a turn in commodities  I am staying in fade the rally mode outside of oil  Accordingly  I used the big 7 2  move in BHP Billiton  N BHP  to triple down on my put options on the stock  I hit March expiration to increase my hedge duration and give enough runway for over reactions to fizzle out 
BHP Billiton Limited  BHP  jumps toward declining 50DMA resistance again 
The commodities I REALLY like here are gold and silver  SPDR Gold Shares  N GLD  looks better than iShares Silver Trust  N SLV   More on these another time

157412,378928,WYNN,Is Wynn Resorts Prepared For China Storm ,opinion,"For Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  and other gaming companies  Macau in China assumes great importance  In the absence of a strong show there  the companies with exposure to Macau are impacted  This was seen in the results of the past few quarters  In fact  it was because of Macau that most of the companies  earnings fell shy of expectations in the last couple of quarters  As a result  some companies  including Wynn  resorted to slashing their dividend rate drastically  Now the question is whether it can turn back to better fortunes since the company is preparing to unveil Wynn Palace in March next year in China s Macau  Is the company ready for a storm in China  Let s see some of the factors before making a decision 
Macau And The Current Situation
Recent reports suggest that gambling revenue from Macau plummeted 35 5  year over year in August  This was the fifteenth straight monthly fall as slowing economic growth in China has worsened the slump  The primary reason for such a bad performance was the crackdown on conspicuous spending in a widespread manner  It is but natural that Wynn Resorts  Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  would have also experienced a similar type of a trend  The region is important for the company since it gets more than 60  of its revenue from there  The company holds 55  of its assets in Macau  That gives an opinion as to why this region assumes so much importance to it 
According to data released by the government of Macau  revenue from the casino plunged to 18 6 billion patacas  or  2 3 billion  from last year  That matched with the 18 6 billion patacas recorded in June  Significantly  though the gaming revenue from the region witnessed a considerable drop  the fall was better than the analysts  estimation of 36   38   That might well be a starting point too for a rebound  though it is premature to come to a conclusion  It is because of Macau that shares of Wynn Resorts  Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  has lost over 60  from its 52 week high price and more than 20  in August alone 
China Storm
Currently  China is facing a slowdown in its economy  thus forcing the policy makers to devalue its currency to boost its export value and restore some confidence in investors  While China is crucial for the global economy  there are other factors to be watched as the Fed rate hikes  besides the sharp drop in crude oil price from the last year level  However  China has not been soft towards gamers as they have cracked down on money laundering between the Macau Monetary Authority and The People s Bank of China  That led to the arrest of seventeen people  Aside from these  the region faces visa restrictions and a planned ban on smoking  That means a big impact on VIP customers  as well as the government hold over the gaming tables 
Wynn Resorts  Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  has already invested about  2 7 billion of the  4 1 billion expected spending in Wynn Palace in Macau  The company is hoping to attract a bigger crowd than a baseball field of Kevin Costner  Its property  plant and equipment grew  1 4 billion and as a percentage of trailing twelve month average net operation assets by 25 5   compared to 0 6  median growth for the industry  Its operating assets  as well as liabilities were less attractive  besides being an underperformer by the industry medians 
The construction  as well as the staffing of Wynn Resorts  Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  s Wynn Palace is on schedule  The company needs to have a clear picture of the total game to be allocated by the government  The gaming firm is in the process of completing the building  Table gaming has also been a question mark in Macau since there are at least six new resorts or expansions launching to take place in the next two year period  The government is not keen on flooding the industry with new table games  There have already been doubts expressed by some circles about the table allocation and that the company has over hired  As the opening of Wynn Palace moves closer  investors need to keep an eye on what the company will get from the government 
Macau May See Recovery
Though Macau has been witnessing a year over year drop of 30   in the current year  there appears to be some stability in monthly revenue generation  The region generated  17    20 billion revenue in most of the eight completed months in the current year  That might be a good beginning for comparison purposes on a year over year basis next year  Most recently  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd  HK 0027  Chairman  Lui Che Woo  said that the worst is over and that there should not be any issue in kick starting the recovery anytime in the near term  For its part  the government also appears to be relenting on visa restrictions and smoking bans  While the government has relaxed visa restrictions  a ban on smoking might be delayed suggesting that a recovery is round the corner 
Wynn Resorts  Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  s plan to open its Palace will likely boost its market share in the Macau region  Though the current year might see mass market table drop  to witness 20  fall in the current year  it will rebound next year and see the volume doubling by the year 2022  According to Forbes estimation  Wynn might generate  2 4 billion in revenue  Also  if the recovery is sooner than expected  the company might be able to deliver EBITDA margin of 30  for Macau casinos  That will translate into  730 million EBITDA  indicating nearly 25  of the company wide EBITDA  On the other hand  if the recovery is stronger than estimated  then it might result in further 10  upside potential 
Conclusion
It seems that Wynn Resorts  Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  shares have nearly bottomed out  Any further drop might be due to drop in monthly revenue generation from Macau  However  commencing from next year  the company s fortune might turn for the better  The addition of Wynn Palace will boost its market share  Therefore  there appears to be low risk for the stock while upside rewards depend on further clarity on revenue generation  In any case  the worst is over for the stock and better days can be seen

Has the Fed Assumed a Third Mandate  
An Opportunity for Readers  Ask Me Anything 
The AMA sessions are the rage these days  and I agreed to participate in one next week  I certainly do not have all of the answers  I have had success in figuring out where to look and identifying real experts on many topics  I answer as many questions as possible in the comments and via email  but I expect this session to be more wide ranging 
Thanks to   If readers are interested in asking something  you can do so in advance  The entire session will be available later as well  but I hope to interact with many at the scheduled time of 2PM EDT on Wednesday  9 23  There is no charge  so I have some hope that the discussion will provide a net profit for participants

Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that it would be all Fed  all the time  That was an easy one  It was a sharply divided week  with a good looking market into the Fed meeting and for a few minutes afterward  As he does each week   describes the action with appropriate wariness about causality  As always  the full article includes several other helpful charts   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  
The chart shows it as a flat week  but you can readily see why it did not feel that good  The week was good enough for the Texas boys to maintain the post Cramer slot on CNBC  but another day or two of this will bring back  Markets in Turmoil  

We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
We are in the period before the important new earnings season  The economic calendar is a bit light  There is a strong focus on international issues  I expect plenty of attention to the meeting of Israel s Prime Minister Netanyahu with Russia s Vladimir Putin  Chinese President Xi Jinping has a state visit to the U S   including a summit meeting with President Obama  Pope Francis will also continue his tour  including a Presidential meeting on Wednesday 
The international theme comes in the wake of last week s FOMC decision  which acknowledged the influence of foreign markets on the U S  economy  The Fed has   maximizing employment and maintaining price stability  Through the mere mention of issues in China and emerging markets  the punditry has a fresh angle on their favorite topic  Criticizing the Fed  The question on the week will be 
Has the Fed taken on a new mandate  
As always  the viewpoints are varied 
The Viewpoints 
The post mortem Fed opinions include the following 


The Fed failed on transparency  by not tipping off the decision in advance   You just can t make this stuff up  
The Fed missed the chance to raise rates  and is already way too slow 
The Fed needs to hurry to raise rates to that they can cut when the next recession hits  It is right around the corner 
The Fed is warning about global economic weakness 
The Fed is sending a muddled message 
None of this was very relevant  Investors should tune out the noise 


As always  I have my own ideas in today s conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasions something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was a little good economic news 
High frequency indicators are generally positive  New Deal Democrat s  includes many indicators that get insufficient attention His conclusion reflects our theme this week 

Once again  those portions of the US economy most exposed to global forces have turned negative  while those most insulated from global problems are generally positive  With housing and motor vehicles still quite positive  I remain positive on the US economy at least through the second quarter of next year  and increasingly so as to the third quarter as well 


Homebuilder confidence hit the highest level in ten years     
Q3 earnings estimates may be too pessimistic  Earnings guru  the expected decline of 2 8  and suggests that actual results might beat this target  especially in certain sectors  We will be following this subject very closely in a few weeks 
Initial jobless claims moved even lower  to 264K   the results to post recession lows  showing their typical great charts for NSA data as well as the seasonally adjusted series  Here is the chart for the four week moving average  a popular way of following this noisy series 

Home equity has improved to over 56   close to pre 2006 levels  U S  residents have more wealth and less leverage   has a list of key topics and charts  including this one 

The Bad
There was also some negative news last week 
Rail traffic declined significantly  reversing last week s spike higher   explores the data and possible reasons 
Technical weakness  Bespoke notes that   See the full post for a discussion of the market implications and additional charts

The Philly Fed showed contraction   analyzes this noisy series while underscoring the most important components 

The Ugly 
Manipulation of Treasury Rates  While still just an investigation  there is a big bank pattern involving other markets     
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  Nominations are always welcome 
Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  For more information on each source   

Recent Expert Commentary on Recession Odds and Market Trends
Bob Dieli does a   subscription required  after the employment report and also a monthly overview analysis  He follows many concurrent indicators to supplement our featured  C Score  
  Provides an array of important economic updates including the best charts around  One of these is monitoring the ECRI s business cycle analysis  Jill Mislinski has joined Doug s team and provides   The ECRI s most recent article suggests that U S  economic growth has been declining for eighteen months according to their indicators  They have continued in the chorus of Fed critics  While eventually stepping back from their mistaken and insistent recession call in 2011  ECRI has remained persistently bearish on economic growth

This is not a market timing tool  but a measure of risk 
The important risk threshold is somewhere around 1 1 
We are not even close to a high risk level 
The Week Ahead
It is a modest week for economic data  I highlight what I see as important  For a comprehensive listing I use Investing com  You can filter for country  type of report  and other factors 
The  A List  includes the following 
New home sales  Th   Important for a continuing economic recovery 
Initial jobless claims  Th   The best concurrent news on employment trends  with emphasis on job losses 
Michigan sentiment  F   Any rebound from weakness in preliminary read  Useful indicator of job creation and spending 
The  B List  includes the following 
Existing home sales  M   Less direct economic significance than new sales  but a good read on the strength of the market 
Durable goods  Th   Weak report expected  but a volatile series 
Crude oil inventories  W   Current interest in energy keeps this on the list of items to watch 
GDP Q2 final  F    Old news  still sets the baseline for measuring economic progress 
In addition to the big week for leaders on the world stage  central bankers will have more to say  Someone will be talking every day  but watch especially for ECB head Draghi on Wednesday  Fed Chair Yellen on Thursday  and St  Louis Fed President Bullard on Friday 
I will also be watching for earnings pre announcements 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
Felix has switched to neutral after the wild swings and failed rally of last week  Felix is still fully invested because there are several remaining pockets of strength  The confidence in this three week forecast is now stronger than it has been in recent weeks  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com  Felix appears almost every day at Scutify  follow him   
 of why most traders are not profitable  My favorites are proper tracking of commission costs and excessive size  You cannot turn a poor system into a good one through money management  but you can go broke despite a good method  Traders take excessive size because the focus on what they want to make rather than what they can afford to risk 
 focuses on stop losses  with a nice list of seven common mistakes 
Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  Start with our  and follow the links 
We also have a page summarizing many of the   If you read something scary  this is a good place to do some fact checking 
Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important article  it would be Morgan Housel s   Morgan has a great lead  emphasizing the health progress over the last 30 years  Since I have lost several family members to breast cancer  this hit home for me 

Consider this  In 1900  1  of American women giving birth died in labor  Today  the five year mortality rate for localized breast cancer is 1 2   Being pregnant 100 years ago was almost as dangerous as having breast cancer is today  


The problem  the doctor said  is that these advances happen slowly over time  so you probably don t hear about them  If cancer survival rates improve  say  1  per year  any given year s progress looks low  but over three decades  extraordinary progress is made 


Compare health care improvements with the stuff that gets talked about in the news   NBC anchor Andrea Mitchell interrupted a Congresswoman last week to announce Justin Bieber s arrest   and you can understand why Americans aren t optimistic about the country s direction  We ignore the really important news because it happens slowly  but we obsess over trivial news because it happens all day long 

This list is so good that it is difficult to pick some favorites  but try these 

5  The average American now retires at age 62  One hundred years ago  the average American died at age 51  Enjoy your golden years   your ancestors didn t get any of them 


9  No one has died from a new nuclear weapon attack since 1945  If you went back to 1950 and asked the world s smartest political scientists  they would have told you the odds of seeing that happen would be close to 0   You don t have to be very imaginative to think that the most important news story of the past 70 years is what didn t happen  Congratulations  world 


10  People worry that the U S  economy will end up stagnant like Japan s  Next time you hear that   unemployment in Japan hasn t been above 5 6  in the past 25 years  its government corruption ranking has consistently improved  incomes per capita adjusted for purchasing power have grown at a decent rate  and life expectancy has risen by nearly five years  I can think of worse scenarios 


35  In 1900  44  of all American jobs were in farming  Today  around 2  are  We ve become so efficient at the basic need of feeding ourselves that nearly half the population can now work on other stuff 


47  According to AT T  NYSE T  archives and the Dallas Fed  a three minute phone call from New York to San Francisco cost  341 in 1915  and  12 66 in 1960  adjusted for inflation  Today  Republic Wireless offers unlimited talk  text  and data for  5 a month 


48  In 1990  the American auto industry produced 7 15 vehicles per auto employee  In 2010 it produced 11 2 vehicles per employee  Manufacturing efficiency has improved dramatically 

Reading the list reminds you of the great progress on so many fronts  despite the persistent focus on negative news and trivia  Much of this progress is not captured in official GDP figures  Everyone talks about health costs without noting how much progress there has been  Jobs  lost  in farming and auto manufacturing reflect productivity improvement  shifting opportunity elsewhere 
And it is also something to keep in mind the next time someone bases a theory on stock data from the 19th century 
Stock Ideas 
Time to roll the dice on Macau gambling  Barron s has a  on Steve Wynn and Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   They discuss a possible 50  gain in the stock and Wynn s reasons for expecting supportive policy from the Chinese government 
Chuck Carnevale s articles always provide a great mix of instruction and specific ideas  He continues his powerful series on retirement investing with an excellent discussion on the right type of stock for your specific needs  As usual there many good ideas  several of which we own   and you will learn how to assemble different stock types in an effective portfolio  You will also learn how to use Chuck s FAST graphs  an indispensable tool 
Philip van Doorn    identifies ten attractive stocks using sales  profits and earnings as criteria  I am always interested in these lists when some of our holdings are included  and we have two of these  I am looking at the others 
Personal Finance 
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in this   As always  there are several great links  but I especially liked this  about talking retirement with young people  Ben Carlson explains that retirement saving does not seem relevant to them  yet it is the very best time to start 
I took up this subject last year  promising to follow up with more  The  is still relevant  but I have not added as much material as I hoped to  It is on my agenda 
Beware 
Wild trading in ETFs present a risk for investors     Be especially careful with market orders  but other intra day pricing may still be an issue 
Trading in the morning may be the worst time for investors    
It is tougher than you think to get commodity exposure through equity investments    
Final Thought
I ll weigh in on each of the question from the introduction  and emphasize a few investment themes 
Concerning transparency  few understand what these means 
It does not mean announcing results before the meeting  Former Dallas Fed President  that members do not know the outcome in advance  They do not even discuss the issue in advance  The meeting matters 
It does not mean an  open meeting   Good decisions require consideration of many possibilities   even the unlikely ones  Ideas can be floated  considered  and refuted  This is the reason that full transcripts are delayed for five years 
The Fed is much more transparent than it was twenty years ago  but it seems only to provide more opportunity for speculation 

Concerning timing of the first hike  I see little relevance to knowing the exact date  I suggested last week that it was much ado about nothing  and so it was  The overall path of increases is most important  and that will be gradual 
Concerning the need to raise to permit a recession fighting reduction later  this is a silly argument  Rate tightening cycles often create recessions  There is plenty of time left in this business cycle  This argument is most frequently raised by those who have been totally wrong about the economy and the stock market  They seem to seek something that will choke off growth 
Concerning the Fed s message about global economic weakness  there is no fresh information about the facts  The Fed produced no data that was not already widely known  The only new information is that  consistent with the urging of many sources  the Fed is cautiously calibrating the impact of global growth on the U S  economy before taking any action 
Concerning the Fed s muddled message  some seem to embrace nuanced statements to suit their own purposes  Noting that the U S  economy is solid and international markets are weaker is not  muddled  
Let us turn back to Morgan Housel s fine list for an interesting conclusion on the success of the Fed 
40  Annual inflation in the United States hasn t been above 10  since 1981 and has been below 5  in 77  of years over the past seven decades  When you consider all the hatred directed toward the Federal Reserve  this is astounding 
The main investment angle from the Fed news is to take advantage of the over reaction  I expect a week full of clarifying Fed speeches    and some better earnings data to come  I continue to like regional banks  technology  consumer discretionary  and some cyclical stocks ",2015-09-20,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-has-the-fed-assumed-a-third-mandate-265578,265578

Commentary Not a lot of action yesterday  the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  N SPY   and T2108 were essentially flat on the day  However  for my last T2108 oversold trade  it was a big day 
The ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  N SVXY  finally breaks out above its 50DMA and closes at its highest point since the oversold periods began 
This 7 2  gain was a sneaky move because the volatility index  the VIX  barely budged on the day  I will probably sell my SVXY shares this week 
The volatility index seems setup to trend all the way back to recent lows 
On the flip side  the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  N UVXY  has ended the August Angst with an exclamation point  UVXY has now completely reversed its entire run up from late August  UVXY is also likely to get back to familiar territory  all downhill 
ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  looks set to resume its downtrend as the August Angst ends with an exclamation point

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  showing some signs of life off the recent lows 
I know IBB is LONG overdue to make a run at reversing the Clinton bash  but the appearance of buying interest as shown above is a reminder to keep the eyes on the ball here 
Speaking of keeping eyes on the ball  I almost missed this unfolding breakout on Baidu  Baidu Inc  O BIDU   
Baidu  BIDU  is finally making a move for a bullish pastures 
I am SO tempted to get back into BIDU  Trading volume is picking up on the buying  However  earnings are coming next week  So  if I do make a move it will strictly be a pre earnings trade  I will definitely be looking for an excuse from earnings to make a longer range play 
My favorite story of the day was Weight Watchers  N WTW   I remember when Jennifer Hudson s commercials made a big splash in early 2011  The stock surged  That was the LAST time things looked good for WTW  The stock maxed out about  87 that year  WTW looked ready for the ICU for over dieting under  4 back in July  Yesterday  it was a full course meal as WTW increased a whopping 105  
Weight Watchers puts on some  good  weight finally as Oprah weighs in 

  74  of float as of September 30th  Talk about greedy shorts  Surely  they had kicked up their feet and planned to just wait for WTW to die a slow but inevitable death  Oprah s purchase of  changed the risk reward balance on short positions  If nothing else  the stock has printed a low that should be sustained for a good while 
The rush to cover must help explain the extreme nature of this move on the news  It has taken me YEARS  but I have finally learned to welcome  not fear  such moves for quick trades  This was NOT a time for fading  So when I saw WTW fading right from the open I made an initial buy fully prepared to make another  I never got another chance  Almost 20  later I locked in my profits

157434,378950,WYNN,5 Gaming Stocks Analysts Love For 2015  Time To Place A Bet ,opinion,"With the economy on an upward trend  it could be time to buy gaming stocks again The gaming sector suffered a dip during the last recession  However  with the economy seeing impressive growth over the last few quarters  the chances that the gaming industry will pick up again are high 
Reuters reported last year that the improvement in economic activities such as construction and healthcare in Vegas has increased the number of people who go to Vegas  This increases the number of people who go to casinos  Moreover  an improving economy could also mean that people now have more money at hand and as such  can now afford the luxury of gambling 
Here are five gaming stocks that analysts love  according to data provided by Thompson Reuters and FactSet through MarketWatch  MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM Las Vegas based MGM Resorts International operates casinos in the U S  and in Macau and has a market cap of  10 billion Seventeen analysts currently rate MGM a  buy   while five analysts have a  hold  rating  The company currently has no analyst rating it a  sell   The rating has stayed steady over the past three months 
A notable recent analyst update came from Union Gaming Research  Analysts at the firm initiated coverage on MGM    and some other Macau gaming stocks    with a  buy  rating  saying that  while the operational gross gaming revenue hasn t bottomed yet  Macau stocks have bottomed and thus  it s time for investors to get in  Melco Crown Entertainment Limited  NASDAQ MPEL Macau gaming company Melco Crown Entertainment is a developer  owner and operator of casino gaming and entertainment resort facilities in Asia  It has a market cap of nearly  14 billion 
Fourteen analysts currently rate Melco Crown a  buy   while eleven analysts have a  hold  rating for Melco Crown  As of three months ago  18 analysts had a  buy  rating on Melco Crown  while eight analysts rated it a  hold   The gaming company doesn t have any analyst advising its sale neither as of the time of writing  nor three months ago 
Melco Crown was also one of the Macau stocks that analysts at Union Gaming rated a  buy   arguing that the stock has already bottomed   as explained in the case of MGM above  Wynn Resorts Ltd   NASDAQ WYNN Based out of Las Vegas  Wynn Resorts develops  owns and operates destination casino resorts in the U S  and in Macau  It has a market cap of about  15 7 billion 
Twelve analysts currently rate Wynn Resorts a  buy   while nine analysts rate the stock a hold   Wynn doesn t have any  sell  ratings 
Wynn was also one of the Macau stocks that Union Gaming covered in its recent report  However  since Union Gaming initiated coverage on the stock with a buy  analysts at Morningstar have downgraded the stock to a  hold   Las Vegas Sands Corp   NYSE  NYSE LVS Las Vegas Sands is a Las Vegas based gaming company that operates integrated resorts in U S  and Asia  It currently has a market cap of  46 billion 
Eleven analysts currently rate Las Vegas Sands a  buy   while seven rate it a  hold   This is quite underwhelming considering that  as of three months ago  there were fifteen analysts who rated Las Vegas Sands a  buy   while seven had a  hold  rating for it  The company doesn t have any analysts who rate it a  sell  
The recent Union Gaming report also rates Las Vegas Sands a  buy   Since then  Stifel Nicolaus has also issued a report in which it lowered its price target for the stock  while still maintaining its  buy  rating  Penn National Gaming Inc   NASDAQ PENN Based out of Wyomissing  Pa   Penn National Gaming owns and manages gaming properties across the U S  It has a market cap of about  1 3 billion

157435,378951,WYNN,No Respite For Casino Stocks As Macau Slump Continues,opinion,"It seems that the situation in the gambling industry is going from bad to worse  Share price of leading casino companies were hit during the trading hours on Monday as economic data released by the Statistics and Census Bureau  DSEC  demonstrated weakness in Macau   a key operating region for these casino companies  Companies that were impacted by the release include Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM   Las Vegas Sands  NYSE LVS  and Melco Crown Entertainment  NASDAQ MPEL  
Per DSEC  Macau s Gross Domestic Product  GDP  for the fourth quarter of 2014 plunged 17 2  year on year in real terms  owing to a significant decline in gross gaming revenues and shrinking visitor spending  This marked the second consecutive quarter of GDP decline and the highest decline since 2001 when the Statistics and Census Service began compiling data  Consequently  GDP for full year 2014 contracted 0 4  in real terms Given the scenario  analysts declared that Macau is in recession    two consecutive quarters of GDP decline What Led to the Decline in Macau Per analysts  as Macau started to grow  it focused on casinos  instead of diversifying into other areas  Since more than 80  of the government s revenues come from gaming  the economy is closely tied to the gambling industry 
As a result  when the Chinese government announced a crackdown on corruption in Macau in 2014  VIP gamblers either opted to refrain from gambling or tried their fortunes elsewhere  This lowered footfall at the local casinos  and thereby gambling revenues  Also  a cooling Chinese economy  political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded woes No Respite from the Persistent DeclineDespite the Chinese New Year holidays  gross gaming revenues for the month of Feb 2015 plunged 49   thereby marking the ninth consecutive decline and the fifth consecutive double digit decline  Thereafter  gross gaming revenues for the month of March also disappointed investors  We note that owing to the anti corruption drive  Macau s visitation arrivals fell 1 5  year over year for the month of January  which is a negative for the companies operating in the region Per media reports  Morgan stanley has downgraded the Macau casino sector as it expects gross gaming revenues in the region to decline 25  year over year in 2015 compared to the previous expectation of a decline of 7   Last week  analysts from both Deutsche bank and Credit suisse reportedly made bearish comments and provided a weak forecast for the gambling industry  Is There an End to Macau s Woes We believe that the worst is not over yet  with China reportedly expected to launch another major crackdown to restrict illegal money transfers  The crackdown comes at a time when the casino operators are already feeling the heat of China s anti corruption campaign  This is expected to further reduce footfall and hit Macau casino revenues   Read   On the other hand  the Macau government is expected to submit a bill to ban smoking in the VIP rooms after implementing the same for mass gaming floors in Oct 2014  This would compound woes as the smoking ban  if implemented  would further hurt revenues There are a few resort openings in the pipeline by operators such as Wynn Resorts  MGM Resorts and Las Vegas Sands in the near term  We need to wait and see whether these openings are sufficient to revive the fortunes of the region and drive demand as economic growth is largely driven by an increase in aggregate demand ",2015-03-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/no-respite-for-casino-stocks-as-macau-slump-continues-245342,245342
157436,378952,WYNN,China s Stock Market Mania  How High Can Red Chips Fly ,opinion,"Recognized as the world s single biggest attraction for high rollers at the gambling tables  Macau is the only location in the People s Republic of China where betting on the roll of the dice is legal  Macau is just a short ferry ride from Hong Kong  through which many mainlanders travel to get to the casinos  As such  the former Portuguese colony saw its annual casino and entertainment revenues soar to a combined  44 billion in 2014  or 7 times that of the Las Vegas Strip  For Macau  the boom times began in 2010 when casino revenues increased  58  and followed by a  42  gain in 2011 
However  the share prices of the biggest gaming operators in Macau suffered their worst year ever in 2014  as Beijing launched a major crackdown on corruption and money laundering in the colony  Chinese President Xi Jinping s bid to catch the mobsters scared off many of the high rollers the so called VIP segment  that accounts for about two thirds of Macau s casino receipts  Operators such as Macau Legend Development  HK 1680   owners of The Landmark  MGM China Holdings   Galaxy Entertainment  OTC GXYEF    which is building Galaxy I  Galaxy II and Galaxy III casinos on the Cotai strip  and multi national casino operators  Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN  which operates Wynn China  HK 1128  and Las Vegas Sands Corp  NYSE LVS  which operates Sands China Ltd  HK 1928   lost a combined  73 billion of market value last year 
Macau is dependent on big spenders from the mainland  and in the month of December  14  the results of crackdown were starting to show up on the casinos  top line  revenues had fallen to  2 9 billion  posting a stunning  30  year on year decline  It was the seventh consecutive month of decline and the biggest drop since Macau began recording monthly revenues 10 years earlier  Casino operators had plans to expand their operations on the Cotai Strip  and transform it into a mass market of resorts  However  the VIP heyday in Macau appears to be over  Instead  much of the  hot money  that used to flow through Macau began sweeping through Hong Kong and into the Chinese stock markets 
While Beijing was busy cracking down on money laundering in Macau  it was also sanctioning its securities regulators  stock brokerage firms  overseers of the stock exchanges  and hundreds of high tech engineers  to begin working night and day to launch the world s third biggest casino    dubbed  Shanghai   Hong Kong  Stock Connect   It would allow global investors to trade Chinese Shanghai  A shares  for the first time  through brokers located in Hong Kong  and mainland Chinese investors could trade Hong Kong s  H Shares  index via the Shanghai Stock Exchange  subject to quotas both ways  The combined size of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets is roughly  10 5 trillion today  behind only the combined  27 trillion size of New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq 

Since April  14  when the HK Shanghai  Connect  was first announced to the public  there s been an unprecedented level of coordination between multiple parties   including 100 banks and brokers  asset managers  the two exchanges  their clearing and settlement providers  data providers  technology firms and several regulators  The trading link has been hailed as a milestone in the opening up of China s capital markets  allowing foreign investors to trade in and out of Chinese stocks in real time 
The HK Shanghai stock connect has added 855 companies with  1 billion   market cap  to the global investable universe  and has created the world s 3rd largest equity market global by market cap and turnover  only behind the NYSE and the Nasdaq  The southbound link of  Stock Connect  allows Chinese investors to trade 266 stocks of companies listed in the Hang Seng Composite Large Cap and Mid Cap Indexes that includes some  H share  companies  Foreign investors with brokerage accounts in Hong Kong can now trade 568 Shanghai  A shares   through the northbound link 
By chasing the high rollers out of Macau and steering them into the Chinese stock markets  the fortunes of shareholders in Chinese casino and brokerage stocks was turned upside down  The share price of HK  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing  HK Ex  has soared by  63  compared with a year ago to HK 195  share  HK Ex is the sole operator of the stock market and futures market in Hong Kong  and also provide integrated clearing  settlement  and depository services  Its OTC Clear provides interest rate derivatives and non deliverable forwards clearing and settlement services to its members  HK Ex provides market data through its data dissemination entity  and also owns the London Metal Exchange  Stock Connect has boosted the average daily value of trading on the HK Ex by  38  to HK 93 billion  and its Empire has grown to a market value of  30 5 billion today 
On the flip side  the share price of Galaxy Entertainment has lost more than half of its peak value to  20 billion today  Galaxy owns and operates the Star World Hotel and Casino   a luxury 5 star property on the Macau peninsula  and operates four City Club casinos in Macau  On March 23rd  the Macau government forecasted gaming revenue would fall  32  this year  compared with 2014  Worse yet  Macau s Chief executive Fernando Chui  warned of a  New Normal  in which government regulation of the gaming sector would only increase  A full smoking ban in 2016 could weigh on VIP revenues 
Retail Investors Stampede into Shanghai Red chips  According to the Chinese Zodiac  the year 2015 is called the  Year of the Goat   People born in a Year of the Goat are generally believed to be gentle mild mannered  shy  stable  sympathetic  amicable  and brimming with a strong sense of kindheartedness and justice  Although they look gentle on the surface  they are tough on the inside  always insisting on their own opinions  They have strong inner resilience and excellent defensive instincts  Though they prefer to be in groups  they do not want to be the center of attention  They are reserved and quiet  most likely because they like spending much time in their thoughts 
However  the share of good fortune for those born in a  Year of the Goat   is not be very good  Instead  they often get involved in financial difficulties  Therefore  it s advised that they should adopt conservative strategies when dealing with investments  They should try their best to increase their income  decrease their expenditure  and live within their means  They are advised to restrain themselves from gambling too much in order to avoid big losses 

However  the vast majority of traders that are operating in the Chinese markets these days have no such inhibitions about gambling  Instead  they are feverishly bidding up red chip shares on the China 300 Index  which has nearly doubled in value since the start of July  14  Chinese retail investors are flocking to the stock market  and they re using margin loans to amplify  ie  leverage  the size of their investments  Buying on margin accounts for a fifth of daily turnover  Retail participation in Shanghai was always high  Over the last five years  retail investors accounted for 80  of A share market turnover  This ratio hit 90  this year  About 4 million new account were opened in March  bringing the total to 182 million  Two thirds of new investors have never attended or graduated from high school 
Many Chinese companies have dually listed shares in Shanghai  A shares  and in Hong Kong  H shares   Today  the A shares are trading at a premium of  32   on average  above their H share counterparts  and above ETFs on the US exchanges   This indicates that arbitrageurs are not yet able to buy the cheaper shares in Hong Kong and sell those shares into the more expensive Shanghai market  thereby driving the premium to zero  One company s A shares and H shares  while representing the same underlying assets and cash flows  are not yet interchangeable  To track this  the Hang Seng China A H Premium Index measures the price spread between the Top 57 companies domiciled in Mainland China  and with A shares listed in Shanghai and H shares in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index 

The superior performance of A shares over H shares since the launch of Stock Connect on November 17th  can also be seen by the price differential between the shares of China s biggest stock broker  Citic Securities  traded in Shanghai under ticker symbol   SS 600030  and in Hong Kong  traded under symbol  HK 0998   When converting Citic Securities H shares into the yuan  it s easy to see the Shanghai price is nearly 10 yuan  share higher  ie about  50  higher  
Trying to level the playing field  China s Securities Regulatory Commission agreed on March 26th to allow mainland based mutual funds to use  Stock Connect  to invest in the Hong Kong market  The Bullish news spurred risk loving traders to scoop up Hong Kong listed H shares  driving the index to its highest level in four years 
On December 29th  Citic Securities said it would issue of up to 1 5 billion of Hong Kong listed H shares to raise capital and help expand its businesses including margin trading in Shanghai  Haitong Securities  China s second biggest listed broker  has also announced a plan to raise HK 30 billion in a private share placement in Hong Kong  also mainly to expand margin loans  Citic says up to 70  of proceeds will be used for margin loans  On the Shanghai Stock Exchange alone  the amount of margin loans reached 684 billion yuan   110 billion  more than double July s 284 billion yuan 

No Replay of Shanghai Stock Bubble of 2006 07  It seems like d j  vu all over again  with memories of the January 2006 October 2007 Shanghai Bubble  still fresh in many traders  minds  However  one dynamic that is very different this time around  the PBoC is not trying to burst the Shanghai rally in 2015 with a tighter monetary policy  In fact  it s doing just the opposite  it s inflating the 2014 15 bubble with an easier money policy  It s for this basic reason that many Chinese traders believe the recent doubling of the China 300 Index is sustainable over the longer term 
That s because the PBoC is currently fighting deflation  or steadily declining prices at the producer level    4 8  from a year ago   and can afford to inject more liquidity into the markets  The near doubling of the China 300 stock index is also the mirror image of the  50   Crash in Crude Oil  prices that began at the start of July  14  Sharply lower prices for crude oil  petrol  grains  industrial metals  and other commodities are delivering a huge windfall to China s economy    the world s biggest importer of natural resources  and Chinese households are enjoying the benefits of increased purchasing power 
By some estimates  Beijing will save as much as  200 billion this year on imports  even while it steps up purchases of crude oil  copper  soybeans  rubber  and iron ore  much of it piling up at the northeastern Dalian port and other trade gateways  China is saving over  600 million per day on its oil import bill  following the  50  plunge in crude oil prices since last summer  The windfall comes on top of China s steady trade surpluses and  4 2 trillion in foreign currency reserves  that makes it easy for Beijing to spend  25 billion this year building up its reserves of grains  edible oils  and  other materials    a  33  rise over 2014 when stockpile spending rose  22  
The Commerce Ministry confirmed in a recent briefing that Beijing is boosting commodity imports to take advantage of lower global prices  Ramped up purchases of oil are helping China reach its goal of a 90 day supply in its strategic petroleum reserve  Imports of iron ore rose  14  last year over 2013 levels  while prices plummeted  50   for a saving of  30 billion  For copper  China increased its purchases  7  last year  while prices declined  20   Some 400 000 tons of the copper purchased was stashed in its strategic reserve  Unlike other countries  China s hasn t depreciated its currency  so it gets the full benefit from buying less expensive commodities priced in US  s 
Ironically  one reason for the 4 year Bearish trend in the commodities markets has been the notable slowdown in China s economy    from a  10  growth rate  on average  for the past few decades  to less than  7  this year  Officially  Beijing set a  7  growth target for 2015  which would mark the slowest expansion in a quarter of a century  if it came to pass However  on March 15th  China s Premier Li Keqiang admittedit would be a big challenge to meet that target  Yet in today s markets  a sharp slowdown in China s economy  and shrinking company profits  is no reason to sell Chinese equities 

Beijing Shifts to Easier Credit and Liquidity Stance  On March 15th  China s Premier Li Keqiang issued a rare  hot tip  of advice  saying the ruling Politburo can do much more to allay fears about a stumbling economy  Li assured traders that policymakers would prop up the Chinese stock market  especially if economic growth is at risk of breaching a  lower limit    In recent years  we have not taken any strong  short term stimulus policies  so we can say our room for policy maneuver is relatively big  the tools in our toolbox comparatively many  If the slowdown in growth approaches the lower limit of a reasonable range  we will stabilize policies in the market  and at the same time  we will increase the intensity of targeted policy control   Li said  Traders interpreted these remarks to mean that further cuts in interest rates and bank reserve requirements would soon be on their way  
 China needs to be on alert for deflation   PBoC chief Zhou Xiaochuan warned on March 30th  adding the central bank was also on the watch for deflation around the world  and falling commodity prices   China s inflation is declining  We need to be vigilant to see if this trend continues  and if it will lead to deflation   On Feb 28th  the PBoC lowered its 1 year loan rate 25 basis points to 5 35   its second rate cut in just over three months  The PBoC also made a system wide  50 bps cut to bank reserve requirements to 19 5   the first time it has done so in over two years  to unleash a fresh flood of liquidity to fight off economic slowdown and deflation  The reduction of  50 basis points can free up 600 billion yuan   96 billion  or more held in reserve at Chinese banks   which could then mushroom into 2 to 3 trillion yuan of added liquidity floating in the economy due to the multiplying effect of bank loans 
On March 30th  the PBoC took additional measures to boost the local economy  it lowered the amount of money needed for a down payment to buy a house to 40   The PBoC said on its website that all banks  are encouraged to offer commercial support to families to buy their own home with the down payment not lower than 40    All these measures   unleashed by the PBoC   helped to power Chinese stock indexes to a seven year high Real estate stocks included in the Shanghai composite property sub index closed at all time highs  even after Chinese property sales in the first two months of 2015 plunged  16  against January February last year  amid a glut of housing supply  In other words  bad news on the economy is good news for stocks  if its leads to fresh liquidity injections  
Just how high can Chinese Red chip stocks fly  It s not wise to stand in front of a raging Bull in a China shop  But if history is any guide to the future  Shanghai A shares did soar to a  95  premium over H shares at the peak of the Chinese stock market rally in October 2007  before succumbing to the PBoC s tightening of its monetary policy  This time around  Shanghai red chips are  32  above H shares  on average  and have the wind of PBoC easing at its back  so it wouldn t be surprising to see the China 300 index climb above the 5 000 level in the year ahead  up from around 4 125 today ",2015-04-05,Gary Dorsch,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china’s-stock-market-mania;-how-high-can-red-chips-fly-247314,247314

157469,378985,WYNN,Gambling Stock Roundup  MPEL Disappoints  PNK Beats Expectations,opinion,"Last week was all about earnings releases in the gambling industry  Melco Crown Entertainment  NASDAQ MPEL  posted dismal fourth quarter results with earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Meanwhile  after missing the consensus estimates for two consecutive quarters  Pinnacle Entertainment  NYSE PNK  posted better  than expected fourth quarter results  Boyd Gaming  NYSE BYD  broke even  which compared favorably with the consensus mark  Its revenues however fell short of estimates 
 Meanwhile  Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN  was busy working on its balance sheet restructuring   Read last development  Gambling Stock Round UpRecap of the Week s Important Stories  1  Melco Crown  which earns a better part of its revenues from Macau  posted fourth quarter adjusted earnings of 22 cents per American Depositary Share  ADS  that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents by 15 4   Further  earnings declined 49  year over year  The downside reflects lower revenues  In the quarter  net revenue declined 20  year over year to  1 12 billion and also missed the consensus mark of  1 14 billion by 1 5   The sluggish revenues reflect lower group wide rolling chip revenues and mass market table games revenues 
The downside reflects a slowdown in Macau gambling growth as a result of high stake gamblers curtailing spending amid a cooling Chinese economy  The region has struggled owing to the anti graft corruption drive  which has lowered footfall at the casinos   Read more    2  As in the third quarter of 2014  Boyd Gaming posted breakeven results in the fourth quarter of 2014  Results compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents and a loss of 24 cents per share incurred in the year ago quarter  The upside reflects improved year over year revenues  and lower operating and interest expenses  Share price went up in response to the better than expected results  Net revenue of  531 6 million missed the consensus mark by 1 7   However  it was up 1 4  year over year due to an improvement in revenues at all its segments except Downtown Las Vegas  which experienced a slight decline  Total adjusted EBITDA was  136 4 million  up 10 6  year over year  Boyd Gaming expects total adjusted EBITDA in the range of  535 0 million to  560 0 million in 2015  This includes 50  of Borgata s adjusted EBITDA  Since Boyd Gaming s Atlantic City partner MGM Resorts  NYSE MGM  has re acquired its 50  stake in Borgata in Sep 2014  Boyd Gaming will account for only 50  investment in Borgata by applying the equity method for periods subsequent to the date of deconsolidation  3  Pinnacle Entertainment posted better than expected fourth quarter results with adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents by 38   Also  earnings increased 29  year over year on higher revenues  Net revenue of  554 0 million marginally beat the consensus and went up 3 6  year over year  owing to higher gaming  food and beverage and lodging revenues  Revenues at its Midwest and Southwest segment increased on a year over year basis while revenues at the South segment experienced a decline  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27   up 70 basis points year over year  4   Wynn Resorts announced the pricing of a private offering of  1 8 billion with an aggregate principal amount of Wynn Las Vegas 5 5  Senior Notes due 2025  The notes will issued at par  The net proceeds from the offering will be used to purchase any and all of the issuers  outstanding  1 226 6 million aggregate principal amount of 7 75  First Mortgage Notes due 2020 and any and all of the issuers  outstanding  377 01 million aggregate principal amount of 7 875  First Mortgage Notes due 2020  Additionally  the company intends to satisfy and discharge the indentures governing each of the 7 75  Notes and 7 875  Notes and use any remaining net proceeds from the offering to redeem any 7 75  Notes and 7 875  Notes that are not tendered and for general corporate purposes 
Share Price Performance
 Share prices of most of the companies increased over the last five trading sessions with the highest increase of 10  recorded by Wynn Resorts  However  Caesars Entertainment  NASDAQ CZR  and Caesars Acquisition   NASDAQ CACQ  both lost value

157493,379009,WYNN,Market Breaking Down,opinion,The evolution of a market going south is what I want to discuss initially here  For quite some time  most of the economic reports that came our way we re quite positive  This held sway until roughly March  There were some mixed numbers just prior to that  but overall  the reports were more favorable  When we received numbers from the ISM Manufacturing Reports  they were heading north from 50 0 readings  which is the dividing line between growth and contraction  They made their way up to the 54 level over several months  The 54 level is nothing to get excited about  but it was clearly headed in the right direction  which is all the stock market naturally cared about We then started to get into the earnings season  with some deterioration already occurring in those economic reports  We waited to hear from Cisco Systems  Inc   CSCO  as they re involved in just about every facet of technology  CEO Chambers said the future didn t look very bright  which caught the market off guard  He stated that the economy seemed to fall off a cliff in March out of nowhere  Thus  he significantly lowered guidance  which crushed the stock  and started the stock market on its intense decline  CEO after CEO came out shortly  thereafter  and confirmed Mr  Chamber s notion that things had indeed fallen off a cliff quite suddenly  To confirm all of the CEO s  we then saw the economic reports start to weaken quite rapidly  Nothing positive any more as jobless claims began to rise Job creation started to fall faster than expected  The ISM Manufacturing Report showed some weakness  not to mention all of the bad reports from the Empire State Index  the Philadelphia Fed numbers  and the Chicago PMI  All of them show recession type  or near recession type  levels in manufacturing and economic growth  With Friday s terrible Jobs Report  and still further weakening ISM Manufacturing Report  we see the market has said enough is enough  The market simply broke down below key S P 500 support at 1292  No strong rally attempts  Just pretty much a gap down and run day  The market has spoken  Folks need to be listening The bad news for Friday began last night when China reported its critically important economic news on manufacturing  The number was supposed to be well over the contraction level of 50 0  Growth was expected  Things were supposed to be getting better  Then reality hit with a reading of 50 2  Just about in recession  That caught everyone by surprise  thus  this was the first catalyst to kill our stock futures Then more bad news came in from Europe  which is normal these days  Futures plunge part two  Part three  or the icing on the cake  came from our Jobs Report  which showed a much lower level of creation than expected  We opened down one hundred points on the Dow  and it never recovered  You can slap this stock market hard and often  It is very resilient  It has taken some very nasty blow yet three times held that key S P 500 level of 1292 But not this time as we opened right on this number  and held it for the first fifteen minutes  or so  and then it gave way for good for the remainder of the day  Ugly action all day as the buyers never stepped in  As the day ended  the breakdown was official  and needs to be respected  This was a great day for the bears  The bulls want to run and hide for now  The bears have completely taken over  Sure  bounces from oversold will occur  but make no mistake about it  the bears are in complete control The carnage was found everywhere you looked today  There was no hiding as everyone was running for bond shelter  Give me 1   Who cares  Just get me out of the way of this stock market  Folks simply wanted out of everything  transports  financials  technology  home builders  internet  gaming  technology  and so on  Dow stocks didn t get their usual hide out run  Who cares if you give a dividend and have a low P E  You re getting smoked as well Nothing held up in this sickly environment for stocks  Just hit the sell button and we ll talk later on  Volume was very decent as well  Stocks  like Facebook  Inc   FB   continued their carnage with no let up in sight  It was a nowhere to hide market  as stocks that were slaughtered and seemed unable to fall further  fell further as they broke down out of bear flag patterns  the moves down rapid and powerful with volume  Everything from Apple Inc   AAPL  to Priceline com  PCLN  fell hard  Stocks  like Wynn Resorts Ltd   WYNN   continue their nose dive as does just about every single stock related to the commodity and financial sectors The market bled hard while there were no bandages to be found  The negative here is how many stocks are breaking key 200 day exponential moving average support on big volume with large gaps  The gap downs  and volume  will make those numerous gaps just above  very tough to get back through  Things are very negative technically  now  which clearly confirms the bad news fundamentally  The technical damage will need to be reversed soon  if the bulls are to have any chance in the short term The weekly and monthly charts have flashed negative divergences on their last highs across the board  Whether you re looking at the Nasdaq 100  Dow  S P 500  small caps  mid caps  or the Wilshire 5000 Composite Index  WLSH   or whether you re looking at transports or financials  it doesn t matter  they re all the same  If you look at individual stocks  the story is the same there as well  Leaders  such as Caterpillar Inc   CAT   Mastercard Incorporated  MA   and literally thousands of others  have weekly and monthly negative divergences  In time  we know they have to unwind  but they can be delayed quite a ways out However  due to the poor economic news we re now hearing about  and those poor earnings reports we have heard recently  that process has begun now  No way of knowing at this moment in time how bad things will get  That tale will be written over time  For now  we watch 1250  which is the next clear level of support  while 1292 up to 1314 is strong and powerful resistance  If we lose 1250  we have 1200 next up in time  Be careful and keep things very light for now ,2012-06-03,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-breaking-down-125260,125260

157497,379013,WYNN,Best Bet on Macau  Las Vegas Sands Or Wynn Resorts ,opinion,Macau has become the world s number one gambling market  overtaking Las Vegas as a result of a huge development surge over the past 5 years  Once a seedy sideshow to nearby Hong Kong  Macau now draws millions of Mainland Chinese visitors  who can t legally bet at home  Over 3 billion people live within a travel radius around Macau  Macau s growth has drawn the attention of investors  Stocks on Wall Street began looking at Macau s growth over two and a half years ago in our May 28th  2010 post titled   What Happens in Vegas Now Happens In Macau   Major gaming companies have increasingly invested in Asia in recent years  with massive profits in return  Our conclusion in 2010 was that both Las Vegas Sands  LVS  and Wynn Resorts  WYNN  were well poised to begin new  major advances  Since then  both stocks have performed exceptionally well  LVS   95 78  and WYNN   41 83   It s time to revisit Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts and determine how they might perform going forward  Here s our analysis  Las Vegas Sands  Undervalued  STRONG LONG TERM BUY Some analysts consider LVS expensive at a multiple of 26 2 times past earnings  However  we think LVS is undervalued and poised for continued long term growth  in spite of what we believe is excessive bearish pessimism over Asian growth   As mentioned above  LVS appreciated 95 78  since we first mentioned it on May 28  2010   up from  23 12 to  45 97 on October 30th  2012  However  LVS has been on a bumpy ride over the past 12 months during which the stock price depreciated  2 35   Year to date appreciation has been  3 33  and LVS  stock price dropped  17 16  over the past 6 months  Yet  over the past 3 months  it has appreciated  22 46   So  you can see what we mean when we say that LVS  stock price has been all over the place over the past year  Nevertheless  as its new casinos become fully operational  we believe LVS  growth prospects will soar based on the market s tendency to think in terms of  what have you done for me recently   Analysts across the board are becoming more bullish about LVS s prospects with 24 of 28 issuing a  STRONG BUY  or  BUY Recommendation for the stock  See the chart below for more details  We are particularly optimistic about LVS s outlook relative to its competitors  We expect LVS to generate its greatest earnings growth in Macau  However  we re equally optimistic about the company s endeavors in other emerging markets  There are rumors that LVS is in talks with banks to get financing to develop a resort in Spain  So What to Expect  In the short term  bears may bet the LVS down due to concerns over capex  However  in the long run  it should pay off significantly thanks to a growing consumerist population in Asia  If China s Golden Week sales growth of 15  is any indication  the company can perform well even on off days  With about 85  of its business leveraged towards Asian gaming  LVS stands to gain big from the current stimulus programs being implemented in China  Singapore  one of the strongest economies in the world  currently has two major casinos   one that is operated by LVS  We expect the LVS to increase its dividend yield  current  2 20   and issue a share repurchase program to encourage investors to sit through the high capex periods and take a more confident outlook on the future  Wynn Resorts  Expensive  HOLD SELL Wynn Resorts has not delivered as strong a performance as its competitor  Las Vegas Sands  Nevertheless  Wynn has been a solid investment   41 83  since we originally mentioned it on May 28th  2010  Wynn Resorts is an excellent casino operator  but overall they re less attractive than their major competitors  Let s compare WYNN against LVS  Both stocks represent a very comparable in terms of size and revenue exposure to Asian markets  However  Wynn doesn t stack up to LVS across a number of key indicators  For example  Wynn underperforms LVS in growth potential  balance sheet measures  leverage and profitability margins  Wynn only outperforms LVS in terms delivering a better capital return and free cash flow generation  Wynn s free cash flow is one of the company s strongest points  They have dramatically turned things around over the course of the past 5 years  In 2007  Wynn was in the red to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars  It is now proudly  2 1 billion in the positive  Nevertheless  the stock trades at a 7 4  valuation premium to LVS  two trading multiples and has a higher PEG Ratio of 2 03 vs  1 00  Wynn has lowered its growth estimate substantially over the past year  Furthermore  when you value their stock relative to the company s fundamentals they again miss the mark  As a result  10 of the 27 analysts covering the stock have issued a  HOLD  or  SELL  rating for the WYNN  Look at the chart below for more details  Wynn s overvaluation wouldn t be so bad if the company hadn t performed so poorly over the past 18 months  Over the past 5 quarters  Wynn s management has missed expectations four times by an average of 4 9   That s not a good sign for investors  Much like LVS  the stock has had its ups and downs and performed dismally over the past year  in spite of the recent surge over the past three months  Over the past year Wynn s stock has depreciated  10 35   Year to date is it up  4 35   Over the past 6 months it is down  10 82   And  like LVS  it has rallied over the past three months   25 83   Bottom line on Wynn  Due to the lack of a sufficient margin of safety on this investment  we don t recommend investing in Wynn  If you currently hold the stock  our suggestion is that you either hold the stock or take the recent 25 83  surge as an opportunity to cash out  If not  hold onto the stock for now as if there is one bright spot for Wynn   a new 51 acre casino resort on Macau s Cotai Strip is scheduled to open in 2016  The company already operates Wynn Macau and Wynn Encore resorts in Macau  Its Cotai resort should provide much needed growth and a significant boost to its revenue projections  Overall Recommendations Las Vegas Sands  Undervalued  Strong long term BUY   Analysis  Shares might dip in the short term  However  we view LVS as a strong long term play    12 Month Price Target   65  Yield  31   Dividend  2 2    Total Net Yield   33  Wynn Resorts  Expensive  HOLD SELL   Analysis  Sell shares on a strong day or hold with hopes new casino developments will improve growth prospects    12 Month Price Target   115

157498,379014,WYNN,Are Analysts Right  Will Casino ETF Keep Winning ,opinion,It may seem like an odd pick on a day when consumer discretionary  high beta and emerging markets stocks were all taken to the woodshed  but a buying opportunity could be nearing in the Market Vectors Gaming ETF  BJK   First  some disclaimers  Yes  BJK finished with a loss of 1 8 percent Wednesday  And yes  that extends the ETF s losses over the past two weeks to 5 2 percent  Still  the ETF is up more than 13 percent year to date and that may imply investors that eyeballing BJK today are late to the party  Maybe not  BJK offers investors that do not want to stock pick the best option for getting exposure to Macau  the world s largest gambling hub  Las Vegas Sands  LVS  sees Macau becoming a  100 billion market  Nomura raised its 2017 revenue estimate for the only Chinese territory where gambling is legal to  70 billion from  13 billion    In that note  Nomura boosted its price targets on Las Vegas  Wynn Resorts  WYNN  and MGM International  MGM   Those U S  listed stocks combine for 19 percent of BJK s weight  but the Macau stocks of each represent another 12 4 percent of the ETF s weight  Those weights underscore the notion that BJK is an international ETF as the U S  accounts for just 28 2 percent of the fund s weight  In terms of exposure to Asian gambling growth  BJK has it  China  Australia  Malayisa  South Korea and Japan combine for over half the ETF s weight  The international exposure comes with a rub that investors need to be aware of in an environment where the U S  dollar is gaining strength  Currency exposure  As in BJK s currency exposure is more than two thirds non U S  dollar  For example  the Hong Kong and Australian dollars  along with the euro and yen combine for roughly 40 percent of BJK s country weight  Additionally  gambling is perhaps the ultimate display of discretionary spending  meaning BJK and its constituents need sanguine market environments and cooperative economic data to move higher  When that happens  which has for most of the past 12 months  BJK actually becomes a better idea than traditional discretionary ETFs  For example  BJK has outperformed the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  XLY  by 500 basis points over the past year  One last thought about BJK  The ETF has just  61 1 million in assets and although it has been proven dozens of times that an ETF s AUM total is not a valid predictor of returns  some so called experts lead investors to believe that all sub  100 million ETFs are evil and illiquid  In the case of BJK  the ETF rarely trades outside of a half percent premium or discount to its net asset value    indicating this is not an illiquid ETF  More importantly  as BJK s one year performance compared to XLY shows  ignoring small ETFs just because they are small is a costly idea BY The ETF Professor,2013-06-06,Benzinga ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-analysts-right-will-casino-etf-keep-winning-170055,170055

157516,379032,WYNN,Three Reasons Why The World Should Fear A China Slowdown,opinion,So many talking heads in the financial media continue to say that they do not care about the Chinese economy  They continue to pound the table that as long as the U S  market inflates  who cares about what happens to China  Well  every investor should be concerned about a China slowdown  I ll cover the top three the reasons why First  the Chinese economy has led the global stock markets higher since 2008  Traders and investors should know that the Shanghai Index bottomed out in late 2008  meanwhile  the U S  market indexes did not bottom out until March 2009  The Chinese economy leads the U S  and the rest of the global markets since that time The second reason that investors should fear a Chinese slowdown is because many companies are doing a lot of business in that part of the world  Companies such as General Motors Co  NYSE GM   Yum Brands Inc  NYSE YUM   Wynn Resorts Ltd  NASDAQ WYNN   and even the mighty Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  do a lot of business in China  If the Chinese economy really slows down it will hurt all of these corporate profits in the future  Remember  the stock market cares about the future not the present  Investors can easily see how the base metal stocks such as Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   and Rio Tinto plc  NYSE RIO  have traded recently compared to the major stock indexes in the United States  This is due to a weaker Chinese economy The third reason why a Chinese economic slowdown will affect the global stock markets is due to a lack of investment abroad  Just think about it  it was not that long ago that the International Monetary Fund  the European Central Bank  ECB   and the even French leader Nicolas Sarkozy begged China to help with a European bailout  At that time  the leaders of the world acted as if China could bail out the entire Euro zone  Now  these same leaders act as if China no longer matters to the global economy Here is the bottom line  if the Chinese economy significantly slows down it will affect the world  If the Chinese no longer continue to invest abroad the world economy will feel it  What will happen to the United States if the Chinese stop buying U S  Treasuries  Better yet  what will happen to the United States economy if the Chinese actually begin to sell bonds  The U S  will have to pay a much higher debt service as yields rise  All eyes should be on China over the next few months as this could be the bigger problem for the global economy ,2012-03-21,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/three-reasons-why-the-world-should-fear-a-china-slowdown-117677,117677
