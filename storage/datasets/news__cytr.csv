2218,223733,CYTR,CytRx Detailed Results ,opinion,"Detailed results on aldoxorubicin presentedDetailed results of the Phase IIb trial of aldoxorubicin in first line STS patients presented at the annual meeting of ASCO  top line results were reported in several press releases  continue to show the drug s superior efficacy and safety profile over doxorubicin  The 400 patient  FDA SPA sanctioned Phase III trial in second line STS is progressing well with targeted completion of accrual in 2015 and possible top line readout in 2016  a major value inflection point if the data are positive 

Detailed Phase IIb aldoxorubicin resultsInvestigators of the Phase IIb trial of aldoxorubicin in first line soft tissue sarcoma  STS  presented the baseline  safety and efficacy data of the trial at the annual meeting of ASCO held from 31 May to 2 June in Chicago  The additional data on response  in particular the percentage of patients with any tumour shrinkage  not only continue to demonstrate aldoxorubicin s superiority over doxorubicin  but also showed that doxorubicin had resulted in tumour shrinkage by central lab review  Previously the central lab review recorded 0  of response for doxorubicin because these tumour shrinkages failed to meet the partial response cut off  and the result caused some concern among investors as doxorubicin has historically achieved some  albeit modest  response in STS  In our opinion  this new disclosure should have calmed the fear that doxorubicin underperformed  and therefore  aldoxorubicin s superior efficacy was questionable in the Phase IIb trial Events to watch in 2014Results that should affect the stock include preliminary data from the Phase II GBM trial and overall survival  OS  of the Phase IIb first line STS  Positive OS data from the Phase IIb present a high bar because of the trial s relatively small size  We should note that the primary endpoint of the SPA sanctioned Phase III second line STS trial is PFS  not OS Valuation   438m suggests upside potentialWe have updated our risk adjusted NPV of CytRx Corporation  NASDAQ CYTR  to  438m or  8 67 share  previously  466m   with the principal change being our decreased forecast of the cash position at the end of 2014 and 2015  reflecting increased R D cost estimates after Q114 actual results

2220,223735,CYTR,CytRx Put On Partial Clinical Hold Following Death Of Patient ,opinion,"Partial clinical hold a minor setbackAldoxorubicin s randomised clinical trials  RCTs  were placed under a partial clinical hold following the death of a patient with metabolic acidosis who received the drug on a compassionate use basis and did not qualify for any of the RCTs  CytRx  NASDAQ CYTR  believes this was the only case of metabolic acidosis out of  250 patients who received the drug to date  While already enrolled patients can continue receiving the drug  no new patients can be dosed until the hold is lifted  CytRx is amending the protocol to exclude acidosis patients from receiving treatment  and believes its existing trial completion forecasts can be maintained if the hold is resolved promptly 

Acidosis likely de regulated aldoxorubicin targetingAldoxorubicin s mechanism involves the release of doxorubicin when the drug albumin conjugate is exposed to acidic environments  ie tumour sites   but presumably not in healthy tissues  with a more neutral pH   However  the increased body tissue acidity in an acidosis patient could have provoked accelerated doxorubicin release into non cancerous tissues  leading to drug toxicity Amendment proposed to resolve clinical holdCytRx intends to require all patients within the ongoing trials to be tested for acidosis prior to receiving treatment  It believes this revision may resolve the FDA s concerns about acidosis related adverse events  and that the hold could be lifted promptly  However  if the hold persists well into 2015  CytRx may need to revise its guidance of top line data in 2016 for the Phase III soft tissue sarcoma  STS  trial SCLC and GBM Phase IIb trials also affected by holdIn September 2014  CytRx started a Phase IIb aldoxorubicin trial in small cell lung cancer  SCLC   which we estimate could provide a peak sales opportunity of up to  1 2bn  CytRx is also assessing aldoxorubicin in glioblastoma multiforme  which follows encouraging mouse data showing survival improvements vs doxorubicin Valuation   272m equity value provides upsideCytRx had  90 0m in cash and investments on 30 September 2014 and expects to spend  62m over the next 12 months  mostly on aldoxorubicin trials   Its resources should be sufficient to attain top line STS data  We have updated our risk adjusted NPV to  272m   4 78 per share   down from  438m previously  to better reflect STS incidence data and a lower success probability given the partial hold  Our rNPV includes contributions from the STS  GBM and SCLC opportunities for aldoxorubicin  and positive clinical data would lead to an increase in our valuation

2221,223736,CYTR,CytRx  Aloxorubicin Trials Resume As Clinical Hold Lifted ,opinion,"Aldoxorubicin trials resume as clinical hold lifted
The lifting of a partial clinical hold imposed on aldoxorubicin improves clarity on its future development and enables the firm to maintain its existing timeline projections for the ongoing clinical trials  CytRx   NASDAQ CYTR  is confident its funds on hand should be sufficient to reach top line data in mid 2016 from its Phase III study in second line soft tissue sarcoma  STS  

Partial hold lifted  timeline targets maintainedThe FDA has removed the partial clinical hold imposed on aldoxorubicin randomised clinical trials  RCTs  since November 2014  CytRx is amending the RCTs to include blood electrolyte tests before treatment to avoid risks in patients with acidosis  The RCTs  including the Phase III study in STS  should resume recruitment over the next few weeks  CytRx maintained its previous guidance for completion of the STS Phase III study enrolment by year end 2015  with top line data in mid 2016 and possible commercialisation in 2017 Phase IIb STS overall survival  OS  data releasedOS for the aldoxorubicin arm of the Phase IIb  n 123  first line STS trial was 16 0 months vs 14 4 months for the doxorubicin arm  p 0 21   Top line data from late 2013 showed significant benefits in progression free survival  PFS   the primary endpoint  As this trial was not powered to detect improvements in OS  we do not believe the lack of statistically significant OS data would negatively affect the prospects of the ongoing Phase III STS study  particularly given that the primary endpoint of this trial will be PFS  not OS Interim GBM and Kaposi s sarcoma  KS  clinical dataPreliminary Phase II data in glioblastoma multiforme  GBM  n 12  and KS  n 9  showed indications of a treatment effect  CytRx interprets the GBM findings as suggesting that aldoxorubicin can effectively cross the blood brain barrier  The company expects to provide more data from these studies by mid 2015 Valuation   286m equity value provides upsideWe estimate CytRx had  77 7m net cash at end 2014  and the firm estimates its resources should be sufficient to attain top line STS data  With the lifting of the clinical hold  we have raised our success probability estimates for aldoxorubicin from 60  to 67 5  in STS  leading to a new pipeline rNPV of  208 5m  vs  182 0m previously   Including our year end 2014 net cash estimate provides an equity valuation of  286 2m  or  5 05 per share

2238,223753,CYTR,CytRx  Detailed Results On Aldoxorubicin Presented,opinion,"Detailed results on aldoxorubicin presented
Detailed results of the Phase IIb trial of aldoxorubicin in first line STS patients presented at the annual meeting of ASCO  top line results were reported in several press releases  continue to show the drug s superior efficacy and safety profile over doxorubicin  The 400 patient  FDA SPA sanctioned Phase III trial in second line STS is progressing well with targeted completion of accrual in 2015 and possible top line readout in 2016  a major value inflection point if the data are positive 

Detailed Phase IIb aldoxorubicin results
Investigators of the Phase IIb trial of aldoxorubicin in first line soft tissue sarcoma  STS  presented the baseline  safety and efficacy data of the trial at the annual meeting of ASCO held from 31 May to 2 June in Chicago  The additional data on response  in particular the percentage of patients with any tumour shrinkage  not only continue to demonstrate aldoxorubicin s superiority over doxorubicin  but also showed that doxorubicin had resulted in tumour shrinkage by central lab review  Previously the central lab review recorded 0  of response for doxorubicin because these tumour shrinkages failed to meet the partial response cut off  and the result caused some concern among investors as doxorubicin has historically achieved some  albeit modest  response in STS  In our opinion  this new disclosure should have calmed the fear that doxorubicin underperformed  and therefore  aldoxorubicin s superior efficacy was questionable in the Phase IIb trial 
Events to watch in 2014
Results that should affect the stock include preliminary data from the Phase II GBM trial and overall survival  OS  of the Phase IIb first line STS  Positive OS data from the Phase IIb present a high bar because of the trial s relatively small size  We should note that the primary endpoint of the SPA sanctioned Phase III second line STS trial is PFS  not OS

2275,223790,CYTR,5 Biotech Stocks Under  10 Worthy Of Investors  Attention,opinion,The pharma biotech sector has been struggling so far in 2018  The sector is plagued by several factors  which include drug pricing issues  declining sales of legacy products and unfavorable clinical outcomes or regulatory updates  Moreover  competition from branded as generic drugs are also putting pressure on revenues  However  small biotechs developing innovative medicines provide opportunities to make significant gains on investment In the past month  the  has increased 4 4  against the  s decline of 0 7   The upside momentum in the Biomed Genetics industry is expected to continue as approximately 30 new drugs are awaiting approval  with the majority belonging to pharma companies Why are Small Biotechs in Focus Small biotech stocks are good bets with lower market cap as well as share price  These stocks represent significant upside opportunities with lower capital at risk  Moreover  large pharma companies are reeling under drug pricing pressure  But these biotech companies generally develop innovative or rare disease treatments and address new markets  This enables them to charge higher prices  Moreover  the orphan drug exclusivity also keeps competition at bay A favorable clinical study data or regulatory decision on the pipeline candidates of these companies can give a significant boost to shares  However  there s an inherent risk in every investment  which  in this case  is a negative clinical outcome or regulatory decision Meanwhile  in order to battle rising competition and pricing pressure  large cap companies are also trying to bring innovative therapies in the market  This can happen through in house pipeline addition or through acquisition of smaller biotech companies  We have already seen some big ticket mergers   acquisitions so far in 2018 with Takeda buying Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   for  62 billion  The acqusition is expected to be completed in 2019  Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  have also acquired smaller biotech companies to boost their pipeline  The bigger pharma companies are also collaborating with smaller biotechs to use the latter s platform  This creates a steady revenue stream for the smaller biotechs  thus boosting their share price The reduction in tax rates following the major tax overhaul in December and a one time low tax window for cash repatriation has boosted the cash position of large cap companies  This higher in hand cash has spurred M A activity in the sector  even at hefty premiums  Smaller companies are likely to benefit more from increasing M A activity in the sector The FDA has also accelerated its approval process  It approved 22 new drugs in 2016  which more than doubled in 2017 to 46  Moreover  so far this year  15 new drugs have already received approval  Many of these new drugs were developed by small and medium sized biotechs Our ChoicesSmall investors  who are on the

2286,223801,CYTR,Bet On Rising P E Investing With These 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"Generally  investors love stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher will be  the value of the stock  The simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore has room to run  is behind investors  inclination toward low P E stocks 
But stocks with a rising P E can be equally worth buying  We ll tell you why 
Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal   
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  You can see  
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 78 
Here are five out of the 78 stocks 
Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL    This is engaged in designing  marketing and distributing men s  women s and children s apparel  accessories  fragrances and home furnishings  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 14

GMS Inc    NYSE GMS    This is a distributor of wallboard and suspended ceilings systems  It carries a Zacks Rank  2  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 44
