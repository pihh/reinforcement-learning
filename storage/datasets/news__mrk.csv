202467,423983,MRK,The 4 Most Important Things to Know About Merck s Q4 Earnings Results,news,"Merck  NYSE MRK  is off to a rocky start in 2020  The company s blockbuster cancer drug  Keytruda  disappointed in a late stage clinical study targeting small cell lung cancer  Shortly afterward  Chinese biotech BeiGene announced positive results from a late stage study for tislelizumab  potentially setting up a battle between the drug and Keytruda in the big Chinese market 
Today  the year became even rockier  Merck reported its 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before the market opened on Wednesday  The drugmaker s shares fell around 3  in early trading  Here are the four most important things to know about Merck s Q4 update 

1  Solid sales growth    but not enough to satisfy Wall Street
Merck announced fourth quarter revenue of  11 87 billion  up 8  year over year and an increase of 9  on a constant currency basis  But this revenue growth wasn t quite enough to make Wall Street happy  The analysts  consensus Q4 revenue estimate was  11 98 billion 
Keytruda wasn t the problem  Sales for the cancer immunotherapy skyrocketed 45  year over year in Q4 to  3 1 billion  Neuromuscular blockade reversal drug Bridion also performed well  with sales jumping 22  to  313 million 
However  revenue from Merck s HPV vaccine  Gardasil 9  fell 17  from the prior year period to  693 million  This sales figure was negatively impacted by the company s previous borrowing of doses of the vaccine from the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s pediatric vaccine stockpile  In addition  Merck faced continued headwinds from pricing pressure for diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet  as well as sales declines due to the loss of market exclusivity for several drugs  including Remicade  Zetia  and Vytorin 
2  A narrow earnings beat
While Merck fell a little short of meeting analysts  revenue expectations  it narrowly beat Wall Street s consensus Q4 earnings estimate  The company reported adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 16  compared to the average analyst estimate of  1 15 
This result reflected solid 12  year over year growth  Merck s earnings growth of 29  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  was even more impressive   
3  Outlook for 2020
Merck expects full year 2020 sales will be between  48 8 billion and  50 3 billion  The midpoint of this range represents a year over year increase of 5 9   It is also slightly above analysts  full year 2020 revenue estimate of  49 53 billion 
The company expects full year 2020 non GAAP EPS between  5 62 and  5 77  up 9 7  year over year at the midpoint  Analysts projected 2020 adjusted EPS of  5 61 
4  A new spin off
Perhaps the biggest news from Merck s Q4 update was that it s planning to spin off its women s health  trusted legacy brands  and biosimilar products into a new stand alone company  Merck will retain its core oncology  vaccines  hospital  and animal health products businesses 
Why a spin off  Merck said that it  will allow both management teams to drive increased responsiveness to the particular needs of their patients and customers and achieve faster growth through focused and fit for purpose operating models   The most important words in that sentence were  achieve faster growth   Merck s Q4 growth would have looked a lot better without the drag of its older products 
The good news for investors is that Merck will remain an attractive dividend stock  Merck anticipates future dividend hikes and will strive to reach a payout ratio between 47  and 50  down the road  The spin off company is also expected to pay an incremental dividend 
This transaction won t happen immediately  though  Merck said that the spin off would likely be finalized in the first half of 2021  That means the positive and negative factors affecting the company in Q4 will carry over throughout 2020 ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prhm9,2076931
202468,423984,MRK,Merck Announces a Big Planned Spinoff,news,"Merck  NYSE MRK  announced Wednesday its intention to spin off its women s health business   legacy brands  and biosimilars unit into an independent  publicly traded company  and reorient itself toward its higher growth businesses  The slimmed down Merck will focus on oncology  vaccines  hospital products  and animal health 
The transaction is planned as a tax free distribution of newly issued shares in the yet to be named spinoff company  Merck expects to receive a tax free payment of  8 billion to  9 billion from the new company   NewCo   when the deal closes in the first half of 2021 

Merck believes that spinning off the slower growing businesses will allow it to increase investments in its core growth areas and significantly expand its operating margin  management is targeting a non GAAP operating margin of more than 40  by 2024  compared with the current level in the mid 30  range   NewCo will have strong cash flows and growth opportunities in biosimilars  contraceptives  and fertility  as well as through the development of sales in foreign markets 
The pharmaceutical giant plans to maintain its current dividend of  2 44 per share after the spinoff  and expects that NewCo will pay a meaningful dividend that will be incremental to Merck s payout 
Investors may be concerned that this move makes Merck even more dependent on growth from its mega blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda  Wall Street gave the announcement  which arrived along with the release of a mixed fourth quarter earnings report  a cool reception  Shares were trading about 3  lower as of 1 30 p m  EST ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prjli,2077072

We have also posted a presentation to the Investors section of merck com  which includes some of the highlights from our results and announcement With that  I d like to turn the call over to Ken Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Peter  We are very pleased to speak with you this morning as we close out what we consider to be an exceptional year for Merck  And we are excited to announce our intention to create two leading growth companies through the spin off of our Women s Health  Legacy Brands and Biosimilar Products into a new company As you can see from our results and our 2020 guidance  Merck had an extraordinary year and is in a position of operational and financial strength driven by strong execution of our strategy and focus on our key growth drivers and innovative pipeline  It is this position of strength born of that focus that gives us the confidence to do what we believe will best position us to deliver even greater value to patients and shareholders Throughout my entire tenure as CEO we have consistently focused on science as core to our strategy to not only benefit the most patients  but also as a means of creating the most value  As you ve seen  Merck s portfolio have evolved from one focused largely on primary care products to one focused on Oncology  Vaccines  Hospital and Animal Health  It is this purposeful shift  coupled with greater prioritization and focus on key growth drivers that has led to the unprecedented growth that we are now experiencing  Going forward  we see even greater opportunities to invest behind our innovative growth drivers  In placing greater focus and prioritization behind these products  we must also think carefully about how to make the best possible use of the remainder of our expansive Human Health portfolio  which has comprised of more than 160 products in total Our responsibility to patients and shareholders has led us to think about how we can maximize the impact of this vast array of Human Health products  Therefore  after careful consideration over time  we ve made the decision to separate into two companies  one  a research intensive biopharmaceutical leader  the other  a new company focused on becoming a leader in Women s Health with the capability to realize the full potential of a portfolio of trusted and medically important legacy products and a rapidly expanding biosimilars business By spinning off NewCo as a distinct business  we can better prioritize and support a set of products that no longer fit in Merck s strategic framework  but which remains important to public health and the patients who rely on them  and which if managed and resourced appropriately  present real opportunities for growth  We re also mindful of the changing industry landscape and believe that evolving our operating model in this way will allow Merck to benefit from an even more intense focus on breakthrough science and innovation As I stated on our Investor Day in June  our mission and rich legacy of inventing to save and improve the lives is the foundation of our company  The separation of NewCo will help us in our aspiration to be the premier research intensive biopharmaceutical company by allowing us to focus on innovations that prevent and treat diseases  And over the past few years  we have seen how more focus and more prioritization leads to more growth  more efficiency and more value creation The spin off will also create significant opportunities for NewCo  As an independent company  NewCo will pursue its strategic intent of becoming a global leader in Women s Health  an area where the future opportunities are significant  In addition to the growth potential in Women s Health  NewCo s growth will be fueled by more fully realizing the full potential of a portfolio of trusted Legacy Brands and pain  dermatology  cardiovascular and other areas  as well as its rapidly expanding biosimilars business  This new company will have a strategic freedom to pursue additional growth opportunities through lifecycle management and targeted acquisitions and partnerships in Women s Health  dermatology and other fields NewCo will be led by a highly experienced leadership team including Kevin Ali  who has been named Chief Executive Officer  Kevin has a proven track record of leadership at Merck with deep experience in global pharmaceutical market and diverse therapeutic areas  In addition  NewCo s Board will be shared by Carrie Cox  who has extensive experience in pharmaceutical commercialization  particularly in Women s Health  as well as broad leadership and Board experience including as former Chairman and CEO of Humacyte  former Chairman of Array BioPharma and as President of Global Pharmaceuticals at Schering Plough prior to its merger with Merck  We are confident that the NewCo will be in experienced and capable hands with this leadership team Our industry faces emerging challenges such as the rising cost of innovation and increasing pressures around pricing and market access  In this environment  we must maximize our opportunities to act with greater operational agility  efficiency and productivity  As separate  more focused companies with more optimal resource allocation  both Merck and NewCo will be better positioned to continue to positively impact the lives of patients  improve global public health and achieve faster growth  As a result  we expect Merck shareholders to benefit through ownership of two focused companies each with attractive financial characteristics and growth profile In summary  we are seeing the benefit of focusing our organization on its best growth opportunities  As we look out to 2024  we believe the strength of our business is under appreciated  We are more confident than consensus on every key financial metric  including revenue  operating margins and EPS growth  Our commitment to maintaining and growing the Merck dividend is evidence of the confidence we have in the long term prospects for our business Our fundamental operating and financial strength allow us to take bold step to stay ahead of the curve by reshaping our operating structure  focusing and streamlining Merck  enabling Merck to become an even stronger  more agile and faster growing company  I strongly believe that this is the right thing for patients  for public health and for shareholders With that  I ll now pass it on to Rob to discuss our results and provide more details on the spin off  Rob Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ken  and good morning  everyone  I m excited to speak to you this morning about our 2019 results  as well as our decision to spin off a portion of our Human Health business  a decision that will enhance the value of both Merck and NewCo  2019 was a year of exceptional growth for our business with revenues increasing 13  and non GAAP EPS increasing 21  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  Our strong performance reflects the continued execution of our science led strategy and we expect our business momentum to continue  particularly as we enhance our focus on our key growth drivers through the spin off I ll start by highlighting our strong fourth quarter results before providing more details on the transaction and 2020 guidance  Total company revenues were  11 9 billion in the quarter  an increase of 8  year over year or 9  excluding the negative impact from foreign currency  Both our Human Health and Animal Health divisions contributed to the growth this quarter The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an ex exchange basis  Our Human Health revenues grew 8   led by products in oncology and hospitals  In Oncology  KEYTRUDA fourth quarter sales were  3 1 billion and for the full year sales exceeded  11 billion  representing 58  growth versus 2018  In the US  growth was driven by strong demand across all indications  KEYTRUDA continues to lead across many indications  including lung  bladder  and head and neck cancers with strong momentum in adjuvant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma  where we are seeing strong uptake across all patient subgroups  Outside the US  KEYTRUDA sales in the quarter grew 50  driven by lung globally with reimbursement for KEYNOTE 189 now secured across all major markets in the EU and strong uptake in lung following approvals in Japan and China We are also seeing positive uptake from early launches in both renal cell carcinoma and adjuvant melanoma in the EU and expect to see strong global growth as these and other new indications continue to rollout  Our results also reflect continued strength for both Lynparza and Lenvima  important products from our collaborations with AstraZeneca and Eisai respectively  Lynparza continues to have strong growth in ovarian cancer and maintains a greater than 60  total patient share in the PARP inhibitor class in the United States Growth of Lenvima benefited from the launch of the endometrial carcinoma indication in combination with KEYTRUDA  and continued strong demand with first line hepatocellular carcinoma where Lenvima is now the leading treatment agent  Our vaccines business declined this quarter due to the impact from the replenishment of GARDASIL to the CDC stockpile in 2018  and our borrowing from the stockpile in the fourth quarter of 2019  which notably impacted the year over year comparison of GARDASIL revenues by  245 million on a combined basis  Excluding these impacts  GARDASIL revenues grew 16  driven by continued strong underlying global demand Our Hospital business benefited from 24  growth in BRIDION  which reached  1 billion in annual sales for the first time  this quarter  Growth was largely driven by an increased share in the US reversal market  For the full year  we achieved strong growth of 14  in our Human Health business driven by our growth pillars across most geographies  Animal Health revenues increased 10  this quarter to  1 1 billion  Growth for the quarter was driven largely by the products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition Now  turning to the rest of our P L  my comments will be on a non GAAP basis  Gross margin was 72 6  in the quarter  a decrease of 240 basis points year over year  primarily reflecting the impact of unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher inventory write offs  Operating expenses of  5 2 billion increased 10  year over year  Administrative and promotional expenses drove higher SG A costs in the quarter  while clinical development spend and cost associated with our discovery efforts were responsible for the increase in R D expense Other income and expense was positively impacted by income from our equity securities portfolio  partially offset by higher net interest expense  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16 9   driven by lower and favorable earnings mix  Taken together  we earned  1 16 per share  an increase of 12  excluding exchange Now  turning to our announced spin off  As Ken noted  by further evolving our operating model and separating into two simpler  more focused and agile companies  both will be better positioned to respond to the changing external landscape  improved efficiency and accelerate growth  creating greater value for patients and shareholders than would be achieved as a single company Spinning off NewCo accelerates Merck s revenue growth by up to 1 percentage point on a compounded average basis through 2024  But more importantly  it allows Merck to enhance focus on its key growth drivers and robust pipeline  This gives us confidence that Merck will realize even greater incremental revenue growth over time  We will also benefit from more streamlined processes and operations  enabling further operating model efficiencies across the value chain For context  the products to be spun off into NewCo represent about 15  of Merck s Human Health revenues based on 2020 forecast  while consuming a much larger share of our operations and resources  In fact  separating NewCo will reduce Merck s Human Health manufacturing footprint by about 25   the number of products by 50  and the number of SKUs by 60  As a result of a more optimized operating model  Merck will achieve even higher operating margins over time  creating additional headroom to invest in innovation  which we continue to believe is the key to our long term growth and value creation as Ken has referenced  Merck will continue to benefit from broad commercial scale driven by its key growth pillars in Oncology  Vaccine  Hospital and Animal Health  as well as our diabetes franchise Merck will continue to have a strong balance sheet with significant cash flows and financial flexibility  which will allow for investments in innovation and meaningful business developments to augment its pipeline and portfolio  while continuing to return capital to shareholders  We expect to complete the transaction in the first half of 2021  Until then  we will remain focused on continuing to successfully execute our strategy and maintaining our strong financial and operational performance Now  let s move to our outlook for 2020  the year in which we continue to operate as a combined entity  My remaining comments will be on a non GAAP basis  We expect full year 2020 revenue to be between  48 8 billion and  50 3 billion  which represents 4  to 7  growth versus 2019  This range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of less than 1 percentage point  using mid January rates Our gross margin will be roughly 75 5   We expect operating expenses to increase by a low single digit rate year over year  due to higher R D spending as we remain committed to fully funding the meaningful opportunities in our pipeline  SG A expenses will remain tightly managed  We expect other expense of roughly  200 million  driven by higher net interest expense  We expect our tax rate to be roughly 17 5  to 18 5  for the year  We project average diluted shares to be 2 54 billion for 2020 and we expect EPS to be between  5 62 and  5 77  which represents growth of 8  to 11   including a roughly 1 5 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange  using mid January rates Longer term  Merck continues to expect strong revenue growth driven by growing demand for our innovative products  When looking out to 2024  we believe our revenue growth potential is under appreciated  even more so as we begin to realize the benefits of this transaction  We continue to expect meaningful operating margin expansion over time  The separation of NewCo enables  1 5 billion in pre tax operating efficiencies  ratable over three years  While initially Merck s operating margins will decline slightly  we expect to achieve operating margins of greater than 40  in 2024  higher than Merck would have achieved as a combined company  The transaction is expected to result in  8 billion to  9 billion of proceeds from a special tax free dividend from NewCo  Merck s capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and we expect to maintain a very solid financial and credit profile First and foremost  we will fund our best growth opportunities through investments in R D  product launches and capacity expansion  and we believe the spin off allows us to better focus on these activities  Merck s dividend will be unaffected by this transaction and we anticipate future dividend increases from the current 2020 dividend of  2 44 per share post separation with a goal of achieving a 47  to 50  payout ratio over time  We will continue to have ample capacity for value enhancing business development and finally  we will continue to repurchase shares as a way to return excess cash to shareholders Turning now to NewCo s financial profile  The products represented by the new company portfolio are expected to achieve 2020 revenue of approximately  6 5 billion with an operating margin of approximately 45  as part of the Merck  As an independent company  NewCo is expected to achieve low single digit revenue growth off of a 2021 base of  6 billion to  6 5 billion  Taking into consideration  the cost to operate as an independent company operating margins from NewCo are expected to be in the mid 30  range and increase over time  And finally  we anticipate EBITDA margins to be in the low to mid 40  range in 2021 and also increase over time NewCo will have strong cash flows and a balance sheet position to invest in growth opportunities and expects to pay a meaningful dividend  which will be at least as competitive as any likely pure company and entirely incremental to Merck s dividend  In total  we expect combined EPS of NewCo and Merck together to initially be nominally lower than what Merck would have achieved without the spin off  but as a result of the incremental growth that NewCo will achieve stand alone  combined with the benefit of the operating efficiencies that Merck will realize  we expect that shareholders owning both companies will realize higher EPS within 12 months to 24 months In summary  we are confident that through the spin off both companies will have strong prospects for future success and sustainable profitable growth  given the clear benefits each will realize as independently operated entities including  enhanced strategic and operational focus on our key drivers to accelerate growth  improved agility to anticipate and respond to customer needs and evolving market dynamics  simplified operating models with reduced complexity and improved efficiencies  optimized capital structures and resource allocation to pursue their distinct strategic agendas  and improved financial profiles making for unique and compelling investment cases  We are excited by this opportunity to create two patient focused growth companies and look forward to continuing to deliver significant long term value to our patients and shareholders With that  I d like to turn the call over to Roger Roger M  Perlmutter    President of Merck Research LabsThanks  Rob  Looking back on 2019 and in particular on our fourth quarter results  there is much to celebrate  In December  our KEYNOTE 057 data were reviewed at an FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting  which was followed three weeks later by FDA approval of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with high risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer  This represents the 23rd FDA approved indication for KEYTRUDA  broadening still further the benefit that can be expected from the use of KEYTRUDA in the urologic setting KEYTRUDA also gained three new approvals in Japan during the fourth quarter as combination therapy and the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  based on the KEYNOTE 426 study  and for the first line treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck either as monotherapy or when combined with chemotherapy based on results of the KEYNOTE 048 trial  The KEYNOTE 048 data also permitted approval of KEYTRUDA in Europe with a similar indication  Finally  we gained approval of KEYTRUDA in China for the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lung  in combination with chemotherapy based on data obtained in the KEYNOTE 407 study Substantial progress was also made in the registration of Lynparza  our leading PARP inhibitor that we are developing in collaboration with colleagues at AstraZeneca  At the December FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee  a majority of committee members supported the use of Lynparza as first line maintenance therapy for patients with germline BRCA mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer  whose disease had not progressed on at least 16 weeks of first line platinum based chemotherapy  All based on data from the Phase 3 POLO trial  which demonstrated a 47  reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the Lynparza treatment arm  FDA granted approval for Lynparza in this setting at the end of 2019 I should also note that data from our PAOLA 1 trial of Lynparza were accepted by the FDA for priority review with a PDUFA date in the second quarter of this year  And PAOLA 1 maintenance Lynparza plus bevacizumab treatment of women with advanced ovarian cancer that have responded to first line platinum based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 41   Additional file supporting the use of Lynparza in the treatment of men with mutation selected metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancers based on the results of the Phase 3 profound study was also accepted by the FDA for priority review with the PDUFA date in the second quarter of 2020 While we are clearly very active and advancing new cancer treatments during the fourth quarter  we also made important progress in other areas  For example  in the management of highly resistant bacterial infections  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion for RECARBRIO  our novel combination of imipenem  cilastatin  and relebactam for the treatment of infections due to aerobic gram negative bacteria with demonstrated resistance to other agent  RECARBRIO is also under priority review by the FDA and the treatment of adult patients with hospital acquired or ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms with a PDUFA date of June 4th Important progress was also made in cardiovascular medicine with the completion of the Phase 2 VICTORIA study  in which vericiguat and novel guanylate cyclase activator being developed in collaboration with colleagues at Bayer  was found to reduce the composite risk of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality  as compared with placebo in patients with worsening heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction  who were receiving standard heart failure therapies Time does not permit me to list the many other regulatory and clinical milestones that we achieved in the fourth quarter  However  I cannot fail to note that ERVEBO  the first effective vaccine against an ebolavirus  was approved by the FDA and received conditional approval from the EMA for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus  We have now provided more than 275 000 doses of this vaccine by experimental and use protocols to support the efforts of the World Health Organization and other agencies attempting to halt the spread of ebolavirus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Approvals have also been obtained at certain African nations  including Burundi  Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo itself  which should greatly improve the process whereby individuals at high risk can be immunized  It has taken many years to reach this important moment  My colleagues and I feel privileged  who have contributed in this way to the control of an otherwise fatal diseases caused by the Zaire ebolavirus Lastly  I wish to comment on the spin off of the new company that we have announced this morning  I begin with a deep belief in the power of simplification to enhance productivity  My colleagues and I have important objectives over the next few years that will  we hope  improve treatment for malignant disease and heart failure and provide vaccines that reduce suffering from infectious diseases  Simplification of our corporate structure can only sharpen our focus on these critically important programs  I have confidence that we can achieve this increased focus internally  while providing the near term support necessary to implement NewCo to establish itself as a highly effective separate entity I ll now turn the call back to Ken Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Roger  And before turning the call over to Kevin  I d like to take a few minutes to share with you some details on his background  Kevin brings a wealth of knowledge to NewCo based on three decades of pharmaceutical and commercial experience at Merck  His experience ranges from leading different regions  including our entire International Human Health business and the emerging markets region to leading markets such as Germany and Turkey Most recently  Kevin has been instrumental in evaluating Merck s options to optimize the entire Human Health portfolio and in envisioning what success looks like for NewCo  while providing invaluable counsel to me and the rest of the senior management team  I m confident that under Kevin s leadership NewCo will reach its full potential and drive greater value for patients  shareholders and employees And with that  I d like to turn the call over to Kevin Kevin Ali    Chief Executive Officer of NewCoThanks  Ken  and good morning  I m excited to share with you today the creation of our new company  which we believe has a remarkable opportunity to unleash the potential of a leading portfolio of assets in Women s Health  a rapidly growing biosimilars business and a portfolio of trusted and medically important Legacy Brands NewCo revenue was expected to be flat to declining through 2024 within Merck  due to limited investment and focus  However  we believe that by allocating the appropriate resources and by focusing management attention  NewCo will achieve sustainable growth and create value outside of Merck  Although revenues are expected to decline in 2021 versus 2020 to a base of approximately  6 billion to  6 5 billion  largely due to the loss of exclusivities of ZETIA in Japan  and NUVARING in the US  the new company will be well positioned to achieve low single digit revenue growth off of that base  As no new LOEs loom and we have identified lifecycle management and commercial investment opportunities  some are already under way NewCo will have a strong global scale and geographic diversification  And as a stand alone entity  we ll be better positioned to capitalize on attractive opportunities across it s portfolio  NewCo will pursue global leadership and sustainable growth in Women s Health through its growing contraceptive and fertility business  including NEXPLANON  which grew 14  in 2019 and is the leading implantable long acting reversible contraceptive worldwide with US patent protection through 2027 In fact  we expect NEXPLANON to be our first  1 billion Women s Health product  The growing  40 billion Women s Health market is highly fragmented with over 400 products in development industrywide  NewCo will be well positioned to capitalize on this attractive market opportunity to become an industry leader through investments in both organic growth and business development opportunities and to deliver better and more innovative and holistic care to women  NewCo growth will also be driven by biosimilars business in the early stages of a long term growth opportunity with three products currently on the market through its partnership with Samsung Bioepis Revenues of the three currently marketed products are expanding rapidly and are    and were approximately  250 million in 2019  NewCo is well positioned to benefit from increased biosimilar demand as markets around the world continue to seek healthcare cost savings through greater biosimilar adoption in a growing market The Women s Health and Biosimilar businesses will represent a larger proportion of NewCo s revenues over time  and are expected to account for more than 50  of sales by 2024  NewCo will also have the opportunity to realize the full potential of its portfolio of globally trusted Legacy Brands to increase focus and targeted investment  Importantly  the infrastructure and cash generation within this broad portfolio provides a scale  geographic reach and capital to support the growth opportunities that the Women s Health and Biosimilar business is present  In addition to its strong product portfolio  NewCo s global scale and geographic reach will serve as an important competitive advantage  The company will have the capability to potentially commercialize and distribute for other innovative industry players Finally  NewCo will be a highly profitable with stable and strong cash flows  As a stand alone company  it will be able to make the capital allocation decisions that best suit its long term interests  including organic and inorganic growth opportunities  paying a meaningful dividend  debt pay down or returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases In summary  I m very excited about the future of NewCo and the opportunity to work with Carrie Cox  This company will have a distinct opportunity to address the health needs of women around the world and to build off of important growth pillars such as NEXPLANON  pain and dermatology and biosimilars  As a focused company with dedicated resources  a strong global footprint  and talented and experienced employees  who embody the shared values of the Merck culture  NewCo will be better positioned to create value for patients and shareholders With that  I d like to turn the call back over to Peter Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Kevin  We recognize today s upfront comments ran longer than normal  So we re prepared to extend the call beyond 9 00 AM  if necessary  So  Carlo  will you please line up the queue for Q A Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  sir  Ladies and gentlemen  we ll now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan  Please go ahead Chris Schott    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat  Thanks very much for the questions  Obviously a lot of news there today  I just had two really both related to the spin  I guess first on this  you mentioned you ve been considering deal like this or some structure for these assets for quite some time  I guess  why now on the timing  is there something that s either happened with the business or the pipeline that made this    make particular sense now versus  I guess  when you ve looked at this in the past And my second question is    I just want to make sure I m understanding the  1 5 billion in operating synergies correctly  Should we think about that as a net reduction in opex relative to what the combined company would have spent  Or is that savings that goes to RemainCo and should be balanced against some of the stand up costs that you re referring to with the NewCo  Thanks very much Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So  this is Ken Frazier  Let me start with the why now  Reason why we re doing this now is that our fundamental and financial strength  which has been driven by the focus on our best opportunities for growth allows us now to do what strategically correct for the company in the long term  This is about taking actions today that will serve the long term growth and viability of Merck  as well as allowing products that no longer fit into our strategic framework to prosper in a new organizational structure So from our standpoint  this is the right time  A few years ago when we were looking at this  we saw the opportunity  but for example  the cash flow generation of our Legacy Products was being employed at that time and standing up our oncology business from which we grew from the ground up  and as you know  has been extremely successful  That success has been due to our ability to allocate capital to a business that we didn t have before and getting the entire organization focused and aligned around an opportunity that we had around KEYTRUDA and other compounds behind KEYTRUDA  So that is why we can do it now  And I said before  we are confident about our long term growth prospect  and one of the ways in which we try to manifest that is by saying we will maintain and grow the dividend on the Merck side irrespective of losing these brands Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsOkay  Rob on the efficiencies Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Chris  On your question  so the way you should think about the  1 5 billion of operating efficiencies  our incremental cost savings in Merck after the spin off is completed  The stand up cost that are required to support the new company are really contemplated if you take the fact that we commented that there s 45  operating margin for the new company within Merck and it goes to 35  roughly mid 30s after the stand up that 10 percentage point delta is really the stand up cost  So those are not    those are separate independent from the  1 5 billion of net benefits    net synergies that will be joined by Merck going forward in its operating results Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question please  Carlo OperatorNext question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research  Go ahead please Tim Anderson    Wolfe Research    AnalystThank you  A couple of questions on spin and then a science question  On the new company to be spun out  will that be doing real R D and have its own R D engine  When you talk about sustainable growth  I m just wondering  if probably that s going to come from genuine R D  And then on RemainCo  updated views on Animal Health  should we assume that this new split means that the remaining parent Merck company is even more likely than ever to keep the Animal Health in perpetuity And then last question is on the adjuvant IO opportunity  Roger  in my past discussions with you  you ve been highly confident the PD 1s will work in the adjuvant setting  recently we saw Roche field and bladder  there has been some timeline slippage  we haven t seen any adjuvant trial timelines pulled forward  no trial stopped at an interim unlike we have with metastatic disease in the PD 1  So my question to you is  are you still highly confident that PD 1s are going to work broadly across tumor types and adjuvant Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Tim  Kevin  on the research and development capabilities of NewCo Kevin Ali    Chief Executive Officer of NewCoThanks and good morning  Tim  Yes  NewCo will have a high quality development capability and it s really well positioned to the partner of choice for other biopharmaceutical innovators  who are looking to realize commercial growth through our global scale and presence in selected international market to increase patient access  Over time  NewCo will build a research capability in selected therapeutic areas  starting with Women s Health as a core pillar of its business development strategy and then will move further from there Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerTim  on to your question about Animal Health  I ll start by saying  we never say what s going to happen in perpetuity  because we regularly review our entire portfolio and make decisions about which parts of that portfolio belong in our portfolio and which ones would be better off  As we look at Animal Health  we believe  if you look at its growth  if you look at its profitability  we continue to believe that we are in effect advantage owners of that business going forward  We also believe that  that is an important key growth pillar that actually helps us in the long run  As you know  there are ups and downs in the pharmaceutical business and having a business like vaccines  having a business like Animal Health gives us the long term stability that actually allows us to confidently pursue our R D mission Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsRight  And Roger  on vaccines Roger M  Perlmutter    President of Merck Research LabsTim  on the question of immuno oncology in the adjuvant setting  I can t speak generally about PD L1  PD 1 antagonist  when you talk about KEYTRUDA  First of all  of course KEYTRUDA is already effective in the adjuvant setting  as we shown in melanoma  And we also showed the effects in the neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer in the I SPY 2 study and as well in the 522 study most recently  and that is a combined neoadjuvant    adjuvant study and we ll be seeing the adjuvant data in not too long time  And you shouldn t really expect adjuvant data to be pulled forward  because by definition  patients who are receiving adjuvant therapy or patients who have better overall survival over a longer period of time  So unexpected to see those adjuvant results rollout with a    more defined cadence and I think that s exactly what we ll see and I m    I based on our success in two prior settings  I would think KEYTRUDA should be as successful in these settings as well  In general  it works better when used earlier Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Next question please  Carlo OperatorNext question is from Steve Scala of Cowen  Go ahead please Steve Scala    Cowen and Company    AnalystThank you very much  One of the concerns investors have with Merck is the view that its outlook is heavily dependent on KEYTRUDA  And formation of NewCo would seem to increase this risk and concern  So Merck appears to not agree that this is a concern  and I m wondering if you can elaborate on why And then second  what was the rationale for leaving JANUVIA within Merck as opposed to NewCo  It seems placing JANUVIA within NewCo would have made Merck s outlook appreciably clear going forward  Thank you very much Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  let me start on the JANUVIA question  We continue to believe that our diabetes franchise is going to be an important contributor to Merck now and into the future  We are also continuing to do significant research in the whole cardio metabolic area  So that s an area of focus for us going forward  In terms of the issue around KEYTRUDA concentration risks  we are mindful of that  we think KEYTRUDA revenues as a proportion of total revenues only increased by small amount  because of this I think the most important thing that I would say about KEYTRUDA is that right now we continue to see the benefits of our focus both in terms of R D and commercial execution going forward  we see it as driving more growth going forward for the company  but we also see the benefits of our other opportunities in oncology  we have more than KEYTRUDA  we have Lenvima and Lynparza  we also have 20 molecules behind that  We also have our vaccines business  our hospital and specialty business  So we are looking to optimize our entire portfolio and augment our pipeline through business development  that s how we see our future growth  not so much these brands  which as Kevin said  left to their own would probably decline more steeply than they are in the NewCo Steve Scala    Cowen and Company    AnalystGreat Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsRob  anything to add Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Steve  just to kind of build on your point about why JANUVIA in Merck as opposed to NewCo  as we looked at it  clearly  we continue to benefit from the fundamental cash flow and strength of that business gives  while it s not a growing business facility generating a lot of cash flow  But in the near term as we approach LOE we ll continue to be important for Merck  This is an important brand for us And frankly  if you look at the NewCo company  while the loss of exclusivity to Merck frankly does not affect our ability to deliver growth as we ve already commented  even through the loss of exclusivity in 2023 2024  we grow each and every year through that period  So we re able to absorb the loss of exclusivity benefit from the cash now that type of the cliff would be insurmountable to the new company And then finally  and Roger can comment on it in more detail  but we continue to do some pretty interesting science in the cardio metabolic area and feel exciting opportunities over there  And so  continue to see from a scientific perspective a fit as well for all those reasons  we felt keeping it within Merck made more sense than moving that over to the NewCo Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Thanks  Next question please  Carlo OperatorNext question is from Andrew Baum of Citi  Go ahead please Andrew Baum    Citi    AnalystThank you  Couple of questions please  Firstly  you initiated your islatravir oral combination trials  Is there any possibility within that and being able to differentiate your combination versus Victoza  Phonetic  on the back of lesser weight gain given the absence of an integrase inhibitor  and while you re waiting for the long acting trials to complete  does that provide any kind of commercial advantage And the second question relates to TIGIT  one of your competitors  Roche  had indicated they re opening a Phase 3 program  They ve already run a head to head data in combination with that PD L1 and non small cell lung  I know that you have a program ongoing and have had for some time  Could you talk to your relative levels of excitement with the molecule and perhaps give us some timelines and when it may be able to enter registration trials  Thank you Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsRoger Roger M  Perlmutter    President of Merck Research LabsGreat  Thank you  Andrew  First of all  with respect to the islatravir combination  the reality is we really have to wait for the data  I think that we are very confident in the behavior of islatravir  which we ve demonstrated through our reasonably large Phase 2 studies and also  And also  we do work that we ve done with impactable person  It s a terrific molecule  it behaves extremely well  How it will behave with this in combination study or we have pretty good evidence that indicates to us that it will be a leading combination and especially valuable in treatment  We also know islatravir either by itself or potential in combination is a good preventive regimen  But we need to see the data from all of those and that s what we ll be getting And with regard to what I call TIGIT    what we call TIGIT  We do have a program and we have been working on this for some time  We have studies going on where we had tried to ask the question of whether this molecule in combination with KEYTRUDA behaves better than KEYTRUDA alone and is there any circumstance under which it can be used  We recognize that KEYTRUDA is a very impressive compound in the whole variety of different settings that we have to find the right place in which to use it  So we re enthusiastic about it and we re moving forward Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Roger  Next question please  Carlo OperatorOur next question is from Louise Chen of Cantor  Go ahead please Louise Chen    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHi  Thanks for taking my questions  So my first question to you is that you noted in the call that you are more confident than consensus on every metric through 2024  I was wondering  if you can elaborate more on what you think the street is missing here And then second question is just on KEYTRUDA in Japan  Curious  what kind of impact you assume for price cuts this year for KEYTRUDA in Japan  And is there another potential price cut coming  Thank you Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsRob Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Louise  this is Rob  Thanks for the question  Really  if you look at the comments that Ken made  he said we feel confident that the street under appreciates our revenue  our operating margin and our EPS growth as we look forward through time  And if you look at it in the components  clearly on revenue  we continue to believe all of our growth pillars have meaningful growth opportunity  and in most cases  continue to be under appreciated across oncology platform within the vaccines platform given GARDASIL and Animal Health  just to name a few So that story  which we ve been talking to you about over the last several quarters continues  And then  as you look beyond that  clearly with the spin off getting up to 1 percentage point improvement in our growth rate as a result of the spin itself that s even further growth it s not appreciated  not to mention the fact that we think through core focus and really directed efforts by our leadership team  we can drive even faster growth  So that is an important part as well  And then  as you look at operating margin  today we ve indicated that by 2024 or in 2024  we expect operating margins now as a result of what the spend enables  which enabling  1 5 billion of incremental cost efficiency on top of the already improving natural mix we ve been benefiting from in our business  We re going to achieve an operating margin of greater than 40  in 2024  and if you take that acceleration in operating margin combine it with potentially accelerated EPS  when you think about us deploying to  8 billion to  9 billion of proceeds from this transaction it puts us share repurchase for instance we can get further acceleration  So as you look out into 2024  that s why across those select factors  we believe the street under appreciates revenue  under appreciates operating margin under appreciates the EPS growth Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsAnd Frank  on the Japanese price cuts Frank Clyburn    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerHi  Louise  It s Frank  In Japan  we did see or we will be seeing  I should say  in February of this year  a huge sales repricing of 17 5   We ve seen significant strong performance based on our lung cancer indications in Japan and because of the sales projection  February we ll see the price reduced 17 5   It s also important to note that we will face another significant reduction in April  That significant reduction is going to be within the same range as the first cut in February Important to note  that will have an impact likely on our Q1 results in Japan  but also as we take a step back when you look at the roll out renal cell carcinoma in our other indications in Japan  we do believe  despite the price cuts  Over time  we will be able to grow in Japan And then I want to reinforce that if we elevate outside of Japan  we still see very significant growth in 2020 and beyond as we continue to roll out many indications globally  very strong uptake we re continuing to see in Europe  and as Roger mentioned  we now have 23 indications in the US  So we feel very good about our outlook for KEYTRUDA  clearly the Japan repricing will have the near term impact in Japan with confident as we go forward Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Thank you  Next question please  Carlo OperatorNext one is from Umer Raffat of Evercore  Go ahead please Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  Thanks so much for taking my questions and I d appreciate you bearing with me a little bit on it  I guess  let me start with this  a simple one  which is  can you confirm that the stand alone EPS goes down by about  1  That s first  Second  if I add up Women s Health  cardiology and diversified  that s about  6 billion  which is roughly what you re saying is what s being divested to the NewCo  But if the goal is to focus on the innovative and pharma in the RemainCo  I notice there is a  5 billion line for your other pharma  which is not being included  And I m curious why that is And finally  I think  it s very interesting that you re not doing a split  You re doing a spin  very specifically  And I also noticed when you talk about the proceeds you re mentioning biz dev before you mention share repurchase  So it almost seems to me that there might possibly be interest in replacing that lost dollar  So my question is  are you looking at a company which is more on the pipeline side  or is the focus more on a accretive deal  which gets to that dollar EPS back immediately  Thank you very much Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Thanks for the question  Umer  So as you look at  thinking about what is the subtraction  if you will  away from Merck by pulling out this business  and I know the math you re doing to get to roughly  1  The only thing I would advise you on is  I don t think you re giving any credit for the operating efficiencies  the  1 5 billion  which we said we will get ratably  so that s  500 million even in 2021  the first year  which is I think where your math is coming from  And you re not giving any credit to what we re doing with  8 billion to  9 billion of cash proceeds  But if you deploy that to share repurchase  in reality  is that dollar you re quoting then goes down to  0 60   0 70 in the range  So thinking of in terms of percentage  you re closer to 15  and we believe the answer is probably closer to 10  Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsUmer asked as well what s included in NewCo Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerYes  so if you look at the other line  the other pharma line picks up a lot of our hospital and specialty products and fixed up products like ZERBAXA  which is still early in its launch  but a product which we are very excited about  So as we looked at the portfolio  those products that are sitting in the hospital specialty space are ones that we continue to believe long term  create value for us and we wanted to maintain and then there is other to be launched revenue numbers sitting in there or products that are smaller in there as well  So it really is a profile products different than what we put into the NewCo and are very aligned with the core growth drivers that we ve already identified Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsAnd then I think Umer s last question was capital allocation priorities  combined with a question about what our interest in BD might be  So let s start with Rob and then turn it over to Ken Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerSo if you look at the capital allocation priorities  they really remain unchanged  First and foremost  we re going to ensure we appropriately fund research and development  we re going to fund the opportunity to launch new products and we re going to fund the capacity expansion that we have under way to ensure we have the capacity to meet what is very strong demand across all of our growth pillars in Vaccines  oncology and Animal Health  We will remain committed to the dividend  We ve talked about that you heard today  very importantly  we are not lowering the dividend as a result of the spin out of NewCo  we re going to hold our dividend at  2 44  which it is in 2020 and then grow it off of that base with a goal to get to 47  to 50  as a payout ratio  So you re actually going to see a maintain dividend  growing over time and then you have the benefit of the incremental dividend that NewCo is going to have  So all in all  you should have overall more dividend if you hold those stocks than we do today And then finally  as we ve always said  our goal is to use excess cash flow first and foremost for value creating business development  to the extent that we can t find those or we don t find ones that bring us the combination of strategy and value  We will return excess cash to shareholders moving forward  And specifically  as you look at the  89 billion of special dividend where we re going to receive from NewCo as a result of this transaction  as we said in the comments  it will be deployed either to business development or to share repurchase it will not be used for debt pay down  and that s why I believe it will be accretive over time Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerUmer  this is Ken  I think  you also asked about spin versus split  We still spin because we thought that was the quickest path in a tax efficient way of doing this for our shareholders  As it relates to business development  I ll just say as we ve always said  it s an important priority and first and foremost  we are always looking for the best science and innovation that will drive long term growth and value for shareholders  So we re still very much focused on those deals that augment our pipeline and you saw last year  we did a number of deals  about 80 transactions spanning licensing  technology deals and clinical collaborations  We ll continue to look for those opportunities to augment our pipeline with the best science Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Next question please OperatorNext one is Geoff Meacham of Bank of America  Go ahead please Geoff Meacham    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  everyone  Thanks for the question  just have a few  Rob  on the spin  I get the operating margin benefit to Merck longer term  but did I hear you right that op margins to be lower this year in post spin initially  And then with freed up capital  there is a spin effect where you guys have previously discussed on the moderation of R D investments looking to 2021 2022 And then  Frank  real quick  can you talk about the growth strategy in China for IO at this point with the NRDL decision in first line lung  I know  you guys just got approval in this indication November  Thank you Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Geoff  thanks for the question  So on your question about operating margin  if you look at what s NewCo is within Merck today is about 45   so it s obviously higher than Merck s operating margins  So it will be initially nominally dilutive when we pull it out in the first year  But importantly  because of the fact we are getting the operating efficiencies started even in the first year of  500 million and then growing with an additional  500 million in year two  another  500 million in year three  So cumulative  1 5 billion  that offsets a lot of that dilution  And so net when you look at it  it s only about 1 percentage point of dilution to our op margin in the first year and then very quickly  you re going to see our operating margins continue to grow  And by the time we get to over 40  by 2024  we will be at a rate higher than we would have achieved as a combined company  largely as a result of that  1 5 billion operating efficiency  So    and the then that was I think the first question The second one was what s happening with  I think  R D as we look at going forward  So we have never been capital constrained in what we re doing in R D  what s driving the inflection point  we ve talked about which is the slowdown of growth in R D in 2021 as a percent of sales  it s still going to grow  it s going to grow  it s just going to grow slower than sales in 2021  That inflection point is driven more by where we see the clinical programs at this time  if we find opportunities to invest and I m confident given the productivity that we ve seen from the labs this far  but they very well might do that  We will obviously increase our investment as those opportunities present themselves  But as of right now  our expectation is that inflection point continues to happen in 2021 Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsAnd Frank Frank Clyburn    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerGeoff  in your question on China  first  I wanted to make sure that we do mention that our primary focus is on ensuring the safety of our employees  families and supporting the people of China  I think that s on all of our minds and also the continuity of supply of our Human Health medicines and vaccines and products  And we re going to have to see how China evolves  we ll likely see some impact in Q1 too early to quantify As far as your specific question on IO  our overall strategy as we ve discussed in particular as we rolled out in the self pay market  we still feel very confident on our position  We are still the only IO therapy that s approved in non small cell lung cancer  We recently got approval for KEYNOTE 407 in the squamous cell carcinoma population and we feel as though we have a very significant opportunity in the self pay market  And we ve also adjusted our patient assistance programs in China to increase the affordability for patients that we re trying to provide access to as we move forward  So we feel confident going forward in our growth prospects for KEYTRUDA in China Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Next question please  Carlo OperatorNext one is Seamus Fernandez of Guggenheim  Your question please Seamus Fernandez    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystThanks for the question  So maybe just a follow up on one of Steve s questions  The concentration of the business  Merck s business to KEYTRUDA going forward  Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive pressure points that could emerge going forward  You talked a little bit about China  but there also are potential Chinese assets that could be introduced into the US following successful lung cancer clinical program  Just trying to get a better sense of the growth opportunity for KEYTRUDA and where you see potential pressure points  And if you could also comment on some of the administration efforts around international pricing  again  a potential risk point for KEYTRUDA  that would be helpful And then just as a follow up on for Roger  Roger  how quickly  the company emphasized a lot of vaccine opportunities for the business going forward  but most of them are Phase 1  How quickly could we see some of those programs advancing and potentially coming to market and maybe you could just tell us which one or two you re most excited to see in the near term  Thanks Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  thanks  So first  Frank  kind of the performance and outlook for KEYTRUDA Frank Clyburn    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYes  So on KEYTRUDA  as far as we    if we look back at 2019 we re one very pleased that our growth of 58  excluding exchange and almost  4 billion and eclipsing  11 billion in sales  We feel very well positioned as we ve been saying with regards to KEYTRUDA  not only with regards to our significant penetration in non small cell lung cancer within the US  but also the significant impact that we re having for patients with renal cell carcinoma  adjuvant melanoma  head and neck  as you heard Roger mention are recent approval non muscle invasive bladder cancer  So the breadth of our indications and the strength of our data gives us a lot of confidence to continue to grow In particular  not only in the US  but ex US and is especially as we roll out our broader indications in non small cell lung cancer and we re now reimbursed in Europe in all markets for lung  which I see is an important aspect of our growth in 2020  The other thing I would add on the concentration piece too  I think we tried to highlight that is not just about KEYTRUDA  it s Lynparza  it s Lenvima  it s our pipeline in oncology that we ve discussed  We also feel very good about our vaccine performance this year  GARDASIL this year grew 21   as well as our hospital and specialty products  we continue to see good growth with BRIDION  So from a concentration perspective  we feel very confident on the portfolio not only KEYTRUDA  but the breadth of opportunities that we have going forward Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsRight  Ken on pricing Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So on the  Indecipherable  question specifically  we understand the administration s concern that certain countries don t pay their fair share of the cost of the innovation  We do keep continuing to make the point that incorporating additional price control is not the solution to the problem  We continue to work with the administration  the Congress and other stakeholders to provide a perspective  I think patient groups are also providing very strong perspective on these issues as it relates to that But if you take a step back and think about what we announced today  the reason why we re taking these kinds of proactive steps now is because we want to make sure that we position the company for long term growth and viability in the future environment  that s about being much more focused on innovation and it s about driving efficiency within our operating model  So this is about staying ahead of the curve rather than waiting until something happens in the pricing environment that we have to react to Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsRight  And Roger on vaccines Roger M  Perlmutter    President of Merck Research LabsRight  Seamus  thanks for the question  On vaccines  I mean  first of all  as you recognize  we have an enormously large program in pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with V114 program having 15 Phase 3 studies that are rolling out over the next 18 months  24 months  We re going to see a lot of those studies coming this year  in fact  And so you will be hearing a lot of data from those studies  which will ultimately permit filing  So that s a very near term opportunity  We have a lot of enthusiasm about our dengue virus vaccine  that vaccine incidentally is    we are collaborating with colleagues at Butantan  where they have a registration enabling study ongoing and that study will deliver results at some point  So that s pretty exciting as well In addition  of course  we have our CMV vaccine  We have a lot of interesting things going on respiratory syncytial virus and those programs are actually fairly advanced  So things are moving along quite well  I can t fail to mention the fact that the demand for GARDASIL 9 remains enormous and we have invested a huge amount of capital together with our manufacturing colleagues and building the additional capability to meet that demand and that will be rolling out in not too longer time and it will be very important obviously for the company Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  We have several more questioners in queue  We re going to have a hard stop at 9 15  but we re going to keep going  Next question please OperatorNext one is from Daina Graybosch of SVB Leerink  Go ahead please Daina Graybosch    SVB Leerink    AnalystHi  Thanks for the question  Two of them  First on NewCo  what do you see as the long term relationship between NewCo and Merck And then the next question for Roger  as you reflect on all the internal and external immuno oncology data that came out in 2019  what novel mechanisms are you most excited about  to add on top of KEYTRUDA to provide further benefit for patients Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  in terms of the long term relationship that s to be decided as both companies look to their future and decide how they want to make sure that they optimize their best opportunities  So I can t say anything other than what we ve announced today in terms of the products that are going over  but obviously what I would say about NewCo that makes me excited is I think they will have many of the same standards and values that Merck has going forward Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  And Roger Roger M  Perlmutter    President of Merck Research LabsYes  Thanks for the question  Daina  The    in many respects  so things we re most excited about  you can tell by looking at the things that we re investing in  You can see that quite remarkably the Lenvima and as it s been demonstrated in the endometrial cancer registration combination with KEYTRUDA most recently  But we ve also seen really spectacular data in renal cell carcinoma  we presented those Phase 2 data  and we have ongoing Phase 3 data demonstrate that the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors with special characteristics can combine very effectively with KEYTRUDA  We also have data which we presented in combination with Lynparza that are very impressive Let me have this very large set of new molecules  which some of which we prefer to already that include antibodies directed against other potential checkpoints Lag 3  TIGIT and a whole bunch of other things and there really are quite provocative data available now already in those settings  We re hopeful that we ll begin to tease out how best to use those things in combination  So a lots of exciting things going on here Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsRight  Next question please OperatorNext one is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley  Go ahead please Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsDavid  are you on the line David Risinger    Morgan Stanley    AnalystSorry  Yes  Can you hear me now Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes David Risinger    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  So I have a few questions  First  could you provide an update on where GARDASIL manufacturing supply stands and the GARDASIL revenue growth prospects in 2020  And then  Roger  could you discuss potential proof of concept results for Merck s early to mid stage pipeline to watch in 2020  And in addition  could you provide a framework for the timeline for the second pneumococcal vaccine that Merck is developing for infants  which would be added to V114 to offer broader coverage longer term  Thank you Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  I think  the first question is on GARDASIL supply and outlook  So Frank Frank Clyburn    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYes  Dave  so with regards to GARDASIL  we do continue to see very strong demand around the world  Currently our supply is not able to meet that demand  As we mentioned  we saw a growth of 21  this year  The growth we do believe will continue in 2020 will be slightly tempered from the rates you ve seen in 2019 and 2018  And we re focused with our manufacturing colleagues to do everything we can with contract manufacturers in the near term to try to help our supply  and then ultimately in 2023  as we ve been mentioning we ll be bringing on two new bulk manufacturing facilities that will really allow us to ramp our supply up to meet the strong demand that we re seeing globally Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Roger  Speech Overlap Roger M  Perlmutter    President of Merck Research LabsSo  David  on the early to mid stage pipeline  well we ve already discussed that in a lot of programs in for oncology in combination with KEYTRUDA  but we have a lot of other areas  as well that are moving forward  Of course  building on the results of recent was in heart failure  the Phase 3 data which will be presented in the results for the near future and which are quite interesting  We actually have a lot of other interesting things going on in soluble guanylate cyclase activators  So that s an important area for us and something that we expect to see quite a lot of data on  And we re going to be seeing a lot of data on of course our vaccine programs that I mentioned just a few minutes ago  So there will be a lot of data coming forward in 2020 And speaking of vaccines  you mentioned the additional vaccine program  I think you were referring to V117 in the pediatric context  which is not an add on  but a separate and independent vaccine all by itself  And that program  which we just given the name to  will be moving forward shortly  We emphasize that the V11 core program is very far advanced with lots of Phase 3 data coming forward this year and next year and will be a leading program in both adult and pediatric settings  ultimately V116 and V117 will provide further coverage  so more to discuss there Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  Next question please OperatorNext one is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs  Go ahead please Terence Flynn    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  Good morning  Thanks for taking the questions  Just maybe a couple on the spin as well  Does this change at all how you approach M A and business development from a timing perspective  Just wondering  if we shouldn t expect any sizable bolt ons until after the spin s completed  And then are there any tax rate implications that we need to consider  And then any update on the path forward for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant breast cancer regarding discussions with FDA and then when can we expect your Phase 3 frontline data and metastatic triple negative breast and is that important in terms of the conversations with the regulators  Thank you Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsOkay  I think we ll start with Ken and the timing of BD and our strategy around that Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI expect to see no change in our approach to BD from a timing or strategy standpoint as a result of the spin  We still see the need to augment our pipeline going forward  and we see opportunities and we re going to be very focused on that Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerYes  And I would add to that point and then I ll address the tax question  As I said in the prepared remarks  but it s worth reemphasizing  we will have ample capital to do anything we want to do  So this also in a way constraints us from a capital perspective  But with regards to the tax rate  generally speaking  you should not see any meaningful change to our tax rate as a result of this transaction Roger M  Perlmutter    President of Merck Research LabsIn terms with respect to neoadjuvant breast cancer triple negative breast cancer of course the 522 data we presented at ASMO  the effective neoadjuvant in that setting  in terms of pathologic complete response is very clear  And we also had very provocative event free survival data that we discussed  There is more data that will be coming forward in that and we continue to have conversations with regulatory agencies about that study And you re right as we have an ongoing Phase 3 study in triple negative breast cancer that could yield data in principle that would have an impact on thinking with regard to the neoadjuvant study  but of course we have to wait to see the data  So that should be coming forward sometime relatively soon as well  It s event driven  of course  I don t know exactly when Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  We re going to squeeze in one last question please  Carlo OperatorLast one is Mara Goldstein from Mizuho  Go ahead please Mara Goldstein    Mizuho Securities    AnalystGreat  Thanks very much  Just a quick question on the NewCo spin off and the targets around achieving an R D organization and how should we think about that from a metric perspective  And then  just quickly on China  I know we ve covered it  but Merck has spoken to China as a component of growth strategy on a go forward basis and understanding that KEYTRUDA has been a part of that  but Merck has other portfolio of products in China  So I m wondering how much of NewCo s business is responsible for the growth in that region and how RemainCo will be able to advance its growth initiative in the absence of NRDL listing  which didn t occur as expected Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsSo the first question I believe was on R D metrics around NewCo  Rob or Kevin  I don t think we have much to add there at this point Robert M  Davis    Executive Vice President  Global Services and Chief Financial OfficerClearly  I would just say that as we think about the 35  operating margin  growing over time that contemplates investments in research and development in the business  And so it is fully covered there is an assumption that they will be doing R D moving forward  and we feel like it s been adequately covered in a way we resourced these investments in the business and    Kevin wanted to add anything about R D other than he    what he said earlier Kevin Ali    Chief Executive Officer of NewCoI think just to recap what we said earlier  that over time we ll build more of the research and development capabilities as we start to do meaningful business development and start to see opportunities to start to do development Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat  And the second question Kevin Ali    Chief Executive Officer of NewCoChina growth Peter Dannenbaum    Vice President of Investor RelationsChina growth  yes Frank Clyburn    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerThis is Frank  With China  as we discussed and we re very pleased with the growth this year of 58   And our growth to your point is very broad based  it s KEYTRUDA  it s GARDASIL  it s Lynparza  it s Lenvima  it s our innovative portfolio has done very well JANUVIA is on the NRDL  Zepatier  Indecipherable  was recently placed on the NRDL  So we see our growth going forward in China and we see significant opportunities  obviously as I mentioned  we re all thinking about the coronavirus  we ll have to see how that unfolds  but nothing has changed in the mid to long term about our opportunities in China Kenneth C  Frazier    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thank you all for joining us today  As I said in our third quarter call  we are confident that we re not complacent and this separation is evidence of just that  We are convinced that the decision is the right one for the business and we believe that now is the right time to capitalize on a position of strength to secure even stronger future for Merck  As a more focused research intensive biopharmaceutical company we ll be better positioned to carry out our mission of inventing to save and improve lives and drive lasting value for the patients and shareholders we exist to serve  Thank you very much Peter Dannenbaum    Vice

202470,423986,MRK,Is Merck s Decision to Slim Down a Buying Opportunity ,news,"On Wednesday  the multinational pharmaceutical giant Merck  NYSE MRK  revealed plans to carve out its women s health  legacy brands  and biosimilars units into a stand alone business  This strategic spinoff will reportedly transform the biopharma into a growth oriented business focused on branded cancer medicines  vaccines  hospital products  and animal health  The split is planned to take effect in the first half of 2021  
Merck s decision to slim down follows similar moves by peers AstraZeneca  NYSE AZN   Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   GlaxoSmithKline  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   All of these top pharmas have jettisoned one or more of their business segments in the past year in an effort to spotlight their newer growth products  For Merck in particular  this carve out will place an even greater focus on its top selling cancer immunotherapy medicine Keytruda   

Although Merck s brain trust reassured conservative minded income investors that it will continue to pay a respectable dividend  and the resultant spinoff will even pay a modest dividend as well   the drugmaker s shares still fell by almost 3  on the heels of this news  Is Merck s planned de merger actually a compelling buying opportunity  or was the market s initial pessimism warranted  Let s break down the big pharma s near term outlook to find out 
Opportunities and risks
The clear cut benefit from this planned spinoff is that it will spotlight the healthy growth of Keytruda  the neuromuscular blockade reversal drug Bridion  and the company s top flight vaccine portfolio  Before the split announcement  Wall Street was forecasting Merck s top line to rise by a pedestrian 2 2   on average  over the next five years  After this split  however  this key growth metric should improve markedly  thanks largely to the excision of several off patent medicines like the cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin from its portfolio  
This strategic move does create some real problems  however  By shaving off its women s health  legacy brands  and biosimilars segments  the drugmaker will lose approximately 14  of its annual revenue  That s a big chunk of money that will no longer be available for shareholder rewards and business development activities  This higher top line growth will thus come at the substantial cost of significantly lower free cash flows    which obviously isn t sitting well with risk averse folks  
Going one step further  this split might ultimately force Merck to become an ultra aggressive player on the merger and acquisition  M A  scene  While acquisitions can turn out to be a boon for pharma companies  they can also turn into expensive misadventures  One of the core reasons the market hasn t warmed up to Pfizer s planned split  after all  is that the company arguably overpaid for most  if not all  of its recent acquisitions  Pfizer seemingly had no choice but to open up its pocketbook in order to boost its late stage pipeline ahead of this de merger  Merck  in turn  might end up in the same boat  
Time to buy 
Merck is clearly trying to take a page out of Astra s and Lilly s playbook  By excising noncore assets and pivoting toward oncology as a key growth driver  these two big pharmas have both turned into top performing growth stocks  Unfortunately  Merck probably won t follow in their footsteps  Astra and Lilly both sport broad portfolios of branded growth products  amassed over fairly lengthy time periods  The same can t exactly be said for Merck as things now stand  
The company has a lot of work to do to first dilute Keytruda s overall importance and  second  to build a stable of branded products capable of sustained  long term growth  That simple fact means that Merck will likely have to spin the wheel on the high risk M A roulette table soon  So  until the company begins this process in earnest  it might be best to stay on the sidelines ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/przxp,2077949

202473,423989,MRK,Seattle Genetics  Astellas  and Merck Hit a Bladder Cancer Bullseye,news,"Astellas  OTC ALPMY   Seattle Genetics  NASDAQ SGEN   and Merck  NYSE MRK  have good news for new bladder cancer patients who aren t eligible for standard chemotherapy  Followup data from an ongoing clinical trial suggests that a combination of Padcev and Keytruda could become a new first line treatment for this underserved group  
Cooperation makes it happen
Keytruda from Merck is a protein that makes it hard for tumor cells to shut down the immune system when it attacks them  Padcev  from collaboration partners Astellas and Seattle Genetics  is a protein that delivers a dose of chemotherapy directly to tumor cells that present a telltale sign of malignancy on their surface called nectin 4 

Padcev earned approval in December as a treatment for bladder cancer patients whose tumors kept growing after treatment with Keytruda and similar drugs  Seattle Genetics had suggested getting Padcev into the mix with Keytruda at the same time would lead to better outcomes for patients  and Tuesday s data drop suggests this is the case 
Seattle Genetics previously released preliminary results that suggested the combination of Padcev and Keytruda was shrinking tumors  On Tuesday  Seattle Genetics and Astellas announced confirmed tumor responses from 33 of 45 patients treated with the combination  seven of whom achieved complete remission 
What matters most
Getting tumors to respond doesn t always lead to better outcomes  That s why the long term commercial success of this potential combination therapy will depend on overall survival results  This study hasn t been underway for long enough to produce data on that score yet 
So far  we know that an impressive 82  of patients given the combination therapy were still alive 12 months after beginning treatment  If this number holds up for another year  Padcev plus Keytruda could become the new standard of care ",2020-02-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptu-u,2081985

202500,424016,MRK,FDA Approves Merck s Dificid for Infections in Children,news,"The U S  Food and Drug Administration approved Merck s  NYSE MRK  Dificid drug for children aged 6 months and older who have diarrhea caused by a specific bacterial infection called Clostridioides difficile  C  diff  
A tablet form of the drug was already approved for adults with diarrhea caused by the bacteria  In addition to expanding the approval for the tablet form to children  the FDA also approved an oral suspension of the drug that will be easier for children to take than the tablet 

Dificid isn t absorbed by the body  making it effective at treating infections of the gut that cause diarrhea  but ineffective at treating bacterial infections in other parts of the body  C  diff causes almost 500 000 infections annually in the U S   with about 29 000 of those patients dying within 30 days of initial diagnosis 
The drug seems to work as well as vancomycin  which is available as a generic  but appears to have a lower recurrence rate  In a clinical trial run by Merck s collaborator Astellas Pharma  Dificid eradicated the bacteria as well as vancomycin when measured two days after the 10 day treatment  Looking further out  at 30 days  68 4  of the children taking Dificid were cured of their infection that didn t return  compared to just 50  of children taking vancomycin 
Merck and Astellas ended up owning rights to the same drug through a series of acquisitions and licensing deals  Merck gained access to Dificid through its 2015 acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals  which had acquired the drug s original developer  Optimer Pharmaceuticals  Before that  Astellas had licensed rights from Optimer to sell the drug in Japan and Europe  where it s marketed as Dificlir ",2020-01-27,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnmku,2068969
202501,424017,MRK,Is Merck Still a Strong Buy ,news,"Merck  NYSE MRK  has long been the apple of investors  eyes  both for its excellent financials and solid dividend payouts  The company enjoyed monumental sales growth in Q3  with aggregate profits reaching  12 4 billion and an overall revenue surge of 15   
Surpassing analysts  expectations  Merck elevated its full year earnings outlook to the  46 5 billion to  47 billion range  a notable rise from the anticipated profits of  45 2 billion to  46 2 billion  While Merck is known for a variety of pharmaceutical products  there was one drug in particular that accounted for the better part of its profits and forecast boost in Q3  its blockbuster anti cancer drug Keytruda  

Keytruda is an immunotherapy drug used to treat a wide range of cancers including melanoma  classical Hodgkin lymphoma  and non small cell lung cancer  Keytruda accounted for  3 1 billion of Merck s sales in Q3  representing a 62  increase in year over  year revenue  Over the first three quarters of 2019  Keytruda brought in nearly  8 billion in total revenue for Merck 
Keytruda has hit some roadblocks to label expansion of late  Considering that the drug has played and continues to play such an integral role in Merck s financial performance  you re not alone if you ve been wondering whether now is still a good time to buy this stock  
Here s what you need to know  
Merck shares dipped after lung cancer study disappointment  but it s no cause for alarm
On Jan  6  Merck announced that Keytruda had failed to meet one of its clinical markers in an important end phase small cell lung cancer study  Merck shares slumped accordingly in the second and third weeks of January  but subsequently bounced back to roughly the same price they had before the news broke 
While the study showed that using Keytruda alongside chemotherapy could slow the growth of small cell lung cancer  the results did not indicate that the drug would notably decrease the patient mortality rate  
Let s put these study results in perspective  Small cell lung cancer comprises approximately 1 10 of all instances of lung cancer  with only about six percent of patients reaching the five year mark after being diagnosed  
Moreover  Keytruda is currently part of more than 1 000 studies testing the drug s efficacy for various indications  The drug has already received the green light for the treatment of a dozen different tumor types following its first approval for melanoma almost six years ago  
Earlier in January  Merck achieved a landmark win when the FDA approved the use of Keytruda to treat a rare  high risk form of non muscle invasive bladder cancer that does not respond to conventional treatments 
While I m not dismissing the market s initial reaction  at this point  there s no reason to think that Merck has been dealt a blow it can t recover from 
Recent licensing deals could mean billions in revenue for Merck
At the beginning of January  Merck announced that it had entered a groundbreaking licensing and research partnership with Astex Pharmaceuticals and Taiho Pharmaceuticals  Merck shelled out  50 million in return for sole worldwide licensing rights to Taiho and Astex s small molecule inhibitor candidates  with the agreement that approximately  2 5 billion more in conditional payments be made based on product  trial  and regulatory performance 
The partnership is targeting inhibitors of KRAS  a common type of oncogene mutation in cancer 
Taiho s managing director Tehruhiro Utsugi  Ph D  stated the following in the company s press release   Taiho has used its unique and proprietary drug discovery platform to generate a number of small molecule inhibitors  This alliance builds on our KRAS research up to now  and together with MSD  Merck  it allows us to combine expertise to significantly accelerate the global research  development  and commercialization of a number of our mutant KRAS programs by accessing external talent and resources  
The small molecule oncology drug market is a multi billion dollar business  Merck s collaboration will see it merging pre clinical candidates and findings with Taiho and Astex to create a global research and product development powerhouse  As such  this strategic oncology alliance will likely bring a significant return on Merck s investment in the years to come 
Merck is in a strong financial position    for now 
Given Merck s healthy profits on a year over year basis and excellent Q3 results  the company appears to be in a strong financial position at present  Keep an eye out for Q4 earnings  which will be released in early February 
Merck s growing regulatory approvals for Keytruda are encouraging  despite the slight setback with its lung cancer study  Clearly  the greatest risk Merck may face is relying too heavily on Keytruda to fuel future growth 
However  Merck s most recent partnership with Astex and Taiho is a solid step toward diversification in the highly lucrative small molecule inhibitor sector  Right now  the future looks bright for this company  and its stock remains a viable buy ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pok92,2070972

Last May  Merck reported the results of a phase 3 clinical trial of Belsomra in 285 Alzheimer s patients  announcing that the study had met its primary efficacy endpoint  After four weeks of treatment  total sleep time in the Belsoma group increased 73 4 minutes compared with 45 2 minutes in the placebo group  The most common adverse effect was drowsiness the next day 

Disruption of sleep wake patterns and difficulty sleeping is common among Alzheimer s patients  affecting about 40  of the population  and there s emerging evidence that poor sleep may contribute to the development of the disease and impairment of memory function 
Physicians use caution in prescribing the most popular sleep drugs such as Sanofi s Ambien to Alzheimer s patients because they may contribute to confusion and falls  Belsomra is the first drug to use a different mechanism that operates on the specific part of the brain that helps keep a person awake

202515,424031,MRK,AstraZeneca and Merck Get an FDA Priority Review for Lynparza in Prostate Cancer,news,"AstraZeneca  NYSE AZN  and Merck  NYSE MRK  continue their quest to gain additional approvals for their blockbuster cancer drug Lynparza  The duo submitted a new application to the Food and Drug Administration for the drug as a treatment for prostate cancer that s resistant to androgen depletion therapy and has metastasized to other areas of the body 
The FDA gave the application a priority review  which cuts four months off the review cycle  The pharmaceutical companies expect to hear back from the agency in the second quarter of this year although a decision could come earlier 

Lynparza inhibits poly  ADP ribose  polymerase  PARP  proteins that are responsible for repairing nicks in DNA  Inhibition of PARP proteins results in DNA breaks that would normally be repaired through homologous recombination  so AstraZeneca and Merck tested the drug specifically in patients with mutations in genes responsible for homologous recombination repair 
The application is based on the results of the PROfound clinical trial that tested two groups of prostate cancer patients  In patients with mutations in BRCA1 2 or ATM  Lynparza reduced the risk of disease progression by 66  compared to patients taking either Johnson   Johnson s  NYSE JNJ  Zytiga or Astellas Pharma and Pfizer s  NYSE PFE  Xtandi  Lynparza also extended the time it took the disease to progress while the patient remained alive from a median of 3 6 months for Zytiga or Xtanti to 7 4 months for Lynparza 
In the overall population that included patients with mutations in other homologous recombination genes  Lynparza reduced the risk of progression by 51  and extended median progression free survival to 5 8 months  compared to 3 5 months for patients receiving Zytiga or Xtanti 
Lynparza is approved for ovarian  breast and pancreatic cancer  AstraZeneca booked Lynparza sales of  847 million in the first nine months of 2019 ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkxp4,2064090
202516,424032,MRK,Merck s Keytruda Could Face Direct Competition from New Chinese Drug,news,"Chinese drug developer BeiGene  NASDAQ BGNE  announced on Monday strong clinical results for its cancer immunotherapy  tislelizumab  A Phase 3 trial tested the drug alongside two other chemotherapy treatments in patients with non small cell lung cancer and successfully met its primary endpoints of improving patient survival rates  
The company also went on to say that it will go on to seek approval in China  Tislelizumab has already been approved in the country for treatment resistant Hodgkin lymphoma in patients that have already tried two previous cancer therapies  

Should it receive approval  tislelizumab would be directly competing with Merck s  NYSE MRK  own cancer superdrug  Keytruda  which was approved to treat non small cell lung cancer in China last year 
Further details
Keytruda brought in over  10 billion in global sales in 2019  Although most of that came from the U S  market  the sheer population of the Chinese market means that Keytruda sales in this area could easily overtake U S  sales in the future 
However  tislelizumab s approval could siphon away market share from Keytruda  Both drugs are similar in that they block a specific protein known as PD 1  programmed cell death protein 1   This protein is responsible for stopping the immune system from destroying a cell  The idea is that by inhibiting this protein in cancer cells  the immune system will target them more efficiently and prevent them from spreading 
Tislelizumab had originally been bought by Celgene back in 2017  However  the pharmaceutical giant ended up backing down from the agreement  giving back the rights of the drug to BieGene and paying a  150 million termination fee in the process ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pk-0j,2064270

202518,424034,MRK,Should Investors Be Worried About Merck s Keytruda ,news,"Merck s  NYSE MRK  cancer immunology drug  Keytruda  is already one of the best selling drugs in the world and is well on track to becoming the No  1 drug by revenue within the next few years  Having already been approved to treat a number of different cancer types  Keytruda is poised to play a crucial role in the company s future sales growth 
Over the past couple of weeks  however  Keytruda has been hit by some mixed  if not outright disappointing  clinical results  Let s take a closer look at some of these developments and whether they should worry pharmaceutical investors 

The lung cancer trial setback
The most notable setback so far in 2020 for the drug involved a phase 3 trial treating small cell lung cancer  SCLC   Merck announced on Jan  7 that Keytruda failed to extend the lifespan of patients who are diagnosed with the condition  although it helped slow down cancer progression in combination with chemotherapy 
It s worth noting that other major cancer drugs that work similarly to Keytruda have also failed to see positive results in the SCLC patient population  Bristol Myers Squibb s Opdivo failed to show strong results in a late stage clinical trial  later failing another trial in treating non small cell lung cancer  Small cell and non small cell are the two main types of lung cancer  with small cell cancer cells appearing small and round under a microscope while non small cell cancer cells appear larger  The small cell cancer cells spread more aggressively than their non small cell counterparts  and patients diagnosed with SCLC have fewer treatment options open to them than patients diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  
Keytruda and Opdivo are both PD 1 inhibitors  a type of drug that suppresses PD 1  programmed cell death 1  proteins in the body  which is responsible for signaling to the immune system to avoid specific cells  The idea is that the body s immune system will turn back on and aggressively target the cells that don t have this protein    in this instance  cancer cells 
However  drugs that operate in a different manner have had a measure of success in treating SCLC  They include AstraZeneca s Imfiniz and Roche s Tecentriq  both of which target the slightly different PD L1 pathway  Tecentriq  in particular  has been approved as a first line treatment for patients with SCLC 
Is this a big deal 
Investors should remember that SCLC accounts for only 10  to 15  of all lung cancer cases  with the vast majority being a type of non small cell lung cancer  For this latter category  Keytruda has already received approval from the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  as a treatment  albeit for patients who aren t suitable for surgery or chemoradiation  Even if Keytruda ends up failing to capture the smaller SCLC market and cedes it to other drugmakers  the NSCLC population    which is represents 85  to 90  of all lung cancer patients    is a massive market in and off itself  Current estimates predict that the global NSCLC market size will reach  43 7 billion by 2026 
However  Keytruda isn t strictly a lung cancer drug  it s approved to treat a variety of other cancers like lymphoma  melanoma  gastric  cervical  and head and neck cancer  whether by itself or in combination with other drugs  When you add all these potential markets together  a setback in the relatively narrow small cell lung cancer indication becomes even less worrisome 
It s also worth mentioning that Keytruda has a plethora of ongoing studies  and of course not every study is going to yield positive results  A simple search on the internet will reveal a number of clinical flops  most notable of which are a late stage breast cancer trial that fell apart in May 2019  Another notable failure came from two phase 3 trials concerning Keytruda s effectiveness in treating multiple melanoma  a type of cancer that affects a specific type of white blood cell    the plasma cells    found primarily in the bone marrow  
It s to be expected that Keytruda won t hit a clinical home run every time a study comes out  In the big picture  however  things look pretty solid 
What about the potential competition 
Looking at the domestic U S  market  which accounts for the majority of Keytruda s revenue  Merck faces perhaps the most competition from Roche s Tecentriq  Despite bringing in only one tenth the gross revenue of Keytruda in 2018  it is seen as the top front runner behind Merck s cancer drug  holding an edge in clinical results in treating SCLC  While not a short term threat  Tecentriq poses an increasing  long term risk  to Keytruda s position  according to Wall Street analysts 
In international markets  such as China  local competitors are popping up that can siphon away market share  Just recently  BeiGene announced strong results for its non small cell lung cancer drug  tislelizumab  which  if it receives regulatory approval  would directly compete with Keytruda in China 
Both in the U S  and internationally  however  it s unlikely that Keytruda s dominance will be shaken up too much in the next year or two  However  within five to 10 years  it s definitely possible that rival drugs could catch up with  or even overtake  Keytruda in terms of market share  Keytruda is also protected from generic competition for several more years  with its patent protection expiring in 2028  
Future Keytruda catalysts to watch for
Keytruda is predicted to reach over  10 billion in annual revenue for 2019  and is well on track to reach peak annual sales of  22 5 billion by 2025  Neither competition nor the occasional clinical setback is likely to do much to change this 
However  there still are some major catalysts for the cancer drug that investors might want to keep an eye on  Most notably  results from a phase 3 trial in the realm of breast cancer is expected to come out in the first quarter while another phase 3 trial for renal cell cancer expected around April  
As for Merck s stock  it trades at a reasonable 25 2 price to earnings  P E  ratio  much lower than AstraZeneca s 63 1 P E but a bit pricier than Bristol Myers  19 4  In some ways  it s surprising that Merck doesn t trade at a higher premium considering Keytruda s revenue projections  but I wouldn t say the stock is underpriced  Overall  I d say Merck looks like a pretty good buy at the moment  with Keytruda s financial and clinical positions remaining unthreatened for at least the next couple of years ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plxj8,2066106

202527,424043,MRK,Merck s Keytruda Misses an Important Lung Cancer Goal,news,"Merck s cancer immunotherapy finally hit a stumbling block in a pivotal study with lung cancer patients that caused the stock to slip 1 5  on Tuesday morning  It s more than a little surprising because Keytruda has been taking huge steps toward becoming the world s top selling drug since Merck   Co   NYSE MRK  revealed game changing lung cancer trial results in 2016  
During a study with small cell lung cancer that hadn t received any treatment for their disease before  adding Keytruda to standard chemotherapy failed to produce a significant overall survival benefit  

Merck was quick to point out that it took significantly longer for patients treated with Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy to show signs of their disease worsening than for those given standard chemotherapy on its own  But because overall survival is the gold standard  a label expanding approval to treat newly diagnosed patients doesn t seem likely 
It could be worse for Merck
Third quarter sales of Keytruda jumped 62  higher than the same period last year to an annualized  12 4 billion  largely because of increasing sales as a first line treatment for non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   Merck s shares haven t been hammered down very far because the recent failure involved small cell lung cancer  SCLC   which makes up around 15  of all new cancer diagnoses 
Lung cancer isn t the most commonly diagnosed malignancy  but it still claims more lives than any other  With a tight grip in the first line setting for around 85  of lung cancer patients who receive a lung cancer diagnosis of the non small cell variety  Keytruda s still likely to become the world s top selling drug within another year or two ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pexp1,2054090

    Let s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement Factors Driving GrowthBristol Myers  key immuno oncology drug  Opdivo  is likely to have maintained its stellar performance in the to be reported quarter  The drug  which is approved for multiple indications  generated sales of  5 4 billion in the first nine months of 2019  increasing 10  year over year  Sales for the third quarter came in at  1 8 billion  The momentum is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter  owing to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance of the drug for several indications  including melanoma  renal cell carcinoma  hepatocellular carcinoma and second line non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  Blood thinner drug  Eliquis  witnessed strong growth in the first nine months of 2019 and was the top revenue generator in the third quarter with sales of  1 9 billion  a trend that most likely continued in the fourth quarter propelled by market share increases Arthritis drug  Orencia  raked in sales of  2 2 billion in the first nine months of 2019  up 10  year over year  and  767 million in the third quarter  The drug has most likely boosted the top line in the fourth quarter as well   In December 2019  the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Orencia  for the prevention of moderate to severe acute graft versus host disease  GvHD  in hematopoietic stem cell transplants from unrelated donors Oncology drug  Sprycel  is also likely to have maintained momentum However  the virology business has most likely witnessed a decline in the fourth quarter In November 2019  Bristol Myers completed the acquisition of Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG  following the receipt of regulatory approval from all government authorities as required by the merger agreement The acquisition added oncology drug  Revlimid  to Bristol Myers portfolio  Revlimid sales came in at  2 8 billion in the third quarter of 2019  up 13  year over year  driven primarily by the adoption of the triplet therapy for myeloma  resulting in increases in treatment duration and market share  Similar contributions are expected in the fourth quarter as well In November 2019  the FDA approved Celgene s Reblozyl for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia  who require regular red blood cell  RBC  transfusions  The drug was developed in collaboration with Acceleron Pharma Inc    NASDAQ XLRN    The top line is likely to have got a boost from the incremental contribution of Reblozyl Apart from the top and bottom line numbers  investors will focus on updates on label expansion of drugs  In December 2020  the European Commission  EC  approved a new indication for Revlimid  lenalidomide   in combination with rituximab  anti CD20 antibody   for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma  Key Anticipated UpdatesBristol Myers recently withdrew its application in the European Union  EU  for the combination of Opdivo  nivolumab  and Yervoy  ipilimumab  for the treatment of advanced non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  based on data from CheckMate 227 Though the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  acknowledged the integrity of the patient data  it determined that a full assessment of the application was not possible following the multiple protocol changes the company made in response to the rapidly evolving science and data  Consequently  Bristol Myers has no plans to resubmit this application in the EU In January 2020  the FDA granted a Priority Review status to the Opdivo Yervoy combination for the treatment of first line NSCLC The FDA has accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  and granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to the combination for the

202546,424062,MRK,Bristol Myers  Opdivo Yervoy NSCLC Application In EU Withdrawn,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced the withdrawal of its application in the European Union  EU  for the combination of anti PD 1 antibody Opdivo  nivolumab  and Yervoy  ipilimumab  for the treatment of advanced non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  based on data from the CheckMate 227 study  The application was initially filed in 2018 for patients with first line NSCLC  who have tumor mutational burden 
However  the application was later amended to include the statistically significant overall survival data  a co primary endpoint  from CheckMate 227 Part 1a  evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy versus chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed PD L1  1  
Per the company  Europe s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  stated that it was not possible to assess the data provided by the company because of  multiple protocol changes  it made in the study 
Bristol Myers has no intention of refiling the application anytime soon  In January 2020  the FDA granted a Priority Review for the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy for the treatment of first line NSCLC based on data from Part 1 of the phase III CheckMate  227 study 
Shares of Bristol Myers have rallied 24 7  in the past year  outperforming the  growth of 10 2  

 
We note that Opdivo is currently approved in many countries  including the United States  the EU and Japan  for several cancer indications  The company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti cancer agents  The Opdivo and Yervoy combination is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and intermediate or poor risk  previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  
The combination is also approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with microsatellite instability high  MSI H  or mismatch repair deficient  dMMR  metastatic colorectal cancer  CRC   which has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine  oxaliplatin and irinotecan 
Label expansion of Opdivo into additional indications would lend the product access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential significantly 
However  the drug is facing competitive challenges in the United States from Merck s   NYSE MRK   PD L1 inhibitor  Keytruda

202681,424197,MRK,Pfizer Merck KGaA s Bavencio Fails In 2nd Gastric Cancer Study,opinion,"Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   along with Germany based partner Merck KGaA announced top line data from a phase III study evaluating their PD L1 inhibitor Bavencio  avelumab   The JAVELIN Gastric 100 study evaluated Bavencio as a first line maintenance therapy following induction chemotherapy in patients with unresectable  locally advanced metastatic HER2 negative gastric cancer compared to continuation of chemotherapy or best supportive care 
Top line results showed that treatment with Bavencio did not lead to superior overall survival when compared to the standard of care in the overall intent to treat population or the PD L1 positive population  thereby failing to meet the primary endpoint of the study 
However  no new safety signals were seen and the safety profile of Bavencio witnessed in this study was similar to what was earlier observed across the JAVELIN program 
Gastric or gastroesophageal junction  GEJ  cancer study covers a hard to treat patient population with significant unmet medical need for additional treatments  Notably  this is the second gastric cancer study on Bavencio  which failed  In November 2017  another phase III gastric cancer study  JAVELIN Gastric 300  evaluating Bavencio monotherapy in the third line setting missed the primary endpoint 
Bavencio is presently approved for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma and metastatic urothelial carcinoma  Bavencio in combination with Pfizer s another cancer drug Inlyta  axitinib  is also approved in the United States for the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC   the most common form of kidney cancer 
Last month  the European Commission approved this Bavencio plus Inlyta combo for the first line treatment of patients with advanced RCC 
Shares of Pfizer have decreased 15 2  so far this year against the  rise of 3 6  

Notably  Bavencio is one of the key candidates in Pfizer s oncology pipeline  Per the company  the Bavencio development program  known as JAVELIN  involves more than 10 000 patients currently being investigated across 15 tumor types including head and neck  non small cell lung  urothelial and others 
Bavencio faces stiff competition from other approved PD L1 inhibitors in the market  such as Merck s   NYSE MRK   blockbuster drug Keytruda  pembrolizumab   Bristol Myers    NYSE BMY   Opdivo  nivolumab  and AstraZeneca s   NYSE AZN   Imfinzi  durvalumab

cents  easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents  However  the bottom line declined from 41 cents in the year ago quarter Net revenues came in at  271 7 million  increasing from  225 4 million in the year ago quarter and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  228 38 million Quarter in DetailNet product revenues came in at  191 8 million  up 17 7  from the year ago quarter  driven by continued growth of Cabometyx in the United States for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  Cabometyx received another FDA approval for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma  who have been previously treated with sorafenib  in January  The label expansion of the drug for this indication in the United States also boosted sales The drug generated  187 4 million of revenues  Patient demand grew 14  year over year but declined 4  sequentially  Prescriber base grew by 40  year over year and 7  sequentially Cometriq  cabozantinib capsules   for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer  generated  4 4 million in net product revenues Total collaboration revenues were  79 9 million  up from  62 5 million in the year ago quarter  primarily owing to the recognition of a  50 0 million milestone from Exelixis  collaboration with Ipsen Pharma SAS for the achievement of  250 0 million of net sales from cabozantinib in its territories over four consecutive fiscal quarters In the reported quarter  research and development expenses more than doubled to  97 3 million due to increases in clinical trial costs  license and other collaboration costs  and personnel expenses   Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses were  51 3 million  up 6 6  year over year  driven by increase in personnel expenses and stock based compensation Pipeline UpdateThe pipeline progress in the year so far has been encouraging In July  Exelixis announced an exclusive collaboration  option and license agreement with Aurigene  an India based biotechnology company focused on oncology and inflammatory disorders  to in license as many as six programs  Per the agreement  Exelixis made an upfront payment of  10 0 million for exclusive options to license three pre existing programs from Aurigene  The companies selected three additional Aurigene led drug discovery programs on mutually agreed upon targets  in exchange for supplemental option payments totaling  7 5 million In the same month  Exelixis amended the protocol for COSMIC 021  the phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq  atezolizumab  in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors  Based on preliminary encouraging activity and safety data  the original immunotherapy refractory non small cell lung cancer and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  CRPC  cohorts were expanded to 80 patients each  Additionally  four new cohorts   two expansion and two exploratory   in metastatic CRPC settings were included in the trial In October  Ipsen announced Health Canada s approval of Cabometyx for the first line treatment of adults with advanced RCC  Hence  Exelixis is eligible to receive a milestone payment of  3 0 million  which will be recognized as revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 In October  the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against MSN Pharmaceuticals  Inc  following the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notice letter from the latter stating that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA requesting the approval to market a generic version of Cabometyx tablets  following the expiration of the Cabometyx composition of matter patent   U S  Patent No  7 579 473   which expires on Aug 14  2026   Per Exelixis  the effective date of any FDA approval for the ANDA would be a date

and SG A expenses around  240 million  previous guidance  between  220 million and  240 million  Our TakeExelixis  earnings and sales beat estimates in the third quarter despite increasing competition from the recently approved combination therapies  Earlier this year  the FDA approved Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda in combination with Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Inlyta for the first line treatment of patients with advanced RCC  Competition has further intensified with the FDA approval of a combination regimen of Bavencio  avelumab  and Inlyta for the same   Given the increasing use of these

202789,424305,MRK,Roche s New Perjeta Combo Meets Goal In Breast Cancer Study,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   announced that its new investigational fixed dose combination  FDC  of Perjeta  pertuzumab  and Herceptin  trastuzumab  has met the primary endpoint of non inferiority in the phase III FeDeriCa study 
In the study  the new FDC  which is administered by subcutaneous  SC  injection in combination with intravenous  IV  chemotherapy  demonstrated non inferior levels of Perjeta in the blood compared to the standard IV infusion of Perjeta   Herceptin and chemotherapy in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer  eBC  
This new FDC of Perjeta   Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy is administered under the skin  thus providing a faster treatment option for the given patient population  The FDC of Perjeta and Herceptin is a new SC formulation  which uses Halozyme Therapeutics    NASDAQ HALO   Enhanze drug delivery technology 
Per the company  the SC administration of the new FDC takes around eight minutes for the initial loading dose and approximately five minutes for each subsequent maintenance dose  This is a significant reduction in administration time compared to the infusion of a loading dose of Perjeta and Herceptin using the standard IV formulations that takes approximately 150 minutes and almost 60 150 minutes for the subsequent maintenance dose 
Roche plans to present full data from the above study at an upcoming medical conference  The company also plans to submit the results to the FDA and the EMA for regulatory approvals 
Perjeta in combination with Herceptin and chemotherapy  the Perjeta based regimen  is already approved by the FDA as an adjuvant  after surgery  treatment of HER2 positive eBC patients  who are at a high risk of recurrence 
We would like to remind investors that Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market  Particularly  it dominates the breast cancer space with solid demand for its HER2 franchise drugs  namely Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla 
However  competition looms large on the HER2 positive breast cancer space  Puma Biotech s   NASDAQ PBYI   Nerlynx  neratinib  is also approved for use as an extended adjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early stage breast cancer in adult patients  who were previously treated with Roche s Herceptin based adjuvant therapy 
Shares of Roche have increased 9 1  so far this year versus the  decrease of 1 2  

In a separate press release  Roche announced new six year data from the phase III study on its multiple sclerosis  MS  drug Ocrevus  ocrelizumab   The longer term data from the OPERA I  OPERA II and ORATORIO extension studies showed that an early and continuous treatment with Ocrevus for six or more years led to a reduced risk of disability progression in patients with relapsing MS  RMS  and primary progressive MS  PPMS  
The results were presented at the 35th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis held in Sweden 
Zacks Rank   Another Key Pick
Roche currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Another stock worth considering in the large cap pharma sector is Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK    which carries the same Zacks Rank as Roche  You can see  
Merck s earnings estimates have been revised 3 2  upward for 2019 and 1 3  for 2020 over the past 60 days  The stock has rallied 9  year to date

202801,424317,MRK,Fuse takes Fidelity funding to expand its bite sized learning system,news,"By Eric Auchard
LONDON  Reuters    Fuse Universal  a learning management platform which companies use to train employees on phones and computers  has raised  20 million in expansion funding from Eight Roads Ventures  Fidelity International s venture arm  the company said on Wednesday 
Fuse has sought to reinvent how corporate learning management systems work by enabling employees to view short  bite sized training clips online or offline  on their smartphones or tablet devices  or from their desks 
The Fuse system is used by more than 100 companies for employee training  including Merck  NYSE MRK   EY  International Hotel Group  Spotify  N SPOT  and  Vodafone   L VOD   It works as a standalone learning management system or as an overlay to older learning platforms 
Vodafone says 50 percent of its UK retail workforce using the system viewed Fuse short courses outside of working hours  with peak usage occurring while traveling to and from work 
While breaking with the formal text and graphic presentations common to traditional knowledge sharing systems that are designed for learning administrators but receive low scores for employee engagement  Fuse also supplies analytics to ensure compliance targets are met  a major selling point 
The company ranks as one of Europe s leading next generation learning platforms  according to a recent survey of dozens of regional and global players in the learning management systems industry by human resources consulting research firm Fosway Group 
Eight Road Ventures said the funding will allow Fuse to expand to reach its increasingly global customer base  It will also allow the firm to invest in educational technology  including machine learning and augmented reality 
Michael Treskow  a partner at Eight Roads Ventures  will join the Fuse board 
The 10 year old London based Fuse took  10 million  7 4 million pounds  in private equity funding in 2015

Congo has conquered some major scientific hurdles in giving high protection  but it now faces extreme real world tests including heat  humidity  language barriers and lack of roads  Because it is not yet licensed  the Merck  NYSE MRK    Co vaccine has been offered to Congo under a  compassionate use  protocol agreed by national and international health and ethics authorities   This means fully informed  signed consent is needed from every person who wants the shot  And in the current Ebola outbreak  that makes logistical  cultural and language barriers the ultimate challenges  global health specialists say  The hurdles illustrate how hard it can be to move from laboratory to real life  especially in remote communities with no functioning health systems  The Congo outbreak is a chance to reality test a vaccine against a disease epidemic that can t be replicated in controlled environments   This is going to need a highly sophisticated operation in one of the most difficult places on earth   said Peter Salama  the World Health Organization s deputy director general for emergency preparedness and response   It s very hot and very humid  and we re talking about hundreds of kilometers of densely forested areas   The shot is designed for use in a so called  ring vaccination   When a new Ebola case is diagnosed  all people who might have been in recent contact with them are traced and vaccinated to try and prevent the disease s spread  The vaccine supplies so far will be enough to vaccinate 50 rings of 150 people  according to the WHO  It said that as of May 15  527 contacts of Ebola cases and suspected cases had been identified and were being followed up  Health workers will need to use translators for several local languages and explain the vaccine to leaders from different communities  Salama said  Limited communications  health facilities and electricity  as well as the need to keep the vaccine in a  cold chain  at  60 to  80 degrees Celsius will also present challenges   If any of these elements fails  the vaccine s potential to protect 100 percent of those immunized will go unrealized   These are make or break issues   said Salama  who visited Congo last weekend   There s a lot of complex logistics and social science here    CONTACTS Results of a trial using the ring vaccination technique with the Merck shot  which is known as VSV EBOV  in Guinea in West Africa in 2015 showed 100 percent protection in those vaccinated immediately  Health experts working to contain the Congo outbreak  which was first reported on May 8  say a cold chain will be in place to get the vaccines from Congo s capital Kinshasa to the affected areas within a few days  Then the shot could be given to local frontline medical  burial and hospital workers who volunteer for it as early as next week   There have been 44 suspected  probable or confirmed Ebola cases in this outbreak in Congo s Equateur province  and 23 people have died   The WHO said on Thursday it became more concerned when a case was confirmed in Mbandaka  a city of about a million people which is connected to Kinshasa by the Congo River  Jeremy Farrar  a specialist in infectious diseases and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity  told Reuters the epidemic now had  all the features of something that could turn really nasty    You can t overrespond in this scenario   he said   But the vaccine must be seen in the context of an overarching public health response  Critically that means early diagnosis  early isolation  safe burials and understanding the social context  The vaccine can only be a part of the solution   ACCEPTANCE  Experts also caution that acting too hastily could jeopardize the potential success of a vaccine deployment  Micaela Serafini  a medical director for the international charity Medecins Sans Fronti res  MSF  who is helping coordinate the response to the Congo outbreak  said its teams are planning for at least 45 minutes of discussion and information sharing with each person  with a translator present  before signed consent would be obtained   Then  she told Reuters  medical teams would probably return the following day to administer the vaccine   What we need to avoid at all costs is an uncontrolled situation in the communities affected   she said   Even though the vaccine has still yet to get a license  the emergency response teams say its safety and efficacy data is strong  And despite lingering suspicions in some of the more remote parts of Africa of western medicines  experts anticipate widespread public acceptance  Congo s health minister Oly Ilunga signaled on Thursday that his government was fully behind the shot s use   The vaccine will help us save lives in the Equateur province  in the DRC and in neighboring countries  The vaccine allows us to limit the virus  so we must use it   he said  Merck and the GAVI vaccine alliance have said a stockpile of more than 300 000 doses of the shot is available for emergency use in an epidemic  Salama and Serafini said one tricky task may be managing a scenario where larger groups of people not identified as high risk contacts of a Ebola case might demand the vaccine for themselves or their family   
 We want to make sure we are engaging whole communities so that the broader community understands what we are doing and why   said Salama   That is particularly important when you re not targeting everyone  because naturally people will ask   How come you re vaccinating that person but not me   ",2018-05-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/in-congo-outbreak-ebola-vaccine-faces-reality-tests-1453244,1453244

202805,424321,MRK,4 Big Drugmakers Boasting Impressive Oncology Pipelines,opinion,"There has been a significant uptick in demand for cancer drugs and subsequent growth of the cancer research market owing to the widespread occurrence of the disease  Cancer is second only to heart disease when it comes to claiming lives  According to a report by the American Cancer Society  more than 1 76 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2019  which creates significant need for effective cancer medication Allied Market Research estimates the global cancer drugs market to be worth more than  176 billion by 2025  The factors contributing to growth of the oncology cancer drugs market are rapid progress of drugmakers  cancer pipelines and increase in the number of collaborations between pharmaceutical companies  which has lowered the cost burden  increased demand for personalized medicines and boosted demand in developing nations  Companies focused on making innovative cancer drugs are in great demand for buyouts The traditional cancer treatments include surgery  radiation and chemotherapy  However  targeted therapy  immunotherapy  gene therapy  hormone therapy  precision medicine and other new novel therapies are slowly making their way into clinics to improve  supplement or replace traditional cancer treatments  Advances in new treatments have attracted investors  attention and made cancer a hot investing area lately It goes without saying that all big pharma companies are working hard to bring innovative cancer treatments to market as well as expand the labels of their marketed oncology drugs to capture a share of this growing market  These pharma biotech giants have significant financial resources at their disposal and have even collaborated to pool their resources and technology Here we discuss four pharma giants  which possess the industry s strongest oncology pipeline portfolios AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN  AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio and has several candidates in its pipeline  Oncology sales now comprise around 35  of total product sales for AstraZeneca  It has some high profile cancer drugs in its portfolio like Tagrisso  Lynparza  Faslodex and Imfinzi  which are among its top medicines AstraZeneca s cancer drugs are being studied in several label expansion studies  which can expand their eligible patient populations  It also has a few oncology candidates in its pipeline Imfinzi  which is marketed for second line advanced bladder cancer and early stage lung cancer  is being evaluated for multiple cancers  either alone or in combination with other regimens  Lynparza  presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer and breast cancer in partnership with Merck   NYSE MRK    is also in different studies for a range of tumor types including prostate  pancreatic and gastric cancers as well as earlier line settings for ovarian cancer and breast cancer  Tagrisso is also being evaluated in earlier line settings for lung cancer  Another new cancer drug in AstraZeneca s portfolio is Calquence  acalabrutinib   which is approved for previously treated mantle cell lymphoma  AstraZeneca expects to file regulatory applications for Calquence to get approval for the larger chronic lymphocytic leukemia indication  in frontline and in the relapsed recurrent disease setting  later this year Key oncology candidates in late stage development include selumetinib  pediatric neurofibromatosis type 1  and savolitinib  non small cell lung carcinoma  NSCLC    In April 2019  AstraZeneca acquired joint development and commercialization rights to an innovative antibody drug conjugate  trastuzumab deruxtecan from Japan s Daiichi Sankyo  A regulatory application seeking approval for trastuzumab deruxtecan in metastatic breast cancer is expected to be filed with the FDA in the second half of 2019 Pfizer   NYSE PFE  Pfizer gained FDA approval for four innovative cancer medicines in the last four months of 2018  which is likely to boost its oncology sales  These include Daurismo  glasdegib  for previously untreated AML  Lorbrena  lorlatinib  for second line non small cell lung cancer  Vizimpro  dacomitinib  for advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations and Talzenna  talazoparib   an orally available PARP inhibitor for advanced breast cancer Two leukemia treatments   Besponsa for relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia were approved in the United States in the third quarter of 2017 Meanwhile  Pfizer is also working on expanding the label of its key breast cancer drug Ibrance and prostate cancer drug  Xtandi Pfizer s newest immunotherapy  Bavencio  though approved for two small indications currently  is being considered a significant future top line driver for this New York based pharma giant if it can gain label expansion approvals  Pfizer has 30 ongoing studies in the avelumab development program involving more than 9 000 patients across 15 tumor types Importantly  Pfizer is gradually venturing into the oncology biosimilars space  Pfizer s biosimilar versions of Roche s cancer drugs Herceptin  Avastin and Rituxan were approved by the FDA in 2019  Biosimilar versions of Herceptin and Avastin are already approved in the EU while that of Rituxan is under review in the EU Finally  the July acquisition of Array BioPharma for  11 4 billion has strengthened its cancer portfolio  Array launched its only commercial medicine  Braftovi plus Mektovi  as a treatment for BRAF mutant melanoma  last year  The combination medicine is also being evaluated in label expansion studies for other cancer types including metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAF mutation Merck Merck s oncology portfolio pipeline  though revolving around just its revolutionary anti PD 1 therapy  Keytruda  can be said to be one of the strongest in the industry Keytruda is already approved for use in 20 cancer indications across 12 different tumor types in the United States  Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally  Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first line lung cancer  In fact  the Keytruda development program is also progressing well and the drug is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 1000 studies  including more than 600 combination studies  Undoubtedly  Keytruda has strong future growth prospects based on increased utilization  approval for new indications and expectation of additional approvals worldwide Meanwhile  Merck has profit sharing deals with AstraZeneca for Lynparza selumetinib and Japan s Eisai for Lenvima for several types of cancer Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY  Bristol Myers PD 1 inhibitor  Opdivo  has been performing impressively  The company is working on expanding the label of Opdivo further  alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti cancer agents Further  Bristol Myers  cancer portfolio includes multiple myeloma drug  Empliciti and leukemia drug  Sprycel  which contribute significantly to the top line  In addition  Bristol Myers is evaluating other immune system pathways for the treatment of cancer  These pathways may help the company bring to market potentially transformational immunotherapies   in combination or as monotherapy   to help fight different types of cancers Most importantly its pending acquisition of Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  for approximately  74 billion should boost its oncology franchise by adding blockbuster drugs like Revlimid and Pomalyst and several pipeline candidates across solid tumors and hematologic malignancies While Merck and Bristol Myers currently carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   AstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Pfizer holds a Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  You can see  Others Not Far BehindAbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   key cancer drug and also what it calls a  pipeline in a molecule   Imbruvica  is currently approved for quite a few indications across different cancer types  Imbruvica has multi billion dollar potential  Several studies on Imbruvica are ongoing to evaluate the drug alone or in combination in different patient segments  AbbVie is also studying another key cancer drug  Venclyxto Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient population  expand into earlier lines of therapy  and broaden into other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia Roche   OTC RHHBY   dominates the breast cancer space  There is strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla  Apart from its strong breast cancer franchise  Roche s oncology portfolio also boasts lung cancer drugs like Avastin  Tecentriq and Tarceva and hematology medicines like MabThera Rituxan  Gazyva  and Venclexta   Newly approved cancer medicines are Polivy Alcensa and Rozlytrek  Label expansion efforts are ongoing for almost all these cancer drugs Swiss drugmaker Novartis    NYSE NVS   oncology portfolio was significantly boosted by the approval of breast cancer drug  Kisqali and CAR T cell therapy Kymriah in 2017  Novartis also boasts many experimental cancer drugs in its R D pipeline including a couple of biosimilar versions of popular cancer drugs ConclusionCompetition in the cancer market is fierce and not all pipeline candidates will be successful  However  pharma biggies have enough late stage cancer programs in their portfolios and there are chances of quite a few rollouts in the coming years Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR   Return

202813,424329,MRK,Too many cancer drugs  Crowded market gives investors pause,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    In London s world famous Great Ormond Street children s hospital  Dr  Karin Straathof is excited about a new cell based medicine that offers hope for toddlers with incurable nerve tissue cancer  Her progress with a handful of children for whom standard care does not work reveals the promise of modern cancer drugs  an increasingly crowded pharmaceuticals field from which investors must try to select future winners  The new therapy using engineered white blood cells has shown anti tumor activity in the hardest to treat neuroblastoma patients   The beauty is that it is very specific in targeting the cancer cells  while leaving healthy tissue unharmed   Straathof told Reuters  after presenting her early findings at a science meeting in Chicago in April   It s an important step forward    Autolus   the small British biotech company developing the chimeric antigen receptor T cell or CAR T treatment   is equally excited  and is planning a potential IPO on Nasdaq  But Autolus is far from alone in pursuing CAR T therapy  In fact  CAR T treatment   part of the wider field of cancer immunotherapy   is one of the hottest areas of drug research today  with multiple firms piling in  The biotech dollars are flooding in not only in Europe and the United States but also in China which  with 162 clinical trials  now boasts more CAR T studies than the United States  according to a Reuters analysis of the latest data  With over 2 000 drugs in the cancer immunotherapy space  the competitive landscape has never been more crowded as each firm seeks its own proprietary version of often similar drugs  Overall  researchers are working on more than 5 200 cancer drugs  up 7 6 percent from a year ago  according to the Pharmaprojects database  The sheer number is stretching the ability of scientists to find enough patients to test them on  Cancer now makes up 34 1 percent of the total drug industry pipeline  up from 26 8 percent in 2010  as companies divert resources into a promising sector where new treatments can often fetch more than  100 000 a year    MORE CIRCUMSPECT   With the first two CAR T treatments from  Novartis   S NOVN  and Gilead Sciences  O GILD  winning U S  approval last year for rare blood cancers  the promise of such smart medicine is real and life changing   especially if it can be made to work in solid tumors  as Straathof s work suggests is possible  However  the wholesale rush by pharmaceutical and biotech companies into the cancer area poses a dilemma for investors   A flood of similar products makes it hard for investors to pick those companies that will achieve commercial success   More competition means you should be more circumspect   said Nooman Haque  head of life sciences at Silicon Valley Bank in London  which provides financing for start ups and venture capitalists   The traditional investment thesis in biotech is to have a differentiated medicine with not many competitors  which helps drive value  Here the problem is that even if there is a big patient benefit  there are questions as to how long your advantage lasts and what your commercial edge will be   Pharmaceutical executives are not blind to the issue  although each hopes to find a winning formula in immunotherapy   the fastest growing part of the  100 billion a year cancer drug market  with sales expected to top  25 billion by 2021  according to analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters  Roche  S ROG  CEO Severin Schwan  head of the world s top cancer company  says he expects  an enormous drop out   while Sanofi s  PA SASY  outgoing research head Elias Zerhouni warned analysts last week that duplication of effort would shrink the time available for drugmakers to recoup their R D investments   The cycle of innovation has been shortened significantly   agrees Aiman Shalabi  chief medical officer at the non profit Cancer Research Institute   There is no doubt we are seeing fast follow on and many identical agents hitting the same targets   The good news for society is that patients will find out much faster than in the past if new approaches work  But that means doctors can rapidly switch to alternatives  leading to increased product churn and uncertainty over future sales   COMBINATION STUDIES Twenty years ago  when Roche launched its state of the art cancer drugs Herceptin and Rituxan  it enjoyed years without rivals  Today  there are multiple versions of new drugs targeting molecular pathways with acronyms such as PD 1 L1  PARP and CDK  as well as CAR T   You re either first or you re best or you re nowhere because it has become such a race   said Paul Major  an investment manager at BB Healthcare Trust  L BBH   who is cautious about investing in cancer immunotherapy  Lydia Haueter at Pictet Asset Management is also wary  pointing out there are already five PD 1 L1 drugs on the market   from Merck  N MRK   Bristol Myers Squibb  N BMY   Roche  AstraZeneca  L AZN  and  Pfizer   N PFE    and more are coming   It seems everybody has a PD 1  so we especially don t go for those kind of cancer companies   she said  Some drugmakers like GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK  and Novartis that missed the initial PD 1 L1 wave are trying to make a virtue of looking ahead to the next phase of cancer immunotherapy  particularly drug combinations  Yet last month s failure of a combination study using a next generation drug from Incyte  O INCY  with Merck s PD 1 Keytruda shows that adding a new agent is no slam dunk for expanding the reach of immune boosting medicine  At Great Ormond Street  Straathof is less concerned about doubling up on research and more focused on getting effective  affordable cures   and she hopes automated processes will eventually bring down today s sky high drug prices   I m not too worried about duplication  It s important to not ask the same question in two

202823,424339,MRK,U S  biotech companies Alnylam  Dicerna settle trade secrets case,news,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON  Reuters    Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Friday that Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc will pay it  25 million in cash and stock to resolve a lawsuit claiming it stole trade secrets about gene silencing technology used to develop drug treatments 
The settlement between the two biotech companies resolves a lawsuit that Alnylam filed against Dicerna in 2015  The accord came ahead of a jury trial that was set to begin on Monday in state court in Woburn  Massachusetts 
Under the agreement  Dicerna said it will pay Alnylam  2 million up front plus 983 208 shares of its common stock 
Cambridge  Massachusetts based Dicerna said it will also pay Alnylam another  13 million over the next four years  the timing of which is dependent on revenue Dicerna receives pursuant to future RNAi technology based partnerships under its GalXC brand 
Alnylam  also Cambridge based  in a statement said the deal would also place certain restrictions on Dicerna  Neither company admitted wrongdoing 
Dicerna s stock was trading at  13 20 midday on Friday  up 29 12 percent  Shares in Alnylam were trading at  97 59  up 1 46 percent 
Alnylam s lawsuit accused Dicerna of misappropriating confidential information related to RNAi technology Alnylam acquired when in 2014 when it bought a Merck  NYSE MRK    Co Inc subsidiary in a deal it valued in court papers at  325 million 
RNAi  or RNA interference  prevents a defective gene from making disease causing proteins 
The lawsuit said Dicerna  which unsuccessfully tried to acquire RNAi assets from Merck  used confidential information it reviewed while considering the potential transaction in violation of a confidentiality agreement 
Alnylam contended Dicerna also hired several Merck scientists who had been involved in developing the technologies its rival acquired as part of an intentional scheme to gain access to trade secrets and confidential information 
Alnylam in court papers filed in Middlesex County Superior Court said the scheme allowed Dicerna to develop  strikingly similar  technologies within a year and unjustly enriched the company by up to  325 million 
Dicerna denied the allegations  It filed a counterclaim alleging Alnylam was pursuing a frivolous lawsuit that improperly interfered with its funding sources and partnership opportunities in order to crush its smaller competitor 
Dicerna sought  42 2 million in damages  It also filed a related federal antitrust case against Alnylam  which is also being settled ",2018-04-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-biotech-companies-alnylam-dicerna-settle-trade-secrets-case-1406258,1406258
202824,424340,MRK,Shire bid marks Takeda s latest   and biggest   push for global status,news,"By Sam Nussey TOKYO  Reuters    Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd s  T 4502   64 billion bid for London listed rare disease specialist  Shire  Plc  L SHP  bolsters its credentials as Japan s most outward facing drugs firm  a mould breaking image that has been more than a decade in the making  Under chief executive Christophe Weber and his predecessor  Yasuchika Hasegawa  Takeda has cut its exposure to Japan  brought in expertise through overseas acquisitions and thrown open its leadership ranks to foreign talent  Some investors worry that Takeda  with only  4 3 billion in cash on hand for the Shire deal  may be overreaching  The company s shares dropped more than 7 percent on Wednesday after Shire said it was willing to recommend the offer to shareholders  and are down 18 percent since news of Takeda s interest in a deal became public in late March  But few argue that Takeda s management isn t ready to go global   Already only 30 percent of the company s drug sales come from Japan  and 70 percent of its workforce is based overseas  The Shire deal would radically accelerate that shift  adding more than  9 billion in U S  revenue   Takeda has been  is and will continue to be the truly international pharmaceutical company of Japanese origin   said Philippe Auvaro  Tokyo based president of rare disease specialist OrphanPacific Inc and a friend of Weber s  To get there  the company reshaped its corporate culture  along the way fending off a revolt against Hasegawa  who saw a focus on foreign business as the future  Takeda declined to make Weber or Hasegawa available for this story  Shire declined to comment   SHOCK TACTICS  Hasegawa was the architect of Takeda s shift  He took the company s reins from Kunio Takeda  the last member of the founding family to run the 237 year old drugmaker  Hasegawa was determined to look overseas for growth as well as leadership  His philosophy propelled the company onto its continent straddling path as it acquired U S  biotech business Millennium Pharmaceuticals in 2008 and Swiss drugmaker Nycomed in 2011  His pursuit of foreigners to fill Takeda s executive ranks cut against the grain of Japan s insular corporate world  The surprise decision to appoint Weber   then the company s chief operating officer   as his successor led to open revolt among some of Takeda s old guard  In 2014  more than 100 former executives and investors signed a letter of objection  calling Weber s appointment a  hijack by so called foreign capital    something that should never be allowed    But Hasegawa was unwavering  Acquisitions were essential if the drugmaker was to rebuild its pipeline as drugs lost patent protection  he told shareholders  Weber was the best choice to take Takeda s new products out into the world  he said   In the end  Weber s appointment sailed through the annual shareholders meeting  with more than 90 percent of the votes in favor   QUIET REVOLUTIONARY  At first glance  the mild mannered Weber might not seem the most likely choice to orchestrate the biggest overseas acquisition in Japanese history   But those who have worked with him praise his ability to convince others of the need for radical change  making him ideal for a company trying to expand globally   Peter Feldinger  who worked at Nycomed and Takeda before becoming a consultant  said the union of the two companies had stalled until Weber took charge   It was complicated to take an inherently old  conservative Japanese organization  and get it to understand the world had changed  he said   Brought up in the Alpine city of Annecy  the son of two doctors  Weber spent two decades at GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK   including a stint as head of its vaccines unit  He took over as chief executive in 2015 after joining Takeda a year earlier as chief operating officer  Hasegawa stayed on as chairman  using his position to act as a  shield  while Weber pushed through unpopular moves  said Tosh Nagate  formerly at Takeda and now chief executive of e Projection  a company that helps foreign drugmakers expand in Japan  Hasegawa stepped aside into an advisory role last year   One of the most difficult decisions was to reduce the number of research and development areas  The company also retrenched in two key sites  Boston and Shonan  southwest of Tokyo  Under Weber  Takeda s involvement in the Japanese market has continued to wane  The U S  now accounts for 35 percent of drug sales  but Takeda has promised to keep its headquarters in Japan  Weber has also been proactive in chasing down cross border deals  announcing the  5 20 billion purchase of U S  cancer drug maker Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc last year and Belgian biotech group TiGenix NV in January as it tries to rebuild its drug pipeline  While questions remain over whether Takeda overpaid for its past acquisitions  drugs on the market as a result are feeding stronger recent results   nL4N1PR2AM   ESCAPE VELOCITY Acquiring Shire would transform Takeda s position in rare diseases  gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience  where Shire is a leader in ADHD drugs   For now  many of its peers remain highly exposed to Japan  although a shrinking population and annual drug price revisions have encouraged them to consider overseas expansion plans of their own   Ono Pharmaceutical Co Ltd  T 4528   which co developed the blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo with Bristol Myers Squibb Co  N BMY   recently said it was looking to build its own sales network in the U S  and was considering acquisitions   Eisai Co Ltd  T 4523  favors a different approach  Last month it signed a deal to collaborate with Merck   Co Inc  N MRK  to develop and sell its cancer drug Lenvima  both alone and in combination with Merck s immunotherapy product  Keytruda   nL2N1QP262  Weber will be under pressure to prove his strategy is the right one   particularly as one of the best paid executives in Japan  His annual pay is more than 1 billion yen    Highly paid and saying he will stay on until 2025  it s possible he feels that he needs to do something big for his reputation as CEO   UBS analyst Atsushi Seki said   Complicating matters is that chief financial officer Costa Saroukos  who had overseen the finances of Takeda s Europe and Canada businesses  only started in his new role this month

202833,424349,MRK,U S  Northeast carbon market creating jobs  revenue  study,news,"By Nichola Groom
 Reuters    Nine states in the U S  Northeast have slashed greenhouse gas pollution  created thousands of jobs in clean energy  and cut consumer power costs using a market based scheme to slash carbon emissions  according to a study released on Tuesday 
The report on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative from Boston based consultancy Analysis Group comes as the Trump administration seeks to unwind federal efforts to fight climate change  arguing they would kill jobs and stifle growth 
The RGGI   a cap and trade scheme adopted in 2009   has provided its nine members  1 4 billion in net economic benefits since 2015  according to the study  It has generated more than 14 500 job years in the renewable energy and efficiency sectors  A job year is the equivalent of a full time job for a year 
Those benefits come in addition to a more than 50 percent cut in emissions of carbon dioxide in the region since the RGGI s inception   a trend aided by the retirement of aging fossil fuel power plants  cheap natural gas  and sluggish demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis 
 All of the states have benefited from an actual reduction in carbon emissions   Sue Tierney  a senior adviser with Analysis Group  said in an interview last week   From a monetary and economic point of view     consumers are a bit better off  
A report by the Congressional Research Service last year  however  said the RGGI program s direct impact on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions was  arguably negligible   in part because the region overall is responsible for just 7 percent of total U S  greenhouse gas emissions 
The RGGI system  which was meant as a model for other states and countries to join or replicate  seeks to encourage carbon cuts by requiring industries like power plants to acquire tradable permits to cover their emissions  Each year  fewer permits are made available by the states   creating an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon output 
The revenue from the permit sales has amounted to some  2 8 billion since 2009  The revenue goes to the member states  which then invest in programs that support energy efficiency  renewable energy and jobs training  according to the report 
Analysis Group said the permit costs had led some fossil fuel generators most affected to hike power prices  but that the states  investments in energy efficiency and renewables had more than compensated for that by reducing consumer demand  resulting in an overall decline in costs for electricity 
Wholesale power prices in New England averaged roughly  33 per megawatt hour in 2017  among the highest in the country  but still less than half the level in 2008 before RGGI was adopted  according to data from grid operator ISO New England

202856,424372,MRK,What To Expect From Sanofi s  SNY  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Sanofi   NASDAQ SNY   stock is down 1 8  in 2019 and has been volatile most of the year  Will this slight cumulative downtrend turn around after SNY reports Q2 earnings 
Overview
Sanofi is the fourth largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue  bringing in  40 9 billion last year  It is also the seventh largest by market share  with 4 11   Sanofi specializes in seven therapeutic areas  cardiovascular  central nervous system  diabetes  internal medicine  oncology  thrombosis  and vaccines  Its subsidiary  Sanofi Pasteur  is the largest dedicated vaccine producer in the world 
Sanofi s most popular medicines include Latnus  Placix and  Lovenox  Latnus is currently Sanofi s most successful drug  bringing about  4 9 billion in revenue last year  It is a drug that controls blood sugar in diabetics with a once daily injection  Lovenox and Placix are anti clotting and blood thinning drugs respectively 
Unknown to most  Sanofi also manufactures many popular over the counter brands  Products such as Gold Bond  Rolaids  Selsun Blue  and Allegra can all be found in drug stores across the country and are steady revenue streams for Sanofi 
On Wednesday  Sanofi acquired the OTC rights to popular flu medicine  Tamiflu  from competitor Roche  Sanofi is now attempting to get Tamiflu approved by the FDA for OTC sales  hoping to cash in on convenience  Roche  meanwhile  has another flu drug in the works called Zofluza  which the company says is faster acting and stronger than Tamiflu  Therefore  it looks like it will be a battle between the two companies to see if consumers will go through the extra hassle of getting a prescription for a stronger medicine  or just chose the quicker and easier access treatment 
Outlook
Our Zacks Consensus Estimate predicts Q2 revenue of  9 88 billion  a 1 24  bump over last year s Q2 sales  For each of the past four quarters  revenues have declined year over year by an average of 1 4   Hopefully  Sanofi can meet projections and have a positive quarter  which may boost SNY stock 
Although revenues have gone down the past few quarters  earnings have managed to stay in the black  Earnings have not been increasing greatly  however  with an average year over year jump of just 0 94  over the past 8 quarters  Earnings this quarter are projected to fall by 6 79  to  0 69  This estimate is  however  up from our  0 66 estimate 90 days ago 
Estimates for next quarter s EPS call for 5 61  growth to  1 13 a share  This would mark an all time high for the company  For all of 2019  estimates show just a 0 62  earnings increase from last year  Estimates also show 8 15  EPS growth for 2020  which would be the company s largest single year EPS growth since 2008 
Since the beginning of 2019  Sanofi s forward P E of 12 4x has dropped relative to its peer group  suggesting that it may currently be undervalued  Its peer group that includes Merck   NYSE MRK    GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK    AbbVie   NYSE ABBV    Pfizer   NYSE PFE    and others has an average forward P E of 14 29 

Recent News
The FDA accepted an application for approval of Sanofi s relapsed refractory multiple myeloma drug  isatuximab  This drug has undergone successful phase III trials and is still in other clinical trials to possibly treat other types of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors 
Sanofi has a strong pipeline in addition to isatuximab  It includes several new biologics and vaccines in late stage development  A promising pipeline is always important for drug companies  as investors need to see how strong the future of the company looks after current patents inevitably run out

202857,424373,MRK,Will Opdivo   Eliquis Drive Bristol Myers  BMY  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company  Its key oncology products are Opdivo  Sprycel  Yervoy and Empliciti  Beyond oncology  the company focuses on immunology and cardiovascular drugs like Orencia and Eliquis 
Bristol Myers  immuno oncology drug  Opdivo  is approved for multiple indications and is the primary growth driver  The drug is expected to maintain momentum in the second quarter  It generated sales of  1 8 billion in the first quarter  increasing 19  year over year  The uptake of the drug continues to be strong  particularly in new indications of first line renal cell carcinoma and adjuvant melanoma  The trend should continue in the second quarter despite stiff competition from the likes of Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda and Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq 
However  investors will also focus on recent pipeline setbacks  The phase III CheckMate 498 trial evaluating Opdivo plus radiation versus temozolomide plus radiation in patients with newly diagnosed O6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase  MGMT  unmethylated glioblastoma multiforme  GBM  did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival  OS  at final analysis 
Moreover  CheckMate 459  a randomized phase III study evaluating Opdivo compared to Nexavar as a first line treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   also did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint of OS 
Nevertheless  the performance of blood thinner drug  Eliquis  was strong in the first quarter  propelled by increased share in the novel oral anticoagulant  NOAC  market  and should boost sales in the second quarter   Oncology drug  Sprycel  should contribute positively to the top line  driven by recent label expansions 
Rheumatoid arthritis  RA  drug  Orencia  also contributes to the company s top line  The recent label expansion of the drug should further boost sales  Yervoy should also continue with its stellar performance in the second quarter 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter sales and earnings is pegged at  6 03 billion and  1 06  respectively 
Apart from the quarterly results  investors will also focus on further updates on the company s impending acquisition of Celgene Corp    NASDAQ CELG    Bristol Myers needs to sell one of Celgene s blockbuster drugs  Otezla  to complete the impending merger on a timely basis  in light of concerns expressed by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  
Bristol Myers  shares have decreased 17 7  in the year so far compared with the  s decline of 1 3

202858,424374,MRK,What To Expect From Sanofi s  SNY  Q2 Earnings  Revised ,opinion,"Sanofi   NASDAQ SNY   stock is down 1 8  in 2019 and has been volatile most of the year  Will this slight cumulative downtrend turn around after SNY reports Q2 earnings 
Overview
Sanofi is the fourth largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue  bringing in  40 9 billion last year  It is also the seventh largest by market share  with 4 11   Sanofi specializes in seven therapeutic areas  cardiovascular  central nervous system  diabetes  internal medicine  oncology  thrombosis  and vaccines  Its subsidiary  Sanofi Pasteur  is the largest dedicated vaccine producer in the world 
Sanofi s most popular medicines include Latnus  Placix and  Lovenox  Latnus is currently Sanofi s most successful drug  bringing about  4 9 billion in revenue last year  It is a drug that controls blood sugar in diabetics with a once daily injection  Lovenox and Placix are anti clotting and blood thinning drugs respectively 
Unknown to most  Sanofi also manufactures many popular over the counter brands  Products such as Gold Bond  Rolaids  Selsun Blue  and Allegra can all be found in drug stores across the country and are steady revenue streams for Sanofi 
On Wednesday  Sanofi acquired the OTC rights to popular flu medicine  Tamiflu  from competitor Roche  Sanofi is now attempting to get Tamiflu approved by the FDA for OTC sales  hoping to cash in on convenience  Roche  meanwhile  has another flu drug in the works called Xofluza  which the company says is faster acting and stronger than Tamiflu  Therefore  it looks like it will be a battle between the two companies to see if consumers will go through the extra hassle of getting a prescription for a stronger medicine  or just chose the quicker and easier access treatment 
Outlook
Our Zacks Consensus Estimate predicts Q2 revenue of  9 88 billion  a 1 24  bump over last year s Q2 sales  For each of the past four quarters  revenues have declined year over year by an average of 1 4   Hopefully  Sanofi can meet projections and have a positive quarter  which may boost SNY stock 
Although revenues have gone down the past few quarters  earnings have managed to stay in the black  Earnings have not been increasing greatly  however  with an average year over year jump of just 0 94  over the past 8 quarters  Earnings this quarter are projected to fall by 6 79  to  0 69  This estimate is  however  up from our  0 66 estimate 90 days ago 
Estimates for next quarter s EPS call for 5 61  growth to  1 13 a share  This would mark an all time high for the company  For all of 2019  estimates show just a 0 62  earnings increase from last year  Estimates also show 8 15  EPS growth for 2020  which would be the company s largest single year EPS growth since 2008 
Since the beginning of 2019  Sanofi s forward P E of 12 4x has dropped relative to its peer group  suggesting that it may currently be undervalued  Its peer group that includes Merck   NYSE MRK    GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK    AbbVie   NYSE ABBV    Pfizer   NYSE PFE    and others has an average forward P E of 14 29 

Recent News
The FDA accepted an application for approval of Sanofi s relapsed refractory multiple myeloma drug  isatuximab  This drug has undergone successful phase III trials and is still in other clinical trials to possibly treat other types of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors 
Sanofi has a strong pipeline in addition to isatuximab  It includes several new biologics and vaccines in late stage development  A promising pipeline is always important for drug companies  as investors need to see how strong the future of the company looks after current patents inevitably run out 
Bottom Line
Sanofi currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   due to upward earnings estimate revisions for this fiscal year and next  Sanofi likely won t report stellar earnings when it releases its quarterly results before the market opens on Monday  July 29  But with a strong pipeline in development and possible OTC Tamiflu boosting future revenues  Sanofi has strong potential to raise earnings over the coming quarters and into 2020

202880,424396,MRK,How Sanofi s setback could lead to better dengue vaccines,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO  Reuters    New dengue vaccines being developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd and U S  government scientists are poised to provide a safer alternative to Sanofi s Dengvaxia  according to vaccine experts  because they already take into account some of the issues that sidelined the product last year  Sanofi  PA SASY  revealed in November that Dengvaxia   the world s first dengue vaccine   might increase the risk of severe disease in people who had never been exposed to the virus  The news prompted an uproar in the Philippines  where more than 800 000 school age children had been vaccinated  Next generation vaccines by Japan s Takeda and the U S  National Institutes of Health  in conjunction with Brazil s Butantan Institute  are now in late stage testing   They both differ significantly from Dengvaxia  which may increase the chances for a stronger  more durable immune response  according to more than a dozen dengue experts interviewed by Reuters   They expressed especially high hopes for the NIH vaccine  which protected 100 percent of volunteers who received it in a small study   Merck  NYSE MRK    Co Inc holds an exclusive license for the NIH vaccine in the United States  Canada  China  Japan and the European Union  and plans to begin its own trials in the first half of 2018  It s too early to say whether either candidate will ultimately succeed  and experts await data from large  late stage clinical trials  And while Sanofi s early safety troubles may delay licensing of new vaccines for a few years as global regulators seek assurances from longer term data  the increased scrutiny should result in a better  safer product  they said   We ve learned a tremendous amount about dengue from the Sanofi vaccine   said Dr  Anna Durbin  a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who helped develop the NIH vaccine   There is hope the two candidates coming down the pike can provide the benefit of a good dengue vaccine without the risk   LESSONS LEARNED Dengue is the world s fastest growing infectious disease  afflicting up to 100 million people worldwide  causing half a million life threatening infections and killing up to 25 000 people  mostly children  each year  An effective vaccine could be worth more than  1 billion globally  according to industry analysts   There are four distinct types of dengue  A first infection with any one of them can increase the chances of severe disease when exposed to a second   Experts say an effective vaccine must protect against all four types at once  A weak response to one of them could act like a first infection and leave a person vulnerable to severe disease when exposed a second time  That is what appears to have happened with Sanofi s Dengvaxia  according to vaccine experts   It wasn t a uniformly high level of response to all four subtypes  of dengue  simultaneously   Dr  Anthony Fauci  director of the NIH s National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  said in an interview  Sanofi s late stage clinical trials  which were designed in 2009  only collected blood samples from 10 to 15 percent of study participants before they were vaccinated   As a result  it was impossible to know when the studies were published in 2015 whether risks were greater in children who had never been exposed to dengue  said Dr  Su Peing Ng  Sanofi s global medical head  in an interview  To answer this question  Sanofi developed a special test to re analyze its results  leading to the November 2017 disclosure    We ve been extremely transparent with our data   Ng said  adding that the company consulted with the field s leading experts as it was developing its vaccine  Clinical trials testing the two new vaccines both require blood samples for all participants before they are vaccinated so they can quickly identify any similar risks  Dr  Stephen Whitehead  who developed the NIH vaccine  said in a 2016 review that the long term follow up from Sanofi s studies  was instrumental in identifying safety concerns that are currently being investigated        IMMUNE RESPONSE Dengvaxia uses a widely effective yellow fever virus vaccine as its genetic backbone  To induce an immune response to dengue  certain yellow fever genes were swapped out for dengue genes   It seemed like a bright idea 20 years ago   said dengue expert Dr  Scott Halstead  an adjunct professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda  Maryland  In hindsight  Halstead said  simply splicing select dengue genes into a yellow fever vaccine may not present enough of the virus to the immune system to induce full protection  Instead of yellow fever  Takeda s vaccine  TAK 003  is based on a weakened version of a live dengue 2 virus    We ve taken a dengue 2 virus backbone and inserted elements of dengue 1  3 and 4   said Dr  Rajeev Venkayya  president of Takeda s global vaccine business unit  That s important  Venkayya said   because it exposes an individual that is immunized to a broad range of proteins on the outside and the inside of the virus  which allows individuals to generate a broad immune response   Data published in November in Lancet Infectious Diseases showed Takeda s vaccine produced responses against all four virus types  regardless of previous dengue exposure  There were no safety concerns   Takeda s vaccine is being tested in 20 000 children aged 4 to 16 in Asia and Latin America  Initial data are expected in late 2018  Venkayya said the company s research has shown the vaccine  given in two doses  can produce both antibodies to dengue as well as a second type of response in which immune cells   known as CD8 positive T cells   recognize and kill virus infected cells  Several researchers suspect exposure to the full spectrum of dengue proteins is key to developing a fully protective vaccine   Johns Hopkins  Durbin said the presence of T cells triggered by non structural proteins in dengue 2 could help clear the virus before people become sick  But  like Sanofi s Dengvaxia  the Takeda vaccine appears to produce an unbalanced antibody response  with the highest protection offered against dengue 2   In a July 2017 paper published in Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology  Halstead said that it is also not clear whether Takeda s vaccine will provoke T cell immunity to the other three dengue viruses  clouding its potential to succeed  The NIH vaccine  called TV003 TV005  also features weakened versions of live dengue  but three of the four components   dengue 1  3 and 4   are based on whole dengue viruses  The fourth component is based on a dengue 4 backbone with dengue 2 genes spliced in   It has been shown to provoke a strong antibody response to all four types of dengue in a single shot  as well as producing T cell immunity   It appears to be a true  protective  one dose vaccine   Halstead said  Brazil s non profit Butantan Institute is testing the vaccine in some 17 000 participants in 14 areas with widespread dengue

202892,424408,MRK,Global business group  lit a flame  for long term U N  goals  chair,news,"By Alister Doyle
OSLO  Reuters    Many companies are looking past quarterly results to discover long term economic opportunities in U N  goals to end poverty and protect the planet  the head of an international business commission has said 
Mark Malloch Brown s Business and Sustainable Development Commission has contacted 1 500 CEOs over two years to persuade them that embracing development can boost their bottom line  and will wrap up its work at the Davos World Economic Forum on Tuesday 
 We feel we ve lit a flame here   said Malloch Brown  a British former U N  deputy secretary general who will now spearhead campaigning to keep Britain in the European Union 
His 37 strong group included leaders of firms such as  Unilever   LON ULVR   Merck  NYSE MRK   Mars   Alibaba   NYSE BABA   Safaricom and  Aviva   LON AV  as well as academics and civil society leaders  urging businesses to adopt U N  goals for 2030 such as ending poverty and hunger and to slow climate change 
In a report last year  the commission said companies could unlock at least  12 trillion in market opportunities by 2030 and create up to 380 million jobs by focusing on transport  energy  cities  agriculture  food and health 
Malloch Brown told Reuters the biggest barrier was CEOs  mindsets 
 CEOs are still terribly preoccupied by quarterly results   he said   The hardest argument is to persuade them to persuade their shareholders to let them think   at least in a portion of their business   in the long term  
Companies such as Unilever and Mars found it was much better to pay African farmers fair  stable prices for cocoa and focus on quality chocolate rather than risk putting farmers out of business with low prices  he said 
And insurer Aviva is developing benchmarks so that investors  can judge whether a company is having an impact  in terms of the sustainable development goals  he said 
Another initiative was to develop more  blended finance  for the global development goals involving both public and private sources 
Malloch Brown said construction firms could tap a vast market for low cost houses in cities such as Mumbai or Lagos rather than building a  few mansions in Weybridge   a prosperous English town 
Commission member Amy Jadesimi  managing director of Nigeria s Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base  said the opportunities in emerging economies were huge

202893,424409,MRK,Glaxo s Two Drug HIV Pill Dovato On Par With Three Drug Pill,opinion,"GlaxoSmithKline plc s   NYSE GSK   HIV subsidiary  ViiV Healthcare  announced that the late stage study  evaluating its newly approved single tablet two drug HIV regimen of Dovato met the primary endpoint  The phase III TANGO study assessed the antiviral efficacy and safety of switching to Dovato in HIV 1 infected patients  who are virally suppressed and stable on a three drug tenofovir alafenamide fumarate TAF based regimen 
The 48 week data from the study showed that Dovato was non inferior in maintaining viral suppression in such patients compared with the TAF containing  three drug regimen  thereby achieving the study s primary goal  This suggests that such patients can maintain viral suppression if they change to the two drug regimen from the three drug  TAF containing regimen  thereby reducing their pill burden  The study also confirmed that no patients met virologic withdrawal criteria or developed any treatment resistance in the Tivicay plus Epivir arm 
Glaxo plans to present these results at the International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Science to be held later in July  ViiV Healthcare is majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer   NYSE PFE   
Shares of Glaxo have increased 6 6  so far this year  outperforming the rise of 1 9  

 
Dovato  a single tablet regimen ofGlaxo s HIV drugs   Tivicay  dolutegravir  50 mg    Epivir  lamivudine    for treatment na ve HIV patients  was approved in the United States during April this year and in the EU this month 
HIV is a key therapeutic area for Glaxo with successful dolutegravir based regimens  namely Tivicay  Triumeq and Juluca in its portfolio  HIV sales totaled  1 1 billion in the first quarter of 2019  The metric increased 4  at CER on the back of 7  growth in dolutegravir franchise  Triumeq and Tivicay and Juluca   which partly offset lower sales of the established HIV products

Esperoct is the brand name for turoctocog alfa pegol  N8 GP  The efficacy and safety evaluation was based on the results from the largest pre registration clinical program conducted in haemophilia A  with inclusion of 270 previously treated people  PTPs  with severe haemophilia A and more than 5 years of clinical exposure 
Esperoct has been found effective in treating severe haemophilia A through a simple fixed dosing regimen of one injection every four days in adults and adolescents or every 3 4 days  twice weekly  in children  The drug is also found to be effective in controlling bleeding episodes and perioperative management with no acute safety concerns 
The marketing authorization for the use of Esperoct treads on the heels of the positive opinion given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  under the European Medicines Agency  EMA  in April 2019 
Shares of Novo Nordisk have increased 12 2  year to date compared with the  7 8  growth 

 
In February 2019  Novo Nordisk announced the FDA s approval of its biologics license application  BLA  for Esperoct to treat adults and children with haemophilia A  In the United States  Esperoct is indicated for use in adults and minors with haemophilia A   using routine prophylaxis   to reduce bleeding episode frequency as well as on demand for controlling bleeding episodes and the perioperative management of bleeding

202918,424434,MRK,Bristol Myers To Sell Otezla For Celgene Merger  Shares Down ,opinion,"Shares of Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   declined 7 42  after it announced plans to divest one of Celgene Corporation s   NASDAQ CELG   blockbuster drugs  Otezla  to complete the impending merger  The company also announced dismal results from a liver cancer study 
Bristol Myers is planning to divest plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis drug  Otezla  to be able to close the acquisition on a timely basis in light of concerns expressed by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  
We remind investors that the company has tyrosine kinase 2  TYK2  inhibitor  BMS 986165  in its pipeline  which is being evaluated in several autoimmune diseases  including psoriasis  The regulatory agency was concerned about a possible overlap between Otezla and BMS 986165 in the pipeline 
Hence  Bristol Myers decided to sell Otezla 
However  investors were clearly disappointed by the decision as Otezla raked in more than  1 6 billion of sales in 2018 and was one of the key growth drivers for Celgene  while BMS 986165 is still in development   Sales of the drug are expected to come in around  1 9 billion in 2019 and retaining the same would have enabled Bristol Myers to develop a strong inflammation portfolio along with its rheumatoid arthritis drug  Orencia 
Moreover  the impending acquisition will be delayed as the company now expects to complete the merger by the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020  assuming the FTC accepts the consent order and other customary closing conditions are satisfied 
The divestiture is subject to further review by the FTC and requires Bristol Myers to enter a consent decree with the commission  The proceeds of the divestiture will allow the company to accelerate its post closing deleveraging plans 
On the other hand  Bristol Myers might not be able to sell Otezla at a lucrative price  given the regulatory constraints 
Shares of the company have lost 12 2  in the year so far against the  s growth of 4 3  

 
We remind investors that in January 2019  Bristol Myers announced that it will acquire Celgene for  74 billion to boost its oncology portfolio  given the stiff competition for Opdivo from the likes Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  However  the acquisition has hit a few road blocks  with a few large shareholders of Bristol Myers opposing the merger 
The shareholders thought it to be risky and may add significant debt to the balance sheet  Moreover  Celgene s growth driving oncology drug  Revlimid  is expected to lose patent protection soon  The acquisition was finally given a green signal a couple of months back 
The divestiture of the drug also puts question mark on the targeted synergies and anticipated sales of the combined company  per Bristol Myers 
Concurrently  it announced that a randomized phase III study CheckMate 459  evaluating Opdivo versus Bayer s   OTC BAYRY   Nexavar as a first line treatment  in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC  failed  Nevertheless  Opdivo is being studied by the company across multiple settings and lines of therapy for HCC  including as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting and in combination with Yervoy  ipilimumab  for previously treated patients

203010,424526,MRK,Trump yields to pressure  calls neo Nazis and KKK criminals,news,"By Scott Malone and Jeff Mason CHARLOTTESVILLE  Va  WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump denounced neo Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan as criminals and thugs on Monday  bowing to mounting political pressure to condemn such groups explicitly after a white nationalist rally turned deadly in Virginia  Trump had been assailed from across the political spectrum for failing to respond more forcefully to Saturday s violence in Charlottesville  The head of one of the world s biggest drug companies quit a presidential business panel as a result  saying he was taking a stand against intolerance and extremism  Critics slammed Trump for waiting too long to address the bloodshed  and for initially denouncing hatred and violence  on many sides   rather than singling out the white supremacists widely seen as instigating the melee  Democrats said Trump s reaction belied a reluctance to alienate white nationalists and  alt right  political activists who occupy a loyal segment of Trump s political base  Several senators from his own Republican Party had harsh words for him  Some 48 hours into the biggest domestic challenge of his young presidency  Trump tried to correct course   Racism is evil  and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs  including the KKK  neo Nazis  white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans   the president said in a statement to reporters at the White House on Monday   We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred  bigotry and violence   he said  A 20 year old man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies was arrested on charges of plowing his car into protesters opposing the white nationalists  killing 32 year old paralegal Heather Heyer and injuring 19 other people  The accused  James Fields  was denied bail at a court hearing on Monday  Trump said anyone who engaged in criminal behavior at the rally would face justice  the Republican president said   I wish that he would have said those same words on Saturday   responded Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia on MSNBC   I m disappointed it took him a couple of days   A group of local community leaders meeting in Charlottesville likewise said they were unimpressed by Trump s latest message   Why did it take criticism from his Republican buddies to move him     to adjust the moral compass that he does not possess   said Don Gathers  who serves as chairman for the city s commission on monuments and memorials   Trump lashed out at his critics again later on Monday on Twitter   Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the  Fake News Media will never be satisfied   truly bad people    As the chorus of outrage over Virginia grew louder on Sunday  Trump stayed silent on the matter while at his golf course in Bedminster  New Jersey  Early Monday  he took to Twitter   his preferred method of communication   to attack Democrats over trade deals and to endorse a political candidate in Alabama  but said nothing about white supremacists   In a strong rebuke to Trump early on Monday  the black chief executive of Merck  NYSE MRK    Co Inc  Kenneth Frazier  resigned from a business panel led by the president  saying expressions of hatred and bigotry must be rejected  Trump quickly hit back on Twitter  but made no reference to Frazier s reasons for quitting the panel  instead revisiting a longstanding gripe about expensive medicines  Frazier would now have more time to focus on lowering  ripoff  drug prices  Trump tweeted  GLOBAL REACTION  The jarring images of violence from Charlottesville and the heated public debate over racism resonated around the world  particularly in Europe where leaders are contending with a wave of xenophobia   German Chancellor Angela Merkel told local broadcaster Phoenix on Monday that clear and forceful action must be taken to counter right wing extremism  and that  we have quite a lot to do at home ourselves   About 130 people demonstrated outside the U S  Embassy in London  some with placards reading  Fascism is not to be debated  it is to be smashed   and  I am an ashamed American   The United Nations said there must be no place in today s societies for the violent racism  anti Semitism  xenophobia and discrimination on display in Charlottesville  About 200 protesters assembled in front of the White House for a  Reject White Supremacy  rally  then marched to Trump s hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue nearby  In Manhattan  thousands of demonstrators stood outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue shouting  No Trump  no KKK  no fascist USA   Saturday s disturbances broke out after white nationalists converged to protest at plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E  Lee  Such monuments are viewed today by many Americans as symbols of racism  because of the Confederate defense of slavery during the Civil War  Asked on Monday whether one side was more responsible for the violence than another  Charlottesville police chief Al Thomas said   This was an alt right rally     using the term to describe a loose grouping that rejects mainstream politics and includes neo Nazis  white supremacists and anti Semites   Mounting anger over Trump s response to events in Charlottesville added to a litany of problems for the president   His inflammatory rhetoric toward North Korea s nuclear ambitions rattled Americans and U S  allies even as he publicly fumed at fellow Republicans in Congress over their failure to notch up any major legislative wins during his first six months in office  The mother of the woman killed on Saturday welcomed Trump s latest comments  In a statement cited by NBC News  Susan Bro thanked him for what she called  those words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred   Fields appeared in a Charlottesville court on Monday by video link from the jail where he was being held on a second degree murder charge  three counts of malicious wounding and a single count of leaving the scene of a fatal accident  His next court date was set for Aug  25  Several students who attended high school with Fields in Kentucky described him as an angry young man who passionately espoused white supremacist ideology  The U S  Justice Department was pressing its own federal investigation of the incident as a hate crime  Also on Monday  in what critics decried as an official endorsement of racism  Trump told Fox News he is considering pardoning Joe Arpaio  the former Arizona sheriff found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case

The company received a major boost with the approval of a tablet formulation of cabozantinib  Cabometyx  which was approved in the United States in April 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC   who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy 
Since the drug is now approved for first line RCC as well  Exelixis can now target the entire patient population suffering from the disease in the United States  Cabometyx continues to maintain its market leading position in RCC  The drug held 34  market share at the end of the fourth quarter  driven by its broad label for advanced RCC and the recent NCCN update as the preferred TKI for the majority of both previously untreated and refractory RCC patients  The company experienced a 10  increase in Cabometyx s prescriber base compared with that in the third quarter 
Exelixis is evaluating cabozantinib in a broad development program  comprising more than 45 clinical studies across multiple indications  In January 2019  the FDA also approved Cabometyx for hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   Per estimates  more than 40 000 patients are diagnosed with liver cancer  resulting in approximately 29 000 deaths each year in the United States  Sales should get a boost from this label expansion  given the market potential 
Exelixis also has collaboration agreements with Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   and Roche   OTC RHHBY   to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents 
While the RCC market holds immense potential  competition is stiff  The approval of Opdivo and Yervoy for the treatment of poor and intermediate risk first line RCC has increased competition for Cabometyx 
The FDA recently granted priority review to Merck s   NYSE MRK   sBLA for Keytruda in combination with Inlyta for the first line treatment of patients with advanced RCC  based on the results of KEYNOTE 426  The agency has set a target action date of Jun 20  2019 
Hence  we expect investors to focus on Cabometyx s performance in 2019  which is expected to be backed by a broad label

203040,424556,MRK,Bristol Myers  Celgene Buyout Still Uncertain Amid Opposition,opinion,Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   is facing strong criticism from activist investors for the proposed acquisition of another large pharmaceutical company  Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG    Bristol Myers investors have expressed multiple concerns related to growth of the company following the merger We remind investors that Bristol Myers  in January that it will acquire Celgene for an equity value of approximately  74 billion or more than  90 billion including debt  The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019 Bristol Myers  stockholder  Starboard Value LP  has urged all shareholders to support its proposal to vote against the deal Starboard Value has posted a presentation on its website detailing the reasons for its opposition  In late February  the investment firm had informed all shareholders of Bristol Myers in a letter about its intention to oppose the mega acquisition  The investment firm has requested all shareholders to vote against the acquisition deal at the Special Meeting of Bristol Myers scheduled to be held on Apr 12  2019 Wellington Management Company  one of the top stakeholders  is also not supportive of the proposed acquisition and had informed the same to the board of Bristol Myers in February Bristol Myers  ExpectationsBristol Myers expects the combined entity to generate more than  45 billion in cash flow over the first three full years post closing and cost synergies of approximately  2 5 billion by 2022  Moreover  Bristol Myers expects the acquisition to be 40  accretive to the bottom line on a standalone basis in the first full year after closing The company expects the merged entity to have a market leading oncology portfolio in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies led by Opdivo and Yervoy along with Revlimid and Pomalyst  The cardiovascular  immunology and inflammation franchise will be strengthened with the presence of Eliquis  Orencia and Otezla  respectively  Moreover  the entity will also have a deep pipeline including six expected near term product launches with potential sales of  15 billion Starboard s ArgumentStarboard Value believes that the deal is overpriced  The investment firm believes that the acquisition of Celgene will increase shareholders  risk significantly without generating enough rewards  It believes that initiatives for cost management within the standalone Bristol Myers will produce better returns than the proposed acquisition Starboard Value stated that Celgene has produced only three blockbuster products in 15 years  which raises concerns about Bristol Myers  assumption of significantly higher number of new blockbuster products in lesser time from Celgene s current pipeline  Moreover  Celgene s major revenue generator drug  Revlimid  will lose patent protection in 2026  which is likely to dent its sales The investment firm has also raised questions on Bristol Myers  current management as the company s share price has been on a decline over the past three years and it has underperformed other large pharmaceutical peers Starboard Value believes that the abovementioned factors along with several others stated in the presentation makes the deal look bad  It also believes that there can be better alternatives than the proposed acquisition to fuel growth at Bristol Myers Our TakeBristol Myers was on the lookout for an acquisition for quite some time now to bolster its portfolio  The company s top drug  Opdivo  has fallen behind Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda in capturing market share in the anti PD 1 PD L1 category  Moreover  competition is rising in the category with the presence of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq  Both Keytruda and Tecentriq are approved for first line non small cell lung cancer   NSCLC    which has the largest patient population among all cancer indications Meanwhile  Opdivo is yet to gain approval for the same indication  which is denting its prospects  In January  Bristol Myers had withdrawn a label expansion application for Opdivo seeking its approval in combination with Yervoy in first line NSCLC However  sales of Opdivo grew substantially in 2018  Moreover  cardiovascular drug  Eliquis is witnessing strong growth  Sales growth of Celgene s Revlimid also remained impressive  While Revlimid generated global sales of  9 7 billion in 2018  Opdivo and Eliquis together recorded sales of  13 2 billion  Total product revenues of both the companies was  36 8 billion in 2018  The current product sales of both the companies and a strong growth rate of major drugs are positives that back the deal  However  successful development of pipeline into several blockbuster products will be necessary for long term growth Although the acquisition will enable Bristol Myers to diversify its portfolio and looks positive prima facie  any acquisition of this magnitude comes with its own set of integration risks  The deal will also add considerable debt to Bristol Myers  balance sheet With rising opposition from stakeholders the future of the deal is getting blurred  However  outcome of the Special Meeting is likely to provide a view of all shareholders  which will decide the future of the deal Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  wouldn t you like

203067,424583,MRK,Endo  ENDP  Q4 Earnings   Revenues Beat Estimates  Shares Up,opinion,"Shares of Endo International plc   NASDAQ ENDP   increased 6 2  after the company reported better than expected results for fourth quarter 2018 
Endo s stock has lost 13 1  in the past three months Endo International plc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Earnings of 75 cents easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents  However  earnings declined from 77 cents recorded in the year ago quarter 
Revenues came in at  786 4 million in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  744 2 million and increasing 2  from the year ago quarter s figure  This increase was primarily attributable to continued strong growth in the U S  Branded   Sterile Injectables segment and the Specialty Products portfolio of our U S  Branded   Specialty   Established Pharmaceuticals segment 
Quarterly Highlights
Endo now has four reportable business segments   1  U S  Generic Pharmaceuticals   2  U S  Branded   Specialty   Established Pharmaceuticals   3  U S  Branded Sterile Injectables and  4  International Pharmaceuticals 
U S  Generic Pharmaceuticals recorded sales of  263 8 million in the quarter  down 13  due to competitive pressures in the generic business 
U S  Branded Pharmaceuticals  Specialty   Established Pharmaceuticals  sales were up 1  to  229 8 million  driven by continued strong growth of Specialty Products portfolio  offset by ongoing generic competition in Established Products portfolio  Specialty Products revenues increased 15  to  143 million  driven by the continued strong performance of Xiaflex  Sales of Xiaflex increased 30  to  80 million  owing to underlying volume growth in both Peyronie s Disease and Dupuytren s Contracture indications  and a benefit from the timing of shipments compared to prior year 
Earlier  Endo reported positive results from two phase III trials of collagenase clostridium histolyticum  CCH  for the treatment of cellulite in the buttocks  The results demonstrated that subjects receiving CCH showed highly statistically significant levels of improvement in the appearance of cellulite with treatment  as measured by the trial s primary endpoint 
U S  Branded Sterile Injectables  sales of  259 1 million was up 32   driven by strong growth of Adrenalin and Vasostrict  In July  the segment launched ertapenem for injection  the authorized generic of Merck s   NYSE MRK   Invanz  which boosted sales 
Endo has decided to terminate its previously announced acquisition of Somerset Therapeutics  LLC  a New Jersey based specialty pharmaceutical company  and the business of its India based affiliate Wintac Limited  which operates as Somerset Therapeutics  contract developer and manufacturer  The decision was taken as certain regulatory approvals in India took longer than anticipated and the company lacks clarity on when those approvals could be received 
Earlier  Endo also entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Nevakar  a specialty pharmaceutical company developing multiple assets in the ophthalmic and injectable areas  Both companies have collaborated for the development of five differentiated  sterile injectable products in the United States and Canada  While Nevakar will develop and seek FDA approval for these products  Endo s Par Pharmaceuticals Sterile Products division will launch and distribute them upon approval 
The International Pharmaceuticals division generated sales of  34 million  down from  41 million in the year ago quarter due to recent divestitures  Endo sold Mexican subsidiary  Somar to Advent International in October 2017  Endo also sold its South African subsidiary  Litha Healthcare Group in July 2017 
2018 Results
Endo s revenues came in at  2 9 billion  down 15  from 2017  but were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Earnings per share of  2 89 were down from  3 84 in 2017 and easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 73  
2019 Outlook
Endo expects revenues between  2 76 billion and  2 96 billion in 2019  The company expects Xiaflex s full year revenues to grow mid to high teens 
Branded Sterile Injectables revenues are now expected to grow high single to low double digits  U S  Generics revenues are projected to decline mid to high teens  International Pharmaceuticals  revenues are estimated to decline approximately 20  due to the impact of generic competition in the business in Canada 
The company anticipates earnings from continuing operations to be  2 00  2 25 per share 
Our Take
Endo s fourth quarter results were positive as the company beat on both earnings and sales  The last year was a transitional year for Endo as it transformed its legacy branded pharmaceutical business  which was primarily focused on pain management  into a highly focused branded specialty pharmaceutical business in the United States 
The company has divested its non core assets and businesses  and repositioned its generics business in the United States by executing a comprehensive product portfolio and manufacturing footprint rationalization initiative 
However  the guidance wasn t impressive as the company expects continued competitive pressure for the generic business  The huge level of debt is a concern   Moreover  response rates from the CCH trials did not impress the investors earlier

The study did not meet the primary endpoint of PFS in the entire study population as well as the pre specified subset of patients with high FR  expression

Although the study did show that in the entire study population  the confirmed overall response rate was higher for mirvetuximab soravtansine than for chemotherapy  there was no significant difference in PFS 
The overall response rate for the company s treatment was higher than the study in which patients were treated with chemotherapy  However  there was no significant difference in overall survival rates  
The company will further assess data from the FORWARD I study to determine potential future steps with a monotherapy approach 
Further  the company said that mirvetuximab combination regimens will continue to be evaluated in ongoing studies as an independent path forward to support a registration in ovarian cancer  Combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine in ovarian cancer are being evaluated in the phase Ib II FORWARD II study 
The FORWARD II study consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Avastin and Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  Preliminary data presented in October 2018 showed that mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Keytruda achieved encouraging anti tumor activity  especially in patients with medium or high FR  expression levels 
In June 2018  the FDA granted Fast Track designation to mirvetuximab soravtansine asa single agent therapy for the treatment of patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer whose tumors express high or medium levels of FR  and who have received up to three prior treatment regimens  Mirvetuximab soravtansine enjoys Orphan Drug status in both the United States and EU for the treatment of ovarian cancer ImmunoGen  Inc  Price

203097,424613,MRK,WHO confirms second Ebola case in Congo outbreak,news,"By Aaron Ross
KINSHASA  Reuters    The World Health Organization  WHO  confirmed on Sunday a second case of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo after an outbreak this week of 17 other suspected cases 
Health officials are trying to trace 125 people thought to be linked to the cases identified in the remote northeastern province of Bas Uele province in northeastern Congo near the border with Central African Republic  WHO s Congo spokesman Eugene Kabambi said 
Three people have so far died among the 19 suspected and confirmed cases  he added 
It was not immediately clear how the first victim  a deceased male  caught the virus  although past outbreaks have been linked to contact with infected bush meat such as apes

203115,424631,MRK,Inovio s Early Mid Stage Vaccine Pipeline Exhibits Growth,opinion,"On Jan 25  we issued an updated research report on Inovio Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ INO   
Inovio s most advanced candidate  VGX 3100 vaccine  has been progressing well alongside other promising pipeline candidates in its portfolio 
VGX 3100 is currently being evaluated in a phase III study  REVEAL 1  for the treatment of cervical dysplasia  caused by human papillomavirus  HPV   The company expects to complete enrollment in REVEAL 1 study by early 2019 and initiate the REVEAL 2 study thereafter  Another phase II study is examining the efficacy of VGX 3100 on women with vulvar dysplasia and anal dysplasia  This will be the third indication that VGX 3100 will be evaluated for 
Last August  Inovio announced a partnership with the AIDS Malignancy Consortium to evaluate VGX 3100 for treating HPV associated precancerous conditions in patients  who have tested positive for HIV 
Shares of Inovio have increased 5 2  in the past year against the  decrease of 23 9  

Inovio out licensed MEDI0457 to MedImmune  a subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc   NYSE AZN    MEDI0457 is a combination of VGX 3100 and its DNA based IL 12 cytokine 
Inovio is set to receive an undisclosed milestone payment from AstraZeneca as the latter dosed the first patient in a phase II study on T cell activating immunotherapy  MEDI0457  The program will evaluate MEDI0457 in combination with AstraZeneca s anti PD L1 checkpoint inhibitor  Imfinzi  for treating several HPV related cancers 
Apart from VGX 3100  Inovio has several vaccine candidates in its pipeline under early to mid stage development 
Earlier this month  Inovio initiated the first human study of its DNA encoded monoclonal antibody  dMAb  technology to prevent Zika virus infection in collaboration with The Wistar Institute and the University of Pennsylvania  The phase I dose escalation study on INO A002 demonstrated safety and tolerability  starting at lower level and then gradually increasing the doses 
Last week  Inovio announced that a second patient with HPV related head and neck cancer treated with INO 3112 in a phase I analysis achieved a sustained complete response after subsequent treatment with a PD 1 checkpoint inhibitor  The complete responder received Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  a PD 1 inhibitor  after being administered with INO 3112  The first complete responder received Bristol Myers Squibb s   NYSE BMY   Opdivo after the vaccine 
Inovio is developing a vaccine for Ebola virus  INO 4212   The vaccine provided 100  protection following a lethal dose in a preclinical study and prompted long term immune responses in monkeys 
Inovio s INO 4700 vaccine is being co developed by GeneOne Life Science Inc for MERS  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome   The company expects to begin a phase II probe on MERS vaccine in the Middle East during 2019  Inovio and GeneOne Life Science also dosed the first patient in a phase I investigation on its hepatitis C vaccine  GLS 6150  to boost immunity in patients 
Inovio is evaluating its HIV vaccine  Pennvax GP s  in a phase I II study and dosed the first patient with the same  The vaccine targets all major HIV strains with potential capacity to improve the human immune system and control HIV without antiretroviral therapy 
Inovio has collaboration with a few big pharma companies  which help it with constant funding for pipeline development  However  Inovio has no approved product in its portfolio  Hence  an excessive dependence on its partners for developing its pipeline candidates remains an overhang on the company

203142,424658,MRK,New budget test puts UK on front line in global drug price fight,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    Can society afford modern medicines  It s a question facing governments worldwide and nowhere more so than in Britain  where a new budget test due to take effect on April 1 threatens to throw up another hurdle to patients getting the drugs  For the last 18 years Britain has led the way in measuring drug cost effectiveness in a rational and dispassionate way  using a model of economic benefits developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  NICE   NICE has inspired copycat agencies across Europe   and in countries as diverse as South Korea and Mexico   giving it an influence beyond Britain s 3 percent slice of global drug sales  Now  however  the original system is struggling and patient charities and drugmakers are alarmed  especially given the wider funding uncertainties facing the National Health Service  NHS   which offers free care at the point of delivery  The new rules mean drugs costing NHS England more than 20 million pounds   25 million  a year will no longer get automatic funding  even if they are cost effective   Instead  firms will have to haggle to get them used  resulting in a potential delay of three years  Peter Johnson  professor of medical oncology at the University of Southampton  fears his patients may lose out on a wave of costly new immunotherapy drugs that are starting to transform treatment   Just when we are seeing an increase in the pace of progress with these drugs  I m worried that this country is going to be unnecessarily slowed down by the new affordability cap   he told Reuters  Since immune system boosting drugs like Merck  NYSE MRK    Co s Keytruda  Bristol Myers Squibb s Opdivo and Roche s Tecentriq can be used against a wide range of cancers  their budget impact will be significant   Almost all these new cancer drugs will hit the 20 million pounds ceiling very quickly indeed  particularly when they are used for common cancers like lung cancer   said Johnson  who also acts as chief clinician for Cancer Research UK  Meeting rising demand from medical advances and aging populations is a universal problem  whether healthcare is funded by UK style general taxation  compulsory social insurance common in western Europe or private insurance as in the United States  But NICE is unusual in putting a clear number on the benefit it expects from new drugs  using quality adjusted life years  QALYs   where one QALY equals a year of perfect health or two years of middling health  Its basic cost effectiveness threshold is up to 30 000 pounds per QALY and in future it wants to incentivize drugmakers to come in below 10 000 pounds by offering rapid approval for  exceptional value  products  NICE data  however  shows only 10 to 15 percent of the drugs it approves currently meet this lower cost effectiveness hurdle  RESPONSIBLE PRICING Carole Longson  director of NICE s center for health technology evaluation  says the onus is on drugmakers to price medicines responsibly   Given the pace of technological innovation  the demands of people who need healthcare and the return on investments that shareholders wish for  the system is struggling   she said  In some cases that may mean phasing payments  rather than simply cutting prices  when treatments like cancer immunotherapy or gene therapy offer long lasting benefits   We need to find ways to structure the budget impact   she said in an interview  NICE s QALY thresholds have long provoked controversy and complaints among drugmakers whose products have fallen on the wrong side of the equation  yet the system has stood the test of time  albeit with tweaks such as looser requirements for end of life care  The new budget test  however  is  a kind of fudge   said Karl Claxton  a health economist at the University of York  who served on NICE s appraisal committee from 1999 to 2012   As a result of trying to put patches on all of this  we end up with a very confusing and rather arbitrary approach   he said  The upheaval comes at a tricky time for the government  which is about to trigger proceedings to leave the European Union but wants to encourage investment by pharmaceutical firms  which account for a fifth of all UK business R D spending

203143,424659,MRK,The cost of cancer  new drugs show success at a steep price,news,"By Deena Beasley  Reuters    Newer cancer drugs that enlist the body s immune system are improving the odds of survival  but competition between them is not reining in prices that can now top  250 000 a year  The drugs  success for patients is the result of big bets in cancer therapy made by Bristol Myers Squibb Co  Merck  NYSE MRK    Co Inc and Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG  among others in big pharma  The industry s pipeline of cancer drugs expanded by 63 percent between 2005 and 2015  according to the QuintilesIMS Institute  and a good number are reaching the market  The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold globally to  75 8 billion by 2022 from  16 9 billion in 2015  according to research firm GlobalData  For a graphic  click   For cancer drugs in general     it is hard for us to drive down cost   said Steve Miller  chief medical officer at Express Scripts Holding Co  the nation s largest manager of drug benefit plans for employers and insurers   You don t want to be in the position of being told to use the second best cancer drug for your child   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle  as well as President Donald Trump  have been grappling with how to restrain rising prescription drug costs  They have talked about solutions ranging from more price negotiation to faster approval of new drugs  often invoking increased competition between drugmakers   Competition is key to lowering drug prices   Trump told pharmaceutical executives at an Oval Office meeting in January  But that is not happening with new drugs called checkpoint inhibitors that work by releasing a molecular brake  allowing the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way it fights infections caused by bacteria or viruses   For cancers like melanoma  the treatments can mean long term survival for around 20 percent of patients  Bristol s Yervoy  first approved in 2011  targets a protein known as CTLA 4  Other immunotherapies  including Bristol s Opdivo  Keytruda from Merck  Roche s Tecentriq  and  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  Inc s Bavencio  involve a different protein called PD 1  Other targets are being explored  Some new data will be presented this week in Washington at the American Association for Cancer Research s annual meeting  Current checkpoint inhibitors each have a list price near  150 000 a year  A combination of Yervoy and Opdivo  approved by the Food and Drug Administration for advanced or inoperable melanoma  has a cost of  256 000 a year for patients who respond to the treatment  Similar immunotherapies are in development at companies like AstraZeneca Plc  Merck  which declined to comment on pricing plans  expects an FDA decision by May 10 on its combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy as an initial treatment for the most common form of lung cancer   by far the biggest market for cancer drugs  Pfizer said Bavencio  cleared by the FDA earlier this month to treat Merkel cell carcinoma  a rare type of skin cancer  has a price  comparable to other checkpoint inhibitors approved for different indications   The pharmaceutical industry holds that discussion of prescription drug prices has to take into account the major investment required for innovation and discovery of new lifesaving drugs   UNRESTRAINED PRICING POWER   Scientific progress  and pricing power  are driving pharmaceutical companies to emphasize oncology research    Most of the strategy on the part of pharmaceutical companies assumes unrestrained pricing power   said Dr  Peter Bach  director of Memorial Sloan Kettering s Center for Health Policy Outcomes in New York   We don t see evidence that companies are pursuing cost effective strategies   Health insurers have had success in demanding price concessions in some drug categories   like diabetes  where several companies sell similar products and insurers are able to negotiate price discounts or rebates in exchange for coverage  According to IMS  that tactic capped the overall rise in spending on diabetes medicines at 8 percent in 2015  compared with an increase of 30 percent in billed invoices  All of the invoice price growth for insulin was offset by price cuts  the institute said  But discounting is much less common for newer  innovative cancer drugs  mostly given by injection and approved for defined patient populations  Net price growth for branded oncology drugs averaged 4 8 percent in 2015  versus 6 4 percent for invoices  according to IMS  Express Scripts  Miller and others said makers of new cancer medications enjoy pricing power due to coverage requirements  insurance plan structure and a lack of head to head comparison studies   Cancer drugs don t compete on price   said Dr  Aaron Kesselheim  a researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of several studies of drug pricing   Drug companies have market exclusivity and we require payers to cover cancer drugs   Medicare has six protected classes  including cancer   Medicare  the federal government s healthcare plan for seniors and the disabled  covers most prescription drugs under its  Part D  pharmacy benefits  The plans are required to cover all drugs in six classes  cancer  HIV  antidepressants  antispychotics  seizure disorders like epilepsy  and immune system suppressants for people undergoing organ transplantation   Trump met recently with Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch  both Democrats  to discuss draft legislation allowing the government to negotiate Medicare drug prices   but the bill preserves the six protected classes  In addition  drugs given by injection  including many cancer therapies  are covered under Medicare s main medical benefit  Bristol disappointed investors when it did not pursue accelerated FDA review of the Opdivo Yervoy combination for newly diagnosed lung cancer   putting Merck ahead in the lucrative lung

Separately  Exelixis has also initiated a phase Ib study  investigator sponsored  on cabozantinib  in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb s   NYSE BMY   Opdivo  nivolumab  or Opdivo plus Yervoy  in patients suffering from genitourinary tumors  including bladder cancer and RCC  The trial has established the preliminary safety and tolerability  and recommended dose for this combination  A phase II trial evaluating safety and preliminary activity of the cabozantinib Opdivo combination as compared to the cabozantinib  Opdivo and Yervoy combination in advance HCC completed enrollment earlier in 2018 
Collaborations with Leading Companies   Exelixis has collaborations with several leading pharmaceuticals such as Bristol Myers Squibb  Merck   NYSE MRK   and Daiichi Sankyo Company forvarious compounds and programs in its portfolio  These collaborations allow Exelixis to earn milestone payments and royalties that boost its top line  Exelixis also has an exclusive licensing agreement with Ipsen for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib 
Exelixis recently announced encouraging results from the dose escalation stage of the phase Ib COSMIC 021 study of Cabometyx in combination with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq  in previously untreated advanced RCC  The combination was well tolerated and showed promising anti tumor activity  In October 2018  Exelixis initiated a phase III trial  COSMIC 311  of single agent cabozantinib in patients with radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer  DTC  who have progressed up to two prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  VEGFR  targeted therapies  
Exelixis and Ipsen announced the initiation of a pivotal phase III study   COSMIC 312   to evaluate a Cabometyx combination therapy in treatment na ve advanced HCC patients  Moreover  an exploratory arm will also evaluate Cabometyx monotherapy in the first line setting for similar patients 
Cotellic s Label Expansion to Boost Top Line  Another drug in Exelixis  portfolio  Cotellic  in combination with Zelboraf  vemurafenib   gained approval in the United States for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive advanced melanoma in November 2015  The drug was also approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation 
Cotellic is also being evaluated in combination with multiple agents for the treatment of various types of tumors  including an immunotherapy in several tumor types like non small cell lung cancer  colorectal cancer  triple negative breast cancer and melanoma 
The IMspire150  TRILOGY  trial  which evaluates the combination of Cotellic  Tecentriq  and Xelboraf in first line BRAF V600 mutation positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma  has completed enrollment  The IMspire170 study  evaluating the combination of Cotellic and Tecentriq versus Merck s Keytruda in first line BRAF wild type metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma  is ongoing
Exelixis faces its share of challenges in the form competition

203146,424662,MRK,Roche s SBLA For Tecentriq Abraxane Combo Accepted By FDA,opinion,"Swiss oncology major Roche   OTC RHHBY   announced that the FDA has accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  for immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq 
The sBLA seeks to get FDA approval for Tecentriq in combination with Celgene Corporation s   NASDAQ CELG   Abraxane and carboplatin for the initial  first line  treatment of patients suffering from metastatic non squamous non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  who do not have EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations 
A decision from the FDA is expected by Sep 2  2019 
The sBLA is based on positive results from the phase III IMpower130 study  which met its co primary endpoints of overall survival  OS  and progression free survival  PFS  in the first line treatment of metastatic non squamous NSCLC 
We remind investors that Tecentriq is already approved in the Unites States for the treatment of patients suffering from metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum containing chemotherapy   In December 2018  the FDA also approved Tecentriq in combination with Avastin  paclitaxel and carboplatin  chemotherapy  for the first line treatment of people with metastatic non squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations 
The drug is also approved for certain types of untreated or previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma  mUC  
Shares of Roche have gained 10 9  in the past six months  outperforming the  growth of 4 5  

 
Roche is working to expand the drug s label further  The company currently has nine phase III studies evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other drugs for lung cancer Tecentriq sales came in at CHF 524 million in the first nine months of 2018  up 49   A label expansion of the drug in the first line NSCLC market will further boost sales  given the potential of the market 
However  competition is stiff in the first line NSCLC market  Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda is already approved for the first line treatment of NSCLC 
Bristol Myers Squibb Company s   NYSE BMY   Opdivo is also in the race for the first line NSCLC treatment  However  the FDA extended the review period of the company s application by three months and set a target action date of May 20  2019

203159,424675,MRK,2 Reasons Merck Is A Compelling Defensive Play For Current Markets ,opinion,"As 2019 begins  it looks as if markets are picking up where they left off at the end of last year  when volatility reigned and high flying growth stocks started losing their luster  We believe volatility will continue and growth stocks will remain under pressure on increasing concerns the decade long US economic expansion could be coming to an end 
During times of market gyrations and increasing economic uncertainty  having a few income stocks in one s portfolio is a good defense  In fact  in 2018 defensive stocks outperformed the broader market  In this space  we strongly favor the global healthcare provider Merck  NYSE MRK  for two reasons its roster of top selling meds and the company s dependable dividend 
1  Strong Growth Momentum  Powerhouse Drugs

Over the past three years  Merck has consistently exceeded analysts expectations on earnings  This impressive winning streak powered its shares higher  Indeed  for 2018 it was the best performer among the 30 mega cap companies listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average  gaining 30  for the year 
We don t expect that pace of growth to slow anytime soon either  Merck s cancer immunotherapy drug  Keytruda  continues to capture market share  In the first nine of months of 2018  Keytruda sales doubled  reaching a whopping  5 billion  The drug has become a core component of Merck s growth  particularly in the large and lucrative area of lung cancer 
Earlier this year the drug showed what medical experts called practice changing results when combined with chemotherapy  As well  just last month  Keytruda gained EU approval for use on adults who ve undergone surgery to remove melanomas  According to Merck  it s the first approval for the drug as an auxiliary treatment in the European Union 
Some analysts expect the majority of previously untreated patients will start taking the drug as well  According to EvaluatePharma projections  it could bring in  12 69 billion in annual sales by 2024  Helped by Keytruda s remarkable success  Merck plans to invest  16 billion on new capital projects through 2022  a 33  surge over what the company announced it would spend in early 2018 
While Merck s cancer treatment is grabbing much of the attention  the company s other drugs are also performing well  HPV vaccine Gardasil s sales were up 55  in the third quarter from the year ago period  while diabetes medications Januvia and Janumet brought in  1 49 billion in sales during the same period 
2  Reliable Payouts
One of the primary reasons to bet on a dividend paying stock is for its benefits during market highs and lows  Which means the focus should be on the company s history of reliably paying dividends 
With its forward dividend yield of about 3   Merck has made returning capital to investors a top priority  Since at least 1970  the company has never missed a quarterly payout  Merck s dividend has grown at an annualized rate of 5 5  since 2010 beating the rate of inflation  After delivering a 15  hike in October  Merck now pays  0 55 a share every three months 
The company has also been returning capital to stockholders in recent years via share buybacks  further boosting its total yield  In October  the company announced that it plans to buy back an additional  10 billion worth of outstanding shares 
Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings and the company s payout ratio  Merck s current payout ratio is 66   suggesting it s in a comfortable position to continue the current dividend growth strategy

Horizon s strategy is to transform into a balanced  diversified  sustainable growth biopharmaceutical company  predominantly focused on rare disease medicines 
The company has been focused on expanding its orphan drug business  as evidenced by its long range plan  wherein the orphan business is expected to constitute approximately 60  of net sales in 2020  Meanwhile  the company has been quite active on the acquisition front  In May 2015  Horizon acquired Hyperion in a deal valued at about  1 1 billion and added a couple of UCD drugs like Ravicti and Buphenyl Ammonaps to its portfolio 
The FDA approved a supplemental new drug application  sNDA  for Ravicti to expand the age range  for chronic management of urea cycle disorders  UCD  in patients  to two months and older from two years and older  in April 2017  In December 2018  the FDA approved an sNDA to expand the age range for Ravicti Oral Liquid to include infants younger than two months  living with a UCD

203171,424687,MRK,Bristol Myers To Acquire Leading Biotech Celgene For  74B,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced that it will acquire Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   in a cash and stock transaction with an equity value of approximately  74 billion  The transaction has been approved by both the boards While shares of Bristol Myers lost 13 3  on news of what will be one of the biggest acquisitions in recent times  Celgene s shares gained 20 7  Financial Terms of the AgreementPer the terms  Celgene shareholders will receive 1 0 share of Bristol Myers and  50 00 in cash for each share held  In addition  shareholders will also receive one tradeable Contingent Value Right  CVR  for each share of Celgene whereby they will be entitled to receive a payment for the achievement of future regulatory milestones  The board of directors of both the companies have approved the combination The total value received by Celgene s shareholders will be  102 43 per Celgene share and one CVR based on the closing price of Bristol Myers stock of  52 43 on Jan 2  2019   The tradeable CVR will entitle its holder to receive a one time potential payment of  9 00 in cash upon FDA approval of three candidates   ozanimod  by Dec 31  2020   liso cel  JCAR017   by Dec 31  2020  and bb2121  by Mar 31  2021    in each case for a specified indication  The total consideration represents an approximately 51  premium to Celgene shareholders based on the 30 day volume weighted average closing stock price of Celgene prior to signing Upon completion  shareholders of Bristol Myers will own approximately 69  of the company  while Celgene shareholders are expected to own approximately 31  The acquisition is expected to be 40  accretive to the bottom line on a standalone basis in the first full year  following close of the transaction  The combined company is expected to generate more than  45 billion in cash flow over the first three full years post closing  Bristol Myers expects to realize cost synergies of approximately  2 5 billion by 2022  The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019 Strategic Aspect of the TransactionThe merger will result in a specialty biopharma company with a strong oncology portfolio and diverse pipeline in the therapeutic areas of inflammatory  immunologic and cardiovascular diseases The combined entity will have a market leading oncology portfolio in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies led by Opdivo and Yervoy along with Revlimid and Pomalyst  In addition  it will also have a strong immunology and inflammation franchise led by Orencia and Otezla and a leading cardiovascular franchise led by Eliquis  The combined company will have nine drugs with more than  1 billion in annual sales Moreover  the company will also have a deep pipeline that includes six expected near term product launches  two in immunology and inflammation  TYK2 and ozanimod  respectively  and four in hematology  luspatercept  liso cel  JCAR017   bb2121 and fedratinib   with potential sales of  15 billion  The early stage pipeline includes 50 high potential assets across solid tumors and hematologic malignancies  immunology and inflammation  cardiovascular disease and fibrotic disease  leveraging combined strengths in innovation Concurrently  Bristol Myers announced its earnings guidance for 2019  The company expects earnings per share of  4 10  4 20  The guidance excludes the impact of the Celgene acquisition  The company expects to execute an accelerated share repurchase program of approximately  5 billion Our TakeBristol Myers was in the lookout of an acquisition for quite some time now to bolster its portfolio  While its blockbuster immuno oncology drug  Opdivo continues to perform well on the back of label expansions  pricing concerns and stiff competition in the immuno oncology space have limited market share gains  In particular  Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda and Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq pose stiff competition in the promising first line non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  space  The FDA extension of the PDUFA date for the company s application seeking approval of Opdivo Yervoy as a treatment for first line NSCLC with tumor mutational burden greater than 10 mutations megabase was disappointing  given the market potentialThe acquisition will enable Bristol Myers to diversify its portfolio  The combined company will have a dominant position in the oncology  immunology and inflammation spaces  Celgene expects total revenues of  19  20 billion by 2020 from its key growth driver  Revlimid While the acquisition looks positive prima facie  any acquisition of this magnitude comes with its own set of integration risks  While the prospects of Revlimid looks solid  the drug will lose patent protection shortly resulting in a dent in sales  Moreover  it might be expensive and will add considerable debt to Bristol Myers  balance sheet Bristol Myers  stock has decreased 25  in the past 12 months  against the  growth of 4 4  On the other hand  Celgene gets a reprieve from the acquisition  having faced a series of pipeline setbacks in recent times  A late stage study on its lead cancer drug  Revlimid  in combination with Rituxan failed  Consequently  shares took a hammering  A phase III trial  REVOLVE   CD 002  on pipeline candidate GED 0301 in Crohn s disease and the extension trial  SUSTAIN  CD 004  were discontinued  following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee  which assessed overall benefit risk during a recent interim futility analysis  The company also suffered a setback in February 2018  when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application   NDA   for multiple sclerosis candidate  ozanimod The company then acquired Juno Therapeutics and added JCAR017  lisocabtagene maraleucel  liso cel  to its lymphoma pipeline  JCAR017 is a best in class CD19 directed CAR T candidate  currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma  However  two leading CAR T therapies  Kymriah and Yescarta are already in the market  Hence  JCAR017 will have a tough time grabbing market share  Hence  the acquisition bodes well from Celgene s point of view Quite a few large cap pharma companies are on the look out for strategic acquisitions  given the stiff competition looming on their high profile drugs from biosimilars and generics  Swiss pharma giant Novartis recently acquired Endocyte to strengthen its leadership in nuclear medicine and radioligand therapy for treating cancer Zacks Rank   Key Pick

203177,424693,MRK,Second missing Pakistani blogger found  leaves country fearing for life  family,news,"By Mehreen Zahra Malik
ISLAMABAD  Reuters    Pakistani blogger Aasim Saeed who went missing earlier this month has been found but has quickly left the country fearing for his life  his family said on Sunday 
Saeed s father said his son was detained by  state agencies  while visiting Pakistan from Singapore  though he did not name which one 
Pakistan s government and Federal Investigation Agency have denied holding any of five liberal activists who went missing this month 
The military and other state agencies have declined to officially comment  The army s media wing did not reply to questions and phone calls on Sunday 
Saeed s recovery comes a day after poet and activist Salman Haider  who disappeared from the capital Islamabad on Jan  6  was recovered  according to his family 
Five liberal activists  some of whom have posted blogs criticizing the political influence of the military and speaking for the rights of religious minorities  had each gone missing separately since Jan  4 
Saeed  who is Singapore based and works in the IT department of the German Merck  NYSE MRK  Group  disappeared on Jan  4 while visiting the eastern city of Lahore 
 It was no one other than the state agencies who took him   Aasim Saeed s father  Ghulam Haider  told Reuters  referring to Pakistan s intelligence agencies 
He said Saeed was picked up over a social media post intelligence agencies deemed  objectionable  
 My son is not against any agency  he is not against the military or government and he is not against Islam   Haider said   The fact that he was set free means that he has been cleared of all charges  
 The only instruction Aasim got from the agencies was that he could not give any media interviews   Haider added 
The military s media wing did not return calls or text messages seeking comment 
Haider said Aasim returned to his house briefly on Saturday but then left quickly  and messaged the family on Sunday morning to inform them that he was safe and would call soon 
Haider said Saeed had either returned to Singapore or was in Germany 
It is not known how the five activists went missing  but some rights groups and newspapers have asked whether state or military agencies were in any way involved 
The Interior Ministry has repeatedly said it was doing all it could to recover the missing men 
Shortly after the activists  disappearances  blasphemy allegations against them appeared on social media and in a complaint to police 
Friends  family and supporters of all five men deny they have blasphemed and have denounced the campaign to press that charge  which could endanger their lives were they to reappear

We note that Lynparza is already marketed in the United States for platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer  regardless of BRCA status and germline BRCAm HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer 
The approval in the first line setting  was based on data from the pivotal phase III SOLO 1 study  which demonstrated that Lynparza  olaparib  tablets led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival  PFS  compared to placebo in women with BRCA mutated  BRCAm  advanced ovarian cancer who were in complete or partial response following first line standard platinum based chemotherapy 
In the Lynparza arm  60  of the patients were progression free at 36 months compared with 27  in the placebo arm  Lynparza reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 70  compared to placebo  following response to platinum based chemotherapy 
With the approval for expanded use in the first line setting  sales of Lynparza can improve in the future quarters 
Other PARP inhibitors available in the market are Tesaro  Inc  s   NASDAQ TSRO   Zejula and Clovis Oncology  Inc  s   NASDAQ CLVS   Rubraca  Zejula and Rubraca are also being evaluated in late stage studies in the first line maintenance setting for the treatment of ovarian cancer patients who have responded to platinum based chemotherapy 
This year so far  AstraZeneca s shares have risen 13 7  compared with the  s growth of 4 9  

In a separate press release  AstraZeneca and Merck announced positive results from phase III SOLO 3 study of Lynparza  which was conducted as a post approval commitment in agreement with the FDA  The results showed that BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer patients treated with Lynparza following two or more prior lines of chemotherapy experienced a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of objective response rate  ORR  and the key secondary endpoint of progression free survival  PFS  compared to chemotherapy  This is the fourth phase III study to report positive results for Lynparza  The companies plan to discuss the results with the FDA 
Astrazenca also announced that two phase III studies OLYMPUS and ROCKIES  evaluating pipeline candidate roxadustat for the treatment of patients with anaemia in chronic kidney disease  CKD   met their primary efficacy endpoint 
The OLYMPUS study was conducted on non dialysis dependent CKD patients  while the ROCKIES study was conducted on dialysis dependent CKD patients 
While OLYMPUS demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in haemoglobin versus placebo  ROCKIES showed a similar improvement in haemoglobin versus epoetin alfa 
Roxadustat is a hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor  HIF PHI   which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and FibroGen 
Data from the phase III OLYMPUS and ROCKIES trials together with the efficacy and pooled safety data from the global phase III program conducted by AstraZeneca  FibroGen and Astellas will be part of the regulatory submission package in the United States and other major countries 
We remind investors that roxadustat was approved in China  its first regulatory approval  for the treatment of anaemia in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis  earlier this week AstraZeneca PLC Price

The drug is now approved in Europe for the treatment of children who are 10 17 years old with relapsing remitting forms of multiple sclerosis  RRMS   Following  the nod  the drug became the first and only oral disease modifying treatment for children and adolescents who experience more severe relapses than adults 
The approval was based on positive data from the phase III PARADIGMS study  Data from the study showed that Gilenya significantly reduced the relapse rates by 82  compared to interferon beta 1a  Moreover  85 7  of patients treated with Gilenya were relapse free for up to two years compared to interferon beta 1a  Additionally  patients experienced a 77  risk reduction of disability progression when treated with Gilenya versus patients treated with interferon beta 1a 
We note that Gilenya is already approved in the United States and Europe for treating relapsing forms of MS in patients aged 18 years or older   In May 2018  the drug was approved in the United States for the treatment of children aged 10 years or older with MS 
Shares of Novartis have gained 7  year to date compared with the  growth of 7 7  

 
We would like to remind investors that  in October 2018  Novartis announced encouraging top line results from another phase IIIb ASSESS study on Gilenya

The safety of Gilenya across both doses was consistent with the known safety profile of the drug  Notably  more discontinuations due to adverse events and unsatisfactory treatment effects were reported in the Copaxone group  The data from the ASSESS study further reinforces efficacy of Gilenya in treating relapsing MS 
Novartis  MS portfolio comprises approved drugs like Gilenya and Extavia  Notably  Extavia is approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS  In Europe  the drug is approved to treat people with relapsing remitting MS and secondary progressive MS  SPMS  with active disease

London to Moscow to Sydney are turning to a new wave of online  buyers clubs  to get cheap generic medicines to cure hepatitis C and protect against HIV infection  While regulators warn that buying drugs online is risky  scientific data presented at a recent medical conference suggest that treatment arranged through buyers club can be just as effective as through conventional channels   Will Nutland  who supports a drug buying network in London and takes Indian made generic drugs that are not available through the health service to prevent HIV infection  thinks the latest research will build confidence in such schemes   This new data shows that so far we ve got it right   the HIV activist said   It gives us a boost in confidence in the types of drugs that are available online   The

imports of medicines for personal use  Like Ron Woodroof  the 1980s AIDS patient in the movie  Dallas Buyers Club   the sponsors of today s drug clubs aim to help patients who can t get the drugs they want through local healthcare systems by bringing in medicines from abroad  But while Woodroof had to smuggle drugs in bulk across the Mexican border  users of modern day clubs can  in many countries  tap orders into their computers quite legally  Savings can be huge  A month s generic supply of the pre exposure prophylaxis  PrEP  HIV drugs emtricitabine and tenofovir costs about 45 pounds   56  online in Britain  around a tenth of Gilead Sciences  branded version Truvada  A Indian made course of treatment for the liver destroying disease hepatitis C  meanwhile  can be had for around 1 000 pounds against a list price for branded drugs of around 35 000  Gilead is also a leading producer of patented hepatitis C drugs  along with Merck  NYSE MRK  and AbbVie  BRAVE ENOUGH TO TRY  Resorting to a buyers club is clearly not conventional medicine but it is something some people have been brave enough to try and it seems to be working   said Andrew Hill of London s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital  Data presented at the Oct  23 26 HIV Glasgow conference showed generic drugs bought via buyers clubs in Australia  Britain  Russia and South East Asia by a total of 900 patients delivered hepatitis C cure rates of around 95 percent  That is similar to outcomes in clinical trials using the original brands  Another piece of research involving more than 200 gay men in London taking generic PrEP bought through a buyers club found that their drugs  mostly made by India s Cipla  were both safe and effective at preventing HIV infection   Such observational studies do not have the rigor of full scale clinical trials but they do provide reassurance   What this sort of data does is give doctors and patients some faith that this isn t an act of complete lunacy that is going to cause patient harm   said James Freeman  a Tasmanian doctor behind a hepatitis C drug buying club  For Freeman and other critics of the pharmaceuticals industry  the advent of today s buyers clubs is just the latest chapter in an ongoing war over drug prices  with parallels to the battle over getting cheap HIV drugs into Africa  In the 1990s  HIV drugs costing more than  10 000 per patient a year were simply out of reach for millions of people in the developing world  Today  thanks to cheap generics  the cost for the poor has been slashed to around  100  Still  there are obstacles  In a number of European countries  including Germany  medicines cannot be sent in the post  prompting some people to collect supplies from friends in countries like Britain where it is permitted  Some online pharmacies demand a doctor s prescription to fulfil an order  although many do not  and people using buyers clubs still require blood tests to ensure the drugs they are on are working properly  without serious side effects  The need for those laboratory tests is controversial  since it costs money to test people taking medicines that were not prescribed by the official healthcare system in the first place   But Nneka Nwokolo  who presented the data on PrEP in Glasgow  believes it makes sense  given the proven efficacy of PrEP in several clinical trials  She works at a National Health Service  NHS  sexual health clinic in London s Soho that has been offering blood tests for generic PrEP users since February    HIV rates among gay men are not going down  despite all our interventions  including promoting condom use  But we know PrEP works and it has been shown to make a significant difference to HIV acquisition   she said  Clinical trials have shown PrEP cuts the risk of catching the virus during sex by more than 90 percent  PATCHY ACCESS Across Europe and around the world access to PrEP remains patchy  In Britain  routine use is stalled by a funding row  as well as doubts over cost effectiveness  based on the high price of branded Truvada  Access to hepatitis C drugs faces similar budget constraints in many countries  given the high cost of brand name products  Gilead s Sovaldi initially cost  1 000 a pill in the United States  although competition has since pushed prices down  Gilead said in a statement that it worked  to ensure broad access to its medicines through dialogue and efforts with payers and other stakeholders  including governments   But HIV activist Nutland  who is also a research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  believes drugmakers must do more to make their products affordable   It s an absolute scandal that the prices are so high that even wealthy national services are saying they cannot afford the costs of these drugs  ,2016-11-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/buyers-clubs-for-cheaper-drugs-help-fight-hepatitis-and-hiv-438062,438062

203245,424761,MRK,AstraZeneca s Lynparza Gets Priority Review In 1st Line Use,opinion,"AstraZeneca plc   NYSE AZN   and partner Merck s   NYSE MRK   supplemental new drug application  sNDA  looking for label expansion of their PARP inhibitor Lynparza as a first line maintenance treatment for advanced ovarian cancer was accepted by the FDA  With the FDA granting priority review  a decision is expected in the first quarter of 2019 
Lynparza is already marketed in the United States for platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA status and germline BRCAm HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer 
The sNDA filing was based on data from the pivotal phase III SOLO 1 study  which demonstrated that Lynparza  olaparib  tablets led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival  PFS  compared to placebo in women with BRCA mutated  BRCAm  advanced ovarian cancer who were in complete or partial response following first line standard platinum based chemotherapy  In the Lynparza arm  60  of the patients were progression free at 36 months compared with 27  of women in the placebo arm 
This year so far  AstraZeneca s shares have risen 17 9  compared with the  s increase of 8 3  
 

 
AstraZeneca reported Lynparza sales of  438 million in the first half of 2018  up 118  at constant exchange rates  on expanded use in ovarian cancer and label expansion in breast cancer  If approved for expanded use in the first line setting  sales of Lynparza can improve in the future quarters 
Other PARP inhibitors available in the market are Tesaro  Inc  s   NASDAQ TSRO   Zejula and Clovis Oncology  Inc  s   NASDAQ CLVS   Rubraca  Zejula and Rubraca are also being evaluated in late stage studies in the first line maintenance setting in ovarian cancer patients who have responded to platinum chemotherapy 
AstraZeneca also announced presentation of detailed data from a phase III cardiovascular outcomes study  DECLARE   TIMI 58  on type II diabetes drug Farxiga at the annual session of the American Heart Association 
In September  AstraZeneca had already announced that Farxiga led to statistical significant reduction in hospitalization for heart failure  hHF  or CV death in the study  thereby meeting one of the two primary efficacy endpoints  Along with the latest release  AstraZeneca said that Farxiga significantly reduced the combined risk of hHF or CV death by 17  versus placebo  Meanwhile  for the other endpoint  though fewer major adverse cardiovascular events  MACE  were observed in the Farxiga arm  this did not reach statistical significance  8 8  for Farxiga vs  9 4  for placebo  
The DECLARE   TIMI 58 cardiovascular outcomes study was carried out in type II diabetes who have multiple CV risk factors or established CV disease  The study compared the effect of Farxiga versus placebo in reducing the risk of MACE in such patients

203250,424766,MRK,Doctors grapple with best use of potent new cancer drugs,news,"By Ben Hirschler COPENHAGEN  Reuters    Evelyn O Flynn still has lung cancer  But after going straight on to a new immune system boosting drug more than a year ago  rather than traditional hard to tolerate chemotherapy  she is feeling great   It s like a miracle   said the 72 year old ex smoker  who is about to become a great grandmother  As a patient being treated with Merck  NYSE MRK    Co s immunotherapy drug Keytruda  O Flynn is one of the lucky ones   Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology  ESMO  congress suggest her early treatment with immunotherapy  as part of a clinical trial in Britain  will become standard for a growing number of patients  But there is a catch  it doesn t work for all  Giving immunotherapy on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD L1  which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy  From now on  oncologists in Copenhagen have been told  lung cancer patients should be routinely tested for this biomarker  However  only a quarter to a third of non small cell lung cancer patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD L1  leaving the majority unserved and around 70 percent of the market still up for grabs  The inability to treat everyone with monotherapy using one single drug is a blow for Bristol  which tried to make treatment with its Opdivo drug work across the board  only to fail comprehensively in a major clinical trial   But it has opened up the field to rivals like Merck  Roche and AstraZeneca  which own what could be among the biggest selling drugs of all time  and all companies are now racing to find smart ways to combine treatments  Oncologists poring over immunotherapy trial results at Europe s biggest cancer meeting have learnt one thing  finding optimal treatments for different patient groups will take more research   I think the future of immunotherapy will be defined over the next 10 or 15 years   said lung cancer specialist Solange Peters from Lausanne University Hospital  one of the organizers of the Copenhagen meeting  Despite immunotherapy successes and the prospect of a potential market worth up to  40 billion in sales  veteran cancer experts urge caution   In oncology  we see these kind of waves from cosmic pessimism to over optimism  so we have to be cautious   ESMO President Fortunato Ciardiello said   Investors  though  were quick to position themselves as shares in Bristol fell 10 percent in early trade on Monday  while Merck hit its highest level since 2001  FIGHTING BACK By taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body s natural killer cells to home in on tumors  immunotherapy offers a different approach to toxic chemotherapy treatment  which causes collateral damage to healthy tissue  It is not without side effects but it is a kinder option  which also promises much longer lasting efficacy  Bristol  Merck and Roche have U S  approval for immunotherapies  while Bristol and Merck also sell their drugs in Europe  China  however  has yet to license them  Lung cancer  the world s biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1 6 million  will account for by far the largest portion of future prescriptions  although immunotherapy is used additionally in melanoma  Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder  kidney  head and neck  With Merck set to sweep the board in lung cancer monotherapy  doctors are looking to the next phase of the story and there is a growing consensus that combination treatments are the future for remaining patients with lower PD L1 levels   Clearly  the race is on   said Jean Charles Soria  a professor of medicine at France s Institut Gustave Roussy  of the looming battle for dominance in the combination market  In theory  researchers believe  it should be possible to get more people to respond by adding other drugs to the mix in order to coax the immune system to fight back against cancer cells  Most attention so far has been on combining two immunotherapies  although this raises questions over cost  with each medicine typically priced at  100 000 to  150 000 a year  The strategy creates an opportunity for AstraZeneca  which has lagged rivals so far but hopes to jump ahead with a drug cocktail that should report clinical results early next year  Bristol is chasing the same idea  although its double immunotherapy trial is not expected to have results until 2018  But the ESMO meeting has also raised the prospect of another approach    successfully combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy  A lot of scientists have been sceptical of this idea in the past  and there are still questions over whether patients will have a long lasting response  but positive data from a mid stage study at ESMO suggests the concept has real promise  Roche and Merck are both enthusiastic  Steering a path through all these permutations is going to be a challenge and ESMO s Ciardiello says the cancer community must await more clinical trial results over the next few years   I think we live in great times for rendering cancer a curable disease but it will take time because the more we learn  the more we understand that it is hugely complex   he told Reuters   30 40 BILLION SALES While nobody yet knows what the  gold standard  treatment regimen is going to be  it is already clear this new generation of drugs is going to be big   Every time we come back to the immunotherapy market we are amazed at just how large the opportunity is   said Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez  who sees combined annual sales of  30 billion to  40 billion for drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo  as well as rivals from Roche  AstraZeneca and  Pfizer   NYSE PFE    How the market will ultimately divide between companies is still unclear but Merck certainly emerges from the past weekend in Copenhagen as the main winner  That underscores a shift in expectations that has been evident since August  when Bristol first revealed its monotherapy trial had failed  British patient O Flynn  whose tumors shrunk dramatically  is just glad she has a chance to try something new

203256,424772,MRK,EU court says Lundbeck pay for delay deals anti competitive,news,"By Francois Aulner
LUXEMBOURG  Reuters    Danish drugmaker Lundbeck s  CO LUN  deals with smaller rivals to delay cheaper generic copies of its blockbuster citalopram anti depressant from entering the market were anti competitive  a European Union court said on Thursday 
The ruling followed an appeal by Lundbeck and five other generic drugmakers against a 2013 decision by the European Commission that their  pay for delay  deals breached EU rules 
The companies were fined a combined 146 million euros   165 million   93 7 million euros of which was from Lundbeck 
The General Court of the European Union said in its ruling that it dismissed the action brought by Lundbeck in its entirety  It said that the agreements had restricted potential competition 
Lundbeck s case  among several before the EU courts  has been closely watched by the pharmaceutical industry seeking to preserve a longstanding business practice opposed by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic 
The pharmaceutical industry says pay for delay deals prevent costly and lengthy litigation  Other companies appealing the EU decision were Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA  Generics  UK   Arrow Group  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries  NS SUN   Xellia Pharmaceuticals and Alpharma 
The Commission s cases came in the wake of an inquiry into the sector in 2008 2009  Israeli drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  Industries  TA TEVA  and France s Servier have also challenged the EU decisions and fines in separate but similar cases

203262,424778,MRK,Endo  ENDP  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Endo International plc   NASDAQ ENDP   is expected to report third quarter 2018 results on Nov 8  before the opening bell 
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 38 2   In fact  it pulled off a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters  recording average positive surprise of 29 1  
Shares of Endo s have gained 116 4  year to date  against the  decline of 4 1  

 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Propelled by strong results in the first half  Endo raised its guidance along with its second quarter results   Endo now expects revenues between  2 75 billion and  2 85 billion in 2018  earlier estimate   2 6 billion and  2 8 billion  
The company is in the process of redefining its business  given the persistent decline in the Generic business  which is expected to face challenges  The focus now is on sterile injectables and Xiaflex   Xiaflex s performance was outstanding in the first half  propelled by strong volume growth for the indication of Dupuytren s Contracture and Peyronie s Disease 
We expect the drug s momentum to continue in the third quarter as well  The company expects Xiaflex s full year revenue growth to be in the high teens percentage range versus its previous guidance of low  to mid teens growth 
U S  Branded Sterile Injectables revenues are now expected to grow in the high teens percentage range   The company anticipates earnings from continuing operations to be  2 50  2 60 per share  earlier estimate   2 15  2 55  
While the turnaround might take time  the company seems to be on the right track  Endo advanced its cellulite treatment development program  The company initiated two phase III clinical trials of collagenase clostridium histolyticum   CCH   for the treatment of cellulite  Recruitment has been accelerated in both the trials and top line results from these trials are now expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 
Revenues from sterile injectable business are being driven by continued growth of Adrenalin  The business is poised to become Endo s core business   In April  Endo entered into definitive agreements to acquire Somerset Therapeutics  LLC  a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets sterile injectable and ophthalmic drugs for the U S  market  and the business of its affiliate Wintac Limited  which operates as Somerset Therapeutics  contract developer and manufacturer  The acquisition will be closed by the end of 2018  
During the last reported quarter  Endo launched glycopyrrolate injection  the generic version of Robinul  as Somerset Therapeutics  exclusive distributor  In July  the segment launched ertapenem for injection  the authorized generic of Merck s   NYSE MRK   Invanz  New launches should propel growth 
During the third quarter earnings call  investors are expected to focus on the company s performance and pipeline updates Endo International plc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Endo this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  3 63   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is 57 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 59 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Endo currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which is favourable  However  the negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some health care stocks you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
CRISPR Therapeutic   NASDAQ CRSP   has an Earnings ESP of  3 53  and a Zacks Rank  1   The company is expected to release third quarter results on Nov 14  You can see  
Horizon Pharma   NASDAQ HZNP   has an Earnings ESP of  2 41  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release third quarter results on Nov 7

203269,424785,MRK,Exclusive  Global firms beef up investigations of Indian mica suppliers after expos  on child deaths,news,By Nita Bhalla and Rina Chandran DELHI MUMBAI  India  Thomson Reuters Foundation    Major global companies buying the mineral mica from India vowed on Thursday to beef up inspections of their suppliers for child labor after a Thomson Reuters Foundation investigation revealed children were dying in illegal mines  A three month investigation in the mica producing states of Bihar  Jharkhand  Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh found at least seven children have been killed since June mining for mica  the valued mineral that puts a sparkle in make up and car paint  These deaths  feared to be just the tip of the iceberg  have gone unreported as victims  impoverished families and mine operators do not want to end the illegal mining in abandoned mines and protected forests   often their only source of income  While officials in Jharkhand and Rajasthan vowed to investigate child deaths following the expose  major companies buying from India said they would examine suppliers   and could stop buying from India without more efforts to end child labor   We have immediately started investigations with our direct suppliers   said a spokesman from German car manufacturer Volkswagen  DE VOWG p   adding that a meeting with suppliers was now scheduled for later this month   Based on the outcome of the results of our investigations we will take corresponding actions based on our internal processes   BMW said it did not tolerate child labor   If the allegations are substantiated  we will do everything to ensure that the supplier involved is no longer part of our supply chain in the future   a company spokesman said  Other big car makers in India   Maruti Suzuki  Hyundai  Honda  Audi  Mercedes Benz   Renault   PA RENA   Mahindra and Tata Motors   did not respond to requests for comments  BOYCOTTS AND ALTERNATIVES Indian law forbids children below the age of 18 working in mines and other hazardous industries but many families living in extreme poverty rely on children to boost household income  India is one of the world s largest producers of mica  a silver coloured  crystalline mineral  that has gained prominence in recent years as an environmentally friendly material  used in the car and building sectors  electronics and  natural  make up  This surge in demand has revived a flagging industry in India which closed most of its 700 mines employing over 20 000 workers in the 1980s following stricter laws to limit deforestation and the discovery of substitutes for natural mica  In 2013 14 India produced 19 000 tonnes of mica  according to the Bureau of Mines  but exported 128 000 tonnes  with the biggest buyers China  Japan  and the United States  It is estimated up to 70 percent of India s mica is produced in illegal mines falling into disrepair  Activists have called for more funding to provide schooling and alternative livelihoods in mica areas which are some of the poorest regions  Rajesh Malhotra  spokesman for the Ministry of Power  Coal and Renewable Energy  said the government has dedicated funds for the welfare of local people in mining areas which will generate  1 billion annually to support various programs  He listed water  health  education  training  child welfare and sustainable livelihoods as priorities  Some companies are supporting these community initiatives  Major buyer  Chinese pigment manufacturer Fujian Kuncai Material Technology Co Ltd  said changes were  urgently needed  and called on all parties involved in the supply chain to act  Mike Tijdink  general manager of Kuncai Europe  said the manufacturer was setting up its own company in India this month to source directly from mines  working with NGO Terre des Hommes to help communities  and had started making synthetic mica   If we are not able to create a child labor free and legal mica industry in India  the industry could consider the switch toward an undisputed product like synthetic mica   he said  German drugmaker Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA  which cut some suppliers after it discovered children collecting mica at some mines in 2008  reiterated its condemnation of child labor  While some companies invest in communities  others say they cannot guarantee supplies are child labor free so have stopped using mica  10 percent of which goes into cosmetics  British cosmetics company Lush  which prides itself on its handmade products and ethical trading  switched from natural to synthetic mica in 2014 due to concerns about child labor and described revelations of child deaths in mines as  atrocious    No industry should result in the loss of life  let alone that of children   Lush s head of ethical buying  Simon Constantine  told the Thomson Reuters Foundation   We continue to choose a boycott of natural mica until greater transparency and assurances can be given on ethical supply     We only hope that other companies see this reporting and are as shocked into action as we have been   A spokeswoman from L Oreal said the company was only buying from a  limited number of trusted suppliers who have committed to sourcing only from legal gated mines where working conditions are closely monitored and human rights are respected   Estee Lauder did not respond to requests for

203296,424812,MRK,Bristol Myers Posts Data On Empliciti  China Approves Opdivo,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced positive results from the phase II study  ELOQUENT 3  on oncology drug  Empliciti 
The study is evaluating the addition of Empliciti to Pomalyst and low dose dexamethasone  EPd  in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma  RRMM   The international study is evaluating Pomalyst based triplet combination in patients with RRMM  who received at least two prior therapies  including Revlimid and a proteasome inhibitor 
The study achieved its primary endpoint as the results show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival  PFS  for patients treated with EPd compared with only Pomalyst and dexamethasone  Pd  
The data were also presented at the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association 
Data from the study showed that patients randomized to EPd experienced a 46  reduction in risk of disease progression compared with patients randomized to Pd alone  with median PFS of 10 3 months compared with 4 7 months in Pd patients 
Additionally  the PFS benefit experienced among patients randomized to EPd was consistent among patients who had received two to three prior lines of therapy and four or more prior lines of therapy 
The combination therapy  if approved  can provide an important treatment option for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed after treatment with lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor 
Bristol Myers is co developing Empliciti with AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   

 
Bristol Myers  shares have declined 9 4  year to date compared with the  s decline of 1 8  
Earlier  the company announced that the China National Drug Administration has approved its blockbuster immuno oncology drug Opdivo  for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  after prior platinum based chemotherapy in adult patients without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations 
Per the company  this is the first and only PD 1 inhibitor approved in China  The approval was based on data from the pivotal phase III study  CheckMate 078 trial  in which 90  of the patients enrolled were from China 
We note that Opdivo became the first PD 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval  It is currently approved in several countries including the United States  the EU and Japan for several cancer indications 
Opdivo became the first PD 1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy   classical Hodgkin lymphoma   in both the United States  May 2016  and the EU  November 2016    The drug has been performing impressively  due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications  including melanoma  renal cell carcinoma and second line NSCLC 
Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly 
However  Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda and Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq which can limit market share gains

203313,424829,MRK,U S  regulator says too many drugmakers chasing same cancer strategy,news," This June 10 story corrects reference to AstraZeneca drug to PD L1 instead of PD 1  paragraph 10  By Deena Beasley CHICAGO  Reuters    A new type of cancer drug that takes the brakes off the body s immune system has given drugmakers some remarkable wins against the deadly disease  but a top U S  regulator says too many companies are focused on the same approach  Dr  Richard Pazdur  head of the Food and Drug Administration s office of oncology products  was referring to therapies designed to disable the PD 1 protein that tumors use to evade the immune system   The FDA has approved such treatments from Merck   Co  N MRK   Bristol Myers Squibb Co  N BMY  and Roche Holding AG  S ROG   each of which have list prices of  150 000 per year  At least five other drugmakers are developing similar medicines    People should ask themselves     would we be better off spending those resources into looking at more novel drugs   Pazdur told Reuters during the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  meeting in Chicago this week   Pazdur acknowledged that the success of a few drugmakers in the worldwide  110 billion market for cancer treatments makes it attractive for rivals to continue developing similar therapies rather than invest heavily in unproven approaches    As with everything in drug development  it is about reduction of risk   he said  But the number of similar drugs in development at the same time is a first in the oncology field  and latecomers to the PD 1 market will likely be relegated to  niche  indications  he added  Drug company executives disputed Pazdur s critique  In interviews with Reuters  they argued that the science around cancer is advancing rapidly  with a focus on how to best combine therapies to attack multiple mechanisms of the disease  determine which patients are most likely to respond to them and how long patients will need to be treated   Bristol Myers and Merck are widely viewed as leaders in the immunotherapy race  with treatments defying the odds to help patients fight off some of the deadliest cancers  Merck s Keytruda was shown to help a significant number of patients with advanced melanoma live at least three years  while Bristol Myers  Opdivo prolonged life for some lung cancer patients by two years  according to data presented at the ASCO meeting   In practice  doctors say  around 20 percent of advanced cancer patients respond to the new drugs and a subset of those patients can have lasting remissions  AstraZeneca PLC s  L AZN  PD L1 drug  which similarly prevents tumors from evading detection  received  breakthrough  status from the FDA to expedite review for treating a type of bladder cancer  Other companies in earlier stages of development include  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   in partnership with Germany s Merck KGaA  DE MRCG    Novartis  AG  S NOVN   Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  O REGN  and China s  BeiGene   O BGNE    Our reason to go into PD 1s is not just to have a  me too  drug   said Israel Lowy  head of translational science and oncology at Regeneron  which has a PD 1 in early stage trials   Most people think that the future is in combinations     Having our own PD 1 that is active and useful gives us enormous flexibility in how we do clinical trials    ENOUGH PROFIT FOR EVERYONE   Industry executives say they are investing in additional  potentially complementary  approaches to PD 1 treatment that can eventually be used against many types and stages of cancer    We don t look at ourselves as  latecomers   We are leading in multiple areas with combination therapies   said Bahija Jallal  executive vice president at AstraZeneca s MedImmune unit  which is testing its PD 1 candidate with a range of other experimental drugs   The question is  how can we really follow the science   Jallal said   At the ASCO meeting  for example  Pfizer presented early stage data from a trial showing that its experimental agent 4 1BB  which aims to increase T cells  was safe when combined with Merck s Keytruda  but only two of 23 patients achieved complete remissions for a year   Somebody may emerge with a surprise new mechanism   said Leerink Partners pharmaceutical analyst Seamus Fernandez  He said drugs from Bristol Myers and Merck will most likely become the standard of care for many patients   Pazdur and other experts agreed that the biggest opportunity for cancer immunotherapies will be their use earlier on in treatment  Fernandez said Bristol Myers could  win the war   if it succeeds with a combination of Opdivo and its other immunotherapy Yervoy as an initial treatment for advanced non small cell lung cancer  Merck and Roche are testing their PD 1s combined with chemotherapy for the same purpose   In the end  patients may benefit from lower costs if Merck and Bristol Myers face more rivals in the marketplace  Both Keytruda and Opdivo have a U S  list price of about  150 000 per year   If combinations of expensive therapies become the norm  drugmakers could theoretically keep prices lower by mixing their own treatments rather than seeking

203317,424833,MRK,3 Stocks Raising Hopes In Troubled Large Cap Pharma Industry,opinion,In spite of a strong start in 2018  the pharma biotech industry is struggling currently  presumably due to a shift in focus to lowering of high drug prices and faster approval of generics  Moreover  quite a few negative pipeline and regulatory updates announced this year so far have probably had an unfavorable impact on the industry However  we expect the industry to turn around as the year progresses  Demand for drugs is rising worldwide due to increasing ailing and elderly population  frequent approval of new drugs as well as line extensions of already marketed drugs  and increased healthcare spending Moreover  reduction in tax and one time low tax window for cash repatriation has boosted the cash position of large pharma companies  This has led to an increase in merger   acquisition activity and may boost innovation and capital building in the biotech industry  With the  62 billion price tag  the proposed acquisition of Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   by Japanese firm Takeda is the biggest deal in the industry  Earlier in the year  we have seen Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   acquiring smaller biotech companies  Impax Laboratories merged with Amneal  Other large pharma companies are also on the lookout for acquisition targets Why Large Caps Given the current dampening mood  we focus on some large cap companies to lower portfolio risk Putting your money in large cap companies reduces risk due to their diversified portfolio and a large cash base  Moreover  the companies  stability and dividend payments provide a safety cushion to one s portfolio  Moreover  in a flat or downtrend market  it is better to focus on specific stocks  Large caps also give high returns and are less risky than small and mid caps However  the large cap pharma  is down 4 5  so far this year while the S P 500 has risen 2 3   But the large cap industry ranks among the top half of the 255 Zacks industry list The below mentioned stocks have risen this year so far  outperforming the large cap pharma industry  Let s discuss the factors driving these stocks and why one should add them to their portfolio AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   shares have gained 6  so far this year on the back of several regulatory approvals and successful study results this year The company s Lynparza became the first PARP inhibitor to be approved beyond ovarian cancer as the FDA approved its label expansion in   Another cancer drug  Imfinzi s label was  to include advanced non small cell lung cancer   NSCLC   indication  Tagrisso s eligible patient population was expanded recently as it is now approved for treating first line  with EGFR mutations Apart from cancer drugs  AstraZeneca s asthma drug    received approval in Europe for severe eosinophilic asthma  Moreover  the company added a new drug to its portfolio with the approval of   formerly known as ZS 9  for hyperkalemiaAstraZeneca s triple combination therapy    for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   COPD   significantly improved several lung functions compared with dual combination therapies   per data from a late stage KRONOS study These approvals for new drugs as well as line extensions are likely to boost the company s top line in the future quarters  In addition  a regulatory application seeking label expansion of Forxiga as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with type 1 diabetes was  for review in March in Europe  Thus  we expect the stock s momentum to continue  However  negative regulatory updates or data readouts may impact the stock unfavorably  key among them being the final overall survival data from MYSTIC study  which has already been delayed Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   stock has gained 7 6  so far this year backed by encouraging data from several clinical studies evaluating Keytruda as well label expansions of the drug Keytruda received  for treating urothelial carcinoma in Japan  Moreover  label expansion in advanced cervical cancer is  in the United States  Several other regulatory decisions are pending in the United States as well as Europe The drug has shown encouraging development in clinical studies  Keytruda significantly improved recurrence free survival   RFS   in  patients and overall survival   OS   in  patients as monotherapy  In combination with Eli Lilly s Alimta  Keytruda  overall survival   OS   and progression free survival   PFS   in first line NSCLC  These positive data readouts increase the probability of Keytruda s label expansion  Moreover  data readouts from a few clinical studies evaluating Keytruda  including two pivotal lung cancer studies  presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  in Chicago were also encouraging Apart from Keytruda  Merck s anti cancer drug    was approved in Japan for label expansion in first line hepatocellular carcinoma   HCC    a type of liver cancer  Moreover  label expansion of AstraZeneca s Lynparza in breast cancer will also boost Merck s revenues as the latter shares development and commercialization costs as well as sales with AstraZeneca Meanwhile  Merck s immunotherapy pipeline for cancer treatment is expected to get a boost with the completion of the  of Australian Firm  Viralytics Limited  in the second quarter  We expect growth of new drugs to continue  which will offset the loss of sales of certain products due to loss of market exclusivity  This should drive the company s shares higher going forward GlaxoSmithKline plc s   NYSE GSK   influenza vaccine   FluarixQuadrivalent   got  for label expansion in infants six months or older in the United States and Europe  HIV treatment    was approved in Europe   Moreover  the company s shingles vaccine nears approval in Europe as in January the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  a positive opinion for the marketing authorization application  In May  the FDA approved the label expansion of asthma therapy  Arnuity Ellipta  as a maintenance treatment in pediatric patients aged five years and older Moreover  the approval of three new products   Trelegy Ellipta  Shingrix and Juluca   in quick succession in the United States and Europe last year early this year boosted the company s top line as the drugs  uptake was encouraging In addition  the agreement to  Novartis    NYSE NVS   stake in the Consumer Healthcare JV is likely to strengthen its competitive position The stock has rallied 14 9

203349,424865,MRK,Can Jafaki Help Incyte  INCY  Beat Earnings Estimates In Q1 ,opinion,Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on May 1  before the market opens In the last reported quarter  the company beat estimates by 103 85  Incyte s earnings track record has been decent so far  Over last four quarters  the company s earnings surpassed expectations thrice  while missing in one  Incyte delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 67 05  in the said time frame   Incyte s stock has lost 46 2  in the last six months  worse than the  s decline of 8 5  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this quarter Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Incyte is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive   and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen Zacks ESP   Incyte has an Earnings ESP of  92 00   as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at earnings of 16 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at an earnings of 8 cents  A positive ESP hints at an earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank   Incyte has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  Further  combined with a positive ESP  chances of an earnings beat are usually pegged higher We caution against all Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors Driving the GrowthIncyte s lead drug  Jakafi  ruxolitinib   is a first in class JAK1 JAK2 inhibitor  approved for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera   PV    patients with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis   MF    including primary MF  post PV MF  and post essential thrombocythemia MF  While Incyte markets the drug in the United States  it is marketed by Novartis   NYSE NVS   as Jakavi outside the country Incyte continues to gain traction by Jakafi s performance   Incyte s Jakafi performance was strong in 2017 driven by patient demand  The sales guidance for 2018 was also impressive  In October 2017  the FDA approved a label update of the drug to include the addition of new patient reported outcome data from the COMFORT I study  as well as updating the warning related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  The pivotal REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease   GVHD   has completed enrollment and results are expected in the first half of 2018 Assuming successful results  Incyte expects to submit an sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication  Jakafi sales are expected to get a boost from the updated labels  Incyte expects Jakafi revenues in the range of  1 35  1 4 billion in 2018  more than 20  growth over 2017 We remind investors that while Jakafi sales and royalties are a key component of Incyte s revenue growth  Iclusig sales and Olumiant royalties are also contributing to the top line Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of  80  85 million R D expenses are expected in the range of  1 077 1 172 million  SG A expenses are expected in the range of  465  480 million We also expect investors to focus on pipeline updates since Incyte suffered a few setbacks this month  Incyte and partner Merck   NYSE MRK   announced the failure of a combination therapy   Incyte s epacadostat and Merck s Keytruda   in achieving improved progression free survival over Keytruda alone in phase III study ECHO 301 KEYNOTE 252  The study was evaluating the combination drugs for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma  An external data monitoring committee recommended the termination of the study following the review of the data from the pivotal study Moreover  the FDA s Arthritis Advisory Committee has recommended an approval of the 2 mg dose of baricitinib  a once daily oral medication for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis for adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate  However  the advisory committee did not recommend approval of the 4 mg dose of baricitinib for the proposed indication based on the adequacy of the safety and benefit risk profiles  While the FDA is generally not required to follow the Advisory Committee s recommendation  but it will consider the same during its review of the NDA for baricitinib  The FDA had earlier issued a Complete Response Letter for the same A Stock to ConsiderHere is one other health care stock worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings GW Pharmaceuticals plc

Shares of the company have declined 0 5  over a year  underperforming the  s gain of 11 2  

 
We note that  Opdivo  became the first PD 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval in July 2014  It is currently approved in several countries including the United States  the EU and Japan for several cancer indications  Opdivo became the first PD 1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy   classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the United States  May 2016  and the EU  November 2016  
In November 2016  Opdivo gained FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum based therapy  Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions  The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications including melanoma  renal cell carcinoma  and second line NSCLC  The FDA also approved Opdivo for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma   HCC   who have been previously treated with Nexavar and Opdivo has rapidly penetrated the second line HCC market 
Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly 
However  Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda and Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price

NewLink s decision came in response to the Incyte Corp  s   NASDAQ INCY    and partner Merck   NYSE MRK   announcement of the failure of a key melanoma combination study on Friday Incyte and Merck said that a combination of Incyte s epacadostat and Merck s Keutruda failed in achieving improved progression free survival over Keytruda alone in phase III study ECHO 301 KEYNOTE 252  The study was evaluating the combination drugs for the treatment unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
An external data monitoring committee recommended the termination of the study following the review of the data from the pivotal study 
Data from the phase III study demonstrated that a combination of IDO1 inhibitor and PD 1 antagonists may not hold potential in treatment of melanoma which obviously raised doubts over the potential success of indoximod combination studies with anti PD 1 PD L1 agent 
Newlink will provide an update when the review is complete  Newlinkclaims that indoximod has a differentiated mechanism of action  MOA  and it has demonstrated that it can improve the outcomes for patients with cancer in combination studies

Pharmaceutical giant Sanofi  PARIS SASY  is partnering with two biotech companies    Evotec AG in Hamburg  Germany and Apeiron Biologics AG in Vienna  Austria   in its latest effort to develop a drug that will harness the body s own immune system in the fight against cancer  The focus of the new collaboration will be on a first in class treatment that takes aim at tumors and cancers of the blood by boosting the function of white blood cells known as lymphocytes 
This strategy  known as immuno oncology  turns the body s own immune system against cancer cells and represents an emerging area of drug development  Already  major pharmaceutical companies including Merck  NYSE MRK   Roche and Bristol Myers Squibb have devoted hundreds of millions of dollars to the idea and launched several treatments known as PD 1 inhibitors that work in this manner  Others  such as Sanofi  are eager to get in the game 
 Immuno oncology has emerged as a particularly promising field to create potentially curative treatment options for many cancer patients   Victoria Richon  a vice president and head of cancer research for Sanofi  said in a statement   Our partnership with experts at Evotec and Apeiron Biologics will help us take the next step toward realizing the full value of these innovative treatments

203410,424926,MRK,Chinese firms pour money into U S  R D in shift to innovation,news,"By Jason Lange WASHINGTON Reuters    Surging investment by Chinese companies in U S  research labs is yielding a fast growing trove of patents  part of a push to mine America for ideas to help China shift from being the world s factory floor to a driver of innovation   Largely absent from American research hubs a decade ago  Chinese firms including Huawei Technologies  and ZTE Corp  SZ 000063  are now using U S  researchers to create patents ranging from new software to internet infrastructure  according to an analysis of Thomson Reuters  global intellectual property database  The rapid growth in China s U S  investments will be a key topic at economic and security talks on Tuesday and Wednesday between top U S  and Chinese officials in Washington  They are negotiating a bilateral investment treaty that could deepen ties between the world s two largest economies even amid tensions over China s military assertiveness  Even without a treaty  China is pouring capital into U S  research as well as buying other assets  While its firms are still newcomers to investing in America and few work on the technological frontier  the Thomson Reuters data offers a glimpse of the advanced economy China aspires to build   Patented inventions by Chinese firms that involved at least one U S  researcher roughly doubled worldwide in each of the last three years  reaching 910 in 2014   We have established a beachhead   said Vincent Xiang  who heads international investment at  Humanwell  Healthcare Group  SS 600079   a Chinese drug company that has put over  50 million into a New Jersey subsidiary that employs dozens of U S  researchers   Rather than compete with powerhouses like U S  drug maker Merck  N MRK  to invent blockbuster medicines  Humanwell s U S  researchers are making smaller refinements such as figuring out how to administer some drugs as pills rather than injections  Humanwell s New Jersey researchers have won approval on four patents so far in the United States and European Union  Xiang said  There are advantages to setting up labs in the U S   where there are over 800 000 people with research doctoral degrees in science  engineering  and health   Without access to innovation  it is hard to win in the domestic market   said Xiang  A SMALL BUT GROWING PLAYER  And yet  direct investment between the United States and China is remarkably low considering the size of their economies  and the fruits of China s U S  R D are similarly modest compared with the vast quantities of patents that emerge from America every year  The cumulative stock of foreign direct investment in China from the United States makes up just over 1 percent of the FDI sunk into Chinese businesses by all nations  according to U S  government data  Most FDI in China comes from other Asian countries  China s share of America s FDI stock is even smaller  but it has been growing rapidly in recent years as Beijing has eased restrictions on outward investment   That is helping Chinese companies sink more money into a range of advanced economies  The Thomson Reuters data also shows a sharp increase in recent years in patents by Chinese firms using German and Japanese researchers  This is a change in China s economic development model   said Thilo Hanemann  who helps maintain a database on Chinese FDI at the Rhodium Group  a New York consultancy   They want to move from an economy driven by domestic investment and exports to one driven by consumption  technology and services   Annual flows of Chinese FDI into the United States have gone from tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year between 2000 and 2009 to  14 3 billion in 2013 and  11 9 billion in 2014  according to Rhodium Group figures  which are widely cited because they track China s investments made via third countries such as Singapore  That is now approaching the annual flows from America s traditional sources of FDI  advanced countries such as Germany and Canada who continue to mine much more knowledge from Americans than does China  German companies extracted 1 416 patents last year using U S  researchers   China already publishes more patent applications than any other country  although development economists note that its state mandated patent targets often lead to lower quality patents  particularly those taken out only in China   However  the Thomson Reuters data  which brings together information from patent offices in dozens of countries  points to many high quality inventions using U S  researchers   For example  Huawei  the top Chinese company with patents fueled by U S  research  has a U S  patent for processing fiber optic signals that was cited by 101 later inventions   The recent Chinese National Patent Development Strategy highlights the country s plans through 2020  including seven strategic industries positioned for growth  biotechnology  alternative energy  clean energy vehicles  energy conservation  high end equipment manufacturing  broadband infrastructure and high end semiconductors  It also includes an increase in research and development expenditures as a proportion of economic output from 1 75 percent in 2010 to 2 2 per cent this year  One Chinese concern likely to be aired at the U S  China meetings this week is that Beijing feels its companies  investments are singled out in U S  security reviews  Huawei is a world leader in producing telecommunications equipment and has six U S  research centers  but is a bit player in America s telecom infrastructure market  U S  national security concerns have helped scuttle several attempts by Huawei to expand its U S  presence   Huawei has occasionally found itself caught in the middle  of geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing  said company spokesman William Plummer  Most Chinese FDI happens when investors snap up established U S  companies  such as when auto parts maker Wanxiang Group  SZ 000559  bought California based electric carmaker Fisker Automotive   and its patents   at a bankruptcy auction last year   The Chinese are also starting new ventures and have invested  3 billion in these  greenfield  projects over the last three years  according to Rhodium   America s state and local governments have set up dozens of offices to compete with one another to attract this capital  which could flow more freely under a U S  China investment treaty  Officials offer potential investors tax incentives and introduce them to potential local partners and to legal and accounting firms   State officials understand there are no go areas given tensions between Washington and Beijing on security matters  Washington reviews more potential investments from China for security concerns than any other country

203421,424937,MRK,Should Value Investors Pick Merck   Co   MRK  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Merck   Co  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Merck   Co  s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Merck   Co  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Merck   Co  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Merck   Co  has a P S ratio of about 3 7  This is marginally higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Nonetheless  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MRK is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Merck   Co  currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Merck   Co  a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 6  which is far better than the industry average of 12 3  Clearly  MRK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Merck   Co  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives MRK a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimate revisions in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 8 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Merck   Company  Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though Merck   Co  has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMerck   Co  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 18   should boost investor confidence However over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Merck   Co The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47

203433,424949,MRK,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Sanofi  Celgene  Bioverativ  Juno And Merck,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 8  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Ecommerce  including Sanofi   NYSE SNY    Celgene   NASDAQ CELG    Bioverativ   NASDAQ BIVV    Juno Therapeutics  Inc    and Merck   NYSE MRK   Industry  Pharma  Part 1Link  The year 2017 was rewarding for pharma and biotech stocks  with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much awaited recovery The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 11 8   while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 18 7  in 2017  This is in sharp contrast to 2016  which was tough for pharma and biotech stocks following criticisms about rising drug prices A key reason for the sector s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus on fundamentals instead  Although the drug pricing controversy will remain a headline risk  investors seem more comfortable with the issue Moreover  a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 restored investor confidence in the sector  The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough Though the sector was off to a strong start in 2018  it has been struggling recently with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and Nasdaq Biotechnology Index down 1 8  and 2 8  year to date  respectively  probably on broader market correction  Also  the mention of high drug prices by President Trump in his State of the Union address dampened investor sentiment  However  the sector is largely expected to rebound as the year progresses New product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results  more frequent FDA approvals  continued strong performance from key products  growing demand for drugs especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track in 2018  A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits Hopes of more mergers and acquisitions  M As  have also gone up with the tax reform in place and big players on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines technology  There has already been quite a bit of M A buzz this year about potential deals  Sanofi and Celgene have already announced two deals each However  headwinds include drug pricing scrutiny  pricing pressure  increasing competition  the growing presence of biosimilars  generic competition  a slowdown in the growth of legacy products  concerns regarding Amazon s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks We are discussing some factors in details here Mergers and Acquisitions  M As  on the RiseThe year started off with expectations that M A activity would pick up  The new tax law  which cuts corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one time tax rate of 10   is expected to spur merger activity this year This was held true with biotech pharma M A activity already starting to gather steam  Sanofi  earlier this year  announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company  Ablynx and haemophilia focused biotech  Bioverativ  Celgene also announced deals to buy Juno Therapeutics  Inc   which focuses on the development of CAR T therapies and Impact Biomedicines  which will add a late stage JAK2 kinase inhibitor  to Celgene s pipeline Merck recently announced that it has proposed to buy Australian oncolytic immunotherapies maker Viralytics Ltd  to strengthen its presence in the fast growing immuno oncology market In fact  most big pharma CEOs believe the tax cuts will place American companies on a level playing field as they can compete better with their foreign counterparts  which operate in better tax environments Meanwhile  in licensing deals continue to be popular with several big companies tying up with smaller and mid sized players with promising mid to late stage pipeline candidates or interesting technology  These deals make sense for both sides    the larger companies are able to boost their pipelines with promising candidates while the smaller ones gain access to a non dilutive source of funds that allows them to continue investing in those pipelines Some companies that often find themselves on the acquisition radar include Exelixis  Incyte  BioMarin and TESARO  among others

203439,424955,MRK,Scientists unveil map of  epigenome   a second genetic code,news,By Sharon Begley NEW YORK  Reuters    Scientists for the first time have mapped out the molecular  switches  that can turn on or silence individual genes in the DNA in more than 100 types of human cells  an accomplishment that reveals the complexity of genetic information and the challenges of interpreting it  Researchers unveiled the map of the  epigenome  in the journal Nature on Wednesday  alongside nearly two dozen related papers  The mapping effort is being carried out under a 10 year   240 million U S  government research program  the Roadmap Epigenomics Program  which was launched in 2008   The human genome is the blueprint for building an individual person  The epigenome can be thought of as the cross outs and underlinings of that blueprint  if someone s genome contains DNA associated with cancer but that DNA is  crossed out  by molecules in the epigenome  for instance  the DNA is unlikely to lead to cancer  As sequencing individuals  genomes to infer the risk of disease becomes more common  it will become all the more important to figure out how the epigenome is influencing that risk as well as other aspects of health  Sequencing genomes is the centerpiece of the  precision medicine  initiative that U S  President Barack Obama announced this month   The only way you can deliver on the promise of precision medicine is by including the epigenome   said Manolis Kellis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  who led the mapping that involved scientists in labs from Croatia to Canada and the United States  Drug makers including Merck  NYSE MRK    Co Inc   the Genentech unit of Roche Holding and GlaxoSmithKline Plc are conducting epigenetics research related to cancer  said Joseph Costello of the University of California  San Francisco  director of one of four main labs that contributed data to the epigenome map  Epigenetic differences are one reason identical twins  who have identical DNA  do not always develop the same genetic diseases  including cancer  But incorporating the epigenome in precision medicine is daunting   A lifetime of environmental factors and lifestyle factors  influence the epigenome  including smoking  exercising  diet  exposure to toxic chemicals and even parental nurturing  Kellis said in an interview  Not only will scientists have to decipher how the epigenome affects genes  they will also have to determine how the lives people lead affect their epigenome  BOOK OF LIFE The human genome is the sequence of all the DNA on chromosomes  The DNA is identical in every cell  from neurons to hearts to skin  It falls to the epigenome to differentiate the cells  as a result of epigenetic marks  heart muscle cells do not make brain chemicals  for instance  and neurons do not make muscle fibers  The epigenome map published on Wednesday shows how each of 127 tissue and cell types differs from every other at the level of DNA  Because scientists involved in the Roadmap project have been depositing their findings in a public database as they went along  other researchers have been analyzing the information before the map was formally published   One of the resulting studies show  for instance  that brain cells from people who died with Alzheimer s disease had epigenetic changes in DNA involved in immune response  Alzheimer s has never been seen as an immune system disorder  so the discovery opens up another possible avenue to understand and treat it  Other researchers found that because the epigenetic signature of different kinds of cells is unique  they could predict with nearly 90 percent accuracy where metastatic cancer originated  something that is unknown in 2 percent to 5 percent of patients  As a result  epigenetic information might offer a life saving clue for oncologists trying to determine treatment  said co senior author Shamil Sunyaev  a research geneticist at Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston  There is much more to come  Instead of the epigenome map being the end  said Kellis   I very much see  it  as beginning a decade of epigenomics  ,2015-02-18,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/scientists-unveil-map-of-'epigenome,'-a-second-genetic-code-328547",328547

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was a loss of 52 cents Incyte Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Quarterly revenues were  444 1 million  up 36 1  year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  418 4 million  The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the United States and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from sales of Jakavi and Olumiant outside the United States 

 
Incyte s stock lost 29 6  over the past year  compared with the  s  1 9  decline 
Quarter in Detail
Jakafi sales grew 26 9   year over year to  302 million driven by strong patient demand for both indications  Net product revenues of Iclusig amounted to  19 5 million  up from  12 9 million in the year ago quarter  Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex U S  markets grew 57 4  to  52 3 million 
R D expenses were up to  447 million from  161 6 million in the year ago quarter  SG A expenses amounted to  98 million  up 1 8  year over year 
2018 Outlook
The company expects Jakafi revenues in the range of  1 350  1 400 million  Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of  80  85 million 
R D expenses are expected in the range of  1 077 1 172 million  SG A expenses are still expected in the range of  465  480 million 
Pipeline Update
The phase II trial  REACH1 trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease   GVHD   has completed enrolment and results are expected in the first half of 2018  Assuming the success of the trial  Incyte expects to submit sNDA seeking approval of Jakafi for this indication 
The phase III trial  ECHO 301  evaluating epacadostat plus Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is now fully recruited and initial data are expected in the first half of 2018 
Incyte has also opened eight new pivotal trials of epacadostat plus PD 1 antagonists in collaboration with Merck   Co    NYSE MRK   and Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   
In December 2017  the New Drug Application  NDA  for baricitinib was resubmitted to the FDA  This was classified as a Class II resubmission  which began a new six month review cycle  A pivotal trial of baricitinib in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis has also been initiated 
The European Commission has already approved baricitinib as Olumiant in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs 
Our Take
Incyte beat on sales in the fourth quarter on strong Jakafi performance  Jakafi sales were driven by patient demand  The sales guidance for 2018 was also impressive 
The label expansion of Jakafi for GVHD will further boost sales  Meanwhile  the NDA for Olumiant was resubmitted and a potential approval will further boost the top line

Crop Science  Animal Health improved as well All growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and after adjusting for currency and portfolio changes Fourth Quarter and Full Year HighlightsThe Bayer Group lost de facto control over the Covestro Group at the end of September 2017  As of Sep 30  2017   there are four reporting segments   Pharmaceuticals  Consumer Health  Crop Science and Animal Health  As such  total figures for the four Life Science segments will no longer be presented separately Revenues at the Pharmaceuticals segment decreased 1 4  to  4 215 million in the fourth quarter but increased 2 6  to  16 847 million in 2017  The growth for full year was backed by a persistently strong performance of the key products like Xarelto  Eylea  Xofigo  Stivarga and Adempas  However  this division experienced a considerable decline in Kogenate s sales  mainly because of a distribution partner placing a lower volume of orders for the active ingredient However  Consumer Health sales were down 9 1  to  1 399 million in the fourth quarter and declined 2 9  to  5 862 million in 2017   The decline was due to decline in revenues in North America  particularly in the United States  owing to the challenging market environment  Further  the Chinese authorities unexpectedly changed the legal status of two of Bayer s medicated skincare brands from OTC to prescription  which led to sales declines in the fourth quarter of 2017  However  business expanded slightly in Europe Middle East Africa  while sales in Latin America came in at the prior year level In the reported quarter  Crop Science sales were  2 263 million  down 5 9  year over year while sales for full year 2017 declined 3 4  to  9 577 million  Sales in the agriculture business declined due to the situation in the Brazilian crop protection business  where volumes were held back by unexpectedly high inventories in the marketThe Seeds business and Environmental Science registered gains  However  there was a decline at the Crop Protection business Sales of the Animal Health segment came in at  322 million  down 2 1  in the fourth quarter but increased 2 2  to  1 571 million in 2017  Sales improved positively in the regions of North America  besides progressing well in Asia Pacific region  The development in North American region was on the back of price increases  lower selling

approximately 36   of the interest in that company for  4 7 billion  Bayer ceded de facto control of Covestro and deconsolidated the company at the end of September 2017  In sync with this  Covestro ceased to be a reportable segment in the third quarter and is now presented as a discontinued operation Bayer s direct interest in Covestro currently amounts to 14 2    Another 8 9  is held by Bayer

business activities of Bayer and Monsanto may also be sold or out licensed The transaction is subject to regulatory approval as well as the successful closing of Bayer s acquisition of Monsanto  Meanwhile  Bayer will continue to own  operate and maintain these businesses until the closing of this divestiture We note that Bayer has made several acquisitions and entered into a number of deals to boost its portfolio in the past few quarters  In September 2014  it acquired Merck s   NYSE MRK   consumer care business for  14 2 billion   10 4 billion   Besides category expansion  the addition of Merck s consumer care business expanded Bayer s geographic reach In addition  Bayer has a license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron   NASDAQ REGN   for the global development and

203461,424977,MRK,Pfizer dampens Astra bid hopes with German Merck cancer deal,news,"By Ludwig Burger and Ben Hirschler FRANKFURT LONDON  Reuters    Pfizer  N PFE  dampened investors  expectations of a renewed bid for AstraZeneca  L AZN  on Monday by signing a major cancer drug deal with Germany s Merck KGaA  DE MRCG   reducing the U S  firm s need for Astra s products 
Merck will get an upfront payment of  850 million from the U S  drugmaker for sharing rights to develop its experimental immunotherapy drug with Pfizer  It is also eligible for up to  2 billion in payments based on the medicine s future success 
Merck s MSB0010718C is part of a class of drugs known as anti PD L1 therapies  which work by blocking a tumor s ability to evade the immune system s defense 
The exclusive nature of the deal means Pfizer and Merck cannot collaborate with any other drugmaker in the PD LI or related PD 1 area  unless they jointly agree to do so 
Such immune boosting medicines represent the hottest area of cancer research and are also a major focus for AstraZeneca  which has a rival anti PD L1 product in development called MEDI4736 
Winning access to AstraZeneca s cancer pipeline has been viewed as a major goal for Pfizer  which was unsuccessful with a  118 billion bid for the British group in May  It has a chance to renew its approach under British takeover rules from Nov  26 
Shares in Merck jumped 2 4 percent on the news  while AstraZeneca slid 2 2 percent by 0510 ET  The British company s stock had already fallen on Friday after several people familiar with the matter said Pfizer seemed unlikely to renew its approach 
Pfizer said immuno oncology was  a top priority  for the firm but a spokeswoman said British rules did not allow it to make any comment on its intentions toward AstraZeneca 
HIGH PRICE
As a result of the cost of the deal  Pfizer said it now expected its 2014 reported diluted earnings per share to be between  1 40 and  1 49  compared with  1 50 1 59 indicated previously 
The drugmaker is paying a high price for a medicine that has yet to prove itself in full scale clinical tests  reflecting intense competition among firms wanting to do a deal  according to Belen Garijo  who will head Merck s healthcare business from next year 
Merck said in September it in talks about a partnership deal for the drug  which is being investigated as a treatment for lung and ovarian cancer  as well as the rare skin cancer Merkel cell carcinoma 
Pfizer and Merck will develop the German company s treatment as a single therapy as well as in combinations with Pfizer s and Merck s portfolio of approved and experimental drug candidates 
Up to 20 high clinical development programs are expected to begin in 2015  including as many as six Phase II or III trials that could be used to seek regulatory approval 
Merck s drug is some way behind rivals from Bristol Myers Squibb  N BMY   Roche  VX ROG   AstraZeneca and U S  namesake Merck   Co  N MRK   so advancing it quickly in clinical tests with a deep pocketed partner such as Pfizer makes good sense  according to analysts at Berenberg Bank 

Pfizer and Merck will jointly fund all development and marketing costs  and will share all revenues  They also agreed to co promote Pfizer s Xalkori cancer drug in the United States and other markets

They sought to amend a report issued by their expert  Daniel Fischel  a former dean of the law school at the University of Chicago whose methodology for calculating damages Swain had found to be flawed 
Swain  however  said the plaintiffs did not deserve a second chance and agreed with Pfizer the case should be dismissed 
 Plaintiffs  failure to proffer admissible loss causation and damages evidence is fatal to plaintiffs  claims   Swain wrote 
Pfizer in a statement said it was pleased with the ruling  adding it  has always believed the evidence in this case demonstrates that the company s historical statements about Celebrex and Bextra were accurate  
Sabella  a partner at law firm Grant   Eisenhofer who represented lead plaintiff Teachers  Retirement System of Louisiana  did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The class action  which Swain had previously certified  covered investors who bought Pfizer stock between October 31  2000  and October 19  2005 
Concerns about the safety of Celebrex and Bextra began to mount following the release of medical studies in late 2004  when rival Merck   Co Inc  N MRK  withdrew its own Vioxx drug from the market because of associated cardiovascular risks 
The lawsuit contended before fall of 2004  Pfizer and its executives hid material results of tests conducted starting in 1998 regarding the safety of Celebrex and Bextra that indicated similar risks 
Revenues from Celebrex and Bextra fell by over  2 billion in the first nine months of 2005 after the safety concerns were made public  the lawsuit said 
The company s market capitalization meanwhile dropped by  68 4 billion between October 2004 and October 2005  the lawsuit said 
Pfizer pulled Bextra from the U S  market in April 2005 at the recommendation of the U S  Food and Drug Administration 

In September 2009  Pfizer agreed to pay  2 3 billion to settle a U S  Department of Justice probe into the marketing of drugs including Bextra 
The case is In re  Pfizer Inc Securities Litigation  U S  District Court  Southern District of New York  No  05 md 01688

203510,425026,MRK,5 Healthcare Mutual Funds To Buy In 2018,opinion,Last year was quite an eventful one for the U S  healthcare sector in particular  The economy witnessed the Republican tax reform becoming law and three rate hikes by the Fed  Thanks to both  healthcare was one of the top performers of 2017  The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLV  rallied 19 5  year  This momentum is slated continue in 2018 Moreover  investors no longer have to deal with fears related to over pricing of drugs  with political voices on this issue mostly absent in recent times  Moreover  a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products have been instrumental in boosting gains  Considering all these factors  this might be the right time to bet on healthcare mutual funds Tax Reforms Likely to Boost Healthcare StocksThe much awaited tax cuts Bill was finally signed by President Trump on Dec 22  2017 in the Oval office  The Bill permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35  to 21   In his comments  Trump pointed out that markets will benefit greatly from this legislation and that  corporations are literally going wild  following the Bill s passage A major aspect of these tax reforms relates to repatriation of trillions of dollars held as cash reserves overseas by companies with global operations at a one time rate of 8   This could improve the overall financial health of big drug companies  Analysts have estimated that companies such as Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE  and Merck  NYSE MRK    Co   with close to  100 billion in earnings overseas  would be major winners of such a policy Moreover  lower domestic rates would leave such corporations with more cash  This is likely to lead to a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2018  Moreover  there has been a surge in the number of FDA approvals of late  This means that more cash reserves would lead to a higher number of drug trials in 2018 and consequently  development of newer products Finally  domestically focused companies that provide only healthcare services would also benefit from a low tax rate  Companies from the sector with limited international exposure and significant capital expenditures would likely enjoy positive cash flows in 2018 End to Drug Pricing Woes Healthcare was hit hard before the presidential election after allegedly exorbitant drug prices were highly criticized by Hillary Clinton  Clinton had tweeted about  price gouging  and framed a proposal to combat skyrocketing drug prices Not to be left behind  President Donald Trump s tweet last year on March 7 relating to increasing competition and lowering drug prices sent fresh shockwaves across the industry  Trump had tweeted that his team was working on a  new system  which would involve  competition in the Drug Industry   Since this tweet  Trump has never commented publicly about drug pricing  Moreover  it is highly unlikely that the issue would resurface in 2018 Also  Trump s pledges to reduce FDA regulations  remove taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers  and successful clinical trials for new drugs may prove to be a boon for the space  Meanwhile  some other factors that should continue having a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks are a new product sales ramp up  R D success and innovation  strong results  a higher number of

 NEW YORK  June 8  Reuters    U S  stock index futures fell
on Wednesday  pointing to a sixth day of losses in an enduring
downtrend as investors worry about the bleak economic outlook
and technical market indicators point to more weakness ahead 
 Stocks reversed tentative gains late in the last session
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged the
economy has slowed but offered no hint the U S  central bank is
considering any more stimulus to accelerate growth 
 ID nN07142566 
 Oliver Pursche  president of Gary Goldberg Financial
Services in Suffern  New York  said the market was likely
hoping for some hint of action from the Fed after its second
round of bond buying expires at the end of the month  He said
the market will sell off past the end of the second phase of
quantitative easing  known as QE2  into July 
  The catalyst for a reversal of this is going to be a
realization by the market that the end of asset purchases as
defined by QE2 is a far  far cry from the end of easy monetary
policy   he said   We are being opportunistic and adding to
positions we really like as they sell off  
 The S P 500 has taken out successive lows in the recent
downdraft  falling almost 6 percent since a peak in early May 
with some technical analysts looking for a pullback to the
March lows in the index at around 1 250  around 3 percent below
its close on Tuesday  A fall of 10 percent would be considered
a correction 
 S P 500 futures  fell 6 3 points and were below fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  fell 59
points  and Nasdaq 100 futures  fell 16 75 points 
 The S P 500 is now up just over 2 percent for the year so
far  Pursche said he  would not be entirely surprised  to see
the index return to support at 1 250

 Therapy for many types of cancers are expected to increasingly rely upon rational combinations of agents   Mark Fishman  president of Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research  said in a statement 

This acquisition will add to several programs that Novartis has for cancer therapies including a chimeric antigen receptor or CAR technology being developed in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania  With this deal  Novartis is targeting PD 1  which is reportedly the next big target for cancer 
Immunotherapy involves coaxing patients  immune cells to recognize and attack their tumors  This technology is reportedly the latest frontier of cancer research following tried and tested methods such as chemotherapy  radiation and surgery 
Companies like Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY   Merck  NYSE MRK  and Roche  OTCMKTS RHHBY  are working to use the human immune system to coordinate a powerful attack on cancer  And  for Novartis  the deal with CoStim will strengthen the company s hold over cancer immunotherapy discovery and will add to its CAR technology 
 Immunotherapy agents provide additional arrows in our quiver for such combinations  They complement our extensive portfolio of drugs that hit genetically defined cancer causing pathways  and also may be relevant to expansion of CAR therapies   Fishman said ",2014-02-17,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/novartis-acquires-us-cancer-researcher-costim-266692,266692

203524,425040,MRK,3 Drugs That Could Shake Up Diabetes Space In 2018,opinion,"2018 could be an incredible year for patients in the diabetes space  A number of fresh treatments have either picked up approval at the end of this year  and  in turn  are due to launch early next year  or will be subject to late stage investigation and seeking approval during 2018 and each of these fresh entrants has the potential to turn the current standard of care  SOC  regimens  which  in diabetes  are notoriously unpleasant  on their heads 
Here s a look at three drugs that fall into the above categories 
First up  Semaglutide 
This one picked up approval from the FDA in the US back on December 5 and is a Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  drug  For those not familiar with the current state of the diabetes treatment space  there are basically two types of therapy 
One is direct insulin therapy  which involves  normally  intramuscular injection of insulin into the body  with the goal being to top up insulin levels ahead of times at which glucose levels are likely to peak  mealtimes  for example   The insulin gets to work reducing glucose levels and returning the patient s blood sugar to normal 
The other is rooted in what s called GLP 1  which is a hormone that stimulates insulin production and  at the same time  induces the feeling of satiation in individuals that take it  It s into this category that Semaglutide fits 
Semaglutide is an agonist of the GLP 1 receptor  meaning  essentially  it makes it work harder than it would otherwise without stimulation  and  in turn  increases the rate of GLP 1 that the body produces 
So  the FDA approved the drug based on what amounted to some very solid late stage data  across more than 8 000 patients  that showed not only can it help lower blood glucose levels but that it can also induce weight loss when used as an adjunct to diet and exercise and   and here s an important point   it s a once weekly administration 
Compare this to the three or four times daily administration of insulin that patients have to undergo right now and it s clear why this one could be a game changer for the patient population 
Next up  ertugliflozin 
Ertugliflozin is the generic name for what Merck   Co   NYSE MRK   the company behind it  intends to call Steglujan commercially  This one literally just picked up approval and  just like Semaglutide is due to hit the shelves in the US at some point during the late first quarter or the early second quarter of next year 
Unlike Semaglutide  however  Steglujan is what s called a sodium glucose co transporter 2  SGLT2  inhibitor  This one s a pretty novel approach to treatment  Basically  SGLT2 is what s responsible for glucose reabsorption in the kidney  The idea behind Steglujan  then  is that by stopping  or at least lowering the level of  glucose that gets reabsorbed in the kidney  you can lower the levels of glucose that end up in the bloodstream at times of peak glucose   meal times  etc 
To put this another way  the drug makes patients extract glucose in their urine instead of absorbing it into the bloodstream  The commercial asset also includes ertugliflozin as an adjuvant type asset  which is what s called a DPP 4  dipeptidyl peptidase 4  inhibitor  These drugs reduce glucagon and blood glucose levels by increasing incretin levels 
Essentially  then  it s a two pronged approach and it allows Merck to go head to head with a blockbuster drug called Glyxambi  which has a more rigorous dosing regimen  giving Merck s asset the advantage 
Finally  ORMD 0801 
This one is the development stage addition to this list  The company that s developing the drug is called Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ ORMP  and it s trying to bring ORMD 0801 to market as an oral administration alternative to the current SOC assets in this space 
Oral insulin has long been just out of reach for the diabetes population and   to date   no company has figured out how to get the incredibly fragile insulin through the GI tract and to the liver without it being broken down and   in turn   rendered unusable 
Oramed has developed a proprietary capsule type technology that uses protease inhibitors to block the effect of the enzymes in the body that would normally break down the drug before it reached its destination 
The drug scored some pretty strong data in a wide reaching phase II trial last year and the FDA just gave Oramed the green light to kick off a phase III trial  which is slated to start any day now 
If the company can prove that its drug can help contribute to lowering blood glucose then it could serve as both a boost to current SOC and  at the same time  a sort of bridge drug that physicians can prescribe to pre diabetics ahead of the injectable SOC options ",2017-12-21,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-are-three-drugs-that-could-shake-up-the-diabetes-space-in-2018-200275140,200275140

203535,425051,MRK,UPDATE 2 Swine flu gives Glaxo a shot in the arm,news,"  Q3 earnings of 28 5p shr  just under 28 7p consensus
   Sales 6 76 bln pounds vs 6 81 bln consensus
   Glaxo set for big H1N1 vaccine boost in Q4
  Shares down 1 percent in London market down 1 8 percent
 
  Adds CEO comments  analyst reaction  latest shares  details 
 By Ben Hirschler
 LONDON  Oct 28  Reuters    Sharply higher sales of flu drug
Relenza buoyed GlaxoSmithKline s quarterly sales  and the
British group said it was in line for a booster from its swine
flu vaccine in the last three months of the year 
 Third quarter earnings per share growth of 13 percent 
flattered by a weak pound  was just shy of expectations  while
group revenue rose 15 percent  helped by recent diversification 
the world s second biggest drugmaker said on Wednesday  
 Glaxo has lost plenty of business this year to cheap
generics  as patents on its older medicines expire  resulting in
a 12 percent fall in U S  sales in the period 
 But windfall sales of drugs and vaccines due to H1N1 are
softening the blow 
 As with many of its rivals  2009 is turning out better than
initially feared  and Chief Executive Andrew Witty said he
expected further growth in the fourth quarter of the year 
 including significant sales of influenza products  
 Glaxo said previously it had taken orders for 440 million
doses of its H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix  and analysts say it could
book around 1 billion pounds   1 64 billion  of this business in
the fourth quarter as immunisation campaigns get underway 
 Witty told reporters that market expectations for sales of
the vaccine were  pretty close to being right   adding Glaxo had
booked further orders and still had capacity for more 
 European drugmakers Glaxo  Sanofi Aventis  Novartis and
AstraZeneca are set to win the bulk of the business for mass
swine flu vaccination programmes launched by governments around
the world 
 Glaxo also gains from having the inhaled flu drug Relenza 
which registered sales of 182 million pounds in the third
quarter  against just 12 million pounds a year earlier 
 Roche has seen a similar sharp jump in sales of its rival
flu drug Tamiflu 
 Glaxo s pretax profit totalled 2 07 billion pounds in the
third quarter  equivalent to earnings per share before major
restructuring of 28 5 pence  on sales of 6 76 billion 
 The mean consensus forecast had been for earnings of 28 7p
and sales of 6 81 billion pounds  according to Thomson Reuters
I B E S 
 Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said the results were
broadly in line  helped substantially by currencies 
  GSK has a decent revenue and EPS profile through 2015  but
its valuation seems to reflect this already   he added  as
shares in the group traded 1 percent lower in a London market
down 1 8 percent at 1400 GMT 
 
 MOVING ON FROM  WHITE PILLS 
 While H1N1 may be a one off  Witty said his strategy of
diversifying away from reliance on  white pills in Western
markets  would mean more predictable long term growth  as
emerging market and consumer products sales increase 
 Less than 30 percent of third quarter sales were generated
from traditional pharmaceuticals and markets  compared with 38
percent last year 
  What we ve begun to show very clearly in these results is
the change in dynamics in our business and particularly the good
progress we are making towards diversifying our portfolio   he
said 
 Witty added he would continue to look actively for bolt on
acquisitions  but only if the price was right  He has eschewed
large scale acquisitions of the kind pursued this year by Pfizer
 and Merck   Co 
 Progress on the research front included encouraging results
with experimental heart drug darapladib  which Witty said was
now six months ahead of schedule in late stage clinical trials 
 Glaxo trades at about 10 4 times forecast 2010 earnings  a
premium to AstraZeneca and Sanofi  which report on Thursday and
Friday respectively  but a discount to Swiss rivals Roche and
Novartis

We note that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this application which will expedite the development and review of the same 
The FDA will make a decision by Apr 16  2018 
The application is based on data from the phase III study  Checkmate  214 study  The study was stopped ahead of schedule based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee following a planned interim analysis of overall survival  The study evaluated the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy versus Sutent for previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC 
The study met the co primary endpoints of improved overall survival and objective response rate compared to Sutent in intermediate  and poor risk patients  Although the combination demonstrated an improvement in progression free survival relative to Sutent  another co primary endpoint  it did not reach statistical significance 

 
So far this year  Bristol Myers  shares have rallied 9 2  compared with the  gain of 20 2  
We note that Opdivo is already approved for a number of indications  These include classical Hodgkin lymphoma  recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum based therapy  Additionally  it is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  in adults progressing on or after platinum based therapy 
Opdivo is also approved for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma  who have been previously treated with Nexavar  The drug received approval for liver and colorectal cancers 
Meanwhile  the company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti cancer agents  Label expansion of the drug into additional indications will give the product an access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential 
However  Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States  With the FDA approving Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  for the first line treatment of metastatic non squamous NSCLC  the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share 
The virology business is also under pressure  The company is also looking to counter generic threat for key drugs through deals and acquisitions  The company recently entered into a deal with AbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV   and Halozyme Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ HALO

gained confidence from sealing Roche s  47 billion buy out of
U S  biotech partner Genentech and as senior figures chairman
Franz Humer and drugs chief William Burns step out of the
limelight 
 The 1967 born Schwan  an Austrian  took charge last year
just before the bid to buy the remaining 44 percent of
Genentech  a protracted process complicated by a growing global
financial crisis that cast doubts on Roche s ability to raise
the required debt 
 In the end  Roche raised the money with ease and the
acquisition was judged a better deal than two other pharma
megadeals this year  Pfizer s offer for Wyeth and Merck   Co s
Schering Plough buy 
 Schwan s growing reputation has since been burnished by
Roche s strong business performance  helped by strong sales of
cancer drugs and antiviral Tamiflu  boosted by the spread of
H1N1 swine flu 
 
 INCREASINGLY  A BIOTECH COMPANY
 Schwan s one big change is Genentech s influence over Roche 
especially in the United States    a chance to shake up a key
unit that had been underperforming and improve drug development 
 That was underlined on Tuesday when Roche announced a revamp
of top management  naming new heads of its two business units 
drugs and diagnostics 
 Genentech developed many of Roche s big revenue drivers like
cancer drugs Avastin and Herceptin  and the Swiss group now dubs
itself a biotech company  stressing good science at a time when
Big Pharma is struggling to develop big selling medicines 
 Significantly  Schwan has decided to throw in his lot with
the specialist Biotechnology Industry Organisation trade group 
rather than with the pharmaceutical industry lobby 
 While Roche s stock performance has not significantly
outshone other drugmakers since Schwan took over  that is
largely due to the fact it was already trading at a hefty
premium to its Big Pharma peers 
 Shares have regained more than 10 percent since sealing the
Genentech deal and the premium  which had been cut down towards
parity with some peers  has expanded again 
 Roche now trades at about 12 times forecast 2010 earnings  a
premium of some 20 percent over closest European rivals
GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis and even further ahead of U S 
majors Pfizer  Merck   Co and Eli Lilly 
  I think there are some difficult and risky patches on the
horizon but they have a rich pipeline of their own now   said
Nick Draeger  a former healthcare fund manager who now manages
business advisors Cederberg   Roche is the best pharma company
out there  
 In July  investors  analysts and journalists saw the result
   raised financial forecasts and a relaxed and confident Schwan
expounding on Roche s transformation into what he called the
world s biggest biotech company 
  The Genentech takeover was not just an acquisition  but has
transformed Roche into a pharma biotech organisation which can
ensure earnings growth in the short term through synergies  and
long term thanks to a high  industry leading R D innovation  
said ZKB analyst Michael Nawrath 
 
 RAPID RISE
 It could have been a poisoned chalice for the softspoken
Schwan  whose dark hair is now scattered with hints of grey 
after he rose rapidly through the Roche ranks from trainee
finance officer to diagnostics chief and CEO in just 15 years 
 He took over after a management team of ex CEO Humer and
Burns guided Roche from the sick man of the sector to that with
the most enviable pipeline of new drugs 
 Even then Humer  now as chairman  Burns and Chief Financial
Officer Erich Hunziker dominated the Genentech transaction 
handling media and investor events  Burns is now retiring   
though he will remain on the board    and Humer is rarely
spotted at Roche events since the deal was sewn up 
 Company watchers say that while Schwan s performance has
been solid  he has not been signficantly tested yet 
  People think he  Schwan  is a good pair of hands  But the
real proof will be when the inevitable problems arise   said
Draeger  who is a former employee of Roche

203548,425064,MRK,INTERVIEW Merck CEO  rivals may wait before any new MA,news,"  Some drug companies may sit on side line  Merck CEO says
   Industry seen watching how recent mega mergers work out
 
 By Ben Hirschler
 LONDON  Sept 17  Reuters    Rival drugmakers are likely to
wait and see how this year s mega mergers turn out before
considering another round of big ticket acquisitions  according
to Merck   Co s chief executive 
 Richard Clark  whose company agreed to buy Schering Plough
for  41 billion in March  said the industry was looking for
proof that deals could provide more than just cost savings 
  I would suspect some companies may sit on the side line
just to see how well these activities are taking place   Clark
told Reuters during a visit to London to unveil a vaccine joint
venture with the Wellcome Trust medical charity 
 Other large deals struck in the first quarter of 2009
include Pfizer s bid for Wyeth  worth  68 billion when it was
announced in January  and Roche s  47 billion buyout of the
remainder of Genentech 
 Many industry analysts see these deals as designed to take
out capacity and cut costs at a time when the global
pharmaceuticals industry faces a wave of patent expirations 
 But Clark said he aimed to deliver more than that 
  If the view is this is a cost synergy and you are going to
kick this can down the alley and it doesn t increase research
productivity  then at the time when you catch up with that can
again you are going to have to kick it again   he said 
  What Merck is trying to do is put a different model
together that says we are going to do research differently  
 If Merck gets it right and shows it can increase revenue
growth and the flow of new drugs from its laboratories  then
senior executives at other big drugmakers could change their
views on deal making 
 Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold said in a report on
Thursday that the next wave of deals by major pharmaceutical
companies would emphasise revenue augmentation over cost
savings 
 She also predicted a divergence of activity between U S  and
European drugmakers  given new European chief executives  stated
disinterest in large deals

   Sees  400 700 million H1N1 vaccine sales in Q4
   Ups full year guidance excluding swine flu vaccine
   Shares up 0 5 percent  outperform sector
 
  Adds analyst comment  shares  H1N1 detail 
 By Sam Cage
 ZURICH  Oct 22  Reuters    Swiss drugmaker Novartis said
sales would grow faster than expected this year  even without a
shot in the arm of up to  700 million from its H1N1 swine flu
pandemic vaccine 
 Third quarter net profit at Novartis  which joined other
major drugmakers in reporting strong trading conditions  nudged
up 1 percent to  2 1 billion  in line with forecasts  the firm
said on Thursday 
  A surprisingly strong set of operating figures   said DZ
Bank analyst Thomas Maul   Management guidance  especially the
outlook for the pharmaceuticals division  is amazingly bullish  
 Novartis shares rose 0 5 percent to 52 75 Swiss francs by
0736 GMT  versus a 0 6 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx European
healthcare sector 
 This year is turning out to be better than initially feared
for Novartis and other major pharmaceutical companies  thanks to
hefty price increases and windfall sales arising from the H1N1
outbreak  though long term problems like increasing competition
from makers of generic drugs have not gone away 
 Both Pfizer  the world s biggest drugmaker  and Eli Lilly
topped earnings forecasts this week and investors will look to
U S  rivals Merck   Co and Bristol Myers Squibb  both due to
report later on Thursday  for more clues on the health of the
sector 
 Novartis  which faces loss of exclusivity on its top selling
blood pressure drug Diovan in 2012  was hit by one off charges
of  189 million from rival Roche s acquisition of Genentech and
discontinuing of a drug by Alcon 
 It has a 33 percent stake in Roche and holds 25 percent of
eye care company Alcon  It made no comment on an agreement with
Nestle to acquire a majority of Alcon 
 The world s biggest food group  which on Thursday reported
nine month sales that met forecasts and kept its 2009 outlook
unchanged  also gave no comment on Alcon in its trading
statement 
 
 SWINE FLU BOOSTER
 Swine flu is set to provide a significant boost to European
drugmakers this year and in the early part of 2010  though the
one off nature of these sales means investors may not set too
much store on the resulting profit boost 
 Roche reported a sharp jump in sales of its Tamiflu drug for
flu last week and analysts expect GlaxoSmithKline s Relenza will
also see strong sales in the third quarter 
 On the vaccine front  Glaxo  Sanofi Aventis and AstraZeneca
 are all expected to highlight an expected jump in
fourth quarter sales due to swine flu when they unveil results
next week 
 Novartis now expects group sales to grow at a high
single digit rate  even excluding H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine
sales  and sees drugs sales growth at a double digit rate  
 It had previously expected group sales to grow at a
mid single digit rate in 2009 and drug sales to rise at a
minimum high single digit rate  both in local currencies 
 It added currency related losses could significantly reduce
growth this year 
 The H1N1 flu vaccine is expected to contribute about
 400 700 million of sales in the fourth quarter 
 Novartis trades at about 13 times forecast 2010 earnings  a
premium to some of Europe s other big drugmakers like
AstraZeneca  Glaxo and Sanofi but a discount to Swiss rival
Roche  which has less exposure to generic competition 
 It had been expected to post third quarter net profit of
 2 1 billion  according to a Reuters poll

European markets edged lower on Wednesday  despite a weaker Euro  as technology shares continued their retreat on investor worries that the Senate version of the U S  tax reform bill would be passed  The Senate version of the bill keeps the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax  and some investors fear that this would negatively impact technology firms  more so than other types of companies  Losses were broad based  but modest across the region  as a softer Euro helped prop markets up to some extent  London s FTSE bucked the falling trend  adding 0 3  as the Pound softened further against the U S  dollar amid no signs of any progress in Brexit negotiations  The Pound also softened against the Euro  providing more fuel for British equities 
U S  markets struggled for direction on Wednesday as gains from the tech sector were offset by losses from the energy sector  By the close of trade the major indices were mixed  with the S P500 basically flat as it edged lower by 0 01   Even so  the small loss was the fourth consecutive declining session for the index and its longest losing streak since March  The Nasdaq gained 0 2  on the back of the rally in technology  which was likely a result of investors buying the dip after several sessions of declines for technology stocks  The Dow Industrials fell 0 16  as 18 of the 30 Dow components ended the day lower  Surprisingly given the weakness in energy  Merck  NYSE MRK  was the biggest loser ass it fell 2 6   followed by Disney  which fell 1 6

 LONDON  July 9  Reuters    GlaxoSmithKline s cervical cancer
vaccine Cervarix has won a green light from the World Health
Organisation  WHO  for use in developing countries  although how
the shot will be paid for has yet to be resolved 
 WHO  prequalification  is necessary for UN agencies and the
non profit GAVI Alliance to purchase the vaccine  and Glaxo said
on Thursday it hoped the move would help speed access to
Cervarix globally 
 Jean Stephenne  head of vaccines  said the drugmaker planned
to work with GAVI  other agencies and governments to identify
financing mechanisms 
  We re exploring a variety of distribution partnerships to
ensure Cervarix will protect women and girls around the globe  
he said 
 Vaccines like Cervarix and Merck   Co s rival product
Gardasil could be particularly valuable in the developing world 
since 80 percent of the 280 000 cervical cancer deaths a year
occur in poor countries 
 But because they are more expensive than standard childhood
vaccines  ensuring widespread use will require concessionary
pricing by drugmakers and smart financing from donors 
 Both Cervarix and Gardasil protect against the sexually
transmitted human papillomavirus  HPV  that causes cervical
cancer

 By Ransdell Pierson
 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    Merck   Co  said
second quarter earnings fell  hurt by lower sales of its
cholesterol drugs  but income from partnerships and a rebound
in sales of asthma drug Singulair helped the drugmaker beat
profit forecasts 
 Merck  whose shares rose 3 8 percent in premarket trading
on Tuesday  earned  1 59 billion  or 74 cents per share  That
compares with  1 77 billion  or 82 cents per share  in the
year earlier period 
 Merck  which plans to acquire Schering Plough Corp 
in coming months  said it earned 83 cents per share  excluding
special items  Analysts on average expected 77 cents  according
to Reuters Estimates 
 Revenue fell 3 percent to  5 90 billion but came in  70
million above the Reuters Estimate forecast  Sales would have
risen 3 percent if not for the strong dollar  which undermines
the value of overseas sales 
 Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Merck s equity
income of  587 million from joint ventures  including its
cholesterol partnership with Schering Plough  was 15 percent
higher than his forecast and helped drive the earnings beat 
 Results were helped by a 10 percent decline in marketing
and administrative expenses  Moreover  the drugmaker s
effective tax rate  excluding special charges and
merger related costs  was 20 4 percent  a benefit of about 5
percentage points due to favorable tax settlements 
 A bright spot in the earnings report was Singulair  Merck s
asthma drug whose sales have steadily declined in the past year
due to safety concerns  Its quarterly sales jumped 16 percent
to  1 3 billion 
 Sales of Januvia  a relatively new diabetes treatment  rose
38 percent to  462 million 
 But combined sales of cholesterol fighters Zetia and
Vytorin  sold in partnership with Schering Plough  fell 10
percent to  1 billion  The drugs have lost favor with many
doctors following a pair of clinical trials that cast doubt on
their effectiveness 
 Results were also hampered by Gardasil  Merck s vaccine
against the virus that causes cervical cancer  Gardasil sales
fell 18 percent to  268 million    hurt by rival vaccine made
by GlaxoSmithKline Plc  
 Merck stuck with its full year 2009 profit forecast of
 3 15 to  3 30 per share excluding special items  and its
full year revenue forecast of  23 2 billion to  23 7 billion

 NEW YORK  June 12  Reuters    Technology shares fell on

 NEW YORK  June 18  Reuters    The Dow and the S P 500 rose
on Thursday following three days of losses as economic data
pointing to stabilization in the job market and improving
regional business conditions lifted investor sentiment 
 Financial shares commanded gains  with Lincoln National up
7 1 percent at  15 96 following an upgrade from Credit Suisse
and the KBW insurance index rose 2 2 percent 
 Discover Financial Services added 6 3 percent to  9 47
after posting a smaller than expected quarterly operating loss
on cost cutting and as growth in bad loans cooled 
 The S P financial index rose 2 1 percent  also reversing
three days of losses 
  Financials are strong and I still think the market
revolves around financials   said Joe Saluzzi  co manager of
trading at Themis Trading in Chatham  New Jersey 
 Government data showed that though initial claims for
jobless benefits exceeded expectations  continued claims
posted their first drop since January  to 6 69 million from a
revised 6 84 million the previous week  and marked the largest
one week drop in that series since November 2001 
 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve s business activity index
for the Mid Atlantic region in June was still negative  but
was much better than economists  expectations and the survey s

203580,425096,MRK,Nektar Bristol Myers  Combo Trial Positive In Phase I II,opinion,"Nektar Therapeutics   NASDAQ NKTR   along with partner Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   announced positive interim data from dose escalation part of a phase I II study  evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of its lead candidate  NKTR 214  with Bristol Myers  Opdivo  nivolumab   The combination therapy is being evaluated for treatment of patients with melanoma  renal cell carcinoma and non small cell lung cancers  NSCLC  
Data from the study was presented at the 2017 annual meeting of Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer  SITC  
Notably in September last year  Nektar had entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers for evaluating the Opdivo NKTR 214 combination therapy across five tumor types  melanoma  kidney  colorectal  bladder and non small cell lung cancer  and eight potential indications in phase I II studies  While both companies share cost of the combination studies equally  Nektar retains the global commercial rights to NKTR 214 
Nektar s shares have significantly outperformed the  so far this year  The stock has skyrocketed 164 9  while the industry has increased 0 9  

The PIVOT 02 phase I II study was conducted on a total of 38 patients across a number of dose cohorts  Data from the trial demonstrated positive response rates across all three tumor types in both PD L1 positive and PD L1 negative patients The company reported no treatment discontinuation due to adverse events 
Importantly  NKTR 214 is a CD122 biased agonist  while Opdivo is a PD 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor  The two different and complementary mechanisms  which comprise the combination regimen  could provide new treatment options for cancer patients 
We remind investors that Nektar is also conducting a phase I II PROPEL study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR 214 in combination with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Tecentriq  atezolizumab  and Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  pembrolizumab   The PROPEL study complements Nektar s ongoing PIVOT trial 
Earlier in May  Nektar had entered into a research collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceuticals to explore the combination of NKTR 214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda s cancer portfolio Nektar Therapeutics Price

203591,425107,MRK,What s In The Cards For Merck KGaA  MKGAF  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA  is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 earnings results on Nov 9 
Merck KGaA s share price has increased 1 2  year to date  while the  gained 2 4  

The company reports results under three business sectors   Healthcare  Life Science and Performance Materials 
Merck s revenues were driven by sales growth in its Healthcare and Life Science segment in the first half of the year  We expect the positive trend to continue this quarter  Meanwhile  the company is streamlining its Healthcare business to focus on its pipeline of innovative medicines 
During the first half of 2017  the company received approval for Bavencio in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma  mMCC  and advanced bladder cancer in the United States  Moreover  the drug was approved in the EU and Japan for treating mMCC in late September  However  Bavencio hasn t generated any meaningful sales as reported by Merck s partner  Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE    Merck s multiple sclerosis drug  Mavenclad  was also approved in Europe this quarter 
The company continues to develop Bavencio in partnership with Pfizer for several cancer indications 
However  we expect sales of three key drugs  Rebif  Erbitux and Gonal f to be lower this quarter due to continued competitive pressure and price reduction  However  favorable currency movement is expected to positively impact the top line in the third quarter 
Moreover  operating expenses increased during the first half due to new launches and higher pipeline development cost  With the company focusing on the development of an innovative pipeline and launch of Bavencio in new indications and geographies  costs are expected to be higher in the third quarter 
In September  Merck completed the divestment of its Biosimilars business to Fresenius as part of its strategy to become a leading science and technology company  The company is planning to focus on developing its pipeline in oncology  immuno oncology and immunology  Meanwhile  Merck announced that it is also planning a partial or full sale of its consumer health business  which includes a number of leading products in over the counter  OTC  categories 
We expect management to shed light on progress and commercialization plans for Bavencio on the earnings call  It may also provide updates on its strategic plans Merck KGaA Price and Consensus

203592,425108,MRK,Here s What The Takeda Deal Means For the Healthcare,opinion,"Takeda Pharmaceutical  T 4502  just announced that it has teamed up with privately held Portal Instruments  Markets are relatively flat on the news  which isn t overly surprising given the early stage of the program that s at the heart of the collaboration  but the long term potential of the deal could be a real upside driver for Takeda if it materializes as the company hopes it will 
With this in mind  here s a look at the deal  what it means for Takeda and Portal and what to look out for going forward as indicative of successful maturation 
First  a quick introduction to the two companies  For most  Takeda likely doesn t need to be introduced  The company is a circa  45 billion biotechnology and healthcare behemoth headquartered in Osaka  Japan  Its portfolio of products is expansive and is broken down into three broad categories for the purposes of operational reporting   prescription drug  consumer and other 
Portal Instruments  on the other hand  is far less well known 
The company is a Cambridge  Massachusetts startup that has developed a handheld device that injects biologic medicines through a pressurized liquid rather than a needle  The needle was initially developed by a professor at MIT called Ian Hunter  who then founded the company on the back of this single invention and now serves as a board member 
This injection technology remains the company s primary asset and   unsurprisingly   it s the asset that underpins the collaboration between it and Takeda 
So what s involved 
Takeda wants to find out if it can use the technology that Portal has created to enhance the experience for patients that need to receive injections of  or  in some cases  self inject  some of the biologics that the Japanese behemoth has in its portfolio 
The justification for this sort of alternative delivery is pretty simple  For many  having needles in the home is not desirable  Aside from the associated stigma around needle use  concerns include an innate dislike of needles  the inconvenience of disposing of needles and  safety around needle use which is especially worrisome when children live in the home  Some people also suffer from needle phobia and even those that don t generally experience some degree of elevated stress associated with needle based administration 
If Portal can show that its device can achieve the same delivery goals as a needle  it has the potential to totally change the way certain biologics are delivered  Of course  Portal is privately held  so there s no direct exposure available to the technology right now 
And that s where Takeda comes into the equation 
The company could set itself aside from its peers in the self injectable biologics space   we re talking versus companies like Merck  NYSE MRK   Astrazeneca  NYSE AZN  and Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY    if it can show that the device works  Whether there s any exclusivity associated with the arrangement isn t clear  but at a glance  it looks like there isn t  Takeda has paid an undisclosed upfront sum for rights to use the asset with its own portfolio and Portal is eligible to receive up to  100 million in future milestone payments if and when the injection technology proves viable with Takeda s biologics 
Going needle free has long been a goal of the healthcare space but   as yet   the viscosity of certain biologics has made it difficult to achieve  With this MIT born technology  Takeda and Portal could be taking the first steps towards a major shift in the global healthcare space ",2017-11-08,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-what-the-latest-takeda-deal-means-for-the-healthcare-space-200263560,200263560

203603,425119,MRK,Merck s Keytruda Failure Dims Prospects,opinion,"The last few days have been a disaster for pharmaceutical giant Merck  NYSE MRK  in the aftermath of the company s earnings report and news about its key wonder drug   reported that Merck suffered on Friday and Monday its  biggest 2 day selloff since February 2009   The company lost 11 5 percent of its value in those two days before hovering around  55 for most of Tuesday  If that was not bad enough  Merck has lost 6 6 percent of its value year to date while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 18 percent 
Merck s recent fall is the product of a disappointing earnings report as well as delays in the testing of its key lung cancer drug Keytruda  In addition  Merck withdrew its application to market Keytruda in Europe  signaling that regulators there are not comfortable with the drug 
Merck is a large drug company  and these delays regarding Keytruda could just be short term prudence which will pay off in the long run  But buyers should look elsewhere for now  Merck has questions it must answer regarding Keytruda and other facets of its business before it can be viewed as an opportunity  
The Keytruda Problem
Understanding Merck s current problems and long term potential requires understanding Keytruda s problems  As noted above  Keytruda is a lung cancer drug which is supposed to work in conjunction with chemotherapy to help patients  and is the only FDA approved immunotherapy drug on the market  albeit only for certain groups and not the general public  A  last Friday noted that lung cancer is the most lucrative oncology market by far  and Keytruda s sales in the United States eclipsed  1 billion last quarter for the first time  However  Merck s de
cision to withdraw its European application and its U S  testing delays is a major blow towards Keytruda s growth prospects 
Investors still expect Keytruda s value to grow despite these setbacks  For example  Benzinga reports that a    0Barclays   investors which recently downgraded its valuation of Merck still holds that Keytruda sales will hit  5 4 billion in 2018 and  6 6 billion in 2019  But this is about 10 percent lower than the estimates before the announcement 
Furthermore  delays in Keytruda s general approval allows other medical firms more time to catch up with Merck and finish developing their lung cancer immunotherapy drugs  Merck had solidly beaten competitors Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  and Roche Holding AG Participation  SIX ROG  in cancer drug tests earlier this year  but both of those companies could come out with further lung cancer drug data later this year or in early 2018  While neither of those companies are likely to surpass Merck  Merck could find itself as just another competitor in the lung drug oncology market instead of having a solid lead like investors had anticipated 
Optimistic investors interested in business capital could interpret Merck s delays as the company taking the time to make sure that its drugs work  and thus sacrificing short term benefits to ensure the long term efficiency of such an important drug  But the reality is that the Keytruda news is a major setback for a firm which could ill afford further bad news  
Further Bad News
While the Keytruda failure is disappointing  it is not the only concern which investors should have about Merck  After all  the company s stock had not performed well over the year even before these announcements 
The major reasons why investors have been so fixated on Keytruda is that it represents Merck s best chance to get out of its growth slump as shown in its earnings report  In that report  Merck s 3Q 2017 sales declined by 2 percent compared to the same quarter 12 months ago and pharmaceutical sales declined by 3 percent 
Merck states that the sales decline is due to losses from a June cyberattack which shut down production  reduced sales  and forced them to borrow drugs from the United States government and thus wants to claim that the decline is a temporary factor  But even if that is the case  they still need to discuss future growth prospects beyond Keytruda as well as a foray into animal health   Merck could perhaps increase revenue through acquisitions such as Cubist Pharmaceuticals and it will be okay as long as it has a steady supply of drugs  But okay does not mean great or growing  
Long Term Potential   Maybe
Despite the stock collapse and Merck s various issues  investors holding Merck stock should have some reason for optimism  The stock will likely rebound somewhat soon and Keytruda will still be successful even if expectations have dropped 
But until Merck can show that it will grow again  particularly through further Keytruda sales  expecting a real bounce back in the near future is not realistic  especially as Merck has been struggling since the beginning of the year  Analysts are right to slash their forecasts  and this is a stock probably not worth picking up for now  Only consider it if you plan to hold it for an extremely long time  and have confidence that Keytruda s success will make the eventual struggles worthwhile ",2017-11-01,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mercks-keytruda-failure-dims-prospects-200257701,200257701

203653,425169,MRK,Agenus  AGEN  Remains Focused On Drug Development Programs,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Agenus Inc    NASDAQ AGEN   on Sep 26  2017 Notably  Agenus is an immuno oncology company focused on the discovery and development of checkpoint modulators  vaccines and adjuvants for the treatment of cancer In fact  the company has collaboration agreements with a number of companies  which not only provide it with funds in the form of upfront and milestone payments and future royalties but also validate the company s proprietary product platform  Agenus has formed collaborations with Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   and Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   to discover and develop multiple checkpoint antibodies In February 2017  Agneus and Incyte amended the agreement  The amended agreement converts the ongoing GITR and OX40 antibody programs from co funded development and profit sharing arrangements to royalty bearing programs Per the agreement  Incyte will be responsible for funding and conducting global development and commercialization  When any of the two candidates from either of these two programs are approved  Agenus would be entitled to receive 15  royalties on global net sales of each approved product Following the amended agreement  Agenus received accelerated milestone payments of  20 million from Incyte related to the clinical development of INCAGN1876  anti GITR agonist  and INCAGN1949  anti OX40 agonist   Across all programs in the collaboration  Agenus will be eligible to receive up to a total of  510 million for future potential development  regulatory and commercial milestones The company s collaboration agreements with players like Incyte and Merck not only validate its technology platforms but also provide the company with funds In fact  we note that the company s QS 21 Stimulon adjuvant is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   and is a key component in multiple GSK vaccine programs that target prophylactic or therapeutic impact in a variety of infectious diseases and cancer Moreover  Agenus  efforts in developing Prophage vaccine for glioblastoma multiforme are encouraging  It is also exploring different options to advance the Prophage vaccine into a phase III study in newly diagnosed GBM either alone or in collaboration with a third party  Also  the company is looking for partners to fund studies with plans of retaining commercialization rights in the United States The company announced its strategic decision to spin off its cell therapy businesses as a separate unit  Also  it has made this decision so that it can make smaller teams that can entirely focus on getting the products approved  We expect the combined value of the separate companies will far exceed the perceived value under one roof  going forward   However  Agenus has no approved product in its portfolio  With only a few candidates in mid stages of development  including Prophage Series vaccine and a number of QS 21 Stimulon containing vaccine candidates  the company is still a few years away from bringing a product to market  Any hiccup in the development process of these candidates may weigh heavily on the stock  Agenus is highly dependent on its partners for the development of its candidates More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ,2017-09-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/agenus-agen-remains-focused-on-drug-development-programs-200215970,200215970

A partial hold was put due to emerging safety data from clinical trials evaluating Merck   Co   NYSE MRK   Keytruda in combination with Celgene Corporation s   NASDAQ CELG   Revlimid and Pomalyst  We note that the FDA had put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program by Celgene 
The FDA is currently evaluating all ongoing blood cancer trials investigating an anti PD1 PDL1 drug in combination with an immunomodulatory drug in order determine if it is a class wide  anti PD1 PDL1  concern in multiple myeloma blood cancers or a specific concern with certain combinations with immunomodulatory drugs 
The two studies include cohorts evaluating Tecentriq in combination with an immunomodulatory medicine  IMiDs  in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma 
As a result of the partial clinical hold  patients who are currently enroled in these trials and are deriving clinical benefit may continue to receive treatment  but no additional patients will be enroled 
We note that the FDA granted accelerated approval to immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq in May 2016 for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  Initial uptake of the drug has been encouraging  In October 2016  Tecentriq became the first and only anti PDL1 cancer immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC 
The FDA recently granted accelerated approval to Tecentriq for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  mUC  who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy  The drug was previously approved for patients suffering from locally advanced or mUC who have disease progression during or following any platinum containing chemotherapy  or within 12 months of receiving chemotherapy before surgery  neoadjuvant  or after surgery  adjuvant  
The news comes as a disappointment as label expansion of the drug will boost sales  Roche s stock has gained 14 1  against the  s gain of 19 4  in the year so far

203681,425197,MRK,Roche  RHHBY  Announces Positive Data On Leukemia Drug ,opinion,"Roche Holdings AG   OTC RHHBY   announced positive results from the phase III study  MURANO 
The study evaluated Venclexta in combination with Rituxan in patients suffering from relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL   Data showed that the study met its primary endpoint as the results depicted a statistically significant improvement in the time patients lived without their disease progressing or progression free survival  PFS   when treated with Venclexta plus Rituxan compared to Treanda plus Rituxan 
We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie  Inc   NYSE ABBV    Both the companies are commercializing the drug in the United States while AbbVie will commercialize outside the country 
We remind investors that the FDA approved Venclexta in April 2016 for the treatment of people with CLL  who have received at least one prior therapy  with 17p deletion  as detected by an FDA approved test  The FDA also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Venclexta in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL based on promising results from the phase Ib M13 365 study 
The company is conducting MURANO study to convert the current accelerated approval of Venclexta to a full approval  Data from this study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to global health authorities 
As per estimates  there will be more than 20 000 new cases of CLL diagnosed in the United States in 2017  CLL is the most common type of adult leukemia  Hence  a potential approval for this indication will boost sales potential 
Roche s hematology portfolio includes approved drugs like MabThera Rituxan  Gazyva  Tecentriq  and Venclexta along with pipeline candidates  polatuzumab vedotin RG7596  and a small molecule antagonist of MDM2  idasanutlin RG7388  
Last week  the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on a phase Ib and phase I II b trials evaluating immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq due to safety issues  A partial hold was put due to emerging safety data from clinical trials evaluating Merck   Co    NYSE MRK   Keytruda in combination with Celgene Corp  s   NASDAQ CELG   Revlimid and Pomalyst  We note that the FDA had put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program by Celgene 

 
Roche s stock has gained 13 6  compared with the  s gain of 19 4  in the year so far 
Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market  The company dominates the breast cancer space due to the strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla  However  sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline  Generic competition for Xeloda continues to hurt sales  Competition from biosimilars looms large on Roche s key drugs like Herceptin  Avastin and Rituxan

203723,425239,MRK,Here s How Takeda Pharmaceutical Is Trying To Dominate Immuno Oncology,opinion,"Takeda Pharmaceutical  OTC TKPYY   TKPYY   one of the biggest healthcare companies in the world and arguably the most well known and most respected of the Japanese pharmaceutical giants  just announced the signing of an agreement that will see it team up with a company called Shattuck Labs in the oncology space  The latter is a privately held company based out of Austin  Texas and is the latest in a line of tiny healthcare entities with which Takeda has struck an alliance 
With Shattuck being a relatively small entity  there is limited information available as to the technology that underpins the collaboration between it and Takeda  As such  the implications for Takeda and its shareholders as far as how this deal might play out are concerned are a little bit murky  With that said  however  a bit of digging can offer some clarity  especially as regards to the concept that Takeda is hoping will provide it with the next generation of cancer therapies 
With this in mind  here is a look at the science that underpins Takeda and Shattuck s latest collaboration with an attempt to figure out what it might mean for shareholders if and when it plays out successfully or otherwise going forward 
The easiest way to tackle this is from the top down  so let s start with a look at immunotherapy  Cancer immunotherapy aims to harness the immune system of the patient in an attempt to stimulate the body  or more accurately  the body s natural response to pathogens  to attack  kill and remove cancer cells  There are many different approaches to doing this  but they generally involve one of three high level concepts  The first is rooted in teaching the immune system to recognize cancer cells through some sort of antibody based engineering  The second is through the removal of a cancer cell s natural ability to hide itself from the immune system  The third is the stimulation of the immune system to such a degree that  regardless of the ability of the cancer cell to hide itself  the cells in question are overpowered and destroyed as appropriate 
Most immunotherapy types harness one of these high level concepts 
Shattuck has developed a technology that it calls its Agonist Redirected Checkpoint  ARC  platform and the latest collaboration is rooted in certain assets that are born out of this platform  The way it works is by combining two binding domains to create fusion proteins that potentially restore and enhance immune system function in a single construct  In other words  the platform is able to create immunotherapy assets that combine two or more of the three high level concepts outlined above and   in doing so   develop a treatment that should theoretically be more effective than a single asset on its own 
And there is evidence to suggest that this is the case   redirects to a healthcare conference at Boston back in May this year  at which Taylor Schreiber  CSO of Shattuck  gave an example of how the technology works and a real life application  Specifically  he discussed a drug that simultaneously blocks signaling through PD 1 and activates signaling through OX40  For those not familiar with these two treatment approaches  PD 1 is rooted in a cancer s ability to hide itself from the immune system  Blocking signaling through PD 1 reveals the cancer cells to our natural attack cells  T cells  etc   
OX40 is rooted in the signaling of the immune system to come and attack cancer cells  Through the upregulation of OX40  the immune system should be able to overwhelm cancerous cells and remove them from the body far more efficiently than might otherwise be the case 
As mentioned  normal drugs would only use one of these approaches  With Shattuck s ARC technology  the idea is to use both at the same time and provide a sort of 360  therapy 
So where does Takeda to come into this 
The collaboration sees Takeda team up with Shattuck on two pre clinical and four discovery stage programs  The Japanese pharma giant will provide funding for pre clinical and clinical development and will have the option to take an exclusive license to further develop and commercialize up to four ARC molecules resulting from the collaboration 
The idea  then  is that Takeda is trying to harness this technology in an attempt to get a jump on some of its healthcare giant competitors in the space 
Immunotherapy  as things stand  is dominated by companies like AstraZeneca PLC  AZN  and Merck   Co   Inc   NYSE MRK   The majority of the treatments offered by these two companies  however  and this includes those in their respective development pipelines  are single approach immunotherapy assets  If Takeda can use Shattuck s ARC technology to demonstrate that a double pronged approach is more effective than a single  then it could become a front runner in oncology very quickly 
Of course  these are early stage assets and there is no guarantee that they will ever reach the clinic  never mind commercialization  With that said  however  we were saying the same thing about immune oncology as little as a decade ago ",2017-08-15,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-how-takeda-pharmaceutical-is-trying-to-dominate-immunooncology-200207263,200207263

Selling  general and administrative expenses were  40 7 million  up 13 7  driven by an increase in headcount connected with the build out and support of the commercial organization in the U S  an increase in legal costs  and an increase in consulting and outside services to support marketing activities 
Pipeline Update
The company continues to focus on the commercialization of Cabometyx in the U S  Exelixis plans to file a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for cabozantinib as a treatment for previously untreated patients with advanced RCC in third quarter 2017 based on the positive data from the randomized phase II trial  CABOSUN  An independent radiology review committee has confirmed the primary efficacy endpoint results of investigator assessed progression free survival  PFS  in the CABOSUN trial  As per the analysis from the committee  Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in the rate of disease progression or death as measured by PFS 
During the first quarter  Exelixis inked agreements with The Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   and Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   to collaborate on the development of cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents  Exelixis and Bristol Myers initiated a phase III trial  CheckMate 9ER  in Jul 2017 
Exelixis has also initiated the dose escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq  The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  UC  or RCC 
In Mar 2017  the FDA granted cabozantinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of HCC  A phase III trial  CELESTIAL is currently ongoing in patients with advanced HCC  The company now expects completing the second intermin analysis at 75  of the events in the second half of 2017 
Meanwhile  Exelixis and Roche have agreed to revise the revenue and cost sharing arrangement for commercialization of the other drug in the former s portfolio  Cotellic in the U S 
Roche also announced that IMspire150 TRILOGY  which evaluates the combination of Cotellic  Tecentriq  and Xelboraf in first line BRAF V600 mutation positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma  enrolled its first patient in Jan 2017 while IMspire170  the trial evaluating the combination of Cotellic and Tecentriq versus Merck   Co   Inc  s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda in first line BRAF wild type metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma  is likely to enroll its first patient in the third quarter of this year 
2017 Guidance
Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of  290  310 million  This guidance includes about  25 million of non cash costs and expenses related primarily to stock based compensation expense  R D expense is projected to increase in the second half of 2017 due to initiation of combination studies 
Our Take
Exelixis  second quarter results were impressive where in both earnings and sales beat estimates  The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales is a positive for the company thereby underlying the increasing demand for the drug  Going forward  we expect investor on further label expansion of cabozantinib and Cotellic  A potential label expansion in first line RCC will significantly boost the growth prospects 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

Is this really the time for a Congressional vacation

The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  via Jill Mislinski 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
Personal Note
I ll be back from vacation tomorrow  It was a refreshing trip  and I have some interesting new ideas for posts  Toronto is a great city with a vibrant community 
The News
The economic news has continued in the mildly positive trend  New home sales and consumer confidence showed strength last week  Most important has been the earnings news 
Earnings season has continued strong with energy living up to its great expectations for the most part  while the three largest S P sectors by market capitalization  Technology   20    Financials   16    and Healthcare   15 00   are reporting strong earnings growth 
As Brian Gilmartin at Fundamentalis explains in his article last week    the largest sectors reporting the best earnings growth often makes for bull markets  Over half of S P 500 constituents  57   have reported actual results for Q2 so far  and of those about three quarters are reporting EPS above estimates compared to a five year average  Actual sales reports show similar above estimate results for about three quarters of companies reporting 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
The calendar is a busy one this week  with numerous important data points coming in such as Employment  ISM Manufacturing and Non Manufacturing PMI  as well as Auto Sales reporting 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  Here are the main US releases 

Next Week s Theme
There is plenty to talk about  with employment taking center stage  The big economic weeks have not led to much volatility this year  and this will probably not be different 
There is an interesting counter theme  The Congressional recess  There is plenty of work undone  most urgently the debt limit   asked Congress to deal with the debt limit before the recess  While he has found extraordinary measures to keep the government going through September  it comes with a cost 
I expect this subject and stories about meetings with constituents will raise the question 
Is this really an appropriate time for a Congressional vacation 
As usual  I ll have more in my Final Thought

The Indicator Snapshot

Watch Out
 on two vastly different views of Universal Display  NASDAQ OLED  are examined  Heavily endorsed by Jim Cramer as the company which will dominate the organic light emitting diode space for year to come  UDC s recent success stems both from such promotion  as well as from OLEDs having become the new  it  material for electronic displays 
As notable short seller Manuel Asensio mentions  however  UDC s key patents expire in December 2017  and their OLEDs based on the rare earth iridium can t display blue light nearly as efficiently as the potential touted for OLED technology  According to Sensio UDC faces stiff competition for this lucrative market  and is likely to lose its dominant position by the end of 2018 as large industry players like Merck  NYSE MRK   Panasonic  and LG bring new OLED technology to bear as well as compete in UDC s iridium home field  To say Cramer and Asensio have differing opinions on UDC s management would be an understatement

team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Merck  NYSE       Citigroup  NYSE      and AstraZeneca  NYSE       These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Merck shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the last year  gaining  10 6  versus the industry s  1 9  decline  This momentum reflects the progress it has made with product pipeline  Merck beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the second quarter  backed primarily by strong sales of PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda While generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressures as are material in the Merck story as they are for many of its peers  the Zacks analyst points out that the company s new products like Keytruda and Zepatier hold great potential  Also  Merck will continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to overhang on the top line  The Zacks analyst discusses all of these issues in the updated research report issued today  You can  Shares of Citigroup shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the last six months  gaining  20 4  vs  5   The company s second quarter 2017 earnings outpaced expectations riding on higher revenues  However  expenses and costs of credit escalated  The Fed s recent approval to the company s 2017 capital plan also remains encouraging Moreover  the recently approved Financial Choice Act will act as a tailwind for the company in coming quarters  However  several issues including Citigroup s litigation pressures are cause for concern  Moreover  in spite of rising rates  margin is under pressure  due to persistent decline in the company s legacy holdings portfolio The Zacks analyst likes the company s restructuring and streamlining efforts  strategic investments in core business and expense management  which should support profitability  going forward  You can  AstraZeneca s shares have gained  10 3  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals sector which has gained  10 5  over the same period  Despite doing well this year  the stock plunged sharply after the company announced the failure of a pivotal first line lung cancer study  MYSTIC  on Imfinzi  AstraZeneca s second quarter results were mixed with earnings beating estimates but sales remaining in line Core products like Nexium and Crestor are facing generic competition  which is hurting sales growth  However  AstraZeneca s newer drugs like Tagrisso and Brilinta should keep contributing to the top line  Meanwhile  cost cutting initiatives should drive the bottom line AstraZeneca also has a promising late stage pipeline that includes immuno oncology candidates  Imfinzi s approval in May 2017 for bladder cancer was encouraging  The Zacks analyst is enthused by the fact that the company expects a lot of activity on the regulatory and pipeline front in the second half of 2017  You can  Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HSBC  NYSE      and Sprint  NYSE      Zacks

Quarterly revenues plunged 84 9  year over year to  5 9 million  This top line deterioration was mainly due to the recognition of a milestone payment of  35 million in the second quarter of 2016  pursuant to an agreement with Novartis   NYSE NVS   for development of ADU S100 in combination with anti PD1 checkpoint inhibitor

A smart combo for next gen immunotherapy
The premise of PD 1 inhibition is that it enables the body to leverage a natural T cell mediated immune response against cancer cells  However  only 16  of patients with head and neck cancer respond to Keytruda  potentially because they lack natural targeting of T cells to their cancer  PDS0101 s ability to specifically sensitise T cells to cancer antigens without significant toxicity therefore has the potential to unlock significant synergies with PD 1 inhibitors  such as Keytruda

203790,425306,MRK,2 Companies Making Breakthroughs At The Cutting Edge Of Healthcare,opinion,"Modern medicine has brought with it a large number of breakthrough scientific developments over the past decade  each of which has changed the way individuals in a range of patient populations receive care  Many of these breakthroughs have translated to considerable upside revaluations for the companies spearheading them  With this in mind  here are two companies that are on the edge of breakthrough developments in biotechnology and healthcare space  each of which could be about to  or might already have  change the face of the sector 
The two companies in focus are VBI Vaccines Inc  NASDAQ VBIV  and Merck   Co   Inc   NYSE MRK  
VBI Vaccines  VBIV  is a US based biotechnology company with a pipeline that spans a host of different indications  ranging from infectious diseases to oncology  The company s lead asset is a hepatitis B vaccine called SciBVac  which is currently approved in 15 regions globally and about to embark on a multi region phase III study designed to underpin an approval in the US  Europe and Canada  This asset isn t what qualifies it for this list  however 
Instead  the novel mechanism of action that earns VBI top spot on this list forms the basis of a drug designed to treat a condition called glioblastoma multiforme  or GBM  which is the most common form of brain cancer and is incredibly difficult to treat 
The current standard of care  SOC  therapy in this indication is surgical resection initially  followed by a traditional combination of chemotherapy and radiation treatment  With brain cancer  however  and especially as relates to GBM  the cancerous cells develop into a sort of tentacle like formation that spreads deep into the brain  This makes surgical resection incredibly difficult and  in turn  limits the efficacy of the subsequent chemotherapy and radiation treatment 
So where does VBI come into the picture 
The company is developing a vaccine for a virus called cytomegalovirus  or CMV  The vaccine is a recombinant DNA type vaccine  built using VBI s proprietary envelope Virus Like Particle  or eVLP  platform  and employs a selection of antigens unique to the CMV virus to stimulate the production of CMV specific antibodies in the patient receiving the drug 
Concurrent to this program  the company is also adapting the CMV associated MOA to potentially target GBM based on a body of historical evidence that suggests a link between this form of brain cancer and the CMV viruses 
Specifically  evidence suggests that GBM cancer cells express an antigen that is also expressed by the CMV virus  Using this commonality  the company has created a vaccine that instructs the immune system to create antibodies specific to this expression  Once these antibodies are created  they circulate systemically looking for any cells that express an antigen normally associated with CMV  but also  in this instance associated with GBM  The circulating antibodies recognize the GBM cells as pathogenic   as if they were CM infected cells   and signals the rest of the immune system   T cells  macrophages  etc    to attack and clean up 
What s interesting about this one  then  is that VBI is using the traditional approach to prophylaxis vaccination and adapting it to form the basis of a cancer therapy  If the company can get this asset through the clinical development pathway and successfully past the FDA in the US  it will be the first time a company has used a crossover approach like this to underpin the MOA of a commercialized asset 
This is an early stage program right now  with the company focused primarily on advancing its registration trial for the above noted hepatitis B asset from a resource allocation perspective  With that noted  a phase I study in this indication is underway and we should see some indication of progress   and potential clinical benefit   during 2018 
Next up is Merck  MRK  
Many reading will likely already be familiar with Merck s blockbuster oncology asset  Keytruda  The drug  which first picked up approval in the US at the turn of the decade  has quickly expanded by way of various supplemental New Drug Applications  sNDAs  into a well established SOC in no small cell lung cancer  breast cancer  melanoma and more 
In terms of its impact on the oncology space  it s proven a breakthrough therapy  During June  however  the FDA made a landmark decision that earns the drug not just the title of breakthrough  but potentially revolutionary in the cancer space  and by proxy  earns Merck and Keytruda a spot on this list 
Those familiar with the mechanics of oncology will likely already be familiar with the concept of tumour specific genetic mutations  For those not yet familiar with this concept  the idea is that all cancers  whatever the type  are rooted in a specific genetic mutation  The genetic mutation results in a damaged DNA sequence that  in turn  results in faulty cell production  The production of damaged cells from faulty DNA  as caused by a genetic mutation at mRNA stage  translates to the unchecked proliferation we commonly associate with cancer  and which forms the basis of tumor growth in tissue 
Putting that concept aside for a moment  current SOC treatment in oncology is tissue specific  That is  a physician determines the best course of treatment for a patient based on the tissue in which the cancer resides   breast  pancreas  brain  bone etc  This is somewhat effective  but scientists have long theorized that a more accurate method of treatment allocation might be rooted in the specific genetic mutation that caused the cancer  as opposed to the tissue in which the cancer resides 
Breast cancer can be rooted in the same genetic mutation as lung cancer  for example  but as things stand  a physician will generally prescribe a different course of treatment for each  This is because  up until recently  no company has been able to come up with a drug that has demonstrated efficacy in patients with the same mutation derived cancer  regardless of tissue type  With Keytruda  Merck has done just that 
Well  it s technically not Merck that has proved the concept  The company supplied a consortium of research entities  primarily consisting of Universities in the US  with Keytruda for the latter to conduct a study  and the NIH funded the investigation  The goal was to prove the above hypothesis  The trial investigated the efficacy of Keytruda as administered across a spate of different solid tumor cancers in   importantly   late stage patients  That is patients that have already undergone the SOC combination of chemotherapy and radio action as well as  in many cases  various courses of immunotherapy  In other words  these are patients that have no options available to them outside of a palliative care environment and   in many cases   have weeks or months at the outside to live 
The study enrolled a little over 80 patients based on a specific combination of mutations and gave them all a course of Keytruda  It didn t matter sort of cancer these patients had  so long as it is a solid tumor cancer   only that the cancer was rooted in one of the two specific mutations in question 
In June  the research consortium published the results in the online Journal of Oncology and the results were incredible 
Of the 86 patients enrolled in the study  77  demonstrated stable disease  defined as tumor regression or tumor stability  i e  The tumor got smaller or didn t grow any bigger   In 17  of the patients  the tumor disappeared altogether 
It s difficult to get across how important these results are  Patients with this sort of advanced solid tumor cancer generally see stable disease rates in the single digit percentage bracket  One in ten lives more than five years  In the study outlined above  more than three out of every four patients saw their cancer stop advancing or recede  Just say of one in five were essentially cured   defined as cancer free at follow up  Of course  cancer can return  but this far from negates the importance of this outcome 
In short  this study has shown that mutation specific cancer treatment can stop cancer to a degree that no other type of therapy has been able to before  and can do so in very late stage patients across a spectrum of tissue type cancers 
This is a huge step forward in the oncology landscape  and the FDA agrees  In an unprecedented move  the agency in the US looked at the published data  remember  this data wasn t published by a company and the trial wasn t investigator sponsored  and immediately approved Keytruda as a spectrum wide cancer therapy for patients with the two specific mutations in question 
Expect this approval to bring with it a wave of development stage programs designed to build on the success of Keytruda and bring more mutation specific oncology therapies to market over the next decade ",2017-07-03,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/two-companies-making-breakthroughs-at-the-cutting-edge-of-healthcare-200198919,200198919

The FDA asked the Advisory Committees to discuss the pre  and post marketing data about the abuse of Opana ER as well as the product s overall risk benefit profile  The abuse of generic oxymorphone ER and oxymorphone immediate release  IR  products were to be evaluated as well  Few members stated that the benefits are now overshadowed by the continuing public health concerns around the product s misuse  abuse and diversion 
Thereafter  the FDA directed the company to remove the drug from the market in Jun 2017  The move comes in wake of the widespread opioid abuse epidemic 
Opana ER is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily  around the clock  long term treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate 
In Dec 2011  the FDA approved a new formulation which had the same dosage strengths  color and packaging  Also  the tablet s size remains the same as the original 
Consequently  the company expects to incur a pre tax impairment charge of approximately  20 million in the second quarter of 2017 to write off the remaining net book value of its drug  Sales of the drug were  158 9 million for 2016 and  35 7 million for the first quarter 2017 
Hence  withdrawing the drug from the market will advserly impact the topline  Nevertheless  Endo continues to believe in safety  efficacy and favorable benefit risk profile of OpanaER 

Following the news  the company s shares declined 1 9   Shares of Endo have underperformed the Zacks classified  industry year to date  The stock was down 32 6  compared with the industry s gain of 5 9

203807,425323,MRK,Nanoco Group  First Commercial Orders ,opinion,"Nanoco Group  LON NANON  has received its first commercial order for CFQD resin from the company s film partner  Wah Hong  Just as importantly  the CFQD product is now being evaluated by 13 major OEMs for 16 programmes  This gives confidence that revenues are now set to ramp up  as more programs progress through the pipeline and shipment volumes increase  We leave our estimates unchanged and highlight that  while it is still early stages  it does not take aggressive assumptions for earnings to scale and the rating to look very inexpensive  We believe a substantial re rating upwards would be justified as support for our estimates further solidifies 

Seminal moment   pipeline suggests more to come
This is a seminal  and long awaited moment in Nanoco s evolution  The commercialisation process has been protracted  involving a number of steps from initial NDA sales approval  technical specification  technical approval  with a number of iterations  and then commercial negotiations  The good news is that the company is progressing 16 programmes through this commercialisation funnel with 13 OEMs up from 14 and nine respectively in April  Of these we understand that at least four programmes  each of which can supply into multiple models  have progressed to the technical approval stage  Consequently  we should see more programmes progress to commercial orders over the course of this calendar year  Notably  these figures exclude developments with Dow   which according to press reports is now working with two film manufacturers   Kolon  KDX and Merck  NYSE MRK   which is aiming to have its plant operational by the end of 2018

  The editor decided that Potash Corp   POT  was a good way to play the agriculture space as planting season arrives  Shares jumped after the company reported an 80  positive surprise in its late April report  but have since pulled back  He added POT with a 12  allocation as he expects it to move higher again 
  All the cool kids are drinking craft beers these days  which was proved when Craft Brew Alliance  BREW  reported a positive surprise of 50  earlier this month  The stock moved higher after the report but is now hanging around  16  It was added to the portfolio today with a 14  allocation and expectations of moving as high as  20 eventually 
  Same kind of story for Quaker Chemical  KWR   The company surprised to the upside by 12  and then pulled back after an initial move higher  Jeremy added it with a 14  allocation ahead of the next leg higher  But this time he strongly suggests that you use limit orders  since this is a very low volume stock 
The full commentary has a lot more on all these moves Healthcare Innovators  One of the most exciting areas of medical research right now is Immuno Oncology  which uses the body s own immune system to attack malignant cancer cells  Kevin has been looking to get into this space for a while  and today he picked up Incyte  INCY  after reading some encouraging analyst reviews on its data  The company is closest to bringing an IDO inhibitor to market  which has caught the attention of bigger leaders in the space like Bristol Myers and Merck  NYSE MRK   INCY is now a key R D partner of these giants  By the way  the editor is so high on this area that he also bought NewLink Genetics  NLNK   which is a younger  less accomplished version of INCY  Read a lot more about these moves in the full write up Income Investor  The large  multinational companies are having a great year  as they continue to outperform with surging profits quarter after quarter  Its even better if they have a lot of overseas exposure to take advantage of an improving global economy  Neena wants to be part of this lucrative space  so she added iShares Global ETF  IOO  on Friday  The fund invests about 60  of its assets in the U S  and the rest in foreign companies  It also has a decent dividend yield of 2 5   Read the full writeup for more Momentum Trader   As I figured  the market quietly went off into the holiday  virtually unchanged at the highs  The action today capped quiet but positive week for the market as equities rebounded nicely from the spike in volatility last week  The President will finish up his foreign trip and should be back next week to further his tax reform and health care agendas   It seems that the market is increasingly disinterested in what s happening on Capitol Hill  The focus has shifted towards earnings and the Fed  We re on track for a June hike and that s settled down several stomachs   Sleepy end to the week ahead of the holiday weekend  This solemn holiday serves as the unofficial kickoff to summer but don t forget what it really stands for  We re not getting a day off to cook burgers and dogs on grills  we get a day of remembrance for the brave men and women who fought and died for our freedom      Dave Bartosiak

Merck KGaA s share price has increased 15 5  year to date  while the Zacks classified  industry gained 6 5  

The company reports results under three business sectors   Healthcare  Life Science and Performance Materials 
Strong performance at Life Science  which was the catalyst behind sales growth in the last few quarters  is anticipated to continue in the to be reported quarter  In addition  Merck KGaA s 2015 acquisition of Sigma Aldrich was integrated into the Life Science business  The company expects total synergies from the acquisition to amount to   280 million by end of 2018 instead of the originally planned   260 million per year 
Merck KGaA in Apr 2017 announced an agreement to divest its biosimilars business  which was a part of its Healthcare business sector  to Fresenius  The decision to divest biosimilars is aligned with Merck s strategy for its Healthcare business sector to focus on its pipeline of innovative medicines 
The closing is expected in the second half of 2017  subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions  For the Healthcare sector  the company is counting on its pharmaceutical pipeline and aims to gain approval for one medicine or new indication every year  2017 onwards 
Additionally  the company announced a dividend increase of   0 15 or 14  to   1 20 per share in Apr 2017  The company made this announcement due to higher earnings or following the Sigma acquisition  In fact  the increased dividend represents Merck s strong commitment to deleverage 
Meanwhile  we expect management to shed light on Merck KGaA s pipeline at the conference call 
Currently  Merck KGaA  in collaboration with Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE    is evaluating Bavencio  avelumab  in several phase III studies for indications such as gastric cancer  platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer  bladder cancer and advanced renal cell carcinoma  Notably  in May 2017  the FDA approved Bavencio  Injection for advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  UC  In Apr 2017  the FDA also approved Bavencio for intravenous use  for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma  mMCC  Merck KGaA Price and EPS Surprise   Upcoming Peer Releases

203865,425381,MRK,Incyte  INCY  Announces Positive Data On Enzyme Inhibitor,opinion,"Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   recently announced that new data was published online from the ongoing trial  ECHO 202 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  in advance of its annual meeting in Chicago  IL  June 2 6  2017 
The trial is evaluating Incyte s selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor  epacadostat  in combination with Merck s   NYSE MRK   anti PD 1 therapy  Keytruda  pembrolizumab  
Patients previously treated with anti PD 1 or anti CTLA 4 therapies were excluded from this trial 
The data from the trial includes phase I II efficacy and safety data from the following cohorts  non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   renal cell carcinoma  RCC   bladder cancer  squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  SCCHN   triple negative breast cancer  TNBC   and ovarian cancer  OVC   The results from new data showed that epacadostat in combination with Keytruda was well tolerated and preliminary efficacy outcomes for these cohorts demonstrate encouraging clinical activity  both within and across tumor types  which compares favorably with contemporary data in the second line setting 
Concurrently  data from the ECHO 204 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of epacadostat  in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb s   NYSE BMY   PD 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo  The results show that the combination was well tolerated across the studied patients and demonstrates promising clinical responses  particularly in melanoma and with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  SCCHN    The combination is also being evaluated ovarian cancer  OVC   and colorectal cancer  CRC  

Following the news Incyte s shares gained 2 3   Notably  in the past one year the company s shares have rallied 68 8   while the Zacks classified  industry fell 5 8  
The successful development of epacadostat will reduce the company s dependence on Jakafi  Incyte s dependence on a single product  Jakafi  for growth is concerning  Lower than expected sales would be a huge setback for the company 
While we are positive on the company s efforts to expand Jakafi s label  any development regulatory setback could pull down the stock significantly  In Feb 2016  Incyte received a notice letter regarding an abbreviated new drug application seeking approval to market a generic version of Jakafi  Earlier than expected entry of generic versions of Jakafi would be a big blow for the company 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
Incyte Corporation currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
A better ranked stock in the health care sector is VIVUS  Inc    NASDAQ VVUS   which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

203877,425393,MRK,Incyte  INCY  Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected  Revenues Beat ,opinion,"Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   reported first quarter 2017 loss of 96 cents  a penny narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 97 cents  Incyte had reported earnings of 12 cents per share in the year ago quarter 
Quarterly revenues were  384 1 million  up 45 8  year over year  and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  353 6 million  The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the U S  and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from ex U S  sales of Jakavi 

Incyte s shares has gained 60 7  in the past one year  while the Zacks classified  industry fell 4 7  
Quarter in Detail
Jakafi sales grew 37   year over year to  251 million  Net product revenue of Iclusig amounted to  14 million  Product royalty revenues from Novartis   NYSE NVS   for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex U S  markets surged 31 8  to  29 million 
Contract revenues rose approximately 55 1  to  90 million 
Research and development  R D  expenses were up significantly to  408 million from  157 million  The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the portfolio as well as upfront and milestone expenses of  209 million related to collaboration and license agreements  Selling  general and administration  SG A  expenses amounted to  87 million  up 33 8  year over year 
2017 Outlook
The company continues to expect Jakafi revenues in the range of  1 020  1 070 million  Iclusig revenues are expected in the range of  60  65 million 
R D expenses are now expected in the range of  1 1 1 billion  up from the earlier forecast of 990 million  1 040 million  SG A expenses are still expected in the range of  340  360 million 
Pipeline Update
A phase III trial evaluating Jakafi in patients with graft versus host disease  GVHD  is underway while the pivotal program evaluating Jakfai in patients with essential thrombocythemia  ET  is likely to be initiated soon  A phase III trial  REACH3 evaluating Jakafi as a treatment for patients with steroid refractory chronic GVHD is expected to begin in 2017 
Incyte also expanded its collaboration with Merck   NYSE MRK    growing the pivotal program studying epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab to a total of five tumor types  Incyte and Merck will advance four additional tumor types beyond melanoma   non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   bladder  renal and head   neck cancers   across six phase III trials  These trials are expected to begin in 2017 Additionally  Incyte expanded its collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   evaluating epacadostat in combination with nivolumab in pivotal studies in two tumor types 
The European Commission approved Olumiant in Feb 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to  or who are intolerant to  one or more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs  DMARDs   However  the company suffered a setback when the FDA issued a complete response letter  CRL  for baricitinib in which the FDA indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate doses  The FDA further stated that additional data are necessary to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms Incyte Corporation Price and Consensus
 
 
   Our Take
Incyte s first quarter results were encouraging as the company reported a narrower than expected loss and surpassed revenue expectations  The growth in Jakafi sales is driven by patient demand and should boost revenues 
While most of the demand is due to a larger established patient base in myelofibrosis  polycythemia vera is also expected to be a major long term driver of Jakafi growth  This is owing to the larger potential patient population and the possibility for longer duration of treatment  The company exited the first quarter with approximately 10 000 patients being treated with Jakafi  However  the delay in approval of Olumiantin the U S  is disappointing

203890,425406,MRK,Here Are Three Companies Addressing A Major Unmet Need In Healthcare,opinion,"Cytomegalovirus  CMV  is one of the most common viruses in the world  It s ubiquitous in all populations  and it s a herpesvirus  meaning it causes a lifelong  persistent infection in its host  In healthy individuals  it s generally asymptomatic  It goes unnoticed in the vast majority of these cases and causes no real issues 
In a certain category of the infected  however  it s a different story  If patients are infected with CMV during or after stem cell transplants  or solid organ transplants  which is very common in both instances  it can be a cause of substantial morbidity and death among patients  If pre natal infection occurs  babies are often born with deformities or mental disability  In immunosuppressed patients  infection can lead to retinitis  hepatitis  pneumonitis  gastroenteritis  or other end organ diseases 
There s a large unmet need for a vaccination  yet to date  none have made it past mid to late stage trials  A number of companies are working to change this right now  Here are three of the most advanced  with a look at the assets under investigation and what to expect going forward from each 
The first company on the list is Merck   Co   Inc   NYSE MRK  
Merck s CMV asset is called letermovir and the company is currently investigating the drug as a potential treatment for the prevention of CMV infection in adult  18 years and older  CMV seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant  HSCT   This is a high risk population  as outlined above  and this program represents the most advanced program in the space right now 
The drug  letermovir  is a once daily antiviral medicine and it is part of a family of drugs called non nucleoside CMV inhibitors  To simplify the mechanism of action  MOA   viruses rely on what s called the viral terminase complex to replicate and proliferate from cell to cell  Terminase packages DNA into viral heads  which then make their way into cells  Letermovir inhibits this process  and theoretically  inhibits the replication of the CMV 
The drug  in October last year  at which point Merck put out a small amount of data and said it would submit for a detailed presentation at a future event  This event turned out to be the   and the data turned out to be very strong  The trial met its primary endpoint of an improvement in clinically significant CMV infection through week 24 post HSCT when compared to placebo  Further  the safety profile of the drug was relatively clean  inducing no real side effects outside of those expected for patients undergoing this procedure 
So what s next 
Merck has to put an application together for submission to the FDA  While we don t have a specific timeframe slated for submission  the company has noted it expects to have the submissions ready before the end of 2017  With fast track designation in place  this means we could see a mid 2018 approval in the US 
Next up  Astellas Pharma Inc  OTC ALPMY  
This Japanese biotech is developing a drug called ASP0113 
Whereas the Merck asset is attempting to inhibit the replication of the virus  this one is more of a traditional vaccine type   it attempts to harness the body s ability to recognize CMV associated antigens to spark an immune response to the virus if and when it presents itself post procedure 
The company pitched ASP0113 against placebo in a phase II study investigating the safety and efficacy of the asset in kidney transplant patients receiving an organ from a CMV seropositive donor  It was a double blind trial and  
Unfortunately for Astellas and its shareholders  the trial didn t turn out as hoped  The drug failed against its primary endpoint of patients having CMV viremia  defined as a plasma viral load of   1000 IU mL through one year after first injection of study drug  It also missed on a couple of secondary endpoints  and while the safety profiles of the placebo and active arms were similar  the latter resulted in more injection site reactions 
That s not the end of the program  however  There are two phase III studies for this one   the above mentioned study in solid organ transplants  in this case  kidney transplants  and a second mirroring that of Merck  investigating the drug in an HSCT indication 
This second trial is set to wrap up during the fourth quarter of this year  While there s justification for pessimism ahead of the results  it s too early to write off the drug  If Astellas can prove efficacy in HSTC patients  there s plenty of room for revaluation as the company carries the drug into a pivotal study in the US 
Closing out the list  VBI Vaccines Inc  NASDAQ VBIV  
This company just  that an update for a phase I clinical study of its own CMV asset  a drug called VBI 1501A  VBI is investigating the vaccine as a potential candidate to prevent congenital CMV infection   the third of the three major risk groups outlined in the introduction to this piece  Pre natal CMV infection affects more live births than Down Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and the direct economic cost of infection exceeds  2 0B annually  Many of the live births affected by the virus will develop serious issues  including blindness and deafness 
Similar in concept to Astellas asset  VBI 1501A incorporates the more traditional antigen driven vaccine model in its construction  It differs from most approved  and in development  vaccines  however  in that it s created using what s called the eVLP platform  The platform is proprietary to VBI and allows for the creation of vaccines that more closely mimic the structure of the virus against which they are trying to trigger an immune response 
Pre clinical models suggest that this vaccine can induce neutralization of CMV up to 32X greater than natural immunity and that it can induce potent neutralization in fibroblasts and epithelial cells  which are two cell types that are susceptible to CMV infection 
The ongoing phase I study is investigating the vaccine in an estimated 125 healthy patients  with safety and tolerability the primary endpoint  However  and of more interest to a biotechnology investor  the trial is set up to also potentially indicate clinical benefit through measuring levels of vaccine induced CMV neutralizing antibodies 
All patients have now been fully dosed  with three doses of immunization  and the latest update announced the unanimous recommendation of a Data and Safety Monitoring Board  DSMB  for continuation  While this recommendation doesn t offer any insight into clinical benefit  it s a good sign that the trial is working towards a primary endpoint hit  which in turn supports the potential advance of the asset into phase II development 
An interim safety report from the trial  which will also address immunogenicity  is set to hit press mid 2017  with the trial set to finish  ",2017-05-03,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-are-three-companies-addressing-a-major-unmet-need-in-healthcare-200186774,200186774
203891,425407,MRK,Merck Vs  Pfizer  Which Stock Looks Better Post Earnings ,opinion,"Both Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   and Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   reported upbeat first quarter results earlier this week  While  Merck posted better than expected earnings and revenues  Pfizer managed to outpace its earnings estimate but missed on the top line 
Both Pfizer and Merck have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but let s see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals  You can see 
Q1 Earnings Performance
For the first quarter  Pfizer reported adjusted earnings per share of 69 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents  The bottom line increased 3  from the year ago period  The company s revenues of  12 78 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 04 billion and decreased 2  year over year  Currency movement negatively impacted Pfizer s first quarter revenues by 1  or  116 million   Read More   
Merck posted first quarter earnings of 88 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents  However  earnings declined 1 1  from the year ago period  Revenues not only increased 1  year over year to  9 4 billion but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 3 billion  Merck s Pharmaceutical segment s revenues increased 1  year over year to  8 2 billion  offsetting the negative impact of currency movement   Read More   
Price Performance

Shares of both Pfizer and Merck have notched up gains since Nov 8  2016  when Donald Trump won the Presidential election  However  Pfizer is a clear winner on this respect with a return of around 11 5   ahead of the  s advancement of around 9 1   Merck has increased only 4 7  during the same period 
Valuation
Here  we have used  to evaluate these two stocks from a valuation perspective  Typical value investors will look at P E ratios  PEG ratios and Price to Book ratios among others  But  the Zacks Value Score takes many other ratios under consideration and conclusively indicates which stock is relatively more undervalued 

Pfizer has a Value Score of  B   while Merck has a Value Score of  C  

Net Margin
Compared to other industries  drug development companies have relatively higher net margin levels  This is mainly because mature pharma companies like Pfizer and Merck deal in diversified business segments as well as develop and market blockbuster drugs 

The net profit margin  TTM  for Pfizer is 86 3   which is significantly higher than the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Sector s level of 16 4   Merck has net profit margin TTM of 37 1   significantly lower than that of Pfizer 
Dividend Yield

In the last one year period  the dividend yield for Pfizerwas higher than the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which offered a yield of 3 5   While Pfizer returned 7 1   Merck had a negative dividend yield of 13 6  during the same period 
Earnings History and Estimate Revisions
Merck delivered positive surprises in all the last four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 4 4   In comparison  Pfizer delivered an earnings beat in only two of the trailing four quarters and posted an average negative earnings surprise of around 0 4  
When considering estimate revisions  Pfizer s earnings estimate for the current year has improved 0 5  over the last 30 days  Meanwhile  Merck s earnings estimate has advanced by only 0 3  over the same period  
Conclusion
In our comparative analysis  we found that both the two pharma giants have certain positives  Pfizer registered a stronger price performance  delivered a significantly higher dividend yield and has better estimate revisions  In terms of valuation as well  Pfizer is more underpriced than Merck  However  Merck holds an edge over Pfizer only when considering its average positive earnings surprise  Our analysis clearly indicated that Pfizer is better positioned than Merck and thus calls for investors  attention post earnings

Tecentriq is already approved for the treatment locally advanced mUC in patients whose disease has progressed after receiving other medicines  either before or after surgery  or after their disease has spread 
Roche s share price shows that the company has outperformed the Zacks classified industry year to date  The stock is up 12 5  compared with the  industry s gain of 5 4  

Also  in October last year  Tecentriq became the first and the only anti PDL1 cancer immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  
The label expansion of the drug is expected to boost sales for the company  As per the press release  bladder cancer is the most common type of urothelial carcinoma and about half the people with the advanced form of the disease are unable to receive cisplatin chemotherapy as an initial treatment  thereby leading to a high unmet medical need  Urothelial carcinoma also includes cancers of the urethra  ureters and renal pelvis 
The accelerated approval of Tecentriq was granted based on tumor response rate and duration of response  Also  it was based on Phase II IMvigor210 study  But the final approval will be give only of the drug showsclinical benefit in confirmatory studies 
However  stiff competition in the immunotherapy space with players like Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   boasts a robust portfolio with drugs like Opdivo and Yervoy  Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda also poses strong competition with approvals for a varied range of cancers

203919,425435,MRK,Bristol Myers  BMY  Collaborates With Apexigen For Opdivo ,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced a collaboration agreement with clinical stage biopharmaceutical company Apexigen  Inc 
Both the companies will collaborate for a clinical trial to evaluate Bristol Myers Squibb s immuno oncology drug Opdivo in combination with Apexigen s APX005M in patients with advanced solid tumors 
APX005M is an experimental compound  designed to activate CD40  a key immune co stimulatory receptor essential to regulate the activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses against cancer 
Both the companies will collaborate to evaluate the safety  tolerability and preliminary efficacy of APX005M in combination with Opdivo in second line metastatic NSCLC patients who have failed prior chemotherapy  and in metastatic melanoma patients who have failed prior I O therapy 
We remind investors that Opdivo is approved for varied indications in both EU and the U S  Opdivo received approvals for several indications including melanoma  head and neck  lung  kidney and blood cancer  The Opdivo Yervoy regimen is also approved in multiple markets for the treatment of melanoma 
The drug recorded sales of  3 4 billion in 2016  up from  942 million in 2015  Bristol Myers is working on expanding the label of Opdivo further  Opdivo became the first PD 1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy   classical Hodgkin lymphoma in both the U S   May 2016  and the EU  Nov 2016   In Nov 2016  Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum based therapy 
Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug 
However  the company suffered a setback in Jan 2017 when it decided not to pursue accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first line lung cancer in the U S  based on a review of available data  A potential earlier than expected entry of Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy will further impact Opdivo sales 
While Bristol Myers  share price decreased 20 8  in the last 12 months  the Zacks classified  industry gained 1 4

203927,425443,MRK,Agenus  AGEN   What s Ahead For The Stock In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Agenus Inc    NASDAQ AGEN   is expected to report fourth quarter 2016 results during this month  Last quarter  Agenus delivered a negative earnings surprise of 46 88   Let s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter Agenus  share price has decreased 6 5  year to date  while the Zacks classified  industry gained 6 1  

Factors at Play
Agenus is an immuno oncology company focused on the discovery and development of checkpoint modulators  vaccines and adjuvants for the treatment of cancer The company earns revenues only through fees received under collaboration and license agreementsCurrently  the company is evaluating AGEN1884 in a phase I study and INCAGN01876 in a phase I II study for the treatment of solid tumors The company has initiated phase I study for OX40 aganist INCAGN1949 in collaboration with Incyte  Agenus has also started phase I study for PD 1 antagonist AGEN2034 and AutoSynVax  Going ahead  the company plans to initiate studies on its second anti CTLA 4 antibody  AGEN2041  in 2017  Agenus also expects to begin combination studies on AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 in the second half of 2017 
In its fourth quarter conference call  investor should remain focus on the company s update on the initiation of combination studies on these antibodies as well as the advancement of additional checkpoint modulator antibodies and vaccines into the clinic in the coming quarters We remind investors that Agenus  lead candidate and several backup antibodies were selected by Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   for an undisclosed checkpoint target  Under the terms of the agreement  Agenus is eligible to receive up to  100 million in milestone payments  in addition to royalties on worldwide product sales 
In January this year  Agenus entered into a clinical trial collaboration with the National Cancer Institute  NCI  to evaluate Prophage  HSPPC 96   in conjunction with Merck s PD 1 therapy  Keytruda  A phase II study will evaluate the effect of Prophage  in conjunction with Keytruda  on the overall survival rate of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma  ndGBM  Surprise History
Agenus  track record has been disappointing so far  The company has surpassed estimates in only once in the trailing four quarters and missed the same in all the other occasions  bringing the average negative surprise to 9 02  
Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Agenus is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Agenus is 0 00  since the Most Accurate estimate stands in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 33 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Agenus currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a 0 00  ESP  makes surprise prediction difficult   Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Agenus Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    Stocks That Warrants a Look
Here are some health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  You can see  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ PCRX   has an Earnings ESP of  20  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is scheduled to release results on Mar 1

203945,425461,MRK,VBI Vaccines Has A Proven Solution To A Problem,opinion,"I spend a fair bit of time looking at smaller biotech companies that are working towards providing better treatments for existing diseases 
These companies offer a lot of potential but they also carry a very high level of risk  It is as they say the nature of the beast 
I suppose this is why I find VBI Vaccines Inc  NASDAQ VBIV  so intriguing  The company has the same potential that this sector typically offers but it comes with a lot less risk  I ll explain why in a moment 
VBI is looking to provide a solution for a specific group of patients that are currently not suitable for Hepatitis B vaccination  A  1 billion opportunity 

Source of image  VBI Vaccines Presentation
Hepatitis B is nasty business  The key facts about Hepatitis B according to the World Health Organization are as follows 
  Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease 
  The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person 
  An estimated 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B  defined as hepatitis B surface antigen positive for at least 6 months  
  More than 686 000 people die every year due to complications of hepatitis B  including cirrhosis and liver cancer 1 
  Hepatitis B is an important occupational hazard for health workers 
  Hepatitis B is a potentially life threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus  It is a major global health problem  It can cause chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer 
In North American and Europe GlaxoSmithKline s  NYSE GSK  GSK  Engerix B is the current standard of care for Hepatitis B vaccines  Engerix B works fine for young  healthy people 
It is not however suitable for people with liver conditions  diabetics and people over 40 with weaker immune systems 
For these people VBI Vaccines has a solution  I m not talking about a vaccine in development  I m talking about a vaccine  Sci B Vac  that has already been proven to be effective 
This is the lower level of risk that VBI presents which I mentioned earlier 
This point was  forward once again with VBI s press release concerning its Phase IV study on 88 seronegative people  without previous immunity to Hepatitis B   Of the 88 subjects in the study data revealed that 98 8  of participants were seroprotected at Month 3  two months after receiving a second dose of Sci B Vac  and prior to receiving a third dose 
These results should not come as a surprise  Sci B Vac has already been proven through more than 20 clinical trials and has been used by more than 4 500 patients  The vaccine is the standard of care in Israel and has been approved for use in 15 countries 
Therein lies my interest in VBI  A company that has already developed a solution and just needs to bring it to market  A much lower risk business proposition than a typical biotech which is offers potential but more uncertainty 
Bringing this vaccine to market is exactly why VBI Vaccines and SciVac Therapeutics merged earlier this year  SciVac had the vaccine and VBI provided the financial and corporate capability to bring that vaccine to the larger markets in the United States and Europe 
Other Products In The Pipeline
Sci B Vac is not VBI s only product under development  There are also a couple of others which offer potential but more risk   1   CMV  Cytomegalovirus  Vaccine
CMV is a very common virus that impacts one in every two people in many parts of the developing world  Most infections of CMV are  silent  which means that there are no symptoms or signs  You have it but you don t know 
VBI is developing a prophylactic vaccine to prevent cytomegalovirus  CMV  infection 
CMV isn t really a problem for most of us  Where it becomes a problem is when a mother is infected during pregnancy because it can result in serious consequences for the newborn  When this happens it is known as a congenital CMV infection 
5 000 U S  infants will develop permanent problems due to CMV every year on average  Some of these problems are quite severe  including deafness  blindness  and mental retardation 
CMV impacts more births than either Down Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome  CMV is a key public health priority that needs a solution and would be a strong candidate for recommended universal vaccination among certain high risk populations 
There is no vaccine for prevention of CMV  VBI is closest in the race to develop one since it is a year to 18 months ahead of its nearest competitor vaccine which is being developed by Merck  NYSE MRK 
Should VBI successfully develop a fully tested and approved vaccine there is likely to be widespread public health support for it 
The market for this product is estimated to be  1 5 billion in the United States  based on number of births and  100 per vaccination  with a similar sized opportunity in developed markets outside the United States  That would give VBI the head start on a  3 billion market 
 2   Glioblastoma Immunotherapy
Glioblastoma is one of the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumors that a human can suffer from  In the United States alone  12 000 new cases of Glioblastoma are diagnosed each year 
The current standard of care for GBM is a surgery  followed by radiation and chemotherapy  Unfortunately even with this aggressive treatment  GBM progresses rapidly and is exceptionally lethal  The median patient survival is less than sixteen months 
VBI has applied its eVLP Platform to the development of a glioblastoma therapeutic vaccine candidate  With its unique approach  VBI is trying to create a GBM immunotherapy that will stimulate the patient s own immune system to identify and kill GBM cancer cells  The ultimate goal is to create a commercially viable therapy that is more effective and tolerable than current treatments 
Risks   While I definitely like the reduced amount of risk involved with the Sci B Vac vaccine this opportunity is not risk free  The nature of this industry is one where competition is fierce and changing quickly  Please keep that in mind when investing in these types of companies ",2016-12-06,Christopher Lourenco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vbi-vaccines-has-a-proven-solution-to-a-problem-200168366,200168366

204037,425553,MRK,Juno Therapeutics Makes Revolutionary Breakthrough In Cancer Treatment,opinion,"It s about 7 30 Friday morning  and I m just back from a run  I chug a 16 ounce bottle of low fat Quik chocolate milk  because physiologists say it may boost post workout recovery  and it s yummy   As soon as I stop sweating  I ll change my shirt 
Then my wife and I will take our 14 year old daughter about 20 clicks around the Beltway  from our home in Alexandria to Falls Church  for a consultation with a hematologist oncologist 
It s an unsettling experience  hearing from your primary care physician that the results of a blood test indicate  something s off  with your child s blood count  In her case  both her white blood cells and platelets  blood clotting cells  are  mildly  moderately low  
That she s also showing a bit of a rash is actually a good thing  It s a sign that after a period of pretty intense fluctuations in her body temperature  it got as high as 103 8 F   her immune system is fighting back against a viral infection 
Aside from the fever  she s also complained of exhaustion and lethargy  and that her muscles feel weak  She has no appetite  My kid s a year round swimmer  a soccer player  and a newbie to cross country running  She s a worker who demands of herself  athletically and academically 
The test for mononucleosis was negative  Results for mycoplasma pneumonia are still pending  There are other uncertainties that prompted our doctor to refer us to the specialist 
She also advised against using Dr Google to try to narrow down the problem 
Too late 
After all  that s what I do  I m a researcher and a writer  And I m a father and a husband before those things 
It s more difficult to put the brakes on my natural curiosity when the matter becomes as personal as this 
The latest innovation in pediatric oncology has taken the cancer survival and cure rate from 10  in the 1950s to early 1960s to about 80  across all stages and disease categories 
Thankfully  we never go to this stage of the process  because our hematologist oncologist called with the good news that our daughter s blood test revealed that her white blood cell and platelet counts had returned to normal 
But based purely on numbers  kids like my daughter are usually diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia  ALL   which accounts for 75  of pediatric leukemia cases 
 Acute  means it s a fast moving type of leukemia  as opposed to chronic 
 Lymphocytic  or  lymphoblastic  refers to a leukemia that starts in the lymphoid cells  which make different types of white blood cells 
Leukemia that starts in myeloid cells   which lead to red blood cells  platelets  or white blood cells known as granulocytes   is called  myeloid   or myelogenous myeloblastic  leukemia 
According to the Cancer Research Institute  several types of immunotherapy are in various stages of testing for leukemia treatment  These categories include adoptive cell therapy  monoclonal antibodies  therapeutic vaccines  adjuvant immunotherapies  cytokines  and checkpoint inhibitors 
Within the past 12 months  experimental tests of a particular type of checkpoint inhibitor have shown remarkable success   Juno Therapeutic  NASDAQ JUNO  T cell therapy 
In clinical trials at Seattle Children s Hospital  the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  and hospitals in Philadelphia  New York  and Memphis  the cancer goes away in 90  of patients with ALL that s returned and resists regular drugs 
The usual rate of remission under these circumstances is lower than 10  
The use of human T cells is the most radical approach among several that use the human body s immune system to fight cancer  According to Juno  it  has the potential to revolutionize the way cancer is treated  
Different checkpoint inhibitors developed by Merck  NYSE MRK  and Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  have been used to treat skin and lung cancers 
Juno s approach to leukemia involves genetically engineering a patient s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells  Its first treatment is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell  or CART  known as JCAR015 
Such cell based therapies could be effective  regardless of the type of previous treatments patients have experienced  And they may have few side effects other than a strong fever 
Novartis AG  NYSE NVS  is developing a similar therapy to treat kids with ALL  while Kite Pharma  NASDAQ KITE  is working on one for patients with a type of non Hodgkin s lymphoma 
According to Roots Analysis and The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine  the oncology market for cell therapies is expected to reach  30 billion by 2030  and more than 600 therapies were in clinical trials at the end of 2015 
Juno  a  3 4 billion company that IPO d in December 2014  has a long way to go to get past the  proof of principle  phase  Tests of its T cell therapy so far have been small   with no control groups  no comparisons  but also no other explanation than T cells for why the cancer disappears   according to MIT Technology Review 
Juno s Phase II clinical trial of JCAR015 was placed on  clinical hold  by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  after two patient deaths in July 
 The fatalities occurred after the addition of chemotherapy drug fludarabine to the pre condition regimen   reports The Fly  Juno proposed to continue the trial using JCAR015 with a different chemotherapy drug  cyclophosphamide  in the pre conditioning step 
In early July  the company submitted a Complete Response to the Clinical Hold to the FDA  including a revised patient informed consent form  revised investigator brochure  and a revised trial protocol  and the  clinical hold  was removed on July 12 
During the company s second quarter conference call  CEO Hans Bishop said that due to the clinical hold  Juno has pushed back the anticipated approval of JCAR015 from 2017 to 2018 
Juno reported a second quarter revenue gain of 120  to  27 6 million  due in large part to a payment from partner Celgene Corp  NASDAQ CELG  as part of 10 year   1 billion deal announced in 2015  Celgene plans to commercialize Juno s cancer and autoimmune disease research 
But the company posted a second quarter loss of  64 6 million   0 64 per share   versus a  29 6 million loss  or  0 35 per share  a year ago 
Its research and development spend surged to  72 1 million  up from  23 9 million a year ago 
Juno shares took a big hit following the FDA s clinical hold in July  falling from north of  40 to around  27 
But the FDA also granted the JCAR015 therapy  breakthrough  designation  which means it could receive approval after just one large clinical trial  It s still on track for approval on an accelerated basis 
Juno s major potential economic advantage   commercializing personalized cellular treatments   is intact

204038,425554,MRK,Merck  The Beauty Of Locking In A Profit,opinion,"In this article dated April 7  2016  I wrote about a hypothetical option trading opportunity in Merck   Company Inc   NYSE MRK   The gist of the idea was to  risk a little  in hopes of making a lot   Unlike many option trades that focus on using short term options  this one used call options with over 6 months left until expiration   in order to give MRK a lot of time to stage some sort of move 
Well MRK moved and the time to  do something  appears to be at hand 
Figure 1 displays the initial trade and the initial risk reward outlook 
Figure 1  Courtesy  
Figure 2 displays the initial trade as of the close on 8 24  As you can see  MRK stock advanced from 55 63 to  62 73 and the option trade was sitting with an open profit of  743   89 8    
Figure 2  Courtesy 
The good news is that this trade has a nice percentage profit and retains further upside potential  The bad news is that the trade could easily turn back into a loser if MRK stock backs off from here  On 8 23 MRK failed to break out to the upside and the next day fell back hard 
So let s consider a simple adjustment to lock in a profit while still allowing for further upside potential 
The Adjustment
The truth is that there are an endless number of ways to adjust any option trade  The choice should be based on one s outlook going forward for the underlying security in question  In this case  I have no real opinion one way or the other regarding where MRK is heading next  But I do know that I do not want to see the current open profit vanish  and I am willing to give MRK the opportunity to move higher still  As a result  the adjustment below involves 
 Buying 1 Oct2016 MRK 50 strike price call
 Selling 4 Oct2016 MRK 50 strike price calls
 Buying 1 Apr2017 MRK 65 strike price call
This adjustment simply exits the original trade and buys a single long call option that can allow us to make more if MRK does in fact move higher between now and April 2017 expiration  240 days from now   The risk curves appear in Figure 3 
Figure 3  Courtesy 
Things To Note 
 This adjusted trade locks in a minimum profit of  523 if MRK is at  65 a share or below 240 days from now 
 The upside potential remains unlimited 
 If MRK rise 2 standard deviations  to roughly  83 a share  the profit can swell to  2 200 or more 
 If MRK collapses the worst case is still a locked in profit of  523 
Summary
One advantage to trading options is the ability to adjust your initial position in order to obtain a more favorable reward to risk ratio  Hopefully this MRK example makes that assertion a little easier to understand ",2016-08-25,Jay Kaeppel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/merck:-the-beauty-of-locking-in-a-profit-200150002,200150002

Quarter in Detail
Immune Design s total revenue was  1 1 million  down from  1 8 million in the year ago quarter but above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 million  The top line included collaboration revenues from Sanofi   NYSE SNY   related to the development of G103 
Research and development  R D  expenses shot up 34 2  to  11 4 million primarily due to expenditure related to the advancement of the CMB305 and LV305 programs to phase I and phase II clinical trials  and the development of G103  General and administrative expenses were also up 4 5  to  3 9 million IMMUNE DESIGN Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Pipeline Update
The company is developing multiple candidates using its two discovery platforms   ZVex and GLAAS   for the treatment of various types of cancer  Key pipeline candidates include CMB305 and G100  CMB305 has been designed under a prime boost approach  involving the sequential dosing of two complementary agents   LV305  from the ZVex platform  and G305 
A randomized phase II trial on CMB305  in combination with Tecentriq compared to Tecentriq alone  for locally advanced  relapsed or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma  STS  is currently underway  An independent data monitoring committee reviewed safety data from part 1 of the study and advised the company to proceed to part 2  in which patients are being actively enrolled   Early data from a single agent phase I study in 14 patients with STS showed positive results 
Meanwhile  Immune Design is collaborating with Merck   Co  Inc    NYSE MRK   to evaluate G100 and LV305  in combination with Merck s Keytruda  in phase I studies for the treatment of patients with non Hodgkin s lymphoma  NHL  and melanoma  respectively  We remind investors that the company has completed a phase I study on G100 in patients with merkel cell carcinoma  The company presented positive final data from this study in Jun 2016 
The company has also initiated a randomized phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of G100 with low dose local radiation  and Keytruda  in patients with follicular NHL  Enrollment is ongoing  Part 1 of the study  dose escalation of G100 with a fixed dose of low dose radiation without Keytruda   is complete and has been deemed safe by an independent data monitoring committee  Part 2  in which patients are currently being randomized to receive G100 and radiation alone or in combination with Keytruda  is in process  Data are expected in 2017 
Going forward  we expect investor focus to remain on further pipeline updates by the company

The upside was also due to increased research and development  R D  services for these collaborations  and the company s progress on existing programs and addition of new ones with existing collaborators Product revenues came in at  10 9 million  down 23 7  from the year ago period  primarily due to a decline in the quantity of livestock previously used in production and live calves sold due to lower demand from customers for these products Service revenues came in at  13 9 million  up 5 1  year over year  primarily due to an increase in the number of in vitro fertilization cycles performed on higher demand R D expenses increased 39 2  to  28 4 million while selling  general and administrative expenses escalated 27 8  to  30 3 million due to an increase in salaries  benefits and other personnel costs Meanwhile  the company continued to enter into new exclusive channel collaborations  ECC  and expanded its existing partnerships  In the reported quarter  Intrexon announced amendments to its ECC with ZIOPHARM Oncology  Inc    NASDAQ ZIOP   in the fields of oncology and graft versus host disease  The move was aimed to improve the alignment between the companies as ZIOPHARM broadens its pipeline and advances multiple therapeutic programs into the clinic Under the partnership with ZIOPHARM  a phase I study on autologous T cells transduced  along with lentivirus  will be initiated to express a CD33 specific chimeric antigen receptor  CAR  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia Intrexon is also developing several candidates in partnership with other companies Meanwhile  the company is currently working with both governmental and non governmental organizations for the potential use of Oxitec s OX513A to reduce or eradicate populations of the Aedes aegypti mosquito  the primary vector for dengue  chikungunya and the Zika virus The FDA published final findings of a no significant impact and final environmental assessment on Oxitec s OX513A self limiting mosquito  concluding that a field study of the Friendly Aedes will not result in a significant impact on the environment INTREXON CORP Price

204058,425574,MRK,Is Merck Postponing Its Bright Future  ,opinion,"Merck  NYSE MRK  is the seventh largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue and market capitalization  It is a DJIA component as well as an S P 500 component 
However  despite its size and significance  its stock price also suffered severely during the last two major stock market crashes of our time   the crash in 2000 and the Great Recession of 2007 2009 
Merck is currently trading slightly below 59 dollars a share  recovering from as low as 20 05 in March  2009  So is this a good time to add Merck to your portfolio  The chart below shows what lies ahead for the stock  according to the  
Merck stock reached an all time high of 96 69 dollars a share in November  2009  What is more important is the fact that this uptrend  which started somewhere in the 1980s  has a very clear  structure  marked with I II III IV V  The theory states that every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction  As visible  this is true  even if we talk about such multi year long trends and patterns 
Wave  II  is a W X Y double zig zag  which takes over eight years to complete  Nevertheless  once a correction is over  the larger trend resumes  It turns out the recovery from 20 05 in 2009 is the start of Merck s wave  III   which usually is the most powerful phase of the trend  The problem is that wave  III  has its own wave structure as well 
In our opinion  the rally we saw in the last seven years is only wave I of  III   Once wave  5  of I of  III  is over  wave I would be a smaller version of wave  I   so the same consequences should follow   a three wave decline in wave II  before the bulls could return in wave III of  III  to take Merck stock to new heights 
If this is the correct count  Merck   Co stock should exceed the top of wave  3  of I at 63 60 and probably approach the 70 dollar mark  However  now does not seem to be right time to be long term bullish  because a major bearish reversal is very likely to occur next  Overall  future looks bright for Merck investors  The next 3 to 5 years  however  do not ",2016-08-02,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/merck-postponing-its-bright-future-200145610,200145610

204060,425576,MRK,Immune Design  IMDZ   Stock To Disappoint On Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Immune Design Corp    NASDAQ IMDZ   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results after the market closes on Aug 9 
Immune Design has a mixed track record so far  The company reported a wider than expected loss in two of the four trailing quarters and a narrower than expected loss on the two other occasions  with a positive average earnings surprise of 2 5   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors in Play
Being a development stage biopharmaceutical company  Immune Design has not generated any product revenues yet  The company earns revenues from collaboration and licensing agreements  and the sale of products associated with material transfer  collaboration and supply agreements 
Investors are expected to focus on the company s progress on its pipeline  The company is developing multiple candidates using its two discovery platforms   ZVex and GLAAS   for the treatment of various types of cancer  Key pipeline candidates include CMB305 and G100  CMB305 has been designed under a prime boost approach  involving the sequential dosing of two complementary agents   LV305  from the ZVex platform  and G305 
CMB305 is currently undergoing an expansion study as a single agent in patients with cancers expressing the NY ESO 1 tumor antigen  The completed dose escalation study on CMB305 showed a favorable safety profile  and a positive signal in progression free survival  PFS  related endpoints have been observed 
In addition  a randomized phase II study on CMB305  in combination with Roche Holding s   OTC RHHBY   investigational anti PD L1 therapy  atezolizumab  in comparison with atezolizumab alone  for locally advanced  relapsed or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma is currently underway  Data are expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 
Meanwhile  another candidate  G100  developed using the GLAAS platform  has completed enrolment in a phase I study in patients with merkel cell carcinoma in combination with radiation  Results from the study showed a 50  overall response rate including a pathologic complete response  CR  following single agent G100 alone 
Immune Design is collaborating with Merck   Co    NYSE MRK   to evaluate G100 in combination with Merck s anti PD 1 agent Keytruda  for the treatment of patients with non Hodgkin s lymphoma  A randomized phase Ib II study in patients with follicular non Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with Keytruda is ongoing and results from the study are expected by the first half of 2017 
Due to numerous ongoing trials  operating expenses are expected to remain high in the quarter  We expect the company to shed light on its progress with these trials during the second quarter call IMMUNE DESIGN Price and EPS Surprise
   What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Immune is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 68 cents 
Zacks Rank   Immune Design currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell    As it is  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement 
Stock That Warrants a Look
Here is a company you may want to consider  as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

	The biggest gainers were Professional Business Services at 70K  Leisure and Hospitality reached 45K and Health Services had 43K  The biggest loser in July s labor market was Mining at  6000 jobs

	Part of the reason the Dow swelled from  37 points to  90  by the way  was due to Merck  NYSE MRK   jumping 11  on news that rival Bristol Myers Squibb s  latest cancer treatment failed a late stage study  BMY shares have fallen 17   but it is not a Dow component ",2016-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/upbeat-july-jobs-report-200146333,200146333

The company released few details of the study  called Checkmate 026  but it said that it had not met its primary endpoint of improvement in progression free survival  The drug it was testing  Opdivo  has already been approved to treat some types of cancer  but the company was trying to see if it would be successful in treating advanced non small cell lung cancer 
Company CEO Giovanni Caforio said in a release that he was  disappointed  with the result with the result but management remains  committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive development program  
While BMY was falling  shares of its biggest rival Merck   NYSE MRK   jumped more than 10  at one point  as their drug Keytruda that competes with Opdivo succeeded in a similar trial recently  It should be noted though  Merck played it a bit safer in the patient population it chose  targeting  high expressors  of the PD L1 ligand  which both Keytruda and Opdivo target through inhibition of the PD 1 protein in cancer cells  Bristol Meyers went for a broader patient population  potentially winning in a bigger market but increasing its risk for failure 
With the opening decrease of 17   Bristol Meyers lost about  21 billion in market cap  Year to date shares of the company are more than 8  lower  BMY currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   MRK is currently also a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but shares of the company are up more than 16  so far this year ",2016-08-05,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/shares-of-bristol-myers-falling-after-failed-study,-while-its-rival-is-surging-200146455",200146455

204083,425599,MRK,Two Big Pharma Stocks To Watch For In July,opinion,"Back in 1992  lawmakers in the US passed what s called the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA   The act sees the the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  collect fees from companies that are looking to submit applications for a new drug to gain marketing approval 
It works like this  the company pays the fee and submits all of the data related to whatever drug it is trying to get approved  This data includes everything from safety  efficacy  manufacturing plans  commerciailzation and marketing strategy etc  The FDA reviews the submission and either accepts it or declines it 
If it accepts it  it will then set what s called a PDUFA date  which is the date by which it aims to give the company an answer relating to the drug in question  95  of the time  the PDUFA date is the date on which we find out whether a drug has an FDA green light  As such  keeping track of the FDA s PDUFA calendar can be a great way to get in ahead of a potential upside catalyst  i e  an approval  in the biotech sector 
With this in mind  here are two companies with PDUFA dates this month  with a look at the drugs in question and what an approval might mean for each 
Shire PLC  NASDAQ SHPG    Lifitegrast
This one s an interesting one  and a little complex  but stick with us  Lifitegrast is a drug targeting a condition called dry eye disease that   as its name suggests   is a disease that causes dry eyes in adults  It s caused by inflammation at the surface of the eye  and is similar  in concept  at least  to something like psoriasis  whereby an immune mediated inflammation causes the plaques associated with the condition  
Lifitegrast aims to block the interaction between something called integrin LFA 1 and ICAM 1  and in doing so  inhibits the inflammatory action that this interaction usually results in  No inflammation  no dry eyes 
Anyway  that s not the complicated part  The complication lies in the development process 
Shire initially submitted an NDA for the drug last year  but the FDA issued what s called a complete response letter  CRL  in October  A CRL is essentially the agency saying that the NDA can t be approved in its current form   in this instance  the agency asked for another trial and a resubmission with the extra trial data included 
Shire quickly put together a phase 3  the data from which supported the initial efficacy hypothesis  and resubmitted the NDA in January  The FDA accepted the NDA for review shortly thereafter  and set a PDUFA of July 22  2016 
The final form NDA has three sets of phase 3 trial data  plus an extra phase 3 looking at long term response  and a phase 2 set of data  with safety write ups as a kicker  It also includes some revised manufacturing details  and as the FDA acceptance in January demonstrates  is ready for a thumbs up or down 
The potential upside here is pretty big  Analysts expect the dry eye disease market to reach  4 6 billion by 2024  up from  2 2 billion in 2014  and expect a large portion of this growth to be driven by   and to paraphrase    the introduction of anti inflammatory drugs such as Shire s Lifitegrast 
Merck   Co Inc   NYSE MRK    Bezlotoxumab
This one is technically not an NDA  it s what s called a biologics licence application  BLA   but that doesn t matter too much to our thesis  The only difference between the two is NDAs are generally based on chemically synthetic products  while BLAs involve drugs or treatments produced from naturally biologics   things like vaccines  gene therapy treatments  etc  Bottom line  they both have PDUFA dates  and that s what s important here 
Bezlotoxumab is targeting the treatment of what s called C  difficile infection  Those reading may already be familiar with the condition   it s caused by a bacterium that already exists in most people s intestines   C  difficile   growing out of control and causing an imbalance  This leads to diarrhea at best  but severe colon inflammation and other more serious side effects at worst 
Bezlotoxumab is designed to pair up with a regimen of antibiotics  the current standard of care in this condition  and complement the regimen s mechanism of action  Specifically  it targets a toxin called C toxin B  which attacks the intestinal wall and creates the inflammation that   in turn   causes the diarrhea 
Unlike the Shire NDA  this one got accepted first time around by the FDA  and it s based on two phase 3s that both seem to show some pretty strong efficacy and safety readouts  Just as with the Shire target  however  this is also a pretty large market  and could serve up a sizeable revenues boost for Merck if the drug picks up an FDA green light 
The C  difficile market is  to hit  1 5 billion by 2024  and since this treatment is designed for administration in line with current SOC  Merck won t have to compete with a first line treatment to gain a sizeable market share 
This is certainly one to watch  with PDUFA set a day later than Shire s on July 23 ",2016-07-07,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/two-big-pharma-pdufas-to-watch-for-in-july-200140590,200140590

204104,425620,MRK,Merck   Co  Inc  Shares Jump On Positive Lung Cancer Treatment Trial Results,opinion,"Shares of the large pharmaceutical company Merck   Co  Inc    NYSE MRK   were climbing higher Thursday on news that the company s late stage lung cancer treatment showed positive results and outperformed traditional chemotherapy  As of around 3 PM ET MRK was up to  57 61  a jump of 2 71  on the day 
Results came back from the Keynote 024 trial where the drug Keytruda was used as the sole treatment of patients with non small cell lung cancer  Though Merck   Co  didn t release any numbers  the company said that the Keynote 024 trial was stopped because it already proved Keytruda s ability to lengthen progression free survival and overall survival compared to standard chemotherapy treatments 
The trial studied only patients which had tumors that showed high expression of PD L1  the ligand that Keytruda is meant to treat through targeting the PD 1 protein  More details regarding the trial are expected to be released at an undisclosed future time 
As it stands the Keytruda drug is only approved to treat relapsed cases of late stage lung cancer  but the company said it plans to file for a label expansion as soon as it can  The expansion could be a major positive for the company in the company in the coming months  but only time will tell if they are able to get approval from regulators 
Merck   Co  is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  but any further positive trials or label expansion of the Keytruda drug could change that in the future ",2016-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/merck---co.-inc.-shares-jump-on-positive-lung-cancer-treatment-trial-results-200136458,200136458

204127,425643,MRK,Intrexon  XON  Q1 Loss Wider Than Expected  Revenues Miss,opinion,"Intrexon Corporation   NYSE XON   reported a first quarter 2016 loss of 32 cents per share  much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 29 cents  The company had reported earnings of 25 cents per share in the year ago period Total revenue was  43 4 million in the quarter  up 28 3  year over year  Revenues were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  44 5 million 
Quarter in Detail
Intrexon s revenues primarily consist of collaboration and licensing revenues  product revenues and service revenues 
Collaboration and licensing revenues surged 62 8  to  24 1 million  The increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred revenue from upfront payments received under the company s May 2015 license and collaboration agreement with Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA  and from other collaborations signed by Intrexon between Apr 1  2015 and Mar 31  2016  The upside was also due to increased research and development  R D  services for these collaborations and for the progression of programs or the addition of new programs with previously existing collaborators 
Product revenues came in at  8 6 million  down 4 2  from the year ago period  primarily due to a decline in the quantity of livestock previously used in production and live calves sold due to lower demand from customers for these products 
Service revenues came in at  10 7 million  up 7 1  year over year  primarily due to an increase in the number of in vitro fertilization cycles performed on higher demand 
R D expenses decreased 67 4  to  25 9 million while selling  general and administrative expenses escalated 55 2  to  42 9 million due to an increase in salaries  benefits and other personnel costs 
In the reported quarter  the company continued to enter into new exclusive channel collaborations  ECC  and expanded partnership with existing ones  Earlier this year  the company announced that it has expanded its existing partnership with Fibrocell Science  Inc    NASDAQ FCSC   by means of a new ECC for the development of genetically modified fibroblasts to treat chronic inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the joint  including arthritis and related conditions 
Several candidates are under development not only in partnership with Fibrocell but with other companies as well  In addition to the three studies that are currently underway  Intrexon anticipates that up to seven investigational new drugs and clinical study initiations with the company s existing ECC partners utilizing its technologies will take place in 2016  subject to FDA approval 
Meanwhile  the company is currently working with both governmental and non governmental organizations for the potential use of Oxitec s OX513A to reduce or eradicate populations of the Aedes aegypti mosquito  the primary vector for dengue  chikungunya  and the Zika virus 
We expect investor focus to remain on updates from the company

204128,425644,MRK,Immune Design  IMDZ  Loss Narrower Than Expected In Q1,opinion,"Immune Design Corp    NASDAQ IMDZ   reported a first quarter 2016 loss of 61 cents per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 65 cents but wider than the year ago loss of 56 cents 

Quarter in Detail
Immune Design s total revenue was  1 9 million  down 3 9  from the year ago period but above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 million 
Research and development  R D  expenses shot up 41 6  to  10 6 million primarily due to expenditure related to the advancement of the CMB305 and LV305 programs to phase I and phase II clinical trials  and the development of G103  General and administrative expenses were also up 2 9  to  3 9 million 
Pipeline Update
Immune Design continues to progress with its pipeline  The company s  prime boost  immunotherapy candidate  CMB305  involving the sequential dosing of two complementary agents   LV305 from the ZVex platform and G305   has completed the first in human dose escalation study and is currently undergoing an expansion study as a single agent in patients with cancers expressing the NY ESO 1 tumor antigen  Enrolment is ongoing and data from the study is expected to be presented this June 
Alongside  a randomized phase II trial on CMB305  in combination with Roche Holdings    OTC RHHBY   investigational anti PD L1 therapy atezolizumab  compared to atezolizumab alone  for locally advanced  relapsed or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma is currently underway  Data are expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 
We note that the company has achieved full patient enrollment in a phase I study on LV305 as a single agent  wherein the candidate showed a consistently favorable safety profile and an improved clinical benefit profile using progression free survival as an endpoint 
Meanwhile  Immune Design is collaborating with Merck   Co  Inc    NYSE MRK   to evaluate G100 and LV305  in combination with Merck s Keytruda  in phase I studies for the treatment of patients with non Hodgkin s lymphoma and melanoma  respectively  We remind investors that the company has completed a phase I study on G100 in patients with merkel cell carcinoma  with data from the full set of patients indicating a favorable safety profile and consistent clinical efficacy  Data are expected in June  The company has also initiated a randomized trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of G100 and low dose local radiation in patients with low grade follicular lymphoma 
Our Take
Immune Design s narrower than expected loss in the first quarter was encouraging  Going forward though  we expect investor focus to remain on pipeline updates from the company  2016 is expected to be data rich year for Immune Design given several data readouts lined up 
Immune Design carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Another well placed stock in the health care sector is Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG    carrying the same rank as Immune Design ",2016-05-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/immune-design-(imdz)-loss-narrower-than-expected-in-q1-200129432,200129432

204137,425653,MRK,Immune Design  IMDZ  Q1 Earnings  What Awaits The Stock ,opinion,"Immune Design Corp    NASDAQ IMDZ   is scheduled to report first quarter 2016 results after the market closes on May 10 
The company has a mixed track record so far  It beat estimates in two of the last four trailing quarters and missed the same on two other occasions  with a positive average earnings surprise of 4 14   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 

Factors in Play
Being a development stage biopharmaceutical company  Immune Design has not generated any product revenues yet  The company earns revenues from collaboration and licensing agreements  and the sale of products associated with material transfer  collaboration and supply agreements 
Investors are expected to focus on the company s progress on its pipeline  The company is developing multiple candidates using its two discovery platforms   ZVex and GLAAS   for the treatment of various types of cancer  Key pipeline candidates include CMB305 and G100  CMB305 has been designed under a prime boost approach  involving the sequential dosing of two complementary agents   LV305  from the ZVex platform  and G305 
CMB305 is currently undergoing an expansion study as a single agent in patients with cancers expressing the NY ESO 1 tumor antigen  Data from the study are anticipated in the first half of 2016  The company also believes that CMB305 has the potential to gain orphan designation in both the U S  and the EU  
In addition  a randomized phase II trial on CMB305  in combination with Roche Holdings    OTC RHHBY   investigational anti PD L1 therapy  atezolizumab  in comparison with atezolizumab alone  for locally advanced  relapsed or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma is currently underway  Data are expected in the fourth quarter of 2016  The company plans to seek for a regulatory approval for CMB305 in the soft tissue sarcoma indication assuming positive results from the ongoing trial 
Meanhwile  another candidate  G100  developed from the GLAAS platform  completed a phase I trial in patients with merkel cell carcinoma  Data are expected in the first half of 2016  Immune Design is collaborating with Merck   Co  Inc    NYSE MRK   to evaluate G100 in combination with Merck s Keytruda  for the treatment of patients with non Hodgkin s lymphoma 
The company recently dosed the first patient in a randomized phase Ib II trial in patients with follicular non Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with Keytruda  Results from the study are expected to be out by the first half of 2017 
Due to the numerous ongoing trials  operating expenses are expected to remain high in the first quarter  We expect the company to shed light on its progress with these trials during the first quarter call 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Immune is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 65 cents 
Zacks Rank  Although Immune Design s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

204144,425660,MRK,Ultimately  S P 500 Earnings Will Have To Start Moving Higher,opinion,"In 2015  the  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate for the S P 500 turned negative in early April  15 and stayed that way for all of 2015  as rapidly declining Energy estimates and the strong dollar took its toll on S P 500 earnings 
Already in 2016  crude oil has rallied roughly 40  50  off its January February  16 lows and the dollar weakened roughly 7  this past week after the Fed talked about fewer planned rate hikes for 2016 
Stabilizing commodities and a weaker buck are  a good thing   for S P 500 earnings  as Martha Stewart would say  even though the S P 500 earnings data has yet to incorporate the new market trends  Even Financials found a bid later this past week  as perhaps the energy credit scenario   i e  massive defaults   may not be as apocalyptic as originally suspected 
One old saw or maxim learned years ago in investing was that  ultimately  fundamentals must follow technicals  
It looks as if we are seeing sustainable bottoms in groups that have been in downtrends for years  crude oil  copper  gold  and commodities in general  Energy  Transports  etc  Only Biotech has yet to really turn  but its downtrend didn t really start until August  15 with the China correction 
However  S P 500 earnings estimates haven t yet moved  I think the sell wide analysts want to wait and hear what Q1  16 Energy and commodity sector managements guide to for Q2  16 and beyond 
Thomson Reuters S P 500 earnings data  by the numbers   as of Friday  March 18   16  

Forward 4 quarter estimate   120 39 vs last week s  120 67  In the last 4 weeks  the forward estimate has fallen about  1 
P E ratio  17 x 
PEG ratio  still elevated at 15 x    core earnings growth probably closer to 3    4 
S P 500 earnings yield  5 87  down from last week s 5 97   Anytime the S P 500 earnings yield has dipped under 6   the S P 500 has usually corrected 
Year over year growth of 4 quarter estimate   1 08  vs last week s  0 98   This  y y growth rate of the forward 4 quarter estimate  has languished now between  2  and  2  for the last 12 months  and must start to move higher if the S P 500 is to make all time highs 

Analysis   commentary  Most of this weekend s stock market commentary is discussing how overbought the S P 500 is  but it really isn t if that S P 500 forward estimate starts to move higher  And the fact is   as I learned painfully in 2008   the S P 500 forward estimate can remain quite  sticky  until the change is obvious  The fact that crude oil has rallied  the Energy sector is stabilizing  and the dollar is starting to weaken means that forward guidance should get somewhat more optimistic come April  16 s earnings releases  if only by a little bit 
If there is one thing that has been obvious off the post  09 lows  and with the latest generation of Street analysts  earnings estimates don t seem to move higher until the catalysts are obvious  Maybe put another way  there is no P E expansion occurring at all in the market today and earnings growth is all that you are getting 
The Health Care sector didn t really participate in this strong rally the last 6 weeks  Large cap pharma stocks probably represent good value for investors if you can look beyond the Presidential election rhetoric  Biotech hasn t gotten any traction either  but its bear market  while severe  is just 8 months old  Pfizer  NYSE PFE  is our clients  biggest net large cap pharma position  but some clients are long Merck  NYSE MRK  too  A number of large cap pharma names are testing their  200 week moving averages  when looking at the charts   Client positions can change at any time  for fundamental or technical reasons  
After a brutal start to Financials for the first 6 weeks of the year  if Energy and commodities stabilize  I do think Financials still work  The big banks are in great shape from a capital perspective  I still do not know why the sector traded the way it did through the end of February  16  but who would have thought on December 31  15 that as of March 18  16   looking at the SPDR ETFs like Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  and Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE    that Financia s would be  5  year to date and Energy would be  5    Long both XLF  XLE 
The sectors that have been a significant drag on the S P 500 for the last 18 months are starting to stabilize  The weak dollar helps immensely too  at first from a psychological or sentiment perspective  but ultimately from an economic perspective 
The catalysts are starting to emerge that can break S P 500 earnings growth from its multi year lethargy  Higher commodity prices  slightly higher core inflation from a wage and price perspective  and a weaker dollar  While these were the exact catalysts for the 1987 Crash in October  1987  today  they could be the catalysts for a continued bull market  Higher commodity prices and higher inflation should be beneficial for S P 500 earnings  particularly after the deflationary decade from 2000 through 2010  and then the Financial constriction that followed ",2016-03-20,Brian Gilmartin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/ultimately,-sp-500-earnings-have-to-start-to-move-higher-200122151",200122151
204145,425661,MRK,Opexa Therapeutics  Restructuring Sharpens Tcelna Focus ,opinion,"On 2 March Opexa Therapeutics  NASDAQ OPXA  announced it has embarked on a restructuring initiative to prioritize its spending towards completing the ongoing 190 patient Abili T Phase II study of lead candidate Tcelna in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis  SPMS   The company has reduced its overall headcount by about 30   but this does not affect the Abili T study timelines  for which data are expected in early Q416  The restructuring lengthens the company s financial runway into Q117  vs prior guidance of Q416   providing added flexibility around the timing of Tcelna data  Our rNPV is  35 1m  which after including  12 4m Q415 net cash equates to an equity valuation of  6 81 per share

204146,425662,MRK,MRK  Maximizing Reward  Minimizing Risk,opinion,"When it comes to trading and investing  knowing what strategy to use when is often half the battle 
Take a look at Merck   Company  NYSE MRK  in Figures 1 and 2  As you can see  following the recent rally MRK is once again  bumping its head  on a familiar resistance area between roughly  56 and  61 
Figure 1   MRK Weekly  Courtesy AIQ TradingExpert 
Figure 2   Courtesy AIQ TradingExpert 
Now different traders may look at these charts and have different reactions  Some might say  it s time to sell  or possibly even say  it s time to sell short   On the other hand others may look at this and say  gee  if it can just break through resistance it could run to a much higher level  
The other side of the equation involves asking how much money a trader is willing to risk in order to express that opinion  So for the sake of example  and as always  please remember that this is an example and not a recommendation  let s say that a trader wants to establish a bullish position in case MRK does manage to breakout to the upside  but that he or she doesn t wish to risk much money 
The Bull Call Backspread
The strategy we will use is an option strategy known most commonly as a  backspread   This strategy involves selling a lower strike price call option and using some or all of the proceeds to buy 2 or higher strike price calls  In our example we also want to give MRK some time to work its way higher  so we will consider longer term rather than shorter term options 
One other note regarding the backspread strategy  At the time the trade is entered  the lower the implied volatility for the options the better  after the position is entered  a rise in volatility can increase the profit potential and or reduce the shorter term risk  and vice versa   As you can see in Figure 3  the implied volatility for MRK options is not at  rock bottom  levels  but it has fallen back down to the low end of the historical range 

Figure 3   Courtesy  
The particulars of our example trade appear in Figure 4 
Figure 4   Courtesy  
Key things to note 
 There are 198 days left until option expiration
 The trade holds unlimited upside potential
 The maximum risk is   826  however  that amount of loss would only be incurred if we are still holding this trade on October option expiration day AND MRK closes on that day at exactly  57 50  In other words  in order to negate that risk all we have to do is resolve to exit the trade prior to October expiration 
Figure 5 looks at the risk involved with this position 

Figure 5   Courtesy  
As you can see  if we resolve to exit the trade by 8 16 for example  the risk curve for this date is represented by the green line in Figures 5 and 6  
 This gives MRK over four months to make some kind of a move to the upside AND
 The worst case loss is approximately   364  this is approximate because a decline in volatility could result in a slightly larger loss and a rise in volatility could result in a slightly small loss  
Also note that we can give MRK a lot of room on the downside  A close look at the risk curve lines in Figure 5 reveal that as MRK price falls lower the dollar risk actual decreases  So if we use the recent low of  47 97 as a stop loss point  by the time MRK falls to that price our risk is only approximately   230  again depending somewhat on any changes in volatility  
Now let s consider the profit potential as displayed in Figure 6 
Figure 6   Courtesy  
As you can see in Figure 6 if MRK moves one standard deviation higher to roughly  64 a share the trade will generate a profit of approximately  1 050  And if MRK was able to break out above the 2015 high of  63 62 and rally two standard deviations then profit potential soars to much higher levels 
Summary
The trade presented herein is an example of a call backspread with a reasonably good reward to risk profile   nothing more  nothing less  That being said please note that I am note  predicting  that MRK will in fact breakout to the upside  The 56 to 61 price range has been a rally killer on numerous occasions in the past and there is no reason to think it can t be again  This is important to consider because the bottom line is that if the stock does not rally further to the upside this trade will lose money 
But not much  And that really is the point  This trade represents an example of one way to play a potential continuation for MRK while essentially only  risking a couple of bucks   Like I said  knowing what strategy to use when is often half the battle ",2016-04-07,Jay Kaeppel,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/mrk:-maximizing-reward,-minimizing-risk-200124348",200124348

204168,425684,MRK,Cancer Immunotherapy Investing  It s All About The Right Technology,opinion,"For many decades  cancer therapy research has failed or  best case  has led to only marginally effective therapies for most types of cancer  which explains why many investors and even clinicians have lost faith in seeing any substantial advance made in the near future  Today  with the data accumulating from clinical trials  there is no doubt that immunotherapy will change our perspective on cancer treatment and give hope to the millions of patients diagnosed with different cancers every year From a financial point of view  cancer immunotherapy is definitely one of the most exciting fields to invest in for the next decade  and despite the underlying risk  many investors are willing to take the early bird strategy in order to most benefit from the high growth potential 
In this article I will try to give summarize some scientific background to help understand the different current approaches in the cancer immunotherapy  and enable readers to make more informed investing decisions  In this article  I will concentrate on three questions which are  in my opinion  the most important for any biotech investor 

First  which companies are adapting the approaches with proven efficacy from clinical trials 
Second  which approaches are more likely to deliver a cost effective treatment to the market 
Third  in which approaches are safety related disappointments less likely 

These questions will be discussed regarding the main approaches biotechnology companies have adapted to beat cancer  which are  CAR T cells  enhanced affinity TCRs  cancer vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors  Please note that this article will only consider the growth companies listed under Loncar cancer immunotherapy index  Chimeric T cell antigen receptor  CAR T cells   Developing companies  ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc  NASDAQ ZIOP   Kite Pharma  NASDAQ KITE   Juno Therapeutic  NASDAQ JUNO   Bluebird bio Inc  NASDAQ BLUE   Cellectis SA  NASDAQ CLLS  and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ BLCM  
In this approach  human T cells are genetically modified to have an engineered receptor that recognizes a specific molecule on the surface of tumor cells  these T cells will subsequently attack and destroy the cancer cells  From the few clinical trials conducted in the last three years  this type of immunotherapy has proved highly effective and led in one of these trials to a complete response in 75  of patients suffering from a blood cancer called CLL  which was resistant to chemotherapy  These are by far the most promising results seen in cancer treatment  which explains why so many companies are racing to achieve most advances in this field 
So far  only Kite and Juno have announced clinical data from trials using the CAR T cells  with Cellectis to enter the clinical stage in 2015  and while most of these trials were using CAR T cells of the 2nd generation  Juno is developing other generations  3rd and 4th  which may be more effective  especially in solid tumors  but will unlikely come without a safety cost 
However  it is noteworthy that most trials with CAR T cells were conducted in patients with blood cancers affecting the B cells  mainly ALL and CLL   the reason is simply that B cells have a high specific molecule  CD19  that we can target without damaging other organs  Meanwhile  Juno  Kite and Bellicum are developing CAR T cells to target other molecules  Juno  L1cam  Kite  EGFRvIII  Bellicum  PRAME  found in solid tumors  Nevertheless  achieving a high efficacy here is more challenging than what we have seen in blood cancers  mainly because L1cam and PRAME may be found in normal tissues while EGFRvIII is more tumor specific but it is only found in 30  of patients with Glioblastoma  a brain cancer  
Safety profile is another challenge for CAR T cells therapy  with many patients developing a life threatening reaction known as cytokine syndrome  in which the effective destruction of the tumor cells results in releasing excessive amounts of small molecules  the cytokines  causing symptoms similar to those seen in severe infections  Other deadly reactions may occur when targeting molecules existing in healthy tissues of the vital organs  However  Bellicum and Juno therapeutics are developing their own approaches to minimize this specificity related risk  either by providing their therapeutic cells with a suicide gene that can be triggered any time during the therapy to save patient s life  Bellicum  or by making them able to recognize two different molecules and thereby increasing their tumor specificity and avoiding collateral damage 
After efficacy and safety  comes cost effectiveness as the next issue investors need to consider  This point becomes especially important once you know that most trials have used a patient s own T cells  autologous CAR T cells   meaning that the developing companies will not be able to recognize their potential market size unless they make huge investments in building their advanced facilities in all demographic centers  which will make it very hard to keep a good profit margin  In this term  Ziopharm and Cellectis are developing a cheaper and more innovative solution  which may enable them to produce off the shelf CAR T cells by genetically modifying these cells to prevent their immunoreaction against the patients  healthy tissues  Increased affinity T cell receptors  TCR  Developing companies  Kite  Juno and Adaptimmune Therapeutics Plc  NASDAQ ADAP  
This therapeutic approach is different from CAR T cells by means of enhancing the receptors existing naturally on the T cells in order to break their cancer tolerance  The main advantage of TCRs over CAR T cells is their ability to recognize extracellular and intracellular molecules as well  which will significantly increase the available therapeutic targets 
In clinical trials  increased affinity TCRs have demonstrated significant clinical responses in patients with metastatic melanoma  colorectal carcinoma  and synovial sarcoma  although the response rate was variable and ranged from 12 to 67   Adaptimmune was the first company to announce data from clinical trials  where increased affinity TCRs were used to target a tumor specific protein molecule known as NY ESO 1  These trials have shown a clinical response in over 50  of patients with solid and hematologic tumors 
The main downside of this approach is the lack of success in developing off the shelf therapeutic cells  as these same receptors  TCRs  take a main part in triggering the immune reaction against the host cells  meaning that these T cells must be taken from the patients  own blood   Cancer vaccines Developing companies  Bellicum  Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ INO   Oncothyreon Inc  NASDAQ ONTY   Celldex Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ CLDX   NewLink Genetics Corporation  NASDAQ NLNK  and Northwest Biotherapeutics Inc  NASDAQ NWBO  
Unlike the vaccines we take to prevent diseases  cancer vaccines aim mostly to treat diagnosed cancers  yet they have a similar mechanism  These vaccines aim to break the cancer immune tolerance by processing and reintroducing the cancer cells or their contents in a way that stimulates a natural immune response 
Despite the high potential of the adaptive T cell therapies  CAR T cells and TCRs   the vaccine based immunotherapy is  in my opinion  a more attractive medium to long term investment  Here are the main points  on which I based my thought 

Many cancer vaccines are already in late clinical stages  Phase II and III  what makes them  at least in theory  closer to any possible market entrance 
Most vaccines are being developed as off the shelf therapies  which means less operating expenses and a chance for higher profit margins comparing with the personalized CAR  and TCR  therapies 
Cancer vaccines have shown potency in many types of cancers  whereas the clinical efficacy of the CAR T cells is still restricted to blood cancers 
From clinical trials  vaccines were less likely to cause the serious side effects seen with CAR T cells  cytokine syndrome and organ failure   which makes the latter more vulnerable to safety related disappointments 

As many biotechs have adapted substantially different approaches to develop cancer vaccines  I will try to summarize these main approaches and their possible upsides and downsides 
Bellicum is developing an approach based on genetically engineering patient s dendritic cells  the antigen presenting cells  so they can introduce a protein called PSMA  prostate specific membrane antigen  to the other contents of the immune system in order to treat prostate cancer  Efficacy is still to be proven in clinical trials  but even then  finding specific targets  production complicity and cost effectiveness may be challenging for this approach 
Inovio s vaccines utilize DNA structures that encode cancer specific proteins  Phase I trials have been initiated to test two vaccination products in a variety of cancers  Beside their suitability for universal  off the shelf  commercialization  the main advantage of this approach is its designing flexibility  meaning that one vaccine can be easily engineered to target more than one cancer protein 
Oncothyreon is developing off the shelf protein based vaccine to stimulate an immune response against a cancer specific molecule known as MUC1  This vaccine is being tested in phase I trials in patients with solid tumors 
Celldex is also working on two off the shelf cancer vaccines  the first is a Phase III peptide that targets EGFRvIII  a cancer specific protein   In Phase II trials  this vaccine has increased the 3 years survival rate in patients with Glioblastoma  a brain cancer  to 26  comparing with 18  under current standard therapy  The second vaccine uses a more sophisticated approach to deliver the immune stimulating protein directly to the dendritic cells and is being tested in phase II trials with encouraging data from phase I in multiple tumors 
Newlink took a totally different approach by modifying cancer cells themselves so they can be used as an off the shelf therapy to stimulate the immune response in patients suffering from the same type of cancer  Among the many trials  the best outcomes were seen in phase II trials in patients with Pancreatic cancer  where this cellular vaccine achieved a 120  increase in 3 years survival rate  Despite the concerns associated with the injection of whole cancer cells  this vaccine has a good safety profile with no reported life threatening reactions 
Northwest Biotherapeutics is working on highly personalized cancer vaccines  which require obtaining the patient s own dendritic and tumor cells as well  Apart from the financial challenges surrounding it  this approach has shown by far the best results seen in patients with glioblastoma  a brain cancer   as the patients had a median survival of 3 years  more than triple the usual time with standard of care treatments   
Checkpoints inhibitors
Checkpoints inhibitors are antibodies or small molecules that block specific receptors  known as checkpoint receptors  which help tumor cells escape the body natural immune attack  With proved clinical efficacies and favorable safety profiles  three checkpoints inhibitors were approved from FDA in the last four years  Opdivo   and Yervoy   from Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  and Keytruda   from Merck  NYSE MRK    Although their clinical benefits are less exciting than these seen in the above mentioned approaches  checkpoints inhibitors have a high potential to be used in combination with other immunotherapies  which may make them an essential ingredient in our future cancer recipe 
However  even when it may be a win win game  investing in checkpoints inhibitors is not that simple as this approach is still dominated by the giant pharmaceutical companies  with only a few biotechs  including Agenus  Tesaro and Newlink genetics  developing similar agents in preclinical stages  
The bottom line
Even if we still can t talk about a cancer cure  there is no doubt that the cancer immunotherapy will change the way we look at this disease in the next decade  Financially  and with the increasing numbers of biotechs engaged in this field  the best what investors can do is to understand what these companies are working on  follow the companies they are most convinced about and most importantly  use the harmless bad news to accumulate shares at lower prices",2015-09-17,Tarek Roustom,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investing-in-cancer-immunotherapy:-choose-the-right-technology-265340,265340
204169,425685,MRK,The Rigging Of The American Market,opinion,"Much of the national debate about widening inequality focuses on whether and how much to tax the rich and redistribute their income downward 
But this debate ignores the upward redistributions going on every day  from the rest of us to the rich  These redistributions are hidden inside the market 
The only way to stop them is to prevent big corporations and Wall Street banks from rigging the market 
For example  Americans pay  for pharmaceuticals than do the citizens of any other developed nation 
That s partly because it s perfectly legal in the U S   but not in most other nations  for the makers of branded drugs to pay the makers of generic drugs to delay introducing cheaper unbranded equivalents  after patents on the brands have expired 
This costs you and me an estimated a year   a hidden upward redistribution of our incomes to Pfizer  Merck  N MRK   and other big proprietary drug companies  their executives  and major shareholders 
We also pay more for Internet service than do the inhabitants of any other developed nation 
The average cable bill in the United States rose 5 percent in 2012  the latest year available   nearly triple the rate of inflation 
Why  Because  of us have no choice of Internet service provider  which allows them to charge us more 
Internet service here costs 3 and a half times more than it does in   for example  where the typical customer can choose between 7 providers 
And U S  cable companies are intent on keeping their monopoly 
It s another hidden upward distribution   from us to Comcast  O CMCSA   Verizon  or another giant cable company  its executives and major shareholders 
Likewise  the interest we pay on home mortgages or college loans is higher than it would be if the big banks that now dominate the financial industry had to work harder to get our business 
As recently as 2000  America s five largest banks held 25 percent of all U S  banking assets  Now they hold    which gives them a lock on many such loans 
If we can t repay  forget using bankruptcy  Donald Trump can go bankrupt four times and walk away from his debts  but the bankruptcy code doesn t allow homeowners or graduates to reorganize unmanageable debts 
So beleaguered homeowners and graduates don t have any bargaining leverage with creditors   exactly what the financial industry wants 
The net result  another hidden upward redistribution   this one  from us to the big banks  their executives  and major shareholders 
Some of these upward redistributions seem to defy gravity  Why have average domestic airfares risen 2 5  over the past  and are now at their the highest level since the government began tracking them in 1995   while fuel prices  the largest single cost for the airlines  have plummeted 
Because America went from nine major carriers ten years ago to just four now  Many airports are now served by one or two 
This makes it easy for airlines to coordinate their fares and keep them high   resulting in another upward redistribution 
Why have food prices been rising  than inflation  while crop prices are now at a six year low 
Because the giant corporations that process food have the power to raise prices  Four food companies control  of beef packing  t of soybean processing  of pork packing  and  of chicken processing 
Result  A redistribution from average consumers to Big Agriculture 
Finally  why do you suppose health insurance is costing us more  and co payments and deductibles are rising 
One reason is big insurers are consolidating into giants with the power to raise prices  They say these combinations make their companies more efficient  but they really just give them power to charge more 
Health insurers are hiking ratesnext year  and their stock values are skyrocketing  the Standard   Poor s 500 Managed Health Care Index recently hit its in more than twenty years  
Add it up   the extra money we re paying for pharmaceuticals  Internet communications  home mortgages  student loans  airline tickets  food  and health insurance   and you get a hefty portion of the average family s budget 
Democrats and Republicans spend endless time battling over how much to tax the rich and then redistribute the money downward 
But if we didn t have so much upward redistribution inside the market  we wouldn t need as much downward redistribution through taxes and transfer payments 
Yet as long as the big corporations  Wall Street banks  their top executives and wealthy shareholders have the political power to do so  they ll keep redistributing much of the nation s income upward to themselves 
Which is why the rest of us must gain political power to stop the collusion  bust up the monopolies  and put an end to the rigging of the American market ",2015-11-02,Robert B. Reich,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-rigging-of-the-american-market-269876,269876

204177,425693,MRK,Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Climbing Since 2009,opinion,"Over the past five years  one sector has outperformed all others in the S P 500  healthcare 
Biotech stocks have led the way  with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index climbing a whopping 520  since early 2009 
The sector s incredible run hasn t dampened enthusiasm for the future  either   continue to receive bullish outlooks  and some are even taking on an air of invincibility 
In early 2015  InvestorPlace dubbed more than half a dozen healthcare stocks  immune  to market declines  And Mario Minotti of Minotti Group Wealth Advisors recently told TheStreet com that he still sees  a lot of growth potential  in biotech right now 
The problem  of course  is that this seemingly unstoppable trend can t last forever  Indeed  a number of healthcare stocks have become extremely overvalued  and eventually they re going to correct  Don t be left holding the bag when they do 
Far From Invincible
This warning is particularly salient for income investors  as healthcare stocks often pay solid dividends and may seem like attractive investments  Yet without doing the proper research  income seekers could end up with serious buyer s remorse 
To avoid falling for supposedly invincible yet overvalued companies  we need to look at valuation metrics  Comparing a company s valuation to the market or to its industry is fine  but it s also important to compare the company s current valuation to its 10 year averages  Let s look at Merck   Co   NYSE MRK  as an example 
Merck is one of the world s largest developers  manufactures  and distributors of pharmaceuticals  Its product categories include heart and respiratory health  infectious diseases  and women s health  At the moment  many of its biggest products are used to fight cancer 
Merck currently yields 3 1   which is nothing to sneeze at  Of course  five year dividend growth of 18  isn t good  but management has bumped the payout every year since 2011 
However  problems arise when we start looking at Merck s valuation 

Currently  the company is trading at a significant premium to the 10 year average of its EV EBITDA ratio  price to sales  P S  ratio  and price to earnings  P E  ratio 
If you need a refresher on EV EBITDA  make sure to check out my colleague   Also remember that you can always find a company s EV EBITDA on the key statistics page at Yahoo  Finance   
You ll notice that Yahoo  Finance lists a different EV EBITDA than my table  which was sourced from Bloomberg  Yahoo  acknowledges that its calculations  made with Capital IQ  may differ from those listed by a company in its reporting 
Either way  it s always worth comparing the current valuation to a longer term average  Even some companies that appear to be trading at a reasonable P E or EV EBITDA might end up being extremely expensive compared to their average 
Bottom line  Don t get caught up in the hype of supposedly invincible stocks  It s always worth doing your own research to see whether a stock actually represents a good buy right now  regardless of the dividend yield or the industry s supposed strength

204178,425694,MRK,What Does The Greek Crisis Mean For Financial Markets ,opinion,"The calendar shows a fair amount of economic data in the coming week  but attention is likely to be focused abroad  After many years  some would say decades  of percolating  the issue of Greece and the Eurozone is coming to a conclusion  I expect this week s theme to be 
What does the Greek crisis mean for financial markets  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that market participants would be focused on the Fed  wondering if they had heard the message from the markets  Some readers commented that Greece was likely to take center stage  They were right at the start of the week  and also at the end when even the most voluble pundits were running out of comments about a predictable Fed meeting  Doug Short s excellent  always captures the story in one great chart 

Feel free to join in my exercise in thinking about the upcoming theme  We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead 
This Week s Theme
The Greece story has been high on the list of worries for several years  Some observers suggest that the underlying problems are better measured in decades 
This coming week features a solid data calendar  but nothing really dominates  The Greek story is both timely and compelling  with the market effects uncertain  It is a perfect paradise for pundits  I expect market observers to be asking 
What does the Greek Crisis mean for financial markets  
The Viewpoints 
There are several basic viewpoints  ranging from best to worst as follows 
An agreement will be reached at the last possible moment   A   I rarely cite anonymous posts  but this group of Amsterdam professors have been informative on this document  with well documented analysis  
A Greek settlement will encourage other European nations to seek concessions 
Greece will default on some payments  but the impact will be quite limited  A new Greek currency will emerge and there will be no  contagion     
Greece will default  leading to a run on banks    
A Greek default spills over to European banks and other sovereign debt  This weighs seriously on the nascent European economic rebound    

Variations on these themes are possible  Here is a   beginning on Monday  And  from ft com   a great way to keep up with events 
And a tongue in cheek look at the  




As always  I have my own ideas in today s conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was plenty of good economic news 
Initial Jobless claims were only 267K  Here is the look  

Building permits are now at the highest pace since 2007  Some of this is multi family building  but from an economic perspective that is OK 
Core CPI is well contained  I am mystified by those who regard this as bad news  While the Fed is not hitting its inflation  target  we should be happy to see restrained inflation in the context of better economic growth  CPI per se is not a growth measure 
The Fed satisfied the markets  It might not have been a surprise  There were plenty of critics  Despite this  the continuing assurance that the path of rate hikes will be gradual is the key takeaway    the leading Fed observer  summarized the meeting as follows 

Bottom Line  Fed policy unchanged as expected  door still open for a rate hike in September  but the lower rate path indicates a modestly more dovish Fed resigned to a persistent low interest rate environment  It s the rate path we need to be watching  not the timing of the first hike 


Leading indicators once again surprised with a gain of 0 7  versus expectations of 0 4    has a complete analysis and critique  including this chart 

Investor sentiment has turned negative  This is a contrarian indicator  so it is good news   several different indicators and notes the protests from those who previously embraced the same measures  If you are going to be fair about an indicator  you need to accept the result when it changes direction  So many sources trumpet this when bulls seem to be  all in  and then fall silent when it changes 

The Bad
There was also some negative data last week  partly on the policy front 
Trade legislation is still mired in Congress  The political lines are shifting  but the fate is uncertain  As I have consistently noted  opinions may vary about worker protection  but this legislation meets our  market friendly  test    
A new government shutdown looming  Here is the early read     
Putin  Playing a nuclear card  The contemplated additions to inventory are small  and within the existing agreements  but why     
Industrial production declined by 0 2  
Housing starts registered a big decline  This was mixed news  given the revisions and the prior month gains   actually called it a  decent report  although the headline number was certainly disappointing 
The Ugly 
Charleston  So bad  so sad  in so many different ways  overshadowing other issues  I expect the story to dominate the Sunday news shows while everyone tries to sort out the implications 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger 
This week s award goes to Pierre Lapointe  who takes on the crowd that has been worrying about profit margins     This concern has been expensive for many investors  This chart summarizes the argument that it can take many years for declining margins to impact stock prices   Here is  from more than three years ago  This argument never dies  

Noteworthy 
This is an amazing list  particularly when we note that they are business passwords  Even the relatively modern requirement to include some numbers and symbols cannot slow down the creatively lazy   Statista via  

Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  For more information on each source   

Recent Expert Commentary on Recession Odds and Market Trends
Bob Dieli does a   subscription required  after the employment report and also a monthly overview analysis  He follows many concurrent indicators to supplement our featured  C Score  
  A variety of strong quantitative indicators for both economic and market analysis  While we feature the recession analysis  Dwaine also has a number of interesting market indicators  He recently noted an   although the levels are still not yet worrisome

  An update of the regular ECRI analysis with a good history  commentary  detailed analysis and charts  If you are still listening to the ECRI  3  years after their recession call   you should be reading this carefully  Recently the ECRI  to the error in their forecast  but still claims the best overall record  This is simply not true  I rejected their approach in real time during 2011 and also highlighted competing methods that were stronger  Until we know what is inside the black box  I suspect excessive reliance on commodity prices and insistence on unrevised data  we will be unable to evaluate their approach  Doug is more sympathetic in his last update  While I disagree  it will require a longer post to elaborate 
In this week s update Doug notes the ECRI claim of lower growth and more frequent recessions  The two do not necessarily coincide  Recessions do not generally begin with  stalls  but rather with business cycle peaks  Some readers have suggested that I retire this line of discussion from WTWA  I would happily do so if more media sources did a better job with the recession discussion  Until then it provides an important reminder 
Doug s  summary of key indicators watched by the NBER in recession dating shows no evidence of a business cycle peak  Only industrial production shows some weakness 


Some economic activity is not effectively measured  Economic growth is under estimated as a result  Here are   starting with examining the differences between spending and income  I suspect that all of us have contributed some cash to the underground economy  

The Week Ahead
We have a modest week for new data 
The  A List  includes the following 
New home sales  T   An important read on an important sector 
Durable goods  T   Volatile May data  but important for a good read on GDP 
Personal income and spending  Th   Key read on overall economic strength 
Michigan sentiment  F   Great concurrent indicator on spending and employment  with some leading character 
PCE prices  Th   This is the Fed s favorite inflation indicator  with less emphasis on housing  Well worth watching 
Initial jobless claims  Th   The best concurrent news on employment trends  with emphasis on job losses 
The  B List  includes the following 
Existing home sales  M   Less important than new sales  above  but still an interesting read on the sector 
FHFA home prices  T   Covering a wide range of homes  but not followed as widely as other measures 
GDP Q1 third estimate  W   Old news  but it provides a baseline 
Crude oil inventories  W   Current interest in energy keeps this on the list of items to watch 
There is a smidgen of FedSpeak  but it is not very important this week  Anything about Greece will command attention 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders

Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important post  it would be this assessment of market prospects by   He is bullish on the summer prospects for stocks  mostly because of errors in a list of nine popular worries that have weighed on the market  I especially like this one 

9  A market correction is not  due   Perhaps the most important data point of all for the bears to remember is that rallies do not end simply because they ve gone on for a few years and are  due  to correct  Consider the  of 1987 to 2000  which lasted 4 494 days and saw a roughly 585  increase in the S P 500  I would never discourage investors from thinking critically or skeptically about the numbers  and it s human nature to wonder when the party is going to end  But predicting the end just because we ve had a long runup  especially in the face of this encouraging data  That s just self defeating 

Stock Ideas 
Barron s has a   suggesting that some could rise by 50  in the coming year  The basic argument is that expansion of capacity has been controlled and RASM  revenue per available seat mile  strong  While several of the big names are cheap  their favorite is American 
Brian Gilmartin provides  in how to use cash flow to compare dividend stocks  Merck  NYSE MRK  Vs  Pfizer  NYSE PFE    From A Dividend And Free Cash Flow Perspective analyzes two popular stocks  provides ideas about the sector  and helps investors to learn a key element of stock picking

Personal Finance 
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in this   I especially liked this  about emotions and investing   a topic at the top of the list in conferences with new clients 
Energy 
Is Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  the best dividend stock  Tim McAleenan Jr   with a good list of reasons  including noting  all weather flexibility  as the company makes profits in a tough environment 
Thinking about Bonds 
Watch out for bond ETFs that sound good  but have a high bid ask spread  The most liquid ETFs are fine  but some spreads are in the 0 8  range  Chris Dieterich in Barron s 
Has there been a  sideways correction     in the popular Barron s Streetwise column  

In fact  stocks have performed quite well after a quiet start to the year  Paul Hickey of Bespoke Investment Group  looked at the 10 years during which the S P 500 stayed closest to where it had started during the first 117 trading days  He found that it had risen 6 6   on average  in the rest of those 10 years  Says Hickey   A sideways market can be a correction in time  not price  Expect things to drift higher from here  

Final Thought
This section is where I share my own conclusion  I try to add some insight to the evidence  Last week there was some discussion  starting with a complaint from a reader  who obviously had only recently tuned it  that I did not offer specific advice  I hope that the regular audience for WTWA knows that the series is designed with several objectives 
Identify the most important issues
Focus attention on those most relevant for the week ahead
Provide interesting arguments for various perspectives
Explain how your analysis might differ depending upon your time frame
Share my own conclusions  often different for traders and investors    and I have programs doing both 
Anyone expecting a one size fits all  spoon fed approach has come to the wrong place 
How does this apply to Greece  The Greek crisis is a good example of a type of market risk  part of the series I am working on  see the link above   It is an example of something viewed as a binary outcome with a known and certain date for the conclusion  The framework for analysis includes three topics 
The probability of each outcome 
The likely consequences of each outcome 
Market expectations  what is already reflected in market prices  
There is always the chance that the deadline will somehow be extended  Outcomes may also be less binary than they seem  The negotiating parties frequently find creative avenues for compromise as well as delay 
With that background  here is how I am using the framework to think about this risk  My conclusions are based upon a wide variety of sources  In WTWA I do not make an argument for my own viewpoint  but I usually share it 
I rate the chance of a default as quite high  The Greek leadership  encouraged by its constituency  seems unwilling to make concessions  European leaders seem to have reached their limit  Reports from those close to the negotiations have not been encouraging 
I expect the ultimate consequences to be limited  but only after a period of uncertainty  While contagion is unlikely  markets hate uncertainty 
It is always difficult to know what is reflected in current market prices  My conclusion is based upon nearly thirty years of observation of daily trading  My sense is that the Greece effect has  so far  been pretty minor  Most market participants have been trained to expect an eleventh hour resolution    
The average investor should not over react to this  going  all out  of the market for a temporary effect  A trader might try to capture the reaction  We did a little of this in our accounts 
As always  the right trade depends upon your time frame and your agility ",2015-06-22,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-what-does-the-greek-crisis-mean-for-financial-255671,255671

204197,425713,MRK,Rating Merck s Plan To Acquire Cubist Pharma,opinion,"Yesterday  December 8th  Merck   Company  NYSE MRK  announced plans to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ CBST  for a total transaction value of  9 5 billion  The two pharmaceutical companies have agreed that 

 Merck will acquire Cubist for  102 per share in cash  which represents a 35 percent premium to Cubist s average stock price for the most recent five trading days  

Cubist is known for creating antibiotics to combat stubborn bacteria  Antibiotics were once viewed as an unprofitable segment of healthcare sector because patients only use the product for specific rather than ongoing treatment  Drugs used to treat chronic illnesses received more attention due to inelastic demand  However  antibiotics are becoming more relevant and profitable with the surge of superbugs  or antibiotic resistant infections Cubist has proved itself to be a key player in combating superbugs  Bacteria morphs as it encounters resistance  and Cubist is working to outpace these mutations  Cubist currently has four drugs in phase 2 and 3 testing that will treat pneumonia  urinary tract infections  and other ailments to add to this portfolio  Michael Bonney  CEO of Cubist  stated  Combining with Merck is an exciting opportunity to accelerate Cubist s established leadership in antibiotics and deliver significant  certain and immediate value to shareholders   Both companies noted how their portfolios will complement each other nicely Once the acquisition is complete  Merck estimates that Cubist will  add more than  1 billion of revenue to its 2015 base   Looking forward  Merck anticipates that the transaction will be  significantly accretive to non GAAP EPS in 2016 and beyond  
One Financial Expert s Opinion
On December 8th  analyst  of Cantor Fitzgerald  a Hold rating on Cubist with a price target of  90  raised from  64  Rivkind based the increase price target on  a 5x multiple applied to 2016 sales of  1 5B  We think that a takeout thesis on the company is quite reasonable given the accretion associated with Cubicin    1 0B net sales per year   but we also believe that some portion of the deal value could be structured via contingent value rights  CVRs  associated with the company s pipeline  similar to other antibiotic deals    She attributed the Hold rating to CVRs being  typically structured around difficult to achieve targets or aggressive time lines  Rivkind s Past RecommendationsRivkind has a history of rating stocks in the pharmaceutical industry such as Salix Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ SLXP  and Jazz Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ JAZZ  Since April 2012  Rivkind has rated Salix twelve times  She rated the pharmaceutical company a Buy in April 2012 when shares were  48 10  Last month  Rivkind reiterated her Buy rating when shares were  93 87  Rivkind has a 57  success rate recommending Salix with an average return of  13  per recommendation Jazz Pharmaceuticals has been rated eleven times by Rivkin  In March 2013  she rated Jazz a Buy when shares were  59 11 and continued to issue Buy ratings as shares climbed to  114 38 in December 2013  Because of these cunning recommendations  Rivkind has a 120  average return per Jazz recommendation  In addition  it has helped Rivkind earn a 62  overall success rate over the past year recommending stocks with an average return of  15 3  per recommendation 
Conclusion
Merck and Cubist are excited to merge their portfolios of antibiotics and drugs in the face of superbugs  How will the acquisition affect the stock price ",2014-12-09,Uri Gruenbaum,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rating-merck's-plan-to-acquire-cubist-pharma-235140,235140

Worst Recommendations 
1  Robert W  Baird analyst  recommended an Underperform rating on Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc  formerly IDIX  on April 8  2014  after the company announced that the data from its phase 1 II clinical trial for its IDX21437 nucleotide for the treatment of Hepatitis C was promising However  the analyst was skeptical regarding the safety of the drug s under development  noting  We still believe a long road lies ahead fraught with risks   He explained his Underperform rating  saying the  assets in development do not support the current valuation and provide little upside opportunity  Shares were  5 83 when Skorney made the recommendation and jumped to  24 three months later  Based on a 3 month horizon  Skorney lost a  308 0  return in profit for his Underperform rating on IDIX  After Skorney s position closed  Idenix Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Merck  NYSE MRK  and is no longer an independently publicly traded company   has successfully made 32 ratings out of 56 total over the past year  earning a 57  success rate recommending stocks and a  2 4  average return per recommendation 2  Cantor Fitzgerald analyst  downgraded her rating on Pernix Therapeutics  NASDAQ PTX  from Hold to Sell on January 6  2014  after having concerns over a lawsuit in which the company was sued for breach of contract  The analyst anticipated  a negative reaction in the stock or potential dilution to shareholders from an equity financing event  When Rivkand made the recommendation  shares were priced at  2 22  Three months later  Pernix Therapeutics was priced at  5 04  Based on a 3 month horizon  Rivkind lost a  120 2  return in profit for her Sell rating on  Irina Rivkind has successfully made 57 ratings out of 85 total over the past year  earning a 67  success rate recommending stocks with a  18 5  average return per recommendation 3  On September 10  2014  Bank of America  Merrill Lynch analyst  maintained a Buy rating on Sapphire supplier GT Advanced Tech  formerly GTAT   but cut his price target from  22 to  19 after Apple announced they would not be using Sapphire for its iPhone 6 Sankar did not expect the new iPhone 6 to have Sapphire  however he did believe Apple s use of Sapphire in their devices is more of a matter of  when  than a matter of  if  Shares were  12 78 when Sankar made the recommendation  Before the 3 month position was closed  GT Advanced filed for bankruptcy and trading of the company s stock on the NASDAQ is now currently frozen  Sankar lost a  97 7  return in profit for his Buy rating on GTAT Krish Sankar has successfully made 19 ratings out of 40 total over the past year  earning a 48  success rate recommending stocks with a  3 3  average return per recommendation 4  On August 13   2014  Cowen   Co  analyst  also covered GT Advanced Technologies with an Outperform rating and a  19 price target  citing that  Apple s new products launch could serve as a near term catalyst  The analyst noted   We see late 2015 early 2016 as being the end of the transitional period for GTAT as Apple revenue accelerates and solar polysilicon   ingot revenue normalizes and revenue recognition on material Hyperion revenue is achieved   He continued    We note this range implies a  19x multiple on our 2015 estimates  which is lofty  thus we expect the stock performance to be dependent on additional catalysts such as orders on the announced new products as well as on existing solutions  When Osborne made the recommendation  shares were priced at  16 59  As stated before  GT Advanced filed for bankruptcy before Osborne s 3 month position was closed and trading of the company s stock on the NASDAQ is now currently frozen  Osborne lost a  97 5  return in profit for his Outperform rating on GTAT In the past year  Jeff

BPZ Resources  NYSE BPZ  with a  7 00 price target on September 23  2014  after the company released an operations report on September 22  2014 The analyst pointed out the operations report contained good news and bad news  the good news being  that the CX15 7D development well at Corvina was completed earlier than expected allowing BPZ to spud the CX15 10D well on September 14  2014 with completion scheduled for November 2014  and the bad news being  that the Corvina CX15 3D and Albacora A 21D are only producing at 36  of prior levels  suboptimal in our view  Related to this  production from 3Q14 will be lower than volume from 2Q14  Shares were  1 97 when Haas made the recommendation and dropped to  0 22 three months later  Based on a 3 month horizon  Haas lost a  88 3  return in profit for her Buy rating on BPZ Irene Haas has successfully made 23 ratings out of 77 total over the past year  earning a 30  success rate recommending stocks and a  15 9  average return

204212,425728,MRK,Who s Buying Small Caps At P E 84 ,opinion,My  Buy in May  thesis held this central idea  the much awaited and necessary stock market correction had already occurred in the growth indexes suc as the Russell 2000 and NASDAQ Composite  And in May  the strong S P 500 index which was just waiting to go higher  would lift the RUT and the Nasdaq  On May 8  I advised Market Timers that we were starting a campaign to play a bottom in the RUT around 1100  I called it our  50 50  campaign because we were looking for support at the 50 week moving average  just below 1100  and for a bounce to ensue to retrace at least 50  of the March April decline  rally to 1150   We played that rally with TNA fairly well  despite a hiccup with the Tepper Tantrum on May 15 where the RUT actually went down and kissed the February low at 1082  Now the RUT rally has exceeded even my expectations for how quickly it could get back to 1180  I m sure there is a fair amount of  bear hunting  going on  but some of my favorite small caps are acting great for good reasons and I want to buy more  In fact  I did buy one yesterday  But  here s the number that still bothers the bears the most about the RUT  84  That s the 12 month trailing P E for the index  That is worrisome  But here s another number the bears should focus on  19  That s the 12 month forward P E  Here s the data from Friday s Wall Street Journal   Now  of course  I m not saying that I believe the RUT will fulfill those wonderful forward estimates  But that s not the point  The point is that many large investors are piling fresh cash into many small companies that they believe will move from a triple digit P E to a double digit one  or that they believe will be doubling or tripling their sales in the next year  Or that they believe are ripe take over targets where the sub  1 billion company gets taken out for 2 or 3 times that valuation  like hepatitis C drug maker Idenix Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ IDIX  yesterday getting bought by Merck  NYSE MRK   While many investors wring their hands about valuations  every week I see managers of large portfolios putting money to work in growth stocks like the one I just bought yesterday  And as long as the S P 500 and Nasdaq 100 remain strong  the smaller growth indexes should make new highs this year  probably this summer  Where do you stand on the valuation question for smaller companies    Is it all too much  QE liquidity  driving us toward another bubble  Or is this investor optimism about the economy and earnings that is justified and bound to persist into next year ,2014-06-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/who's-buying-small-caps-at-p-e-84-215487,215487

204238,425754,MRK,Embrace These New ETFs  Don t Play The Waiting Game,opinion,There is a deeply flawed school of thought prominent in the world of exchange traded products and it applies directly to new ETFs and ETNs  Many investors believe they should wait for new funds to mature before getting involved    Mature  means wait for a new ETF to gain assets and sufficient average daily trading volume  though neither metric has ever been scientifically linked to an ETF s total returns   Think about that for a moment  By waiting for Investor A to commit capital to a new ETF  Investor B is succumbing to the same follow the herd mentality that has doomed market participants for years   Here is real world example of what can happen when investors play the waiting game with new ETFs and by  new   it is funds that are less than a year old that are being referred to  The PowerShares S P 500 High Dividend Portfolio  SPHD  debuted on October 18  2012   Although SPHD has yet to reach the overrated  100 million in assets under management threshold  volume is decent at over 60 000 shares per day and only once during the fourth quarter did the midpoint on SPHD s bid ask spread exceed 50 basis points above the ETF s net asset value  Since its debut  SPHD has gained nearly seven percent and has delivered four dividend payments  it pays a monthly dividend  totaling about 41 5 cents per share   To be fair  not all new ETFs merit investors  consideration  but not all of these funds should be ignored  either  At least not simply because they are new  The following rookie ETFs are worth looking at right now and all of them debuted this year   PIMCO Foreign Currency Strategy ETF  FORX  The PIMCO name certainly helps and that is perhaps one reason why the PIMCO Foreign Currency Strategy ETF is off to an impressive start having attracted  26 6 million in AUM in just over a month of trading  FORX is an actively managed ETF  meaning investors will pay up a bit for the privilege of PIMCO management  though an expense ratio of 0 65 percent is decent among actively managed products   FORX invests  in currencies  currency forwards  or fixed income securities denominated in the currencies of foreign  non U S   countries  and  intends to limit its exposure to any one currency to 20  and to maintain a portfolio duration between zero and three years   according to PIMCO   What is attractive about FORX is its allocations to countries that have not engaged in currency debasement via monetary easing  For example  Canada  Norway  Australia and New Zealand combine for nearly 39 percent of the new ETF s weight   Global X SuperDividend U S  ETF  DIV  This one will really get the naysayers going because the Global X SuperDividend U S  ETF is not even a week old  However  DIV is not offering up an opaque concept that warrants a wait and see approach  Rather  the new fund is quite straight forward   Home to 50 stocks that are almost equally weighted  DIV is the U S  complement to the successful Global X SuperDividend ETF  SDIV   SDIV crossed the  100 million AUM level in August and has since more than quadrupled that total  For a moment  think about what would have happened if an investor was thinking about buying SDIV in May 2012 and declined in the essence of waiting for the ETF to reach  100 million in assets   That investor s entry point was about 10 percent and he missed out on three months of dividends because SDIV pays a monthly dividend  There are no guarantees DIV will follow a same trajectory  but Global X does expect DIV will pay a monthly dividend  Investors can take comfort in the fact that DIV is home to plenty of familiar  low beta names such as Dow components AT T  T   Merck  MRK  and Verizon  VZ    WisdomTree Global Corporate Bond Fund  GLCB  For the investor looking for a complement to or a yield above that of the iShares iBoxx   Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund  LQD   the newly minted WisdomTree Global Corporate Bond Fund is a credible option   GLCB debuted at the end of January and should not be viewed as a high risk version of LQD  U S  issues account for almost 52 percent of the new ETF s weight and half the holdings are rated A or AA with another 21 7 percent garnering a BBB rating  Overall  GLCB offers exposure to 15 countries  including four emerging markets   GLCB s effective duration is 5 54 years with an embedded income yield of 3 72 percent  according to WisdomTree data  The ETF s 30 day SEC yield is 35 basis points higher than LQD s BY The ETF Professor,2013-03-15,Benzinga ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/embrace-these-new-etfs:-don't-play-the-waiting-game-159060,159060
