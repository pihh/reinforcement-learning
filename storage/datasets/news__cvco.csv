2312,223827,CVCO,Cavco Industries  The Last House Standing,opinion,"Believe it or not  mobile home stocks used to be good places to park your money  Twenty years ago  the so called  manufactured housing  industry was widely followed by Wall Street analysts  and public companies like Clayton Homes  Champion Homes  and Palm Harbor Homes were all rated strong buys 
Then the roof caved in 
First  the easy credit of the early 2000s housing bubble allowed many first time buyers to choose  site built  homes instead mobile homes  That was followed by the 2008 crisis  when financing for all types of homes  mobile or otherwise  evaporated  Now  US mobile home production hovers around 70 000 units  down from a peak of 350 000 units in the late 1990s 
But a few companies have managed to weather the storm  The top three builders now command a combined 72 percent of the market  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  owns the largest of them  Clayton Homes  which accounts for 45 percent of all US mobile home production  The third largest company  Champion  is privately held  Aside from tiny Skyline Corp   NYSE SKY    that leaves only one publicly traded option for most stock investors  the second place company by market share  Phoenix based Cavco Industries  NASDAQ CVCO  
Cavco was spun out of Dallas based homebuilder Centex in 2003  Today  it operates 19 manufacturing plants and 45 company owned retail stores  The average Cavco home is 500 to 3000 square feet  and brings the company about  50 000  Cavco has been profitable every year since 2003  In fiscal 2016  it made  29M  or  3 15 share  on  712M of revenues vs   24M  or  2 64 share  on  567M of revenues a year ago  Unlike almost all site built homebuilders  Cavco has no debt and is sitting on  108M in cash  or  12 share  Fiscal 2016 free cash flow was  42M  and should grow to  45M in fiscal 2017 and  53M in fiscal 2018  That means  in two years  Cavco could have nearly  200M cash  or about  21 share  Not bad for an industry plagued by excessive debt and  for site builders  high amounts of land inventory 
At today s share price of  99  CVCO sells for 24x current year EPS of  4 15  That s not cheap  but a number of catalysts could boost the stock  1  price competition is unlikely  as Berkshire Hathaway subsidies rarely cut prices to gain market share  which means Cavco s 20 percent gross margin and 6 4 percent pretax margin should increase in upcoming years  2  stock buybacks and or a dividend initiation are likely  as management wants to return cash to shareholders  and 3  the manufactured home industry should grow as a percent of the entire housing industry as financing becomes easier and a secondary market  securitization  is re established 
Finally  I suspect revenue  profit  and cash flow growth will compel additional brokerage industry analysts to recommend Cavco shares  At the moment  only one analyst from an obscure firm writes research on the company  I expect that number to grow  Cavco just announced a 2 for 1 stock split  and the upcoming annual meeting  as always  will be held this June at the company s Phoenix headquarters  Having grown up in the area  I can safely guarantee comfy 105 110 degree weather that day  Last year  exactly one outside investor attended   I think he mainly came for the sandwiches   As Cavco s fortunes continue to improve  a lot more people should begin to take notice ",2016-06-03,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cavco-industries:-the-last-house-standing-200133813,200133813

government shutdowns and extensive regulation affecting manufactured housing This conference call also contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this live broadcast  Friday  January 31st  2020  Cavco undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this conference call  except as required by law Now  I would like to turn the call over to Bill Boor  President and Chief Executive Officer  Bill William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you and welcome  everyone  The message this quarter is one of continuing consumer demand and strong results from our operations  We re doing a great job focusing on quality  service and profitability  Very good demand stemming from the strong economy and well documented demographic drivers continue to leave us optimistic about the industry as a whole and our prospects going forward  The big picture for the industry will continue to be driven by over eight years of under building  particularly under supply of affordable units as well as by pent up household formation demand  The long term need for affordable housing is real and growing and our efforts are aimed at being part of the solution December s industry MH shipment data is not yet in  but looking at the second half of the calendar 2019  basically July through November  industry shipments were up nearly 4   So while the full year shipments will be deceiving because of the first half retail inventory reduction  the year over year comparisons are starting to clear up and show growth and demand  We have seen that in our wholesale sales and we have seen that in our retail operations where traffic is up year over year  In last quarter s call  we commented that we are expecting backlogs and demand to carry us through the winter  end of the spring selling season  Three months later  our backlog has held up well at six weeks and it s enabled us to grow shipments Turning to financial services  our teams had another outstanding quarter  In insurance  there weren t any major weather events impacting our policy areas  However  this shouldn t overshadow how well our team at Standard Casualty is balancing growth and risk diversification  To consider the results are solely driven by weather doesn t do justice to the great job they have been doing through time  Similarly  the lending operation is contributing strong results  not solely due to interest rates and home buying demand  but in large part due to the steady and smart approach to growth and risk management  Paying attention to details is everything in these financial services operations and our teams are simply doing an outstanding job Regarding the broader lending environment  I don t have much to add to what I expect the participants on the call are already following  The GSEs remain constructive through their duty to serve commitments  Having said that  it shouldn t be surprising that it takes time for programs like ChoiceHome and MH Advantage to gain momentum  These are very good programs that are making a difference and we certainly appreciate the level of commitment by the GSEs  Similarly  investor appetite in the prospect for more robust secondary market for MH loans is building  All of these developments continue to move in the right direction And finally  I would simply like to add a comment that recognizes the improving regulatory environment  Fed continues to make positive strides on behalf of the industry to reduce regulatory barriers as well as a streamlined process for code updates and these are important changes  These changes reduce cost and they result in a much more efficient process to get deserving families into quality homes So with that  I will turn it over to Dan Urness to review the financial results Daniel L  Urness    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerHappy to do so  Thanks  Bill  Good day  everyone  Net revenue for the third fiscal quarter of 2020 was  273 7 million  up 17 1  compared to  233 7 million during the prior year s third fiscal quarter  The majority of the increase was within the factory built housing segment where net revenue grew approximately 17  to  257 million from  220 million in the prior year quarter  The improvement was from organic sales growth and the inclusion of a full quarter of Destiny Homes operations as the acquisition occurred in August of 2019 Housing unit sales volume increased approximately 12  overall while approximately 5  of the improvement was from home price increases  which included a modest product mix shift toward multi section home sales  Financial services segment net revenue increased 24  to  16 6 million from greater unrealized gains on investments in insurance subsidiary s portfolio  higher home sales loan volume and more insurance policies in force compared to the prior year  These increases were partially offset by declines in interest income from the continued loan portfolio runoff Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 21 9   up 90 basis points from the same period last year  The higher gross margin percent was mainly from improved earnings in our financial services segment as the prior year period included a large hailstorm event in Phoenix  While smaller storms did occur this quarter in Dallas and Phoenix  there were no significant weather related events  The factory built housing gross margin percentage was 19   up slightly from 18 9  during the same quarter last year Selling  general and administrative expenses in the fiscal 2020 third quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 13 5  compared to 13 2  during the same quarter last year  The increase was primarily from  2 1 million in amortization of premiums related to D O insurance as the policies were purchased in December 2018 requiring only one month of amortization in the prior year quarter  We also recorded more sales commissions and incentive compensation from higher sales volumes and profits Expenses related to the SEC inquiry were  900 000 this quarter compared to  1 3 million during last year s third fiscal quarter  Other income net this quarter was  2 2 million compared to  318 000 in last year s comparable quarter  The Company realized  300 000 in unrealized gains on corporate investments versus an unrealized loss of  2 1 million in the prior year quarter amounting to  2 4 million positive change by comparison  The current period also includes greater interest income from larger cash and commercial loan balances offset partially by lower market interest rates The effective income tax rate was 15 5  for the third fiscal quarter compared to 21  in the same period last year  The current quarter included a  1 7 million benefit for the recognition of certain tax credits from the 2020 Appropriations Bill  most notably Energy Star credits  The effective income tax rate decline from the prior year is partially offset by lower benefits from the exercise of stock options Net income was  20 9 million  up 56  compared to net income of  13 4 million in the same quarter of the prior year  Net income per diluted share this quarter was  2 25 versus  1 44 in last year s third quarter Next  Josh will discuss the balance sheet  Josh Joshua J  Barsetti    Chief Accounting OfficerThanks  Dan  Comparing the December 28  2019 balance sheet to March 30th  2019  The cash balance was nearly  217 million  up from  187 4 million nine months earlier  The increase is from net income and changes in working capital  repurchase of securitized debt and cash paid for the Destiny Homes acquisition  Prepaid and other assets increased mainly from a land exchange that occurred last quarter  Property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible balances increased from the Destiny Homes purchase Certain balance sheet line items were affected by the new lease accounting standard  which was implemented at the beginning of this fiscal year  As a reminder  this accounting standard requires that all leases be recorded on the balance sheet  The current portion of securitized financings and others declined from the repurchase of securitized debt that occurred in August of 2019  Lastly  stockholders  equity was approximately  596 million as of December 28th  2019  up approximately  66 million from the March 30th  2019 balance Bill  that completes the financial report William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Josh  Jewel  I think we ll just go ahead and turn it right over for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Dan Moore with CJS Securities  Your line is now open Stefanos Crist    CJS Securities    AnalystHi  This is Stefanos Crist  calling for Dan  So first  can we maybe just talk about the underlying demand trends  the traffic at the dealer level and your expectations for backlog going into Q4 William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I can talk generally about what we see  I mean  we have talked in the past that the big question  everyone s trying to always keep up here on the pulse of is the end consumer  the end homebuyer demand  And we don t talk about specific numbers  but we do look pretty closely at our Palm Harbor villages operation for an indication  Now they not national  but they cover a pretty big and important region and as I mentioned in my opening comments  when we watch those year over year trends  traffic is up and deposits are strong and conversions are strong  So it kind of just supports the whole thesis that while wholesale shipments are something we all track as well  when you are really trying to keep a finger on the pulse of consumer demand  all the indications we have are pretty positive Stefanos Crist    CJS Securities    AnalystThanks  guys  And that s it for me  I will jump back in queue William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from Greg Palm with Craig Hallum Capital  Your line is now open Greg Palm    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the good results there William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Greg Daniel L  Urness    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerThank you Greg Palm    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystI guess  maybe just start with the house keeping item  Can you break out what your organic growth rate was in the quarter  And maybe your overall unit contribution from Destiny  if you have that handy Daniel L  Urness    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerWe don t break it out separately  Greg  But I can    we had pretty growth this quarter as we mentioned in our opening statements  And I would break it down roughly that a third was related to Destiny and then another third related to organic shipment growth and then the final third related to the higher prices Greg Palm    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystOkay  So you are talking about a third of the revenue increase in the quarter  that s what you are talking about  A third  a third  a third Daniel L  Urness    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYes  That s right  We had a 17  increase and I am just breaking it down roughly a third  a third  a third  That s right Greg Palm    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystPerfect  That s helpful  In terms of the uptick in financial services revenue growth this year and it really accelerated this past quarter  Dan  you talked a little bit about it  But anything to note there in terms of a change of strategy  It s really been interesting to see how that s accelerated through the year Daniel L  Urness    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYeah  You bet  I will just mention one thing there and it s actually in our press release  But we have  part of the increase is a pretty big spread in just how we have to record unrealized gains and losses on equity investments  So we had a  300 000 unrealized gain in the equity investments in the portfolio in that insurance company  While this quarter last year  it was  900 000 loss  So that s  1 2 million of the increase  And then in addition to that  of course  we had the growth in loans that are being made  loan activity is up  And then we also have a larger portfolio  larger book of business in our insurance business and revenue growth from that area as well Greg Palm    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystOkay  That makes sense  And then just sticking on the financing side of things here  it sounds like a few of your competitors to  Indecipherable  CountryPlace have announced some new programs really aiming at lower FICO scores  So I wanted to get your opinion on how that might improve overall accessibility to financing industrywide  And whether that s something that you expect to follow suit with CountryPlace as well William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerLyle  you want to take a shot Lyle D  Zeller    President of CountryPlace MortgageYeah  We definitely have noted some of those programs that are coming out and we are encouraged by it  I think lending has been a constraint  It s pretty well discussed in the industry  So no one wants to see the industry get over its skis on anything like that  but I think we are far from that at this point  So we think it s a good development  And as far as CountryPlace Mortgage  I guess all I can really say is  we are constantly kind of evaluating and looking at where we should focus our origination efforts  That s an ongoing process in the Company  And we see some opportunities there  So we are going to kind of continue doing what we always do  look for opportunities in our origination strategy and pursue them  So the loosening up  if you want to say that  of lending programs  I think is  right now at very healthy pace  It s not something to be concerned of  it s good Greg Palm    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystGot it  Okay  Do you have an opinion or maybe  I don t want to say a target  but just sort of an own assumption of maybe what the industry growth rate might be calendar year  20 versus calendar year  19 wholesale shipments  You gave a lot of color on sort of first half  19  second half and related growth rates  So I am just curious if you have assumptions sort of built in or not William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe don t really have a pin down projection or function  We kind of tend to shy away from doing that and getting too obsessed about trying to predict it  But I do think that  without diving too much in the weeds  I think about this a lot and maybe it s time to just let it go into history  But 2019 might be looked at as kind of a flat type year  But you got to always remember that there are a lot of sales that were pulled from 2019 forward into  18  So that was really what I was trying to get out in my comments that  once the dust has cleared on that inventory  the retail inventory situation which we are all tired of talking about  but once that dust is cleared and you really looking year over year on more comparable months and quarters  there is a lot of reason to see that right now the industry is growing in kind of low to mid single digits and we don t see that changing Greg Palm    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystAnd how do you view the inventory situation out there  I mean  has it cleared entirely  Has it cleared in most regions  I mean  how is sort of the level of inventory either at your own stores or from the independents  in your opinion William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would venture to say  it s largely cleared  I think that issue is behind us Greg Palm    Craig Hallum Capital    AnalystPerfect  All right  I ll leave it there  Thanks for the time William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Greg OperatorThank you  I am not showing any further questions at this time  I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Boor for any closing remarks William C  Boor    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  It s not a lie  I really appreciate people s interests  We are always available to continue the discussion  Thanks a lot for joining us today and have a great day Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  20 minutesCall participants Mark
