117501,339016,IAC,IAC must face Tinder co founder s  2 billion lawsuit  NY appeals court,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    A New York state appeals court on Tuesday rejected IAC InterActiveCorp s  O IAC  bid to dismiss a  2 billion lawsuit by a group of Tinder founders  executives and early employees who said it undervalued the dating app to avoid paying them billions of dollars 
The Appellate Division in Manhattan said Tinder co founder Sean Rad and the other five plaintiffs  who also sued IAC s  Match Group Inc   O MTCH  unit  were not bound under their stock options agreements to what they considered artificially low valuations of their stakes 
 Although the parties agreed that the value of their stock options would be determined by the valuation process  nothing in the agreements provided that the valuation would be binding or final or that the parties would be precluded from fully disputing the valuation in court   the five judge panel said 
The decision affirmed a June 13 ruling by New York State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla in Manhattan 
She had said the plaintiffs could pursue claims of breach of contract  and intentional interference with both contractual relations and prospective economic advantage 
In seeking a dismissal  New York based IAC and Dallas based Match had called the August 2018 lawsuit a belated and improper attack on a  binding expert appraisal  done 13 months earlier 
 This baseless lawsuit has no more merit today than it did over a year ago when it was filed   IAC said in a statement   We look forward to defending ourselves in court  
Orin Snyder  a lawyer for the plaintiffs  in a statement said his clients looked forward to a jury trial   IAC and Match cheated our clients and engaged in a brazen cover up   he said 
IAC and Match separately sued Rad in January  accusing him of having secretly copied files and other proprietary information 
They also filed a  400 million countersuit in September accusing him of having recorded conversations with his superiors without their consent 
Rad has sought to dismiss the January lawsuit  and in an Oct  17 court filing Snyder called the countersuit  legally without merit  and an effective attempt to bankrupt Rad 
IAC said on Oct  11 it intends to spin off its 80 5  stake in Match  which includes Tinder 
The appeals court case is Rad et al v IAC InterActiveCorp et al  New York State Supreme Court  Appellate Division  1st Department  No  9946  The cases in the New York State Supreme Court  New York County are Rad et al v IAC InterActiveCorp et al  No  654038 2018  and Match Group Inc et al v Rad  No  650287 2019 ",2019-10-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/iac-must-face-tinder-cofounders-2-billion-lawsuit-ny-appeals-court-2006889,2006889

Match Group  which contributes nearly half of IAC s revenue  reported 22  rise in quarterly revenue while ANGI Homeservices  formed by merging IAC s HomeAdvisor and consumer review platform Angie s List  reported a rise of 18   from a year earlier 
Earlier in October  IAC said it intends to spin off its ownership stake in Match Group resulting in the full separation of the two companies  The proposal came after an initial announcement from IAC in August where it said it intended to distribute its stake in Match group and ANGI Homeservices to its shareholders 
Speaking to Reuters  Chief Financial Officer Glenn Schiffman said the company will not turn its attention to ANGI until the Match spin off is done

Shares of IAC InterActiveCorp  NASDAQ IAC  rose 11 9  in December 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  The media and online content conglomerate gained 11  in the space of two days thanks to a couple of potentially game changing deals 

So what
First  IAC s stock went up 7 8  on the news that the company is selling off its holdings in Match Group   NASDAQ MTCH   creating two entirely separate companies  Before this deal  which had been coming for some time  IAC owned 80  of the Tinder parent s shares 
The next day  IAC announced a tender offer of  15 per share in a buyout bid for family care specialist Care com  NYSE CRCM  
Shareholders applauded both the Match Group split and the Care com acquisition

Now what
The Match Group deal should bolster IAC s balance sheet with a net cash infusion of at least  700 million  The company is also expected to move roughly  1 7 of long term debt to Match Group s balance sheet  The  550 million Care com buyout looks small next to these big financial transactions  but it could be the first of many smaller deals that combine to move IAC into a lower risk market 
IAC s shares have now gained a total of 46 4  over the last year  trading at a reasonable valuation of 25 times free cash flows  The company is rebuilding itself under a business model with lower top line growth but stronger cash flows  Market makers are embracing the new and improved IAC InterActiveCorp ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pedxd,2053388

Now let s jump right into it  Joey 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
Thanks  Glenn  Thanks everybody for joining  We entered this year with plans to accelerate revenue growth and really invest through our P L in the form of higher margins  which is something we re doing for the first time in a really long time to accomplish that  And we did that for a few reasons  we saw opportunities and continue to see big opportunities in our addressable markets  we have fantastic leaders in fantastic categories and we wanted to press those competitive leads and we really like the price of internal investment more than the price of external investment opportunities  And as we re nearing the end of the year  we feel very good about that decision 
We re seeing the accelerating revenue growth  we are looking for  We like our position as we end the year    start to end the year going into next year and we have high confidence in the business including at ANGI where we had a bit of a bumpy quarter last quarter and we re feeling good about our outlook now from here  I would say we re on the    in the middle of a discussion with the special committee of Match and that to the extent that happens could be a big transformation for our business and it s a really exciting time for us at IAC because the extent we can pull that off  if we go back to the period of rebuilding which is a phase that we love that we    I think we can do well in and starting to focus on some new and interesting things if we can pull that off  I m sure you all have a lot of questions  so let s transition that questions starting with the first now  Operator 
Questions and Answers 
Operator
Thank you   Operator Instruction  Our first question will come from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets 
Daniel Salmon    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst
Hey  Good morning  everyone  Thanks for taking the questions  Joey  maybe if I could just start with  which as you noted in the letter  the process will take longer  Maybe  just any color you could add to us  has the process changed  has it just been a little longer than expected  Would just love a little color on that  And then maybe Brandon  just obviously your search business stabilized  If you could just catch us up on that  but a big picture question  I d love to ask you is  how do you view fixed services as a    what is success for you in that business  One of the metrics we noted here in the letter was the 133 tasks on the platform  is that something we should be thinking about  Do you think about it as a    sort of what it makes up of the total business  I d love to hear more about that  Thanks 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
Thanks  Dan  So just one little correction  I didn t say longer than we expected  I said longer than we would like  And these processes always takes longer than we would like  Once we sort of have a point of view  we like to just march forward  but that s not how it works In this case  It is going to take a little longer than we like  And in terms of how long that takes  I think we don t have a update on that  In the past  we ve done spins  this is different for various reasons  but that s taken a few quarters  And that is    don t know if this one will be the same  but that is what things are taken in the past and we re in  as I said  active discussions with the special committee 
So I would hope that we will have an update relatively soon on whether we can reach an agreement on something there or not  I don t expect that phase to take meaningfully longer  but we ll see  It s hard to predict how these things go 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  This is Brandon  On search  the team did make really great progress  particularly around paid search  We saw    I think I alluded to this last quarter where we were testing and employing some new technologies and tactics  particularly around bidding  We made really good progress throughout Q3 in that area and are seeing good results  so we expect to more or less complete our conversion to this new platform  if you will  over the next two quarters  I really think paid search    there s a lot of opportunity there and I expect that to be more of a tailwind next year  Within the organic search arena I would call it stable  I don t think we made up lost ground  We do have a plan going forward that we re optimistic about 
But as we all know that environment works a little differently in a little different pace  Overall  though  we re pleased with the progress we made around search generally speaking  With fixed price services in terms of how we think about this and what we view as success  one thing I would just remind us all  we actually started down this path in 2017 
So this has been a long time in formation  The acquisition of Handy has allowed us to materially accelerate our efforts in this area and really governed by what we re seeing as we  as we put it in the hands of customers  There are two ways to look at what success means  First of all  just in terms of the experience we re looking at the purchase rate  the conversion rate by homeowners  we re looking at their satisfaction levels and we re looking at repeat use  What does this deeper richer experience mean for consumers in terms of their frequency of use of our service and their long term loyalty 
Right now  all of the early data    all the data while early looks really  really positive on all those fronts  exceptionally positive  which is why we ve leaned into it so heavily and gone so much quicker than what we communicated last quarter  In terms of what does it look like in terms of the impact on our business  the 133 tasks already represents about 35  of the total volume of service requests we get  and that s not by value but in terms of the frequency and just pure volume of those requests  And why that s important is that we re able to offer this experience to a pretty large percentage of our customers and we simply think it s going to be a superior both for them and ultimately in terms of the relationship it creates with us 
What do we want it to do for our business  Those 133 tasks cover billions and billions in GMV  The grand question here is how much of that GMV can we get processed through this experience  We talked last quarter about having 40  of our requests that we were unable to fulfill and unable to monetize  that s obviously the clear and obvious opportunity  Those amount to a tremendous a portion of those billions in GMV and we don t know the answer yet  but our goal is to scale this as big as it can possibly get and to process as much of that transaction value as we can through the service

Thanks  Dan 
Operator
Thank you  Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer 
Jason Helfstein    Oppenheimer   Co     Analyst
Thanks  Two questions  One  kind of a follow up and then an IAC question  So I mean overall it seems  Google has become a less reliable or it s become less reliable for SEO  more expensive for SEM  not just home services but travel  other verticals as well  Just longer term  how do you think about moving dependence away from Google  You mentioned some partnerships in the letter  would you consider buying properties that could drive inexpensive traffic or potentially more brand spending 
So just maybe longer term after you finish this platform conversion  And then on to IAC  once the Company is recapitalized  what verticals will you pursue M A and should we think of the minority investment in Turo as a one off or will you consider minority stakes in the future  Thanks 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  With regard to Google  our thinking about how do we address long term diversification  Obviously  we don t want to be overly reliant on any one source  Over the last 12 months we brought in more than 26 million individual project requests for consumers  So we re doing a phenomenal job on customer acquisition and we are well diversified but we can always do better  We are excited about the two partnerships we announced with Realogy and Nextdoor  Both of those are great brands and very large audiences  they have obvious relevance to us and so we re going to keep pressing on finding new avenues to acquire customers  But Google continues to be a good place to acquire customers and we don t expect that to change  The long term solution here or I ll even call the medium term solution  is to acquire customers  get them in a much stronger product ecosystem that is a lot stickier and that drives a lot more repeat use 
We have a ton of innovation in the pipeline for the coming year  that we believe is going to do just that  Obviously  we think this fixed price experience  and we know from the early data  is achieving that  But we are also going to be driving a lot more of our business to our mobile app where we already see materially higher repeat use and customer loyalty  We ve got an extraordinarily strong and aggressive strategy to drive accelerated penetration of our mobile app into our homeowner base  And that s really    the answer is it s not about getting away from Google  it s about acquiring customers and Google and everywhere else and keeping them and that s where our focus is
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
And then    I ll add a little bit to that and then I ll answer your other question  Jason  I mean  I think we ve talked about this before  the key in all of these businesses is to make your experience more compelling to go direct and everything that Brandon talked about I think takes big leaps forward in making that experience easier and more efficient for a consumer to go directly to us to get something done  and I think some of the things that the channels that we provide  Indecipherable  doing it  they re actually making it less compelling to go through their platforms and I think that that could be a long term benefit for us 
In terms of new verticals  I think it s something we re very actively looking at  something we ve always candidly very actively looked at  I think there is a finer point on it in imagining of the post Match world and where we re highly capitalized with cash  But that doesn t change the discipline of buying new verticals where we think we can add value and where we think there is large addressable markets with leaders and where the  as we say  the future is obvious meaning there s things that we know consumer behavior will evolve in a certain direction because of existing things and evidence  and those are things that we re looking for 
I think  as always  we re prioritize capital on our existing verticals  because that s where we have the best advantage  I think we ve done little M A at Dotdash with nice success so far  We re going to continue to look for opportunities there  We seem to be able to integrate things relatively quickly and add value relatively quickly there 
We just did a small one for IAC  but relatively big one for Vimeo in terms of an acquisition with Magisto and so that s going to take a little bit to digest  I don t expect much M A at Vimeo in the near term  And so new verticals will be a factor  In terms of minority investments that s not a pattern and we said that last when we did the Turo investment  we feel great about the Turo investment  we feel great about the progress in that business  but we are prioritizing capital in areas where we can have control and we think that that s the best place that we can put things to get a return 
Glenn H  Schiffman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And Jason  in addition to obviously M A in our existing verticals or new verticals  there s a lot of organic growth in the portfolio and you saw that across the Board  given the strong results this quarter of Vimeo and Dotdash and the continued strong results at Mosaic  As you know  we have six verticals    our growth verticals  the slowest grew 22  this quarter on the top line and if and when we spin off Match we ll have five verticals  The slowest of which grew 22  this quarter  all of which have single digit market share and all of whom compete in markets that are hundreds of millions of dollars in size

Thank you  Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays 
Ross Sandler    Barclays    Analyst
Hey  guys  Question on the spin details  so we can all see the negative value that you have for core IAC stub  you laid that out in many prior quarterly letters and you noted in the letter  this time that the 2008 core stub created nearly three fourth of the value that you see today  So if this is the same playbook  I guess what s the market missing and what will you guys do post spin to help unlock some of that hidden value 
And then  the second question is you laid out the framework for the spin in the addendum  I guess what do you view as the ideal amount of cash in a perfect world for new IAC and the ideal amount of debt for Match post spin  Thank you 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  Ross  valid question  I m not going to answer the last one  what we ve said is comfortable cash  and that s a pretty wide range you could imagine there but I don t think it s appropriate to answer that right now  given where we are in the discussion  In terms of    relative to 2008  it is a    it s really interesting  I mean I m more confident now then I remember being in 2008 thinking about it  We have three businesses right now that are doing each  50 million a quarter in revenue or are about to  Vimeo  Dotdash  Mosaic and those businesses are growing nicely 
When we    I think we had two    by the way  I m excluding ANGI from that yet  ANGI I would say  four and one  comfortably well north of that  when you look at 2008 I think we had two businesses at that level of scale and the momentum was not in our favor then  there were also some general macro issues going on in the market at that time  but the momentum in each of those individual businesses wasn t really significantly in our favor  I really like the momentum behind the businesses I m talking about now ANGI  obviously  Vimeo  Dotdash  Mosaic and we ve got a little bet and we had some little bet then too  I mean then Vimeo with a little bet and probably that no one was really paying attention to 
There was a bunch of other ones  Many of those failed  We ve got a bunch right now  Many of them may fail  but we ve got really nice momentum in really large markets right now  And so I feel pretty confident there  Some of the things that drives value of the or that are factors in the negative stub are kind of general concepts  meaning people not understanding a lot of different business or not wanting to bet at the same time on a number of different businesses at once  I think it s possible that that process for our goal is to be as clear as we can on the prospects of the businesses that we own  the metrics of the businesses that we own  so that people can see what it is and be able to make those conclusions 
And then there is the set of tools that we ve deployed for the past decade and for the next few decades of unlocking value over time  when businesses need a public currency or should respond or whatever  those are tools that we can use  We can use subsidiary equity to get deals done  we can use the different balance sheets and use different currencies  all those things are tools that are at our disposal and will continue to be and do over time unlock value  And of course  there is a big one if we fail in all of that  which is share repurchases and that was also a very big tool over the course of the last decade 
And we talked  I think in the letter about how the share count has come down over that period  It s come down almost in half  I think something like that  So I think I hope that answers your question  Ross  but any others  No  I think we lost Ross  so we ll go to the next question

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS 
Eric Sheridan    UBS     Analyst
Thanks so much  Brandon  maybe coming back to the topic of where we re going over the medium to long term with the ANGI  A lot of initiatives on both the demand side  the customer relationship side as well as continuing to build out the supply side  We d love to just take a step back and maybe you could frame what do you see as some of the biggest initiatives you re trying to unlock to sort of realize the value or the potential for ANGI medium to long term as a business  And how investors are supposed to think about some of the investments you re making over the short and medium term to bridge to sort of the goals over the longer period of time  Thanks so much 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Sure  Do we re ending in Q3 with good momentum at our two largest businesses  Obviously  Angie s List returns to growth for the first time a very long time  That s an important milestone and reflects success in the investments we ve been making there that we ve been talking about and we expect to see Angie s List grow from here 
HomeAdvisor also finishes with strong momentum  we are seeing strong sales performance  Obviously  we ve made progress in search  We expect to see both of these businesses modestly accelerate again next quarter  As we look forward to 2020  we re really focused on a couple of things  Joey said this earlier  but it rings true important  which is we are laser focused on creating an exceptional experience for homeowners that is unrivaled by anything that exist today or has ever existed  And tied to that  but also critically important of its own right is bringing on far more service provider capacity 
These two things together solved a lot of problems for us as a business  Being able to monetize through additional service provider capacity  All of their requests are going unmonetized today  provides a much better experience for our customers  substantially improves the economics of those transactions  improves the margins of the overall business and gives us far more buying power as a business to go out and drive further growth  So that s critical  We ve talked about fixed price and that s certainly one means to accomplish both of those goals 
But we have a lot of other very similar investments we haven t talked about publicly yet that are oriented around the same problems and are focused on achieving the same outcomes  Separately  through a better experience for consumers and through a stronger product ecosystem  including through the app  we are very  very focused on acquiring customers and keeping them  And we believe that a differentiated experience that is superior to anything else including traditional word of mouth style referrals  is the key to doing this 
Obviously  again  as we think about improving repeat use  it s all the same sort of economic problems in the business  it makes our marketing investment look substantially better  it s improves our buying power and obviously over time also impacts the margin profile of the business 
The investments we re making are obviously rapid  they re happening right now  And as I mentioned earlier  we ve been investing in Angie s List throughout the year and we re seeing that pay off  We ve accelerated our investments  particularly in fixed price but in a few other areas as well against capacity  And the way we re thinking about that  frankly  is we re letting the results guide our decisions  We    I think last quarter  I said we will launch 100 tasks by Q1 of 2020  we re at a 133 by Q3  so we re almost 6 months ahead of where we thought we would be  and that is driven by the results we re seeing and I guess  our excitement around the results we re seeing 
Next year  it s all about how fast we can scale  I think more than anything this experience  the deep experience around fixed price services  A lot of that will be governed by consumer interest and engagement and as we roll this out and put it    make the opportunity available to more consumers and more of our acquisition channels  we will see how fast it scales  But    if it scale faster  we will invest faster and that s really the way we re thinking about investment around fixed price services  We continue to have investments in other parts of the business  I think we will continue to invest in Angie s List  although probably not at the same pace as this year and then we have investments in other areas including the acquisition of Fixd last year in international
Glenn H  Schiffman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And to translate that into numbers that strategy  obviously  and that roadmap underpins our significant confidence in our 20  to 25  revenue growth rate on a long term basis  including next year  And on margins  as we ve said  we re not optimizing for margin short term  but every one of those initiatives will help us drive toward our long term margin targets

John Blackledge    Cowen    Analyst
Great  Thanks  Joey  we got a lot of questions on the spin process  Just curious if you can offer color on kind of like the steps and timing once there is an agreement on the spin  And then just on ANGI  with the good paid search stabilizing  Glenn  maybe could you give us color on what that implies for ANGI margins next year  Thank you 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
Sure  In terms of steps  there is a few key components  which we laid out in the letter  One is moving the   again all of this is caveat I think in the proposal and we need to reach agreement with the special committee  which we may not  But the step that would be consistent with what was outlined in the proposal are  one  moving the converts is what I m calling it converts  are actually exchangeable notes and related hedging instruments  but we ll just simplify by calling it the converts  moving that to    moving those to ANGI in exchange    I m sorry  moving those to Match as exchange for Match shares and that s relatively straightforward 
The other two components are a dividend from Match to IAC some amount and the third thing that is potentially    that may not happen  but potential equity offering  which has the effect of IAC selling shares in new Match in those shares getting swapped in the separation ended up with IAC having more cash and new Match having fewer shares outstanding 
All of those things  in theory happen    kind of roughly I think or could happen kind of roughly at the same time  there is work to do to prepare for all of those things and that is a    that is  I think maybe the best I can do  I don t know  Glenn  maybe you    we re a little bit limited in what we can say here and I apologize for that and I want to have a real complete update for everybody soon which I m hopeful we can get to  But right now we re just a little bit limited in what we can say  I don t know  if you ve got more to add to that 
Glenn H  Schiffman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No  I think it was    I think it s well said and timing Joe you address that earlier when we ve done spins in the past they ve taken a couple of quarters to be complete  So I think that    again  as Joey said we ll update you when we can  In terms of margins  next year for ANGI to translate everything Brandon just walked through  margins are dependent on three things  One is our overall revenue growth because ex marketing we create real incremental margin in the business  ops  G A  sales all of our other cost grow well below our revenue growth  given obviously the strength of the business and the scale of the business  So that ll be one factor 
The second factor is the investments we make  that s in our International business  which is still losing money  that s in Fixd that small business we bought in early 2019  that s Handy and that s our fixed price initiative  and as Brandon said  we see success  we may continue to invest to invest into that 
And then third  it will depend on marketing partially  that s the choices we make  And as you know  we re partial to investing in category expansion  given the opportunity in front of us and we re going to want to broadcast the fixed price offerings  given the roll out there  And then how we    how effective we are  and as Brandon said  we re making real progress but it s early days  indeed  I think all that adds up  we ll give you obviously our outlook early next year  but I think all that adds up to margins not increasing 
And may be depending on the elective choices we make potentially  even margins could come down  Something that may skew the margins a little bit and we ll of course transparently walk you through that is  in all likelihood  the accountants are going to force us toward gross revenue recognition for the Handy transactions on our platform and the fixed price transactions on the platform  because we will underwrite and we will backstop and guarantee those transactions  So the margins may be a little muddled next year because of that  but we ll obviously walk you through it and attempt to reconcile that for you

Good morning  Joey  on the Vimeo growth acceleration  if you could just comment what you re seeing there and the progress you re making on the Enterprise side that would be extremely helpful 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
Sure  So one component    meaningful component of the Vimeo growth acceleration is we completed the Magisto acquisition  so those numbers are in there now so that accelerated the business and continues to grow nicely without the acquisition  but that s certainly a driver of acceleration  The Enterprise business is  I think still fastest growing component of Vimeo and so we re really excited about that  And just interesting stat we got the other day  is that 60  of Fortune 500 companies have someone with Vimeo account and that doesn t mean that we have a active relationship at the corporate level with those companies  what it does mean is that people are using it and there is a big opportunity for us there 
We got to get organized  of course  on how to pursue that  which we ve been doing in terms of building the Enterprise sales force  organized the Enterprise sales force  We re still weighted heavily toward inbound inquiries  we have to nail the operation on outbound sales  but we view that as real validation in terms of the size of the market and the size of the opportunity  And remember  this is a  50 billion TAM that we think Vimeo is playing in here  We think with video  I keep saying that to everybody  but video is a relevant narrative tool for all enterprises  entities  events  individuals and we re trying to make those tools very easy and I think we re succeeding on doing that for a pretty wide audience  We got to pull that through in the business  but it looks compelling in the numbers right now

Our next question comes from Kunal Madhukar with Deutsche Bank 
Kunal Madhukar    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Hi  Thanks for taking the question  Two  if I may  One on ANGI  one  with regard to the outlook for 4Q that there seems to be a Q over Q decline in the revenue growth rate  How much of that is because you have lapping Handy and how much of that is for other reasons  And then on Vimeo  as you go out and as your Enterprise sales force kind of goes out and meets with potential customers  who else do you see in the room  Who are the key competitors  What is the value proposition and how are you differentiated  Thank you 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  On the fourth quarter  guide  you re exactly right  It s the Handy comp and that s a couple of points of growth  The other small thing  small thing we re seeing  as you recall in the first quarter of last year    sorry  the first quarter of this year  we shut off certain marketing channels that drove revenue and service requests that was as a result of a slight uptick of those revenue    that revenue and those service requests in the fourth quarter 
So we re also obviously comping against that  That will be a tailwind as we roll into 2020 but it s those two things and that s a couple of points of growth  So absent that  it s actually not a deceleration and then further to that  if you strip all that out and you look at the core Angie s List business and you look at the core HomeAdvisor marketplace business we re actually accelerating and the acceleration started in the second quarter of this year
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
And on the competitive landscape for Enterprise  it s actually pretty wide  There s a wide range of things that we see  So there s the some of the older players in this category  who build like very custom solutions for enterprises  which were expensive and took a lot of time and were hard to maintain and we re seeing a preference in    there were things they want custom to start and then you sort of show the cost differential and the feature differential and the ongoing maintenance differential and we re seeing a lot of people go to  OK  I d rather be on the platform  than have this complicated custom build  so that s one area 
People do things themselves historically  they put together a bunch of different solutions to make something work and so having a sort of simple end to end turnkey solution we founded as a good antidote to the self built solution 
And then for a lot of folks it s new  They ve had    they just haven t used video to tell the story that they re telling  The Enterprise area is    we ve got both OTT customers  over the top customers  that means people who are essentially building a channel  And our platform works very well for people who are building a channel and that a lot of times is going to compete against the custom solution that is generally much more expensive 
And then the other is Enterprise net usually where there isn t an incumbent  where they just haven t been communicating with their employee base and their customer base  they haven t felt a need to communicate by video  They ve generally been communicating by text or by pictures and now we ve seen the opportunity to communicate by video and that turns out to be compelling but as there is not sort of one big or two big folks that we see as incumbents or other voices in the room right now

Our next question comes from Brad Erickson with Needham and Company 
Brad Erickson    Needham   Company  LLC    Analyst
Hi  Thanks  Just a couple on ANGI  First for both of these partnerships with Realogy and Nextdoor  Can you talk about some of the key aspects that I guess were attractive to both parties from your perspective  I think obviously many of us can offer an opinion there  but it d be good to hear that from you 
And then second  can you just remind us sort of the why 40  of unmonetized leads has been so persistent like if you had to bucket  the top three or four things that that s caused by  be a useful reminder as you obviously look to drive that number lower with things like fixed price and on demand  Thanks 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Great questions  So on the partnerships  both of these partnerships are very attractive and we start with Nextdoor  Obviously  Nextdoor has a phenomenal audience of neighbors  About 20  of the requests that that happen on Nextdoor  have to do with local services in some form or fashion  So  it s incredibly relevant audience for us to get exposure to  We think of this as a long term strategic partnership  I think the opportunity to do some really innovative things there is quite exciting  Obviously  neighbors are on there sharing word of mouth recommendations  but there are a number of ways that we can add value to those conversations  whether it d be that people want additional options or whether it d be that in some cases that there needs to be a backstop for these recommendations  I would look at that as a partnership that will continue to innovate and grow over time 
Realogy is really completely different animal  Realogy is involved in more real estate transactions than any other entity in the US and the opportunity    what we re doing with them is effectively offering the seller of the home  the opportunity to fix up that home pre sale to generate either a higher purchase price or a faster sale 
This is a win win win for all three parties involved  Obviously  the owner of the home gets the opportunity    gets those benefits  we get the opportunity to form a relationship there and to help manage the process of home improvement  and then this is a service overall that is attractive in terms of Realogy being able to service customers  We are excited about the early results with the Realogy partnership  It was just in a few markets  but we are expanding quickly based on what we re seeing  And with that partnership it s a little bit of a market by market expansion 
One of the things that s exciting about it is  it really gets us    and not only into this sort of offline relationship  but into the relationship around real estate transactions where there s just an enormous amount of home services demand that s generated and we can t always expect people to jump online  Some of the stuff is happening offline  as we all know 
In terms of the 40  of unmonetized leads that we talked about last quarter  I don t know that I would call it stable  I would say that is a number that has largely grown over time  It s a really    there s only one explanation and it s really simple  which is if you look over the last 5 or 6 or 7 years we have grown really fast as a marketplace  but we ve always grown faster on the consumer demand side and if you re growing consumer demand at 30  or 40  or 50  and service providers are growing at 20  or 30  that catches up with you  Over a 5 year period it really makes themselves felt 
The solution is as straightforward as a problem  which is we need more service providers with more capacity and we re making good progress with our traditional products  We re seeing good momentum there  as I mentioned earlier  from a sales standpoint  But the real answer is we ve got to have more products and more offerings to bring more providers then to participate 
The fixed service product that we ve been talking about is just such an example  In the case of fixed price services  we actually go out to providers and offered to pay them to do a job  which is quite a bit different than our traditional product where they have to pay us  And you can imagine how that could be compelling for a service provider and how it might enable us to tap into service providers that perhaps are resistant to our traditional product 
We are in fact seeing good success doing just that  And that s one example where we are bringing    tapping into new segments of service providers and bring to fill in the capacity online  We are going to be chasing quite a few of these in parallel to solve what s a pretty big problem and one that  as we saw that will have an enormous impact on the economic profile of the business

Thank you  Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust 
Youssef Squali    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst
Great  Thank you very much  Two quick questions  One  either Brandon or Glenn  can you    as you guys push the fixed price offering more aggressively next year  I was trying to understand maybe the economics of the model relative    of that product offering relative to the traditional offering  In other words  is it margin accretive  margin dilutive  I know    I think  Glenn  you talked earlier about having to change the revenue recognition there  So just maybe help us understand how those things work at least short term 
And then  Joey  as you go through with the spin with    I was just trying to understand how you think about business models that you may be interested in  Historically  you guys have had a bias to marketplaces  is there any reason to believe that that s not the case this time around  Thank you 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
This is Brandon  I ll start on the fixed price margin question  The reality is offering 133 different types of services and 40 000 zip codes on the fixed price basis is an enormous problem to solve as we scale it  the faster it grows  the more it will initially cost us  Right  That s just essentially the way it works and a lot of that just has to do with building up capacity to perform these jobs in so many micro locations 
What I can say is that in our most mature categories where we ve been offering fixed price the longest  the margins are extremely compelling  And if you compare the take rate of our traditional business relative to the take rate we get on these mature fixed price services  it s substantially better 
And I ll turn to Glenn to add more color 
Glenn H  Schiffman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  that s exactly right  After the start up costs just to spool    to figure out how to price the job to spool up the demand and get the infrastructure in place  it is going to be accretive to our long term margins  One  we attack those zero accepts and we just change the whole price value relationship with the SP without that incremental cost of marketing  Again  for these 40  zero accepts  we ve already paid marketing to get that 
Two  Brandon referenced  it s the take rate  Our take rate  as you know  on our marketplace matching is around mid single digits  Our take rate is higher simply because our win rate is so higher for the SP  the job is guaranteed  And then  when Brandon says  we open up SP capacity that is also majorly margin accretive because we don t have to rely on our sales force  which is of course quite effective  but it s also expensive for sure  And all these    all this product innovation among the many things that it does  it s going to drive repeat rate  it s going to drive down the zero accepts and it s going to increase SP retention and those are the three most powerful margin drivers that we have in our P L
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
In terms of post spin interest  marketplace is still exciting for us  It s a  I d say a preference  not a rule  We have said we like businesses where scale improves the product  not just the price that is I think our most successful businesses in our past and current meet that test 
So that is something that we will look for  but if we find a new vein that s exciting that s possible too  Some of the dynamics that we ve seen in marketplace businesses are things that we think we can do a nice job identifying and we think we can do a nice job amplifying  And so that that does favor marketplace businesses  but does not require marketplace businesses  I guess I d say

Thank you  Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan 
Douglas Anmuth    JPMorgan    Analyst
Thanks for taking the questions  First  Brandon  I just want to follow up on paid search  Can you just help us understand where you ve stabilized now relative to last quarter and then also perhaps 6 to 12 months ago  And then  Joey or Glenn  just want to shift gears and talk about Dotdash  You talked about having emerging brands in seven high intent categories here  Can you just talk about the key priorities for 2020 and for the business  Thanks 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  just to reiterate on paid search  Last quarter  I mentioned that we were testing some new tactics and bidding technologies  In Q3 we migrated a fairly significant portion of our activity to a new bidding platform where we ve seen substantially better profit profile  We really completed the majority of that toward the end of the third quarter  There is a quite a bit of work left that we expect to drift into Q1  But I would expect by the end of Q1  we are largely completely migrated  I don t know    what we ve accomplished doesn t bring down costs  It improves profitability  which is fine with us  But we can t control the cost in that ecosystem  but we can    what we have been able to do is control the profitability of our investments and it looks like it s going to be very favorable 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
In terms of Dotdash  we kind of look at each vertical as a huge opportunity  So just picking one which is out    we re doing a nice job in health  I think we re ranked three are in the top five  When you look at audience in health and there are some very big players ahead of us there  in terms of both revenue and profitability
And we ve been very focused on innovating in product in this area  We ve been  as we said  focused on having the best content  freshest content and fewest ads  which means in all of these areas and health being one in some ways we re looking at undercutting the competition on price because the number of ads was effectively    or kind of the way you monetizing that is effectively the way you price the content and you price the service because we really only monetize with ads  Now we    though we monetize with other formats of advertising  I think of e commerce as a format of advertising where we re sending audience onto other sites that monetizes on their sites  but really the way we build this product allows us to undercut the competition on price  And we re going to continue to do that and I think that we can do that sustainably because we re doing that I think comfortably profitably today 
So there is health  big players in front of us  Finance  there s huge players in front of us  several of them  And we were doing very well with Investopedia and the balance and we re going after the people who are bigger than us with bigger audience and bigger revenue  and again doing that with the freshest content  the best of sites and the fewest ads  Beauty is another one  home is another one  All these are multi billion dollar categories of advertising online where we think we can deliver really compelling content and really compelling service 
So it s    when we think about just 2020  It s more content  more better content in our existing categories  And then we re going to continue to look for either new verticals or new additions in our existing verticals  So we ve done that in some categories already  And I think we ve done a few in beauty right now and we ll keep looking in that area for more

Thank you  Our next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs 
Michael Ng    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Great  Thank you for the question  I just have two  First  in the letter  you guys talked about how ANGI could benefit from remaining inside IAC for the time being  Could you just elaborate on what those benefits are  is it helping to think about broader strategic initiatives or is about M A 
And then just on the second question  Glenn  I was just hoping you could clarify the ANGI margin outlook for 2020  I think you mentioned that it may be a little bit muddled next year because of some of the investments  Just any additional color  that would be helpful  Thanks 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
Sure  In terms of the benefit of being    ANGI benefit of being in IAC  I probably shouldn t answer that  Of course  Brandon will answer that probably in the room here  But it is    one of the things that we ve talked about ANGI doing right now is investing in the business and that s what was done over the course of 2019 and I think we ll continue to do over the course of 2020  Some of that is easier with a very large shareholder who is very aligned with you on the size of the long opportunity in the categories and the ability to take more share  and the ability to deliver really compelling consumer product and we have that sort of outlook and that patience  And I think that that can work well for ANGI in this phase of its evolution  especially as we look at a particular new product around fixed price  That s one thing 
The other is  I do think we    there is    ANGI will have plenty of operating flexibility  whether that means M A or whether that means something else  I m not sure  but we have the sort of firepower and the wherewithal to do lots of aggressive things in this category and we ll continue to look to operate that way 
Glenn H  Schiffman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  on the margin on the margin point  On the last call I said  I don t expect margin improvements and on a steady state basis    steady state revenue basis that is we don t think margins are going to increase  And depending on  again the decisions we make to invest more aggressively in fixed price  to invest in marketing  to invest in a lot of the growth initiatives  that Brandon talked about  margins could go down on a steady state basis  And then if you layer in the gross revenue recognition obviously the numerator is higher  so on the same EBITDA base  the margins would    throughout just Match  the margins would slightly go down 
We ll update all of this  obviously  when we share our outlook in February  as we re working on our plans now  our marketing plans and our investment plans  but it ll be very much investing into success next year  as opposed to this year where margins came down given some of the volatility in the ecosystem and our reaction to it

Thank you  Our next question comes from Victor Anthony with Aegis Capital 
Victor Anthony    Aegis Capital    Analyst
Hey  guys  Thanks for putting me on  Just a follow up  There was an earlier question about the economic impact of the shifting the business to fixed price  So first    you also mentioned  I guess  the low single digit take rate of your traditional business  Now  why shouldn t take rate for fixed price eventually be in the teens maybe high teens  given that other non fixed price businesses    other Internet marketplaces that have very high take rates  That s one 
You ve also talked about in the past that one third of the GMV is easy to convert  I think you re already there I think to fixed price and the next one third is probably harder to attain  You also talk about billions of dollars of GMV shifted I m kind of curious exactly the mix    the GMV mix between the one third to one third and one third of    if that makes sense for you guys  And lastly  I guess  the trade off to build in supplies for the fixed price business versus migrating to existing SPs  what s the trade off there  Thanks 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Sure  So  I certainly think that take rate in the teens seems very achievable  I do think it depends on the individual project  The smaller the project  the less materials that are required for a project  I think the higher the take rate can ultimately be  Obviously  as you get into a larger more complex projects that have supplies  materials involved that changes things a bit but mid teen seems extremely reasonable and I think we all believe that here 
The one third  one third  one third was more about the number of task and I do think we    obviously we ve gotten that first third live a lot more quickly than we thought  I think we are obviously going to also pursue that next third but it s all too early to comment on that at this point 
In terms of GMV  I don t think we re ready to break out sort of what the percentage of GMV are  I can only tell you that we have a enormous amount of un transacted or potential GMV that s going unmonetized and there is a ton of it in this first one third of transactions that we re enabling  Obviously  you get into higher value projects and those make up a large    a part of untapped GMV as well  but we ve made great progress in the first third of transactions  We will certainly be making efforts toward the second  third but just aren t there yet 
And I think we have    we ve debated this quite a bit internally  but I think we have    I think it s important that we perfect the experience around this first third of transactions that we ve enabled  They do represent 35  to 40  of the requests that we received for consumers and our goal    more important than just processing the GMV  which is obviously desirable  is to create an experience that just knocks people s socks off  And so we want to really get this first third of transactions right  We ve gotten live  We still got a lot of work to do to protect that experience  And then  we ll move on from there 
What was the last question  Building supply  yeah  So when your supply constraint as we are  obviously  we want to roll out new products that appeal to new segments of SPs that we re having a hard time getting  fixed price does that  It doesn t mean that we can t also offer those jobs into our traditional network and I m sure we will do that as well over time  But a quarter of ours is to bring a lot more providers into this marketplace as participants and we re seeing really  really  really good success with fixed price out of the gates on that front  I would expect us to extend that to the entire network over time as scale grows

Ygal Arounian    Wedbush Securities    Analyst
Hey  Thanks guys  So I just want to ask on  your service requests growth came in    accelerated nicely  comps were a little bit easier  but still accelerated  And I think we re above our expectations  and I just want to kind of hear a little bit more about that in light of some of the marketing challenges  Was it search kind of coming back and improving  Was it the other distribution partnerships that you ve developed just kind of what s leading to growth there and expectations 
And then also on the distribution point  Redfin last night    you mentioned Redfin home services that they re kind of building out the service there  iBuying Network and in light of the partnership with Realogy just wanted to get your thoughts on partnering with the iBuyer community  There s obviously  a ton of supply there  Are iBuying margins just too slim for them to kind of to give that business out and partner or is there opportunity for you guys to create efficiency in that model for them and take part of the share  Thanks 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  It s a great question  Let me address the second one first  I think iBuying is interesting  However  the transaction volumes are still relatively small when you think about the scale we at  We actually think the traditional brokerages and the partnership  we have with Realogy  it just offers a much larger opportunity to reach homeowners during these transactions 
I do think ultimately the slim margins in iBuying  they may need to do this themselves  I m not sure exactly how big of an opportunity that ll be for us  but at this point  the scale of it is too small to warrant our attention  We have bigger opportunities in other places 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
By the way to put a number on that  I mean just think about it for  100 million    for every  100 million of capital that goes into iBuying at  200 000 average home price  let s say  that s 500 homes  It s just    when you think about relative to 26 million or whatever our number is  something over 20 million homeowners that are coming through our platform  it s just very small 
Brandon Ridenour    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  that s right  And then as our growth    the answer is a little bit all of the above  we did see real progress on paid search  But our proprietary channels also did really well and then we have these new partnerships which are nascent but important  Glenn  you want to add more color on that 
Glenn H  Schiffman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  And just taking a step back on    we get a lot of questions on SP growth and SR growth  And just remember  the marketplace business is driven by SP growth    the one side of the marketplace  SP growth and revenue per SP and on the other side of the marketplace it s SR growth and revenues per SR and they re not going to be linear or frankly predictable  There s a lot of levers that  of course  the management team  Brandon and his team will pull to optimize  it also is task mix that throws some of those relationships to thunder  it s also what the ecosystem    what s going on in the ecosystem at the time and also the year over year comp 
Our goal for all four of those metrics obviously is double digit growth  We ve been real strong on revenue per SP  You saw that record  1 200 this quarter  up  what  16  odd  All that will support our 20  to 25  long term growth rate here  But again they could undulate around every quarter  Next quarter  we ll probably see a slight dip in SP growth  we ll probably see a slight dip in SR growth  again given the comps  but we ll make that up on revenue per SP and revenue per SR  I m not foreshadowing a price increase  It s as we get more and more efficient about matching supply and demand  which we are getting with all of our liquidity

Thank you  Our last question will come from Benjamin Black with Evercore ISI
Benjamin Black    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Hey  guys  Thanks for squeezing me in here  Just a quick one on Vimeo  I m wondering if you could provide some color on your product pipeline  as we look to 2020  what are some of your key focus points here  And then a quick one on capital allocation  I mean  you guys were pretty active this quarter on the ANGI buyback  would love to hear what your priorities are as you look to 2020  particularly with ANGI trading at these levels  Thank you 
Joey Levin    Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  On buybacks  yeah  we don t really comment on forward projection to buybacks  We did buyback I think about 1  of ANGI in the quarter  which is I think a third of our authorization and something that we look at and we ll always look at 
In terms of Vimeo product  big push for us right now is around video creation and that is    it starts with the Magisto accusation    sorry acquisition  but we ve got a big integration to pull off right now to  in terms of integrating that into the core of Vimeo product  And that does a few things for us it  One  it allows us to sort of manage the full customer lifecycle in video  but importantly  allows us to talk to customers earlier  In other words  right now when we re out looking for customers of Vimeo we re trying to find people after they ve made a video  before they ve found in place to keep that video and do some other services that we offer them for that video  And we ve been very successful there  but that s a relatively narrow window in which to capture some    to find somebody 
When you think about video creation  before they create a video  and as I ve said before  we think many entities  every entity almost  needs video right now  but many of them haven t gotten started or are afraid to get started  I don t think they have the talent or the team to get started or the tool to get started  and we can kind of offer all of them    all of that right now in one package  And so we think from a marketing perspective that starts to really open up opportunities for us and that s what our big focus is certainly right now and I d say for 2020  getting that product integrated and live and really seamless for users 
I think we re over our allotted time here  So thank you all very much for joining and thanks for all the questions and we hope to have updates for you all soon  Thank you

117544,339059,IAC,Facebook launches dating service in United States,news,"By Katie Paul
 Reuters     Facebook Inc   O FB  is launching its dating services in the United States  the social network said on Thursday  sending its shares up 2  
The company said users will be able to integrate their Instagram accounts with Facebook s dating profile and add Instagram followers to their  Secret Crush  lists  That feature allows users to indicate romantic interest in a friend  without the attraction becoming public  If two friends each tag the other as a crush  Facebook Dating alerts both of the interest 
The service would be optional for Facebook and Instagram users  the company said  adding that dating activity of users will not appear on their profile or news feed 
The service will be available only to users aged 18 and over  who can decide who gets to see their dating profile  Facebook said 
The launch marks a major expansion of Facebook s dating service  initially rolled out in Colombia  Thailand  Canada  Argentina and Mexico last year 
It also opens the company to further scrutiny of its privacy and safety record  which has caught the attention of regulators around the world after years of scandals over its handling of personal information 
Facebook offers safety guidelines to people who sign up for a Dating profile and notes in the liability section of its terms of service that it does not conduct background checks or sex offender register searches 
 You interact with other users at your own risk   the terms state 
Fidji Simo  who recently took over leadership of the core Facebook app  said at the company s annual F8 developer conference in May that the service was expanding into 14 new countries in Asia and Latin America and would be available in the United States by the end of the year 
She also introduced the new Secret Crush feature  which allows users to express romantic interest in nine of their Facebook friends or Instagram followers  Dating profiles are separate from those other services  but use their data to identify Secret Crush matches 
The expansion poses a threat to competitor dating apps  which have long similarly relied on data from connected Facebook accounts to identify possible connections between users 
Facebook  with its 2 1 billion daily active users  dwarfs the scale of those apps  CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2018 that 200 million Facebook users listed themselves as single 
Leading competitor Match Group  O MTCH   which operates Tinder  OkCupid  Plenty of Fish and other dating apps in 190 countries  has about 50 million daily users  according to a Refinitiv estimate 
Shares of Match Group were down nearly 6  on the news  Match s parent IAC  O IAC  was down more than 3

117545,339060,IAC,Tinder owner sued for using fake profiles in ads on Match com,news,"By Neha Malara
 Reuters    The owner of Tinder and OkCupid is being sued by U S  regulator for seeking to draw in potential subscribers with emails from fake users expressing interest in pairing up 
The U S  Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday alleged that  Match Group Inc   O MTCH  knowingly sent automated advertisements via Match com with expressions of interest from accounts which it knew were likely fake 
The emails in question  which did not include user pictures  told recipients that a particular profile had expressed interest in them and gave them a link to click to see details  leading to a subscription page 
 The FTC has misrepresented internal emails and relied on cherry picked data to make outrageous claims and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves   Match Group said https    The FTC said some users had purchased subscriptions to see the details of the users 
 We believe that Match com conned people into paying for subscriptions via messages the company knew were from scammers   Andrew Smith  director of the FTC s Bureau of Consumer Protection  said https   
In its most recent quarterly report  Match said that in August 2019 the FTC referred claims against it to the U S  Department of Justice and that it believed they were without merit 
Shares of Match Group fell 3   while those of its parent group InterActiveCorp  O IAC  dropped nearly 4  
The FTC also said consumers who considered purchasing a Match com subscription generally were unaware that as many as 25  to 30  of Match com members who register each day are using it to perpetrate phishing schemes and extortion scams 
The agency alleged that the company also made it difficult for consumers to cancel their subscriptions ",2019-09-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/ftc-sues-tinder-owner-match-group-for-placing-fake-ads-on-their-site-1986029,1986029

117592,339107,IAC,Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Wednesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  May 9 
1  Oil Prices Shoot Higher
Oil prices rose around 3  to hit fresh three and a half year highs after U S  President Donald Trump walked away from an international nuclear deal with Iran  raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies 
Brent crude futures at one point touched their highest since November 2014 at  77 20 per barrel  It was last at  76 95  up  2 11  or 2 8  
Meanwhile  New York traded WTI crude futures surged  2 00  or 2 9   to  71 06 a barrel  after reaching  71 17 earlier in the session  also highs last seen in late 2014 
In a televised speech Tuesday  Trump said the United States would withdraw from a 2015 international agreement designed to deny Tehran the ability to build nuclear weapons  and also reimpose  the highest level of economic sanctions  against Iran 
Some analysts have said the reinstatement of sanctions could lead to tighter global oil supplies as they make it more difficult for Iran to export oil 
Iran  which is a major Middle East oil producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   resumed its role as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran s nuclear program 
2  Weekly EIA Supply Figures Ahead
Besides Iran  oil market players looked ahead to fresh weekly data on U S  commercial crude inventories to gauge the strength of demand in the world s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise 
The U S  Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended May 4 at 10 30AM ET  1430GMT   amid forecasts for an oil stock drop of 719 000 barrels 
Analysts also forecast a fall of 450 000 barrels for gasoline stockpiles  while distillate inventories are expected to drop by 1 3 million barrels 
After markets closed Tuesday  the American Petroleum Institute said that U S  oil inventories fell by nearly 1 9 million barrels last week  The API data also showed a decline of about 2 1 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles  while inventories of distillates dropped by 6 7 million barrels 
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA 
3  U S  Stock Futures Point To Upbeat Open
U S  stock futures pointed to an upbeat open  as investors continued to assess the implications of President Donald Trump walking away from the Iran nuclear deal 
The blue chip Dow futures rose 135 points  or about 0 6   the S P 500 futures tacked on 13 points  or around 0 5   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 26 points  or roughly 0 4  
On the earnings calendar  notable results expected out Wednesday include Twenty First Century Fox  NASDAQ FOX   Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   Groupon  NASDAQ GRPN    Office Depot   NASDAQ ODP    Roku   NASDAQ ROKU   and IAC InterActive  NASDAQ IAC  
Elsewhere  in Europe  the continent s major bourses were slightly higher  supported by strength in energy stocks 
Earlier  in Asia  markets in the region closed mixed  following an uninspiring overnight lead from Wall Street 
4  Dollar Rally Rolls On As Yields Climb Back Above 3 
The dollar continued to rally against a basket of currencies  reaching yet another 2018 high  bolstered by rising U S  bond yields 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  rose to a session peak of 93 26 at one point  the most since December 19  It was last at 93 01  up around 0 1  
Meanwhile  the yield on 10 year U S  Treasury notes rose above the psychologically important 3  level to hit 3 014   the highest level in two weeks 
The recent bounce in the dollar and yields came as strengthening inflation prospects added to expectations of a more hawkish approach from the Federal Reserve this year 
5  Inflation Data  Weekly Oil Supply Figures In Focus
Wednesday s calendar features top tier U S  data on inflation  The Commerce Department will publish producer price inflation figures for April at 8 30AM ET  1230GMT

117725,339240,IAC,IAC Bulls  Strength Decreasing,opinion,"IAC InterActiveCorp  NASDAQ IAC  is a  19 billion media and internet services company  It is the controlling shareholder of Match Group  NASDAQ MTCH   which in turn operates Tinder   the online dating app  IAC stock was beaten down heavily during the Financial Crisis 
In March 2009  IAC stock fell to  13 23 a share  down 92 3  from its July 2003 peak  There aren t too many stocks out there that have managed to fully recover from a 90  crash  but InterActiveCorp  is one of them  The company found its way again and climbed to a new high of  242 88 earlier this month 
Usually  when a stock is up over 1750  in ten years  caution  is not a word you hear very often  However  trends tend to reverse when you least expect it  In order to find out if IAC stock s rally can be relied on  let s take a look at its weekly chart through an Elliott Wave perspective 

Trends move in waves  which in turn form repetitive and recognizable price patterns  The weekly chart of IAC allows us to recognize maybe the most well known pattern in the Elliott Wave catalog   the impulse 
A smaller five wave structure in wave  1   labeled 1 2 3 4 5  was followed by a sharp decline to  38 82 in wave  2  in 2016  Then  wave  3  multiplied the stock price by more than 5 5 by September 2018  Wave  4  erased 29  of InterActiveCorp s valuation before the bulls came back to conquer  242 a share in wave  5  
IAC Stock Not Safe Anymore
All is well when it ends well  right  It depends on where you stop telling the story  Unfortunately for IAC stock bulls  the Elliott Wave principle states that a three wave correction follows every impulse  This means that instead of hoping that the future will resemble the past  IAC shareholders should prepare for a notable pullback  Besides  the complete impulse pattern is not the only reason for caution  The RSI indicator shows a strong bearish divergence between waves  3  and  5   highlighting the bulls  decreasing strength 
The anticipated retracement can be expected to drag IAC stock back down to the sub  150 area  In our opinion  a  35  decline from current levels is very likely in the not so distant future

117766,339281,IAC,These 5 Top Stocks May Surprise You With An Earnings Beat ,opinion,"Just earnings growth is not enough to keep investors happy these days  A positive earnings surprise or a  BEAT  is what matters  irrespective of earnings growth  A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 
Seasonal fluctuations also come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
It s only after significant research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives that Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  If the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
 How to Locate Potential Outperformers  
Investors tend to look for stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line but might not always succeed  One way of identifying the winners beforehand is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company 
An impressive track record in this regard generally acts as a driver  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  Investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10  Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20  We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20  This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just seven 
Here are five out of the seven stocks 
IAC InterActiveCorp    NASDAQ IAC     This is a leading media and Internet company  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Tactile Systems Technology Inc     NASDAQ TCMD     This is a medical technology company  which develops medical devices for the treatment of chronic diseases at home  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 41   
Martin Marietta Materials Inc     NYSE MLM     The Zacks Rank  2 company is engaged principally in the building materials business  including aggregates  cement  ready mixed concrete  and asphalt and paving product lines  It hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 36   
Fortinet Inc     NASDAQ FTNT     This Zacks Rank  2 company is a provider of network security appliances and Unified Threat Management network security solutions to enterprises  service providers and government entities worldwide  The company belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 17

This agreement to invest  26 4 billion in Israeli database analytics developer SQream will bring the company s technology to Alibaba s cloud customers in China 
The company already has an R D center in the country  one of seven it intends to build in tech hubs across the world  and founder CEO Jack Ma met a group of 35 senior executives recently to cement ties 
SQream CEO and co founder Ami Gal  who toured Beijing  Shanghai and Shenzhen last year said   The whole idea was that we were looking for a strong  local partner to distribute our database in China  
SQream has earlier raised  7 4 million from Blumberg Capital in 2015 for its SQL analytical database 
Consolidating Chinese Delivery Network 
Alibaba  its logistics partner Cainiao  in which it has a controlling stake  and other investors are putting  1 38 billion into Chinese logistics company ZTO Express  In exchange  the group will get a 10  stake in ZTO and Alibaba will get a seat on its board 
ZTO  which has for long been an Alibaba distribution partner  has been seeing growing competition  After a bitter price war with peers  the firm  along with several others  was recently forced to raise prices  So the cash infusion should help the company shore up its capabilities to serve its customers better and perhaps justify the price it charges 
As far as Alibaba is concerned  ZTO s first and last mile pickup and delivery capabilities  warehouse management  cross border logistics and technology driven smart solutions  will help it deliver what it calls  new retail   This is basically its omnichannel effort and includes quick delivery times  grocery delivery  car vending machines  in store shopping apps and so on 
According to Lin Wan  President  Cainiao Network   The logistics industry in China is highly competitive with its own unique features and presents plenty of new opportunities ahead  This investment will enable Cainiao and ZTO to supercharge joint innovation and development to accelerate digitalization of the industry  
Alibaba also recently bought minority stakes in YTO Express and Best Inc  with a similar goal in mind 
Healthcare Assets Transferred to Alibaba Health
Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd has agreed to buy Alibaba owned Ali JK Nutritional Products Holding Limited to expand its product categories and thereby deal with growing competition from companies like Tencent Holdings backed WeDoctor and recently listed Ping An Healthcare 
Ali JK  which generated a gross merchandise volume  GMV  of around 20 56 billion yuan   3 21 billion  in the financial year ended March 31  controls sales of medical devices  healthcare products  adult products and healthcare services on Alibaba s Tmall platform 
The deal  which is subject to approval of Alibaba Health shareholders and the Hong Kong stock exchange  will see Alibaba acquire newly issued shares in Alibaba Health that will take its economic interest in the company from the current 48 1  to 56 2   also resulting in a 67 5  voting interest 
McKinsey   Co estimates that Chinese healthcare spending will reach  1 trillion by 2020 from  357 billion in 2011  with some disruption from technology firms  So it s an important market to conquer  Getting its healthcare assets and brands organized seems like a necessary step in that direction  No wonder then that Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said in a statement that the deal would help turn Ali Health into the country s  best healthcare ecosystem

understand to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector  Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software related companies  and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech focused investors New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape  and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud  The markets have been paying attention  and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud based companies  or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations With this in mind  we ve highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud related activity  but also strong fundamental metrics  Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now 1  Progress Software CorporationProgress develops software and cloud based products that assist clients with application

117847,339362,IAC,Why U S  Brands Need To Play By Alibaba s Rules In China,opinion,"AP reported yesterday  based on informal conversations with people at an unnamed U S  clothing company  that Alibaba   NYSE BABA   had penalized it for not agreeing to its exclusivity deal  This resulted in a 10 20  drop in the retailer s revenue 
Since Alibaba is the leading online shopping platform in China  such agreements might come across as high handedness  anti competitive and not in the interest of consumers 
Alibaba has responded by saying that exclusivity deals are commonplace in China  Assuming that he s telling the truth  and he might be because earlier complaints with the government have fallen on deaf ears and Alibaba has continued as always   maybe we should take a look at the Chinese ecommerce market in a hunt for the reasons why this might be the case 
China s Ecommerce Market
The Chinese ecommerce market is perhaps the most mature  so it is vibrant  innovative  highly competitive  unique and driven by trends that may not have started to play out in other markets 
Chinese shoppers today have more to spend and are spoiled for choice  making them more discerning  concerned about authenticity and bored  So they are always on the lookout for new experiences  brand interactions  technology integration and personalized offers  While they remain concerned about the security of online payment systems  most are likely to still use them for online transactions  PWC report   This in itself guarantees competition 
The PWC report also says that despite Alibaba s leadership position  only a very small percentage of Chinese customers shop exclusively on Alibaba  They are far more likely to spread purchases between Alibaba  other etailers and in store 
Moreover  since shopping is a social experience in China  the Chinese have a strong propensity to use mobile phones and social media channels to buy things  So they may stick with a platform for some things and just as easily move to another for something else  depending on what their social circle is doing 
Retail store space being prohibitively expensive  this has worked out well for retailers  with most expanding their businesses by going online 
China has moved on from the online to offline  O2O  model experience to omnichannel fulfillment  and today  the craze is  New Retail   The concept was coined by Alibaba s Jack Ma in 2016 and in his words means  the integration of online  offline  logistics and data across a single value chain   The company s shopping environment across both the Tmall and Taobao platforms and its physical presence  through its own stores and through agreements with brick and mortar retailers  therefore incorporates not just shopping but also entertainment  videos  livestreaming  virtual reality  games  competitions  fashion shows  communities and key opinion leaders  KOLs  
KOLs are an advanced stage of social commerce where Internet celebs endorse products on behalf of brands and their fan bases follow quickly  As may be expected  it s particularly effective in cosmetics  garments and shoes  also luxury items   So if you re selling a premium cosmetics brand  a big platform like Alibaba for example would be able to hook you up with a relevant KOL who could drive users to your brand 
All this is very advantageous for global brands as they can leverage an online platform s strengths to quickly reach more customers  Chinese laws only allow international retailers to operate through online stores  store fronts or through a marketplace like Alibaba or JD com   NASDAQ JD    effectively pushing them to these platforms to drive sales 
Legally Speaking
On Dec 27  2017  the draft PRC ecommerce law was published that more or less legalized the current system of operation of ecommerce companies  But some specifications are encouraging 
The first is that going forward  all online retailers are required to register with the Administration for Industry and Commerce  AIC  and obtain a trade license  whether they operate ecommerce marketplaces  have an ecommerce website  an ecommerce storefront on any digital platform or are simply sellers in a marketplace built by somebody else  This may be expected to reduce the number of counterfeit items on sale by making it difficult for wrong doers to abscond  It can also make things difficult for smugglers  Intellectual property protection may therefore get easier 
The second is a mandate to ecommerce platforms to adopt network security technology and knowhow and specify contingency plans in case of a cybersecurity incident 
The third is a mandate on the protection of customers  data so they can now search for  edit or delete any personal information or deregister entirely 
International retailers are still required to enter into 50 50 JVs to do business in China  55  in the Shanghai free trade zone   It s therefore much easier for them to use an online marketplace  The Chinese government also encourages this because it earns from the excise duty and Chinese ecommerce firms make some money out of it 
Conclusion
Yes it s true that exclusivity deals may not be the way some international brands want to go  But to survive in a market like China  you have to keep the government happy  And the government is happy as long as imported goods are routed through a Chinese company so they are easy to track and collect on  and Chinese companies get a share of the sales 
Even the recent ecommerce law is sweet on companies like Alibaba and JD  so taking them on will be a little bit like taking on the government  The good news is that these are advanced ecommerce platforms and sticking with them for China sales may not be such a bad idea

117848,339363,IAC,Nobody Was Prepared For The Amazon Blitzkrieg,opinion,"It seems like the technology companies have it in for Mr  Market  With a deaf ear to all the negative press  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   followed Facebook   NASDAQ FB   to report solid results  allaying fears that the growth in FANG may be nearing its end  Users simply have other things on their minds  and they are what continue to drive revenue to these tech titans 
Amazon fairly smashed estimates  with revenue growing 42 9  to come in 1 7  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings growing 120 9  to come in 168 0  ahead 
So definitely  there s something driving that earnings growth  Drilling down into the details  it appears that a favorable mix  North America and AWS increased as a percentage of sales while the loss making international business declined slightly   decline in all except fulfillment cost as a percentage of sales  increase in other income and a lower tax rate as offset by higher fulfillment cost and interest expense  net  drove the results 
A little over half  52 7   of Amazon s revenue came from its online stores  8 4  from physical stores  18 2  from third party seller services  6 1  from subscription services  10 7  from AWS and 4 0  from other sources  mainly advertising   The strongest growth is in other  followed by subscription  AWS  third party seller services and then online stores  sales growth in physical stores that came with Whole Foods can t be compared since the acquisition was toward the end of 2017   So it does look like the company is firing on all cylinders 
While still tiny compared to Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google  Amazon s advertising business can scale very quickly because of its direct connect with users  its ownership of the leading sales platform and a super personal assistant called Alexa that it s trying to get into as many devices as possible  Like AWS  this is a much more profitable business than retail so will improve its earnings potential 
The other business growing very fast is subscriptions  last quarter benefited from a change in the revenue recognition method   which will also see a boost from the recent price hike in Prime  Amazon said that Prime was getting more expensive because of the number of things it was adding to the service  So the annual subscription charges were bumped up by  20 to  119 
Amazon Bezos clearly has a lot of faith in the 100 million strong user base  and it will be good to know how those numbers grow going forward  Even if subscribers don t grow at all  the price increase will bring in an additional  2 billion for the company right there helping it finance its growing content acquisition original programming cost 
The guidance is also strong  revenue growth of 34 42   or  51 0 54 0 billion including favorable currency impact of  1 2 billion or 320 basis points and operating income increase of 75  to  1 1 1 9 billion 

 
Summing Up
Overall  it was a very good quarter for Amazon  with nothing to suggest any change in its leadership position across retail  cloud and Alexa 
Amazon has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and it s our strongest bet in the industry  But go ahead and indulge in any of these other Internet stocks because the sector is particularly hot right now  Boohoo   OTC BHOOY    IAC Interactive   NASDAQ IAC    PetMed Express   NASDAQ PETS    Secoo   NASDAQ SECO   or eBay   NASDAQ EBAY

117849,339364,IAC,Amazon Roundup  Earnings  Analyst Notes  In Car Delivery  Alexa For Kids  More,opinion,"Since most of the conversation around Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   last week centered on its stellar earnings report  it s easy to overlook the other significant news  That s what this write up is about  But first  a brief recap of the earnings announcement 
Stellar Q1 Earnings
Amazon reported a blowout quarter  with revenue growing 42 9  and earnings 120 9  from the year ago quarter  More important  the earnings were 168 0  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  A stronger mix was part of the story  as was the benefit from operating leverage  The tax rate was also a factor 
After announcing a few days previously that its Prime subscribers had crossed 100 million  Amazon also raised the annual subscription fee for Prime by  20 to  119  the monthly fee was raised some time back   Read more 
Analyst Upgrades
Even before the solid results  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  analyst Stephen Ju put out a note reiterating his Outperform rating and raising the price target from  1750 to  1800  or roughly 16   The optimism was based on Amazon s product innovation that the analyst said would help it deal with harder to handle  non homogeneous product verticals  positioning it to grab the next wave of retail dollars moving from offline to online 
For Q1  Credit Suisse forecast revenue of  48 87 billion  adjusted EBITDA of  5 97 billion and adjusted earnings per share of  2 93 that Amazon easily beat 
Post earnings  analysts from Macquarie and Monnes  Crespi  Hardt   Co  raised their price targets to  2 100 and  2 200  respectively  valuing the company at a respective  1 02 trillion and  1 07 trillion  Macquaire analyst Benjamin Schachter said   We believe that even without margin expansion in core retail  the other businesses can drive significant profit growth over the coming years and will make AMZN the first trillion dollar company  
Amazon In Car Delivery
Amazon will leave no stone unturned to deliver packages to you at the most convenient and safe location of your choice  So as a variation of its Amazon Key service  it will now deliver packages to your car s trunk  This isn t just about the fear of thieves making off with the packages on your porch  but more about convenience 
It s doing this through agreements with Volvo  and General Motors   NYSE GM   for some of their car models launched after 2015  The service links a Prime user s account  next day delivery subscribers  to his Volvo on Call or GM OnStar service account through the Key app and deliveries are possible only in a publicly accessible area within a couple of blocks of the delivery address 
Amazon verifies the identity of the delivery driver and checks that the right person is at the right location and with the right package before accepting a request to unlock the car  The driver also has to check that the car is locked after delivery 
While delivery inside the house requires more gadgetry and therefore costs  220  the car service is free 
The service has been tested for six months before launching in 37 cities and Amazon has plans of further expansion 
Amazon Echo for Kids
Amazon is ensuring that parents won t have a good reason to refuse Echo speakers inside their kids  bedrooms  And it s also ensuring that kids will be ensnared by its eco system  So it has now launched Amazon FreeTime on Alexa  Amazon FreeTime Unlimited on Alexa  and Echo Dot Kids Edition that are available via a  free  update  Amazon of course says that many parents are putting the things in their kids  rooms already 
Amazon FreeTime on Alexa allows parents to set limits on kids time and activities including the ability to review activity logs  allows blocking of explicit songs and facilitates communication between rooms  like an intercom   But its most significant feature is the way it facilitates interaction with kids as soon as they say  Alexa  I m bored   This is quite a stroke of genius because it s this interaction that will enable Amazon to harvest their data so Alexa gets  smarter  every day 
While each comes with specific features and the Unlimited feature has the most  letting kids ask for a wide selection of Alexa specific content such as kid friendly premium  skills   music from iHeartRadio Family  300  Audible books  custom alarms  and more  all of which is available at no additional cost for existing FreeTime Unlimited members  or starting at  2 99 per month for Prime members 
The Echo Dot Kids Edition is the simplest way to get started with the Alexa kids experience  It comes with all the FreeTime parental controls features  one year of FreeTime Unlimited family plan  a kid friendly case  and a 2 year worry free guarantee 
Bezos Faces Protestors in Berlin
Amazon s Jeff Bezos faced protestors outside Axel Springer offices  when he travelled there to collect an innovation award  The protest was organized by trade union Ver di that has often  in the past organized strikes to make Amazon pay more to warehouse workers  This time people travelled from all over Germany and also Poland and Italy  according to media reports 
The protestors were joined by Andrea Nahles  the newly elected leader of Germany s Social Democratic Party  the junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel s government  Nahles has been very vocal about her disapproval of Amazon and its likes  She has earlier said that Bezos diesnt treat his employees right and is along with other big tech companies  world champions in tax avoidance    This does not deserve a prize  
In a fireside chat with Axel Springer CEO Mathias D pfner on Tuesday evening  Bezos declared that he was  very proud of our working conditions  and  very proud of our wages that we pay  
Under new rules mandating the information for public companies  Amazon recently disclosed that last year  its workers  median annual salary was  28 446  or  13 68 an hour  Walmart  NYSE WMT  paid  19 177   But the number isn t really indicative of actual pay to workers because it includes people from more than 50 countries as well as full and part time workers in fulfillment centers  in customer service  in software engineering roles  product management and other areas 
According to WSJ analysis  Amazon isn t among the top payers  which are pure tech companies  Amazon  which has more significant retail operations  pays closer to what retailers generally pay  Amazon s average hourly wage to full time fulfillment center workers in the U S  is more than  15  including cash  stock and incentive bonuses  a spokeswoman told the WSJ

stock is on the rise once again  up 4  in interday trading Like Match Group  the IAC Investor letter made specific mention of the Facebook threat  but pointed out that  We have a 23 year head start and several months advance warning  and we re going to take advantage of all of it  CEO Joey Levin  appearing on CNBC Thursday morning pointed out that Match had already fended off challenges in the dating market from Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  and AOL when those companies were the giants of the internet and that he expected to fare the same in the current environment by providing a superior customer experience CEO Hints at Hidden ValueLevin also pointed out an interesting valuation issue that was not specifically mentioned in the official release   He said IAC owns 87  of ANGI and 81  of MTCH and that if you added the market value of those holdings to the company s cash on the balance sheet  the total exceeded the market cap of IAC  meaning the rest of the holdings were being assigned a negative value by the markets   He illustrated that Vimeo in particular had an excellent subscriber base  strong retention and customer life and improving gross margins and yet  was being virtually ignored by IAC investors Though Levin played coy when a sharp interviewer asked if that meant investors could expect a Vimeo spinoff  clearly that possibility must be on the table Spinoffs of undervalued assets are a common way for companies to unlock hidden market value and are generally positive events for investors InterActive Corp is a much more diversified way to bet on a Match Group rebound  while also getting exposure to a high performing basket of internet assets   Management appears well prepared for the competitive challenges ahead  and though the MTCH selloff may be justified based on both competitive and valuation issues  IAC seems to have been punished unjustly and could see a significant rebound The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8

117889,339404,IAC,Wanna Date ,opinion,"On Wednesday  IAC InterActiveCorp  NASDAQ IACI  the conglomerate run by Barry Diller  announced that the company s Match Group    Match com  Tinder and OKCupid    plans to pursue an initial public offering during the fourth quarter of this year  According to the press release  IAC will issue less than 20  of its shares in the offering  with IAC s remaining stake in The Match Group represented by both high and low vote common shares  IAC believes that their dating sites are an attractive combination of large cash flows  solid growth potential  and strong margins 
In general  dating sites in the United States are a hot market  expecting to generate  1 17B this year  while dating apps are expected to make  628 8M  up from  1 08B and  572M last year  IAC has a market capitalization of  6 35B  Match Group s portfolio is made up of 40 global brands  has generated more than  780M in revenue  and has made profits of over  260M in 2013  Evidently  IAC s dating sites  successes have encouraged the movement towards an IPO  and the market is seemingly in favor  In fact  IAC shares increased over 5  in premarket trading on Thursday after the announcement of this planned stock offering  This year alone  IAC shares are up more than 33   and have climbed 4 6  to  80 83 in recent trading 

IAC s Match Group s revenue is soaring faster than any of Diller s other business segments  as it gained 11  last year  rising up to  897M  As a result  the Match Group now makes up 31  of IAC s top line  However  while paid subscribers have grown 16  this year  profits for the segment fell 36   likely due to stiff competition in the on line dating space 

IAC s first matchmaking service  Match com  was launched in 1995  and is now represented globally in 24 countries  The Match Group overall is valued at  5 7B  and Tinder is worth around  2B by itself  Although Tinder has been a big hit with users  most are still using the free app  which continues cannibalize profits from Match com  a paid service  Even as IAC works to monetize Tinder  recently laying out a suite of new premium features  it will be sometime before it is profitable  Tinder s new premium services costs  9 99 for younger users and  19 99 for people over 30 years old  Analysts fear that these customers will continue to resent the payment system  and thus go elsewhere for a free dating source 
It will be intriguing to see whether this IPO will lead to a match made in heaven with Wall Street  Definitely keep a look out for this love affair  as it could certainly be a scandalous one ",2015-06-25,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wanna-date-256295,256295
117890,339405,IAC,A Broadening Rally As Sentiment Continues Improving,opinion,"T2108 Status  47 9 T2107 Status  21 4 VIX Status  19 4General  Short term  Trading Call  bullishActive T2108 periods  Day  5 over 20   Day  4 over 30   Day  1 over 40   ending 48 days under 40    overperiod   Day  53 below 50   Day  68 under 60   Day  409 under 70 

The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  N SPY   closed with a 1 2  gain and its highest close since January 7  2016  The index also closed tantalizingly just below resistance at its 50 day moving average  If not for this resistance  I would declare a double bottom already confirmed 

As this rally unfolds  the January and February lows are looking more and more like a double bottom pattern  Buyers still need to accomplish an impressive close above 50DMA resistance 
T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  continues to add to the bullish vibes  My favorite technical indicator closed at 47 9   its highest close since December 1  2015  This steady climb combined with a rising S P 500 represents a broadening rally  This is very healthy and indicates a definitive change in sentiment 
T2108 is showing an ever expanding rally that is starting to look like October s moonshot from oversold conditions 
The volatility index  the VIX  acknowledged the change in sentiment by confirming a breakdown below its 50DMA 
The volatility index  the VIX  has plunged nearly non stop since the last time it failed at resistance from the 2012 intraday high 
This almost seems too good to be true  Needless to say  I am thinking about hedges again  If the S P 500 fails to break through 50DMA resistance this week  sellers will surely become bolder  I will actually leave Caterpillar  N CAT  alone for now as it has achieved a 50DMA breakout  Instead  I will look for stock specific shorts as hedges  TraderMike  see above  recommended the following chart of IAC InterActiveCorp  IAC   A close below Monday s low triggers the short with the assumption that the move will confirm stiff resistance from the downtrending 20DMA  Moreover  the rally to this point has occurred on very weak volume  especially compared to the selling volume that preceded the bottom 
IAC InterActiveCorp  O IAC  has rallied a cool 17  from the intraday and 3 year low from three weeks ago 


Even if IAC breaks its primary downtrend  the monthly chart suggests the stock has topped out and will be a prime short at SOME point  
In the last T2108 Update  I showed some some stocks that looked like classic plays to pick coming out of oversold territory  Twitter  N TWTR  is a similar stock  While TWTR may seem similar to IAC  I think of it as fundamentally different given the large one day gains from the lows  the strong buying volume  and now the stock s ability to penetrate into the upper Bollinger Bands  BBs  which can ignite an extended rally  TWTR is one 50DMA breakout away from creating a fresh surge higher 
Twitter  TWTR  makes a bid for a confirmed bottom   just one 50DMA breakout away 
While I am on the topic of internet stocks  I might as well show an update of Facebook  O FB     Today s breakaway from 50DMA congestion all but confirmed a new bullish run is underway for FB that will contribute to the growing sentiment change in the market 
Facebook  FB  breaks away from 50DMA congestion  A new bullish run is likely underway 
Finally  one more notable move in the internet space Amazon com  O AMZN  brought together several bullish shifts  a breakout above both its still increasing 200DMA and its downtrending 20DMA  Buying volume has been very strong coming off the February bottom 

Amazon com  AMZN  has now recovered a little over 50  of its post earnings losses as it makes a very important breakout 
It looks like an astute trader could create some very interesting and profitable pairs trades from these collection of internet stocks

117893,339408,IAC,Angie s List  ANGI  Stock Rallies 60  On IAC Buyout Bid,opinion,"On Tuesday  shares of consumer recommendation website Angie s List   NASDAQ ANGI   are rallying big time  up about 60  in morning trading after the company agreed to be acquired by online conglomerate IAC Interactive Corp    NASDAQ IAC   
Under the terms of the deal  Angie s List shareholders can choose to receive  8 50 in cash per share or a share in the newly combined company  which is set to be called ANGI Homeservices Inc  At  8 50 per share  the deal values Angie s List at over  500 million  representing a 44  premium over the stock s closing price of  5 89 on Monday 
ANGI Homeservices will combine Angie s List and its direct rival  HomeAdvisor  which IAC also owns  both websites allow people to search for professionals that provide services like home repair  The new company will be publicly traded  and IAC will own about 90  of the stock in the combined company 
 After completing our comprehensive strategic review  we have found a true partner in IAC and HomeAdvisor that we believe will create tremendous shareholder value for Angie s List  Together  we uniquely benefit from the powerful combination of two market leaders  who  by joining forces  can drive incredible innovation  customer satisfaction and category growth   said Thomas R  Evans  Chairman of Angie s List 
IAC  and specifically its most famous chairman  Barry Diller  tried to buy Angie s List before  making many buyout offers back in 2015  Angie s List rejected the  512 million bid   it  dramatically  too low  it represented a 10  premium at the time  when Angie s List market cap topped  575 million 
Since then  the value of ANGI stock has plunged  Its market cap currently sits at about  350 million  and the company lost nearly  8 million in 2016  Over the past one year  ANGI has lost over 32  in value 
For IAC  the Angie s List acquisition is an opportunity to create the next big online  on demand marketplace  The company notably buys businesses  combines similar sites into the same holding company  and then spins them off  This model created Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE    which now owns numerous other travel sites like Hotwire  Trivago  and HomeAway  among others  IAC also did the same for Match Group   NASDAQ MTCH    which owns Tinder  OkCupid  PlentyOfFish  Match  and other dating sites 
The deal is expected to close by the end of this year  HomeAdvisor s current CEO Chris Terrill will head the new company  and Angie s List CEO will remain at least until the deal closes  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  acted as financial advisor to IAC and HomeAdvisor  and Wachtell Lipton Rosen   Katz LLP provided legal counsel  Allen   Company and BofA Merrill Lynch advised Angie s List  while Sidley Austin LLP served as legal counsel

117925,339440,IAC,AVG  Stale Short Interest  Great Opportunity,opinion,For reasons I will explain below  I think there is a good short term long opportunity in this stock as its very high short interest is likely to come down meaningfully and relatively quickly  Even if I put in very conservative assumptions into a DCF  I cannot generate a valuation that is not AT LEAST 100  upside from here  assumptions for DCF highlighted in the paragraph below  AVG Technologies  AVG  is a consumer and enterprise software company that operates using a  freemium  model  In 2012  the company grew Adjusted EPS 37  on 18  sales growth  Despite this growth and consistently beating expectations  the average EPS beat vs Street over the last 5 quarters has been close to 50    the stock currently trades at less than 10x NTM Street Adjusted EPS  Free cash flow per share has historically been higher than EPS primarily because of the company s growing deferred revenue balance  subscribers generally pay ahead of revenue recognition   As of the middle of June  the short interest as a   of the float stood at 33  The company s main product offering is free antivirus for desktop computing  AVG primarily monetizes its user base by upselling subscriptions to a portion of its users and through a product called  secure search   Users of the antivirus software can download a toolbar so that AVG becomes the default search provider  As users click on advertisements  AVG gets a revenue share with the search engine company that is providing the search results  The bear thesis largely revolves around this search business Immediately after this article came out  AVG s short interest jumped from just 751k shares at the end of January to over 8 5m shares in mid April  The Company significantly beat Q1 expectations when it reported results on April 24th and as I will argue below  the short thesis seemed to have largely played out but the short interest remains very high at 7 9m shares  In q4 2012  almost all of AVG s search revenue came from its Google partnership  In February  Google made a policy change so that all new downloaded toolbars needed to be  opted in   Bears were correct in concluding that this change would force AVG to move all new users to Yahoo  which still has an  opt out  policy  However  they were incorrect in the financial impact this would have  Bears argued that since Yahoo monetizes search significantly  up to 50   lower than Google  AVG s search related revenue would have a sharp fall  This argument made sense at the time  but the evidence does not support the bear case  In Q1  the company reported that Yahoo represented 9  of search related revenue  Moreover  AVG said that Revenue per Thousand Searches  RPM  stayed flattish sequentially and guided for this to be the case for Q2  The bears are failing to recognize the fact that while Yahoo likely monetizes less  Yahoo s new management views getting increased scale in search as strategic and is very likely giving up more in revenue share than Google was  I estimate that AVG s revenue per search is only about 15  less than what it was getting with Google  If it is much lower than that  then RPM would not have stayed relatively flattish sequentially  This estimate has also been confirmed by talking to other toolbar companies  Moreover  if one looks back to the 1st half of 2010 when almost all of AVG s search business was with Yahoo  the RPM was in the  16 17 range vs the  21 RPM it had with Google in q4 2012  Based on conversations with several people in the industry  I think it is highly likely that AVG s current RPM with Yahoo is much better than it was in the first half of 2010  First  Yahoo has improved monetization since then  Second  AVG has much more leverage since it has many more users  Third  Yahoo has new management who wants to take share from Google and who views increased scale in search as strategic  While it is true that AVG would have been economically better off if Google did not do the policy change  it does not appear that the lower monetization with Yahoo is enough for the company to miss estimates and at sub 10x FCF  the company needs to miss estimates significantly for the shorts to make money  When the company beat EPS expectations in q1 by over 50   AVG left full year guidance largely unchanged  This effectively brought down search revenue expectations for the rest of the year and was the impact of the Google policy change  This should become even clearer when the company reports results for Q2 which will be the first full quarter following the Google policy change  Perion Network  PERI  and InteractiveCorp  IACI  are impacted by the same Google policy change and both also still guided for growth  While the new Google policy has already impacted Street numbers  there are several sources of large upside optionality that will also become clearer to bears as we progress through the year  1  AVG has 36m mobile users as of q1  These mobile users grew 100  y y  83  organically if you adjust for an acquisition   The company is currently not monetizing these users and the Street does not seem to be incorporating any revenue from mobile even for next year  AVG has said that it will start to monetize these users in q4  AVG s mobile products have gotten great reviews for products such as  and   both of which received 4 5 out of 5 stars on Google s app store  In addition  given the privacy climate created by the government s PRISM project  AVG s Do Not Track  DNT  functionality has attracted a lot of users to their mobile offerings  I estimate that the company could have close to 95m mobile users by the end of the 2014  In q1  2013  the company generated  56 6m of subscription revenue from an average of 117m desktop users or close to  2 in annual subscription revenue per desktop user  Even if the company can monetize mobile users at just 10  of the rate it does on desktop  this could imply at least 3  upside to Street revenue in 2014 and because the incremental margin on this revenue would be extremely high  it could imply well over 10  upside to Street 2014 EPS  2  AVG continues to do well with improving its monetization of desktop users  The company s desktop subscription revenue growth has accelerated over the last 5 quarters and was 54  of total revenue in q1 2013  This happened despite the fact that desktop users declined sequentially over the last 2 quarters as Google s toolbar policy change also impacted customer acquisition  I expect that desktop user growth will go back to growing sequentially  After all  AVG is offering a good free alternative to existing Antivirus products on the market and still has a relatively low share of the total PC installed base  PC sales have been weak which is great for AVG as new PC s are often loaded with trial antivirus from Symantec or McAfee  An aging PC installed base is also good for AVG s newer Tune Up products  which appear to be doing well  The company plans to break out Tune Up users on its next conference call  which implies that it has become material  In q1 2013  the average paying desktop subscriber paid the company at an annualized rate of  15 09  which was up from  12 43 in q1 2012  Given that the company seems to be pushing its security suite  which is priced at  40  there seems to be a fair amount of room with this variable to continue to rise  3  The company recently made an accretive acquisition of LPI which will add  5m of revenue in the 2nd half of 2013  This deal further diversifies the company away from search related revenue and also does not seem to be factored into Street estimates yet  4  Finally  since the company is domiciled in the Netherlands and has such a large and growing user base that can be cross sold other products  it is possible that it could be an acquisition target for one of the many Technology and Internet companies that have a lot of overseas cash  I am not arguing that many of AVG s users likely unknowingly opt in to AVG s secure search products  However  while the company may do some unpopular things with its search related business  the short thesis appears stale and the short interest has surprisingly stayed high despite obvious evidence that point to the fact that the overall revenues should continue to grow quite healthily  This should become clearer after the q2 results and if shorts have not covered by q4  they will likely cover as we get closer to the big upside optionality of monetization of mobile users  The CEO s resignation is concerning but the company is likely past its hyper growth phase and it seems like he just wants to do something more entrepreneurial  He has not sold any shares and has not even initiated a 10b5 1 plan  Moreover  he will stay on at the company as an advisor  In my DCF  I assume that 2014 search related revenue declines slightly as we cycle through the lower monetization from Yahoo vs Google  I model a 25  per quarter churn rate for Google toolbar users vs the 15  churn rate used by the bearish analyst in the article mentioned above   However  search revenue should then go back to growing at least in the low single digits in 2015 and beyond  The company has said that it plans to generate platform revenue in other ways than just search such as ecommerce and advertising  I have not factored any of this  I model desktop subscription revenue growth to decelerate from 21 5  y y growth in q1 2013 to the low teens in 2015 and single digits thereafter  If you play around with the key variables    of active users that pay and revenue per paying subscriber   it is very difficult to even envision this level of deceleration given historical trends  I expect that by 2018  they get to the same number of mobile users as desktop users today   again a very conservative assumption given the current growth rates of mobile users  I also assume that by 2018  the company generates about 40c in subscription revenue per active mobile user  vs about  2 and rising in subscription revenue per active desktop user today   I use a 30  operating margin in my terminal year vs the 37  operating margin that was reported in q1 2013 and 33  historical operating margin  Finally  I use a 10  discount rate and a 10x terminal multiple  I think a 10x terminal multiple is very conservative especially since I expect in just a few years  the vast majority of revenue will be coming from subscription revenue  The company s auto renewal rate on subscriptions was at 77  last quarter and has been consistently rising  it was just 44  in 2011   With all these conservative assumptions  I still get AT LEAST 100  upside to the stock  I welcome any comments from people who are short to understand what I may be
