3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Right Now
Shares of some of the biggest names in the semiconductor industry have surged in 2019  The climb is due in part because Wall Street and investors began to see value in some chip names after many tumbled  along with other tech giants  to end 2018 
With that said  the historically cyclical semiconductor industry appears to be in the midst of a downturn  Companies in the industry are beholden to their customers  product cycles  capital investments  and more  On top of that  chip oversupply can hurt pricing power  as is currently the case for some firms in the industry 
Still  despite the current woes  the industry looks poised to remain highly valuable within the larger technological revolution  Semiconductor companies are poised to help drive forward the growth of the Internet of Things  artificial intelligence  autonomous vehicles  and much more  And it won t just be the likes of Apple that are set to turn big profits and see their stocks climb as these industries expand

14668,236183,CREE,Fact Check  Is It Better To Invest In Small Cap Or Large Cap Stocks ,opinion,"Investing in equities  when done right  can provide unparalleled returns  But unless an investor has a specific stock they re focused on  there s another question that should be asked before any targeted choices are made  Is it better to invest in large  or small cap shares 
Large cap is the commonly used vernacular for companies whose stocks have large market capitalizations  meaning valuations above  10 billion  Small caps are the exact opposite  companies with a smaller market capitalization  often valued at up to  2 billion 
Both types of shares have their own benchmark indices  Large caps are listed on the much watched S P 500  while the small cap index of choice is the Russell 2000  The median market cap for companies listed on the S P 500 is  22 billion  whereas companies listed on the Russell 2000 have a median market cap of  800 million 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   which are all listed on the S P  each hit valuations of  1 trillion  garnering considerable investor and media attention  Conversely  it s very possible you ve never heard of The Trade Desk  NASDAQ TTD   Cree Inc  NASDAQ CREE  and Coupa Software  NASDAQ COUP   three of the largest Russell 2000 components 
Over the past decade  it has become conventional wisdom that small caps usually outperform large caps  But do they really  Here s what we discovered from the data below  which lists the annual total returns  dividends included  of both the S P 500 and Russell 2000 

First  note that based on results over the past 40 years the timeframe for which the Russell 2000 data was available the small cap index outperformed the S P 500 22 times  the S P bested the Russell 18 different times  Overall  then  it seems pretty balanced 
Second  outperformance seems to be cyclical  Data shows  the Russell generally outperformed between 1979 1983  1991 1993  2000 2014  while the S P outperformed between 1984 1990  1994 1999  and 2014 2018  Breaking these periods down further  a pattern emerges 
The Russell 2000 outperformance coincides with economically troubled times in the U S  

1979 1983  Double digit inflation  plus during 1980 and 1982  recessions 
1991 1993  1990 1991 Recession
2000 2014  Tech bubble  subprime crisis

The S P 500 outperformed when the U S  economy was strong 

1984 1990  1980 s boom  leading to the 1990 recession
1994 1999  Mid 90 s economic expansion  leading to the tech bubble
2014 2018  Economic expansion after recovery from the 2008 crisis

Of course  the correlation between the performance of the indices isn t absolute  Some years the results are counterintuitive to this theory  Still  the correlation is strong enough to indicate that when the economy is expanding  go with large caps  However  when economic conditions get tough  go with small caps 
And since we ve already crunched the numbers  here s the answer to a likely secondary question  if you had invested  100 dollars in both the Russell and the S P during January 1979  which investment would have made more money 
On January 2019  our final data point  you would have seen a return of  6 759 from the Russell   7 835 for the S P  But the flow of returns was also time dependent  The Russell took the lead from the beginning of the period examined until 1989  In 1989  the S P took over  until 2010 
The strong recovery of the Russell 2000 after the tech bubble and subprime crisis allowed it to retake the overall lead in 2010  only for that to be squandered in 2014 when the S P came roaring back to dominance  where it remains to this day ",2019-05-15,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fact-check-is-it-better-to-invest-in-smallcap-or-largecap-stocks-200421475,200421475

14670,236185,CREE,Factors Setting The Tone For Cree  CREE  In Q4 Earnings,opinion,Cree  Inc    NASDAQ CREE   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings results on Aug 20 Notably  the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 45 28  Q3 Results Sneak PeakCree had reported non GAAP earnings of 20 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019  improving 17 6  year over year  Moreover  the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25  Revenues came in at  274 1 million  up 22  year over year  However  the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  275 million Guidance   Estimates for Q4Cree was compelled to trim fiscal fourth quarter outlook owing to addition of Huawei to the entity list  Markedly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  the company had anticipated revenues from products and materials in connection with Huawei s wireless infrastructure to be up to  15 million  which remains a major concern Per the revised guidance  Cree anticipates fiscal fourth quarter revenues in the range of  245 million to  252 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  248 34 million  suggesting a decline of 39 4  on a year over year basis Non GAAP earnings have been forecast to be between 8 and 12 cents per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 10 cents  indicating a decline of 9 1  from the year ago quarter  Notably  the consensus has remained unchanged for the past 30 days Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsCree is expected to benefit from ongoing momentum in Wolfspeed business  The segment includes silicon carbide  or SiC  materials  power solutions and RF devices  Robust adoption of the company s SiC  RF and Power solutions  primarily by automakers to accelerate deployment of electric vehicles  EVs  remains noteworthy During the quarter under review  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  Group selected Cree as silicon carbide partner for Volkswagen s FAST  or Future Automotive Supply Tracks  Initiative  The company s expertise in SiC technology will be utilized by the automaker to efficiently implement global vehicle projects Expanding clientele is infusing confidence in the stock  Shares of Cree have returned 33 7  year to date  outperforming the  s growth of 16 3  Moreover  during the to be reported quarter  Cree concluded the divestiture of Cree Lighting to IDEAL INDUSTRIES  with an aim to focus on RF power business Nonetheless  the company has been compelled to increase investment on product innovation to deal with stiff competition  from peers like Analog Devices   NASDAQ ADI    Qorvo   NASDAQ QRVO    among others  This is likely to hurt profitability In fact  during the quarter  the company announced plans to invest up to  1 billion to expand SiC capacity  The move is aimed at developing the state of the art  automated 200 mm SiC fabrication facility and a materials mega factory at its headquarter in Durham  NC  With this increase in capacity  Cree aims to address the evolving requirements of 5G and electric vehicle markets by 2024 Although  this investment favors the company s growth prospects over the longer haul  it is likely to limit margin expansion in the near term Notably  for fourth quarter fiscal 2019  the company projects Wolfspeed revenues to lie in the range of  132  135 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wolfspeed revenues is pegged at  133 million  suggesting growth of 20 9  from year ago reported figure Meanwhile  owing to uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions  management remains cautious and revised LED revenues outlook  For fourth quarter fiscal 2019  Cree anticipates LED product revenues

Cree  which was founded by researchers from North Carolina State in 1987  issued the lower guidance amid wide ranging product delays and customer service disruptions over the quarter  The Durham  North Carolina based company now expects to finish the quarter with revenues around  365 million  sharply below initial targets between  400 and  430 million  At the same time  Cree reduced its quarterly earnings outlook to 0 13 and 0 15 per share  from previous guidance of 0 22 to 0 29

 I believe we ve addressed the root causes that led to our recent business challenges   said Chuck Swoboda  Creed CEO   While it s premature to provide specific targets at this time  the order rate in commercial lighting improved in March  and we re optimistic that this  combined with demand for new products  will begin to drive growth in fiscal Q4

Campeon office complex in Neubiberg  near Munich  the location of Infineon s headquarters The acquisition will be funded from the company s existing cash balance  The acquisition will earn a rate of return well above Infineon s borrowing cost and as from the beginning of fiscal year 2017 is accretive to the segment operating income GuidanceInfineon anticipates the global semiconductor market to

forecast to be roughly in line with or slightly above the group average  The Power Management   Multi market and Chip Card   Security segments are both expected to report growth rates below the group average Infineon has decided to raise the target for the Segment operating margin throughout the cycle from 15  to 17  due to estimated positive impact on future earnings from further ramp up and higher utilization of the 300 millimeter plant in Dresden as well as by cost benefits resulting from integrating International Rectifier s manufacturing landscape  Moreover  favorable foreign exchange rate is a factor Investments in property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and capitalized development costs is anticipated to be  950 million for fiscal 2017  This figure includes approximately  35 million for a new building at Infineon s headquarters in Neubiberg near Munich The ratio for investments as a percentage of revenue  at the mid point of the planned revenue range for fiscal 2017  excluding expenditure on the new office building is approximately 13   Depreciation and amortization are expected to be about  830 million Due to MoTO acquisition  free cash flow is anticipated to

the forecast revenue range  the segment operating margin is expected to be 14  Our TakeWe believe that Infineon has significant growth opportunities in the Automotive market due to growing hybrid and fully electric vehicles globally  including China  Growing demand for its IGBT transistors for partially and fully electric cars along with radar chips are worth mentioning in this regard We believe that the company s focus on developing energy efficient solutions will be a key catalyst going ahead  In this regard  the acquisition of Wolfspped from Cree   NASDAQ CREE   will expand the company s compound semiconductors product portfolio and will enable it to serve growing markets such as electromobility  renewable energies and cellular infrastructure However  we believe slowdown in smartphone sales can prove to be a major drag  Additionally  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  constant and swift technological changes  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion is likely to be major headwinds going ahead Zacks Rank   Key PicksInfineon carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Better ranked stocks in the broader sector include NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   and Intersil   NASDAQ ISIL

146989,368505,CREE,Falling Earnings Estimates Signal Weakness Ahead For Cree  CREE  ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Cree  Inc    NASDAQ CREE    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in CREE A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 2 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from 51 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 35 cents Also  for the current quarter  Cree has seen 2 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 6 cents a share from 17 cents over the past 30 days    The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 15 8  in the past month So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Computer   Technology sector  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Barracuda Networks  Inc    NYSE CUDA    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be better selection at this time ,2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/falling-earnings-estimates-signal-weakness-ahead-for-cree-(cree)-200127278,200127278
146990,368506,CREE,4 Stocks To Watch  ACIA  AXDX  LCI  XNCR,opinion,"It was an interesting day on Wall Street on Thursday  The markets were up sharply  they bounced  came down in the afternoon  tried to retest earlier highs  did not break  but came on strong and managed to back off in the last hour as some cautious profit taking set in  in some overbought conditions 
But the market keeps climbing  Individually  a lot of stocks did well on Thursday  so let s take a look at some of them  I ll show you a few that are either swinging  or day trading 
Acacia Communications Inc  NASDAQ ACIA  has been phenomenal since after its IPO when it hit bottom around 27  then ran up to 45  pulled back to the Brexit low down around the 33 area  and then took off and has been smokin  the last couple weeks 
On Thursday it was up 2 81 to 52 43  or 5 66   on 1 1 million shares  This looks like a stock that isn t done yet  Although you may have Wednesday s low as a potential stopping point  we don t want it under 47  I think this stock could hit the mid 50 s  maybe even 57  as early as Friday 
Accelerate Diagnostics Inc  NASDAQ AXDX  popped 63 cents to 19 07  or 3 4   on 390 656 shares traded on Thursday  This is one of our swing trades that recently popped  came down into the Brexit low  and then has run up every day since 
That s two weeks and twelve trading days  I wouldn t be an advocate of buying it aggressively here  I would look for some pullback opportunities up towards 17 17 1 2 range  but it looks like this stock is headed to 23 24 zone  at least initially  With 20 6 days to cover  we may very well see that 
Lannett Com  NYSE LCI  is a company that I like  It had a big move down from the mid 70 s down to 16 when most biotech s got hammered  It dropped  consolidated  and broke out  consolidated again  and on Thursday it popped 1 52 to 28 23  or 5 69   on 1 6 million shares  convincing me that I want to put this on my swing list  Particularly because it closed at 28 23  7 cents from the high  and a new closing high  which indicates to me a target of 32 going forward 
Xencor Inc  NASDAQ XNCR  was actually down 23 cents to 17 96  or 1 26   on 203 728 shares traded  This stock  with its long base  a massive breakout with a breakaway gap on big volume  followed by two weeks of flagging on low volume  I decided it was time to put out a swing trade on this on Thursday 
Although I did state that I may be a little early  it could get up to a little bit lower towards 17  If it does what I think it can  and breaks out of this flag and runs  and if it gets through the 19 99 20 zone  I m looking for this stock to run up the mid 20 s  14 days to cover could fuel the advance on this one

147004,368520,CREE,Cree Gets LED Lower,opinion,The leading light emitting diode  LED  and semiconductor manufacturer Cree Inc   NASDAQ CREE  was trading lower at the start of the trading session  Recently  CREE s stock price has stalled out on the daily chart around the  35 70 level  This resistance area is an important lower gap window from October 2  2014  Often  gap windows will serve as major chart resistance when retested  Today  CREE stock is trading lower by 0 70 cents to  34 87 a share  Day traders should watch the  33 36 level for intra day support  This is an area where day traders can look for an intra day bounce in the stock ,2014-11-17,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cree-gets-led-lower-232802,232802
147026,368542,CREE,Bulls Need To Shake Off The  June Gloom ,opinion,Here in Santa Barbara  we refer to the annual summer ritual of a heavy marine layer engulfing the coastline for much of the day as the  June gloom   It can be frustrating to beach going visitors since there are otherwise no clouds  and the inland areas are brilliantly sunny  Similarly  bullish investors might be frustrated with the financial version of June gloom to start the month  given that the overall setting for equities is still relatively bright During their run of seven consecutive positive months  stocks have managed to shrug off a lot of obstacles from Greece  Italy  Cyprus  China  Japan  North Korea  Iran  and even our own Federal government  But the blame for this June gloom has been widely placed on the rumored tapering of the Federal Reserve s bond buying program  Treasury yields have spiked  sending bond prices down  The worry is that the bond market will get clobbered and bring equities down with it Some think the FOMC has been too transparent  with all their internal squabbling making investors uneasy  And yet the stock market remains on a bullish trajectory despite its recent weakness  It s likely that money will simply flow from bonds to stocks as interest rates rise Low volatility ETFs like PowerShares S P 500 Low Volatility  SPLV  and Guggenheim Defensive Equity  DEF  have outperformed this year as the more defensive sectors that dominate their portfolios have been the leaders  Lately  however  their performance has suffered as Utilities has sold off hard as capital has rotated into cyclical and higher beta sectors Of course  the appeal of dividend paying stocks diminishes as interest rates rise  and as P E multiples of these safe dividend paying sectors have risen  their valuations are no longer so attractive either  This  along with a slowly improving economy  has been the driver of the recent sector rotation into cyclicals Looking at the chart of the SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY   it closed Wednesday at 161 27 as the technical consolidation that appeared to be starting last week continues  Bollinger Bands  have pinched back together and oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic have all cycled back down from overbought territory  The 20 day simple moving average  SMA  failed to hold up as support  It is now approaching the bottom of the bullish rising channel that has been in place since November  which happens to converge with psychological support at 160  corresponding with 1600 on the S P 500 Index  and the important 50 day SMA  I expect this level to provide strong support The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 17 50  which is above recent resistance at 15  but it remains below the important 20 as it approaches the April highs  Still  VIX has not been above 20 during 2013 Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  business sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations 1  Little change this week  Financial  IYF  stays in the top spot with an Outlook score of 73  Stocks within IYF display strong sentiment among insiders and Wall Street analysts  net upgrades to earnings estimates   as well as a low forward P E  Technology  IYW  is a close second with a score of 72  Stocks within IYW display a low forward P E  a solid long term projected growth rate  and the best return ratios 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 0  It is weak across the board with a high forward P E  poor long term projected growth  low return ratios  and negative sentiment among insiders and sell side analysts  It is joined in the bottom two again this week by Basic Materials  IYM  at 31 3  I would say that this week s fundamentals based rankings are still mostly bullish  with Financial  IYF   Technology  IYW   and Energy  IYE  in the top five  But it would be more encouraging to see improving scores in Consumer Services  IYC   Industrial  IYJ  and Materials  IYM  4  Looking at the Bull scores  IYJ has been the leader on particularly strong market days  scoring 54  followed closely by IYF and IYM  while defensive sectors have been the laggards  IYZ and IYM score the lowest at 45  This is normal market behavior and further evidence of the rotation into traditional leaders of market rallies  However  the narrow top bottom spread of 9 points continues to indicate high sector correlation on strongly bullish days 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Technology  IYW  has become the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 54  followed closely by traditional safe havens Utilities  IDU  and Consumer Goods  IYK   Financial  IYF  remains the weakling during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 47  The top bottom spread has dropped even further to only 7 points  which indicates much lower correlation on weak market days than we were seeing during most of the year so far 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 176  Telecom  IYM  is the worst at 96  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Consumer Goods  IYK  and Technology  IYW  display the highest score of 104  Telecom  IYZ  scores the lowest at 96 These Outlook scores represent the view that Financial and Technology sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Some top ranked stocks within IYF and IYW include Mastercard  MA   Berkshire Hathaway  BRK B   Cree Inc  CREE   and SanDisk  SNDK  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned  About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2013-06-06,Scott Martindale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bulls-need-to-shake-off-the-'june-gloom'-170114,170114
147027,368543,CREE,Sector Detector  Investors Try To Decipher Clues From The Fed ,opinion,The world has been watching every peep  sniffle  or innuendo associated with any voting member of the FOMC  What is the future of the latest in their ongoing market manipulation  in which money is printed to buy bonds to hold down interest rates  spur corporate borrowing  and artificially inflate stocks  Lately  that s all investors have cared about Yes  it seems that all anyone has been talking about is the Federal Reserve and the timing of their  tapering  off on quant easing  There was a lot of anticipation going into this latest meeting  Fed chairman Bernanke said on Wednesday that if the economy continues to improve  their asset purchasing program could start to wind down in late 2013 and conclude in 2014 Stocks sold off on the news and Treasury yields spiked to 2011 highs  Interestingly  the worst performing sectors during Wednesday s market weakness were the defensive sectors  Utilities  Consumer Staples  Telecom  and Healthcare  In Thursday trading in Asia  stocks  currencies  and commodities are all getting hammered Bernanke says they will continue watching the economy for more gains  and only taper asset purchases if the economic data continues to improve in a self sustaining way  He also deflected questions about interest rate hikes as a separate issue for a later date  Notably  the FOMC meeting reportedly showed a strong majority preferring not to sell mortgage backed securities during the unwinding process  even though they all agree that the longer term focus should be on Treasuries On the negative side  mortgage applications are falling sharply as interest rates rise  which threatens the housing recovery and the important  wealth effect  it creates  This provides some downward pressure on interest rates by making the Fed reluctant to do anything that upsets the apple cart Despite the expectation of rising yields  the US dollar has weakened significantly this month  The weak dollar should give a boost to corporate profits among multinationals and other companies with significant overseas sales  as those sales in stronger currencies are converted  Overall  a weaker dollar boosts commodity prices  corporate earnings  GDP  and stock prices Actually  stock valuations are still pretty good right now  given current forward earnings expectations  But top line growth would certainly be welcome  Achieving further earnings growth through productivity gains and cost cutting can be challenging at this point  as companies are already running pretty darn lean  In fact  it was just reported that Men s Wearhouse  MW  has fired founder pitchman George Zimmer   You re going to like the way you look  I guarantee it    I guess nothing is sacred when it comes to cost cutting Looking at the chart of the SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY   it closed Wednesday at 163 45  which is right on the upper line of the neutral symmetrical triangle I drew last week  So  after bullishly breaking out of the upper resistance line of the triangle  price is now testing resistance turned support  Overall  Wednesday s price action means the technical consolidation continues  and might be forming a sideways channel that roughly corresponds with the space between the 20 day and 50 day simple moving averages  SMAs   although I think the long standing bullish rising channel that has been in place since November will remain the dominant pattern The oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are still neutral  Strong support exists at the bottom line of the rising channel  followed by psychological support at 160  corresponding with 1600 on the S P 500 Index   Below that  there is 154  150  and the 200 day SMA  which is  support of last resort  Small caps have been looking particularly strong lately  A chart of the iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund  IWM  is similar to the SPY  but the past month s action is shaping up more in the form of a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern  which would be very bullish Also of note  some commentators are trumpeting the virtues of rotating into emerging markets  given their dismal performance this year  even if just for a  mean reversion  play The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 16 64  Since the beginning of June  it has stayed above resistance turned support at 15  but it still has not closed one day above the important 20 level during 2013 However  keep an eye on the lofty level of NYSE margin debt  which just hit a record high    above the previous highs last seen in the market tops of 2000 and 2007 Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  business sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score

1  Very little change in the Outlook scores this week  Financial  IYF  stays in the top spot with a 79  Stocks within IYF display by far the strongest sentiment among insiders and Wall Street analysts  net revisions to earnings estimates   as well as a low forward P E  Technology  IYW  remains in second with a score of 71  Stocks within IYW display a low forward P E  a solid long term projected growth rate  and the best return ratios  although the analysts aren t highly optimistic about their earnings projections 2  Healthcare  IYH   Energy  IYE   and Consumer Goods  IYK  round out the top five this week  IYH and IYK are buoyed by mostly positive Wall Street sentiment  while IYE sports the lowest  best  forward P E 3  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 1  It is weak across the board with a high forward P E  low long term projected growth  poor return ratios  and negative sentiment among insiders and sell side analysts  It is joined in the bottom two again this week by Basic Materials  IYM  at 22  Materials stocks endured further earnings downgrades from Wall Street  Financial  IYF  continues to enjoy positive Wall Street sentiment while Materials  IYM  gets hammered4  This week s fundamentals based rankings remain on the bullish side of neutral  although they aren t progressing  IYF and IYW are still at the top  and IYE is hanging in there  too  But it would be more encouraging to see rising scores in IYM and Industrial  IYJ  5  Looking at the Bull scores  IYE and IYJ have been the leaders on particularly strong market days  scoring 56  followed closely by IYF  while IYZ scores the lowest at 44  IYW is showing marked improvement this week  in both Bull and Bear scores   The top bottom spread has widened to 12 points  indicating slightly lower sector correlations than they have displayed recently  This is encouraging since high sector correlation indicates more of a  risk on risk off  approach in which all boats are lifted together  rather than a thoughtful stock picking approach 6  Looking at the Bear scores  IYW has jumped back up as the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 57  IYF  IYE  and IYM are tied for the lowest during extreme market weakness as reflected in their low Bear score of 46  The top bottom spread is 11 points  which is slightly wider than last week and indicates somewhat lower sector correlations on weak market days 7  Overall  Financial  IYF  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 180  Telecom  IYM  is the by far the worst at 92  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Technology  IYW  displays the highest score of 106  while Telecom  IYZ  scores by far the lowest at 91  This indicates that Tech stocks have been the strongest in extreme market conditions  up or down  while Telecom stocks are generally avoided These Outlook scores continue to represent the view that Financial and Technology sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Some top ranked stocks within IYF and IYW include Signature Bank

147028,368544,CREE,Stocks Seek Direction In The Midst Of The Summer Doldrums,opinion,I suspect there is no greater example of  summer doldrums  than the week surrounding the Fourth of July  especially when the holiday falls mid week  From my standpoint  I certainly have received my share of  out of office  auto responses on emails  For bullish investors  this is usually a time for caution  as any apparently dominant psychology of the market can be misleading  For bearish traders  it s hard to get much momentum going  Bears thought they had their catalyst when the FOMC announced its intention to begin tapering off on the quantitative easing program  But alas  bulls defended their ground  but not before significant technical damage had been done to the bullish charts  In addition  ever since the Fed announced two weeks ago its intention to begin tapering off on the latest quantitative easing program  investors have been somewhat paralyzed by uncertainty  On the one hand  Fed Chairman Bernanke has made it clear that the FOMC will only taper asset purchases if the economic data continues to improve in a self sustaining way  But on the other hand  investors know that it can t go on forever  The Fed s balance sheet must stabilize sooner than later and eventually unwind  no matter the state of economic recovery  Although interest rates spiked with the bond selloff  and many suspect that this flight of capital from bonds is rotating into stocks  I think a continued rise in rates likely will be short lived  Given the extreme importance of housing to the U S  economy and investor psychology   wealth effect    any significant increase in mortgage rates will reduce the affordability factor until home buying cools off  thereby negatively impacting the improving economic data  Beyond the Fed s promised tapering  there are other headwinds for U S  stocks  For one  corporations and the analysts who follow them have been lowering their earnings guidance for the second half of the year  Second  U S  stocks have dramatically outperformed other developed markets as well as emerging markets  so many advisors are suggesting that better values can be found in those beaten down global regions  As Jason Zweig wrote last week in his latest must read  on wsj com   I long ago concluded that regression to the mean is the most powerful law in financial physics   Third  the recent market pullback has left the S P 500 with formidable overhead resistance from its 50 day simple moving average  SMA  and the uptrend line of former support that had been in place since last November  And fourth  let s not forget the global dynamics  turmoil  and  in some cases  government experiments in places like Portugal  Egypt  Syria  China  and Japan  among many others Even at the local level  we each continue to hear about municipal government  school district  and state budget deficits as well as the many cancellations of annual events like Fourth of July fireworks displays  due to an inability to pay for them  even by private organizations  Still  the first half of the year saw the best performance since 1999  with the S P 500 up by  12 6   The second quarter saw bullish leadership from the financial and consumer discretionary sectors as investors rotated from defensive sectors  which were the Q1 leaders  into cyclicals  Looking at the ten U S  business sector iShares ETFs  Financial  IYF  and Consumer Services  IYC  were the clear Q2 leaders  Nevertheless  Healthcare  IYH  is still the leader on a year to date performance basis  up  18  Friday brings the highly anticipated employment report  non farm payrolls   which could be a market mover  But since Friday is one of those unpredictable orphan days after a Thursday holiday  in which few investors are paying much attention  it s hard to know how big of a catalyst the report might be Looking at the chart of the SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY   it closed Wednesday at 161 28  After a disastrous breakdown through the long standing uptrend line  prior psychological support at 160  and the 50  and 100 day SMAs  it bounced near prior support around 155  Much of this selloff likely was simple overreaction to the Fed announcement  which accounts for the quick recovery back above 160  which corresponds with S P 500 at 1600  and the 100 day SMA  But it was turned back at the 50 day  and now SPY might be forming a symmetrical triangle with an imminent apex  which positions it to break one way or the other next week The oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are each giving a different signal  RSI is neutral  MACD is turning up from oversold  and Slow Stochastic is crossing down from overbought  No clues here The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 16 20  which is where it was two weeks ago    just before it spiked above 20 for a few days for the first time all year  At this level  it is back in the zone of complacency  Given the recent rotation into cyclical sectors and their higher beta stocks  we might see VIX staying above 15 My take on market direction  I think stocks continue their struggle to find much upside for the summer  but I also doubt they fall very far  as investors hold on in anticipation of further upside later in the year Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  business

continue to be pounded with earnings downgrades from Wall Street 3  This week s fundamentals based rankings remain on the bullish side of neutral  but they still aren t progressing  IYW  IYH  and IYF remain the top three  even with some shuffling  IYE is hanging tough  and Industrial  IYJ  rose a bit 4  Looking at the Bull scores  IYF has been the leader on particularly strong market days  scoring 58  followed closely by IYJ  while IYZ and IDU score the lowest at 47  and in fact they are the only two scoring below 50  The top bottom spread is still a narrow 11 points  indicating relatively high sector correlations  High sector correlation indicates more of a  risk on risk off  approach in which all boats are lifted together  rather than a thoughtful stock picking approach  so I d rather see a wider top bottom spread 5  Looking at the Bear scores  IYW remains the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 53  IYM scores the lowest during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 43  The top bottom spread is 10 points  which still indicates relatively high sector correlations on weak market days 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 194  Telecom  IYM  is the by far the worst at 96  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Industrial  IYJ  displays the highest score of 106  while Telecom  IYZ  scores by far the lowest at 92  This indicates that Technology stocks have been the strongest in extreme market conditions  up or down  while Telecom stocks are generally avoided These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Healthcare sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Some top ranked stocks within IYW and IYH include Western Digital  WDC   Cree  CREE   Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  REGN   and Celgene Corp  CELG  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2013-07-04,Scott Martindale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-seek-direction-in-the-midst-of-the-summer-doldrums-174051,174051

147040,368556,CREE,Sector Detector  Stocks Succumb To The  New News ,opinion,Market timing is tough duty  Even as stocks have risen inexorably and we all knew it couldn t go up in a straight line  still picking tops is hard  You can be wrong for a long time  and either lose your shirt shorting the market  or miss out on big gains by staying out  Well  it appears that all those previous bullish catalysts are played out  at least for the moment  and the annual ritual of April pullbacks might be kicking in yet again Is it because of the April ritual or anticipation of  Sell in May and go away   No  I think it is more due to the new type of news events we have been getting lately  Rather than the usual financial reports to which investors have grown immune focusing on EU debt  China growth  Federal budgets  municipal pensions  and corporate earnings  the  new  news is more in the form of military threats and terrorism here at home  like bombs and poison letters   In any case  it has caused investor paralysis and bulls have suddenly lost the mojo that they had apparently regained just last week  The technical breakout of the S P 500 above its all time highs has failed  and it is back to testing important support levels Still  the Fed s QE3 liquidity spigot continues to flow  which has helped support equity prices and the housing recovery  albeit at a rate that leaves many unsatisfied  But this lengthy U S  economic recovery cycle  with its low inflation and low borrowing costs  is allowing corporate earnings and revenues to grow while lending a stabilizing force to a fragile global economy  On the other hand  the hawks in the FOMC are taking a new tact of reverse psychology to try to bring an early end to the doves  bond buying by asserting that QE3 hurts the masses  including those living on fixed income  while mainly making the rich richer  You might call it collateral damage This year s rally has been led by defensive sectors  Healthcare  Utilities  and Consumer Goods  and even Telecom has made a recent surge  And this general investor conservatism is also reflected in the outperformance of developed markets over emerging markets and value over growth  and the popularity of dividend paying blue chips Hot money driven  junk rallies  are usually indicative of momentum trading leading to  blow off tops  rather than sustainable long term investing  But the prevailing preference for defensive sectors  value  and dividends tells me that investors are cautious but committed to staying in equities  and any selling should be contained Looking at the charts  the S P500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 155 11  Last week  it broke out strongly above the sideways channel between about 153 5 and 157 that had been in place since early March  But SPY now finds itself back inside the channel and testing support at the bottom of the channel  The 20 day simple moving average has been providing short term support  and in fact price managed to close right at the 20 day on Tuesday  The 40 day SMA has provided reliable secondary support  and in fact it closed Wednesday right at the 40 day after briefly violating support intraday  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all pointing down now  but only Slow Stochastic is approaching oversold territory  The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   has been a yo yo lately  After closing last week below 12  it popped up near 17 on Monday  closed back down below 14 on Tuesday  and then went as high as 17 90 on Wednesday before closing at 16 51  It is still at levels that are historically considered complacent  but in the current VIX environment  anything approaching 20 is showing elevated fear  and above 20 indicates a selloff in progress   Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF   High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend   As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Observations  1  Financial  IYF  has moved into the top ranking with an Outlook score of 76  followed by Technology  IYW  at 74  which is the same as last week s score   IYF continues to see its score gradually rise  while defensive sector Consumer Goods  IYK  saw its score fall a few more points down to 62 to hold on to third place  IYW continues to display a low forward P E  strong projected long term growth  and the best trailing return ratios  while IYF took the lead on the basis of its favorable forward P E and strong support among Wall Street analysts  i e   net upgrades in forward earnings estimates  2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 0  It is among the worst in every metric in the model  particularly forward P E  trailing return ratios  and insider sentiment  It is joined in the bottom two again this week by Basic Materials  IYM   which received a number of downward earnings revisions from the sell side 3  This week s rankings maintain an overall neutral tone  although the bias appears to be gradually swinging back to the bullish side  This week  I m noticing the rise in Financial at the expense of Healthcare  Defensive sectors IYK and IDU still rank in the top five  while economically sensitive sectors IYJ  IYM  and IYC are all in the bottom half 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Financial  IYF  and Industrial  IYJ  are the leaders on particularly strong market days  scoring 56  Basic Materials  IYM  joins Telecom  IYZ  as the laggards on strong market days  scoring 49  But the top bottom spread is quite narrow at only 7 points  which continues to indicate high sector correlation on strongly bullish days 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is serving as the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 64  while Basic Materials  IYM  is by far the worst during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 40  The top bottom spread has widened further to 24 points  which indicates lower correlations on weak market days    i e   it pays to be in the safe sectors when the market is bearish 6  Overall  Financial  IYF  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 180  Telecom  IYZ  is the worst at 106  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities  IDU  shows an impressive total score of 116  Materials  IYM  displays by far the lowest score at 89  This indicates that Utilities stocks have performed the best in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish  while Materials stocks are avoided altogether These Outlook scores represent the view that Financial and Technology sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Some top ranked stocks within Financial and
