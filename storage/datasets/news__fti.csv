197385,418901,FTI,StockBeat   Saudi Attacks Mean Oil   Gas Gains  Airlines Pain,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Oil and gas stocks surged and airlines and other cyclicals suffered Monday as the world was forced to rip up its oil price forecasts in the wake of the attack on Saudi Arabia s oil facilities at the weekend 
By 5 AM ET    BP    LON BP  and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  had shot to the top of the U K  FTSE 100  rising 3 8  and 2 8  respectively  while there were more spectacular gains for pure upstream plays such as   Tullow Oil    LON TLW  and Lundin Petroleum  which rose 8 9  and 6 7  
Europe s other majors  Equinor   OL EQNR    Total    PA TOTF     ENI    MI ENI  and Repsol  MC REP   all rose between 4 3  and 1 5  
Another big gainer was Norway s  Seadrill    OL SDRL   which had appeared to be skidding toward a second insolvency process as oil prices wilted in August  It rose 7 0  by 4 30 AM ET and is now up 60  from its low at the start of September 
Oil and gas contractors fared less well  reflecting the fact that while a windfall is guaranteed to anyone producing oil right now  it s still not clear whether the sudden rise will last long enough to incentivize more investment in alternative supply  Analysts at Rystad Energy predicted last week that the oilfield services sector was headed for a recession next year  after three years of expansion  although chief sectoral analyst Audun Martinsen still sees the sector returning to growth from 2021  
By 5 AM    Technip    PA FTI  was up 3 7   while   Saipem    MI SPMI  was up 2 0  and Petrofac  LON PFC  was up 2 1 
As far as initial reactions are concerned  airlines provided the mirror image to the oil sector s gains  The sector has been struggling with overcapacity and weaker demand in any case  and is not well positioned to withstand a lasting oil price shock 
  Air France KLM    PA AIRFxb  was the biggest faller  losing 4 0   while discount flyer Wizz Air  LON WIZZ  fell 2 8  and  Lufthansa  DE LHAG  fell 2 6      Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA    OL NWC  was the outlier  rising 6 4  amid progress on restructuring two of its biggest bonds 
Overall  markets took the news from the Middle East badly  and sentiment was hurt further by weak economic data out of China  where retail sales and fixed asset investment growth fell short of expectations and industrial production grew at the slowest pace since 2002  according to data compiled by Investing com
The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0 6   while the German DAX fell by 0 7  and the Italian FTSE MIB by 1 2   Outperformers included the FTSE 100  which lost only 0 1   and  of course  the Russian RTS  which rose 1 3  on the prospect of the oil windfall ",2019-09-16,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--saudi-attacks-mean-oil--gas-gains-airlines-pain-1978486,1978486

197454,418970,FTI,TechnipFMC  FTI  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Miss Estimates,opinion,TechnipFMC plc    NYSE FTI   suffered disappointing results in the third quarter of 2019  missing on both earnings and sales The oilfield services provider reported adjusted earnings of 12 cents a share  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents by a wide margin  The bottom line was also lower than the year ago earnings of 31 cents a share This underperformance was attributed to weaker than expected contribution from two of the company s three segments  Precisely  adjusted EBITDA from the Subsea unit totalled  139 million  significantly falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  180 million  Moreover  adjusted EBITDA from Surface Technologies came in at  44 4 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  58 million However  providing some respite to investors amid this gloom  adjusted EBITDA from the Onshore Offshore unit was  304 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  274 million Meanwhile  third quarter revenues came in at  3 335 1 million  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 561 million but 6  higher than the prior year figure of  3 143 8 million Moreover  on a further discouraging note  the company booked record inbound orders of  2 6 billion  down 28 4  year over year  However  the firm s backlog soared 59  year over year to  24 1 billion Segmental AnalysisSubsea  The segment s revenues in the quarter under review were  1 342 2 million  up 11  from the year ago figure of  1 209 1 million  With the subsea sector regaining momentum  the company benefited from the spurt in activities and the achievement of key milestones on projects nearing completion  However  owing to competitively priced backlog and relatively higher share of projects in early phases  TechnipFMC s operating earnings dropped 43  from the prior year period to  45 5 million in the quarter under review Even though the segment s inbound orders in the reported quarter slightly dipped 2 8   its backlog is boosted by  8 6 million  reflecting a 36 5  surge from the year ago period Onshore Offshore  This segment generated revenues of  1 596 million  increasing 4 2  from the prior year quarter  Revenues were driven by ramped up activities on the back of recent awards in downstream  petrochemical and offshore sectors  partly offset by completion of some key projects  especially Yamal LNG  Operating profit from the segment totalled  284 6 million  rising 16 9  from the third quarter 2018 level  backed by a strong project execution and milestone bonuses on key projects The segment s backlog jumped 79 4  year over year to  15 03 million in the quarter  primarily driven by the plum  7 6 billion contract win for the Arctic LNG 2 project Surface Technologies  The company s smallest segment Surface Technologies recorded revenues of  396 6 million  down 1 4  year over year  primarily due to reduced sales in North America  mainly induced by a drop in drilling and completion activities The segment experienced a downfall in its backlog by 5 9  from the year ago level to  428 7 million  Owing to the short cycle nature of the business  orders are generally converted into revenues within a year s time TechnipFMC plc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Dividend  Capex and FinancialsIn the reported quarter  TechnipFMC spent  98 million on capital programs whereas cash flow from operating activities totalled  92 million  As of Sep 30  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  4 504 4 million and a long term debt of  3 608 8 million with a debt to capitalization ratio of 26 06  Revised 2019 GuidanceTechnipFMC has kept revenues and EBITDA margin forecasts for the Subsea and Onshore Offshore segment intact  Meanwhile  it has tweaked projections for Onshore Offshore and Subsea segments The company expects revenues from the Subsea and Onshore Offshore units within  5 6  5 8 billion and  6  6 3 billion  respectively While sales forecasts for the Surface Technologies segment remain unaltered at  1 6  1 7 billion  its EBITDA margin is tweaked to 10  Final ThoughtsWith a massive flow of robust backlog in the Onshore Offshore and Subsea segments  TechnipFMC is at an advantage  These further increases investors  optimism on the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  While the company has been snapping up several contracts and

197473,418989,FTI,Can Onshore Offshore Unit Aid TechnipFMC  FTI  Q2 Earnings  ,opinion,TechnipFMC plc   NYSE FTI   is set to release second quarter 2019 results on Jul 24  after the closing bell  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is a profit of 34 cents on revenues of  3 25 billion In first quarter 2019  the oilfield services provider reported adjusted earnings of 6 cents a share  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents  The underperformance was primarily attributed to lower than expected EBITDA from the Surface Technologies unit  Moreover  the bottom line deteriorated sharply from the year ago period due to lower y y contribution across all its segments  The company s earnings surprise history displays a dismal record  TechnipFMC missed estimates in each of the last four quarters  resulting in average of 62 74  TechnipFMC plc Price and EPS Surprise   However  the trend is expected to be reversed in the to be reported quarter as our proven model predicts that TechnipFMC is likely to beat on earnings this time around Which Way are Top and Bottom Line Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings has been downwardly revised by a penny in the past seven days to 34 cents per share  Nonetheless  it indicates an increase from the year ago reported figure of 28 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  3 250 million  suggesting an improvement from  2 961 million reported in the prior year quarter Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proprietary model shows that TechnipFMC is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to be reported quarter  as it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  5 08   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged two cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents a share  A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise Zacks Rank  TechnipFMC currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  A Zacks Rank  3  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us confident of an earnings beat Conversely  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors at PlayHigher revenues and EBITDA from TechnipFMC s Onshore Offshore segment are expected to drive earnings in the second quarter of 2019  Increasing onshore activities and gradually improving offshore drilling bode well for its upcoming earnings release  Notably  the segment s inbound orders jumped nearly 70  in the last reported quarter  giving a boost to the backlog  which bodes well for revenue and earnings growth of the unit in the to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues and adjusted EBITDA from the Onshore Offshore unit is pegged at  1 500 million and  215 million  higher than the year ago reported figures of  1 342 million and  171 million  respectively  During the last reported quarter  the company upwardly revised 2019 revenue and EBITDA margin forecasts for the unit  raising optimism for the upcoming results Moreover  revenues from the Subsea unit are estimated at  1 366 million  pointing to growth from the year ago reported figure of  1 217 million  However  the company is likely to feel the heat from pricing pressure and weaker EBITDA margins from Subsea and Surface Technologies segments Overall  we expect that the improving results from the Onshore Offshore unit are likely to offset relatively weaker contribution from Subsea and Surface Technologies units  thereby fueling TechnipFMC s second quarter results Other Stocks to ConsiderTechnipFMC is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season  Here are some other companies from energy space  which according to our model also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter Cenovus Energy   TSX CVE   has an Earnings ESP of  13 91  and a Zacks Rank  3  The firm is expected to release

197475,418991,FTI,Factors To Know Ahead Of Forum Energy s  FET  Q2 Earnings,opinion,Forum Energy Technologies  Inc    NYSE FET   is expected to release second quarter 2019 results after the closing bell on Thursday  Jul 25  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 5 cents on revenues of  258 1 million In the preceding three month period  the energy equipment provider beat the consensus mark by 42 9  on successful introduction of new products  operating efficiency and strict cost discipline As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the Houston  TX based company is on an excellent footing  having gone past met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below Forum Energy Technologies  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells can continue winning ways by surpassing earnings estimate this time around too  However  our model indicates that the company might not beat on earnings in the second quarter Let s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results Factors to Consider This QuarterE P Spending Restraint  Clients are taking a more conservative approach on their investment decisions  Per the new paradigm in the energy sector  a disciplined capital expenditure strategy  resulting in free cash flow  is being prioritized over reckless spending beyond operating cash flows  Consequently  major upstream oil companies are now committed to investor returns rather than adding production by outspending cash flows  This has created an extremely challenging operating environment for the service providers as there is not enough incentive to trigger investments in mature field development  exploring unconventional resources  or expanding offshore programs  This slowdown in activity hurts overall demand for services and equipment across the industry spectrum and does not bode well for Forum Energy s upcoming earnings release In particular  near term pressure pumping activity levels  primarily associated with new equipment  are expected to be a major casualty of upstream operators  belt tightening  The company s  Completions  segment is likely to suffer as a result  reflected by management s recent lowering of revenue and EBITDA guidance for this unit   Lower Rig Count  Moreover  during the second quarter of 2019  U S  oil rig count decreased by 23  from 816 to 793  While there is a typical delay of around three four months between oil price changes and its reflection on rig counts  the statistics suggest weakening North American activity in the April June timeframe  Forum Energy  with sizable presence in the region through its  Drilling   Downhole  segment  is expected to suffer on this sentiment Recovery in International Operations  One bright spot in the otherwise gloomy earnings outlook is the recovery in overseas markets  In the last quarter  Forum Energy s international business delivered sequential top line growth of 20   We expect continued revenue growth from activity outside North America on strong demand for coiled tubing products Cost Efficiencies  Forum Energy continues to boost margins by driving down cost and improving efficiency  The company s EBITDA in each of its segments rose sequentially in the first quarter on successful cost reduction efforts  We expect profitability to increase further in the to be reported quarter      Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Forum Energy will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  2 86  Zacks Rank  Forum Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be sure of the positive surprise Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Forum Energy  here are some companies from the  space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter Helix Energy Solutions Group  Inc    NYSE HLX   has an Earnings ESP of  7 61  and a

197476,418992,FTI,FMC Technologies  FTI  Beats Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 39 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 35 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 28 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11 43   A quarter ago  it was expected that this provider of equipment and services to energy companies would post earnings of  0 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 06  delivering a surprise of  80  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
FMC Technologies  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry  posted revenues of  3 43 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 49   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 96 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
FMC Technologies shares have added about 33 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for FMC Technologies 
While FMC Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for FMC Technologies was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 41 on  3 50 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 24 on  13 36 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Field Services is currently in the bottom 24  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fmc-technologies-fti-beats-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200444338,200444338
197477,418993,FTI,TechnipFMC  FTI  Q2 Earnings Top  Backlog Jumps  View Up,opinion,TechnipFMC plc   NYSE FTI   reported stellar results in the second quarter of 2019  surpassing both earnings and sales estimates  The oilfield services provider reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents a share  topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents  The outperformance was attributed to better than expected contribution from all the three segments of the firm  Precisely  adjusted EBITDA from the Onshore Offshore unit totaled  282 million  significantly beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  215 million  Moreover  adjusted EBITDA from Subsea and Surface Technologies came in at  186 2 million and  46 7 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  161 million and  46 51 million  respectively The bottom line was also higher than the year ago earnings of 28 cents a share on the back of robust contribution from the Onshore Offshore segment  Notably  adjusted EBITDA from the Onshore Offshore unit in the reported quarter increased 65  from the year ago figure Second quarter revenues came in at  3 434 2 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 257 million and increasing 16  from the prior year figure of  2 961 million On a further encouraging note  the company booked record inbound orders of  11 2 billion  skyrocketing 164 2  year over year  Markedly  the firm s backlog skyrocketed 73 4  y y to  25 8 billion   TechnipFMC plc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Segmental AnalysisSubsea  The segment s revenues in the quarter under review were  1 508 7 million  24  higher than the year ago figure of  1 217 4 million  With the subsea sector regaining momentum  the company benefited from increasing activities and the achievement of key milestones on projects nearing completion  Consequently  operating profit rose 24 6  from the prior year period to  94 6 million in the quarter under review  However  owing to competitively priced backlog and lower vessel utilization on a year over year basis  adjusted EBITDA declined 2 6  to  186 2 million Markedly  inbound orders in the first half of 2019 came ahead of full year 2018 level on the back of ramped up upstream operations  Inbound orders came in at  2 632 7 million  increasing 73 6  on a year over year basis  primarily driven by Anadarko s Mozambique award  The increased inbound orders boosted the segment s backlog  which totaled  8 747 million  reflecting a rise of 41 6  from the year ago period  Onshore Offshore  This segment generated revenues of  1 505 million  increasing 12 1  from the prior year quarter  Revenues were driven by increased activities on the back of recent awards in downstream  petrochemical and offshore sectors  partly offset by completion of some key projects  especially Yamal LNG  Operating profit from the segment totaled  274 million  increasing 60  from the second quarter 2018 level  backed by strong project execution and milestone bonuses on key projects  Adjusted EBITDA also rose 65  from a year ago to  281 9 million The segment s inbound orders jumped 253 4  year over year to  8 131 2 million in the quarter  primarily driven by the massive  7 6 billion worth of contract for the Arctic LNG 2 project  As such  backlog more than doubled from the prior year period to  16 608 3 million Surface Technologies  The company s smallest segment  Surface Technologies recorded revenues of  420 5 million  up 4 8  y y mainly on higher wellhead equipment sales and fracking rental services  However  unfavorable product mix and decline in completions related activity in North America weighed on its operating profit and adjusted EBITDA  which declined 50 5  and 35 7  y y to  25 5 million and  46 7 million  respectively  The segment s inbound orders came in at  415 7 million compared with  415 3 million in the year ago period  Backlog totaled  426 6 million in the quarter  up 2 7  from the year ago level   Dividend  Capex and FinancialsThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents per share  payable on Sep 4  2019 to its shareholders of record at the close of business as of Aug 30 In the reported quarter  TechnipFMC spent  92 3 million on capital programs  whereas cash flow from operating activities totaled  96 6 million  As of Jun 30  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  4 621 3 million and a long term debt of  3 701 0 million  with a debt to capitalization ratio of 26 4  Revised 2019 GuidanceWhile TechnipFMC has kept revenue and EBITDA margin forecasts for the Surface Technologies segment intact  it has tweaked projections for Onshore Offshore and Subsea segments The company now expects revenues from the Subsea unit within  5 6  5 8 billion  higher than the prior forecast of  5 4  5 7 billion  EBITDA margin forecast is pegged a tad higher at 11 5  than the prior estimate of 11  Sales projections from the Onshore Offshore segment remain unchanged in the band of  6  6 3 billion  Increased EBITDA margin of 16 5  versus prior forecast of 14  brightens prospects Sales and EBITDA margin forecasts from the Surface Technologies segment remain intact at  1 6  1 7 billion and 12   respectively Final ThoughtsWith a massive flow of inbound orders and robust backlog  TechnipFMC has the wind at its back  In addition  raised guidance for Subsea and Onshore Offshore segments further increases investors  optimism for the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  While the firm has been winning several contracts and benefiting from strong project execution  reduced dayrates and stiff competition remain headwinds Meanwhile  some better ranked players from the same  are SEACOR Holdings  Inc    NYSE CKH    Oceaneering International   NYSE OII   and Subsea 7 SA   OTC SUBCY

197484,419000,FTI,FMC Technologies  FTI  Up 5 2  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI   Shares have added about 5 2  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is FMC Technologies due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  TechnipFMC Posts Weak Results in Q4  Backlog Rises Y YTechnipFMC plc came up with unsatisfactory quarterly results on Feb 20  hit by massive impairment and accounting charges of more than  2 billion  leaving investors disappointed  The oilfield services provider swung to fourth quarter 2018 adjusted loss of 9 cents a share  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 37 cents  This negative earnings surprise of 124 32  was primarily attributed to operating loss of  1 7 billion in the firm s subsea segment  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a profit of  92 million  The bottom line also deteriorated sharply from the year ago earnings of 20 cents a share due to high impairment charges related to goodwill and fixed assets incurred in the quarter under review  Fourth quarter revenues came in at  3 323 million  which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 410 million and also decreased 9 8  from the prior year figure of  3 683 million  However  on an encouraging note  TechnipFMC s total backlog at the end of the quarter was  14 560 million  reflecting year over year growth of 12   While quarterly inbound orders marked a decline  full year orders rose 40 2  from the prior year quarter to  14 291 million Segmental Analysis Subsea  The segment s revenues in the quarter under review were  1 233 3 million  reflecting a decrease of 4 6  from the year ago figure of  1 292 2 million  While the company witnessed increased operations in North and South America  as well as Asia Pacific  completed projects in Africa impacted revenues  Markedly  the segment was hit by asset impairment charges of  1 775 6 million in the fourth quarter  resulting in operating loss of  1 739 5 million vis a vis reported income of  67 4 million in the year ago period  Adjusted EBITDAdeclined 39 2  from the year ago period to  148 5 in the quarter under review amid lower revenues and competitively priced backlog  Notably  vessel utilization rate declined to 62  from 65  in the prior year period  Weakness in commodity prices during the fourth quarter resulted in 49  year over year decline in the firm s inbound orders  which came in at  880 6 million  The diminishing inbound orders in turn impacted the segment s backlog  which totaled  5 999 6 million  reflecting a decline of 3 3  from the year ago period  Onshore Offshore  This segment generated revenues of  1 672 4 million  down 17 2  from the prior year quarter  The segment s revenues were negatively impacted by the completion of some key projects  especially Yamal LNG  Operating profit of the segment totaled  206 4 million  down 19 8  from the fourth quarter 2017 level due to lower revenues and margins  Adjusted EBITDA also fell 26 2  from a year ago to  217 2 million  However  the segment did offer some respite as its inbound orders jumped 84 1  year over year to  1 609 4 million in the quarter  As such  backlog also increased 27  from the prior year period to  8 090 5 million  Surface Technologies  The company s smallest segment  Surface Technologies  was the only one to record higher year over year revenues  The unit recorded revenues of  417 3 million  up 12 1  from fourth quarter 2017 figure of  372 3 million  The increase can be primarily attributed to rising momentum in the North American market as well as higher wellhead product sales  However  unfavorable product mix weighed on the company s operating profit and adjusted EBITDA  which declined 27 2  and 14 4 y y to  38 8 million and  64 9 million  respectively  On an encouraging note  the segment s inbound orders in the quarter rose 10 7  year over year to  435 1 million  Consequently  backlog increased to  469 9 million in the quarter from the prior year level of  409 8 million  Dividend   Stock Buyback The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents per share  payable on Apr 3  2019 to its shareholders of record at the close of business as of Mar 19  2019  During the quarter  TechnipFMC bought back  58 4 million shares  completing the  500 million stock buyback program implemented in October 2017  Bringing in some pleasant news for investors  the firm further boosted its repurchase program by  300 million in December 2018  Capex   Balance Sheet In the reported quarter  TechnipFMC spent  112 9 million on capital programs  Full year capex amounted to  368 1 million  As of Dec 31  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  5 540 million and a long term debt of  4 124 3 million  with a debt to capitalization ratio of 28 4   2019 Capex Cut  Sales and EBITDA Margin View Intact TechnipFMC slashed its 2019 capex forecast to  350 million from the prior guidance of  400 million  The company has reiterated its revenue and EBITDA margin forecasts for 2019 TechnipFMC expects subsea  offshore onshore and surface technologies revenues within  5 4  5 7 billion   5 7  6 billion and  1 7  1 8 billion  respectively  Revenue forecast of  12 8  13 5 billion for 2019 versus 2018 sales of  12 5 billion provides a ray of hope  However  respective EBITDA margin guidance of 11   12  and 17  for subsea  offshore onshore and surface technology segments may dent investors  sentiments

197487,419003,FTI,FMC Technologies  FTI  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of equipment and services to energy companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 16 billion  up 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 99  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FMC Technologies 
For FMC Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that FMC Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FMC Technologies would post earnings of  0 37 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 09  delivering a surprise of  124 32  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
FMC Technologies appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fmc-technologies-fti-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200408365,200408365
197488,419004,FTI,TechnipFMC s  FTI  Q1 Earnings Miss  Inbound Orders Jump,opinion,TechnipFMC plc   NYSE FTI   came up with unsatisfactory quarterly results  lagging both earnings and revenue estimates  The oilfield services provider reported first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of 6 cents a share  significantly lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents  The underperformance was primarily attributed to lower than expected EBITDA from the Surface Technologies unit  Precisely  adjusted EBITDA from the segment came in at  30 1 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  61 million by a huge margin The bottom line also deteriorated sharply from the year ago earnings of 28 cents a share due to lower y y contribution across all its segments in the quarter under review  First quarter revenues came in at  2 913 million  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 163 million and decreased 7  from the prior year figure of  3 125 million TechnipFMC plc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   However  on an encouraging note  TechnipFMC s total backlog at the end of the quarter was  17 777 6 million  reflecting year over year growth of 27   This is attributed to uptick in inbound orders  which came in at  6 184 5 million  up 77  from the year ago period Segmental AnalysisSubsea  The segment s revenues in the quarter under review were  1 185 3 million  a tad higher than the year ago figure of  1 180 2 million  However  competitively priced backlog and lower vessel utilization dented the segment s operating profits  which declined 8 3  y y to  50 million  Notably  vessel utilization rate declined to 55  from 60  in the prior year period  Adjusted EBITDA also declined 18 8  from the year ago period to  139 7 in the quarter under review due the above mentioned factors  partly offset by cost cut initiatives On an encouraging note  the segment s inbound orders increased on the back of ramped up upstream operations  attributable to rebounding oil prices  which increased more than 30  in the first quarter   Inbound orders came in at  2 677 6 million  increasing 118  on a year over year basis  The increased inbound orders in turn boosted the segment s backlog  which totaled  7 477 3 million  reflecting a rise of 22 4  from the year ago period  Onshore Offshore  This segment generated revenues of  1 335 1 million  declining 15 1  from the prior year quarter  The reported revenues were negatively impacted by the completion of some key projects  especially Yamal LNG  Operating profit of the segment totaled  155 7 million  decreasing 23 3  from the first quarter 2018 level due to lower revenues and margins  Adjusted EBITDA also fell 9 4  from a year ago to  194 8 million However  the segment brought some respite as its inbound orders jumped 69 7  year over year to  3 138 million in the quarter  As such  backlog also increased 31 7  from the prior year period to  9 862 7 million Surface Technologies  The company s smallest segment  Surface Technologies recorded revenues of  392 6 million  up 5 7  y y on higher demand of pressure control equipment  outside North American markets  However  unfavorable product mix and one time charges associated with new product introduction weighed on its operating profit and adjusted EBITDA  which declined 65 7  and 40 2  y y to  10 5 million and  30 1 million  respectively  Further  the segment s inbound orders declined 10 2  year over year to  368 million  Nonetheless  backlog was  437 6 million in the quarter  up 7  from the year ago period   Dividend  Capex and FinancialsThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents per share  payable on Jun 5  2019 to its shareholders of record at the close of business as of May 21 In the reported quarter  TechnipFMC spent  178 2 million on capital programs  As of Mar 31  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  4 965 3 million and a long term debt of  3 725 million  with a debt to capitalization ratio of 26 4  Revised 2019 GuidanceWhile TechnipFMC has kept revenue and EBITDA margin forecasts for its Subsea segment intact  it has tweaked the projections for Onshore Offshore and Surface Technologies segments The company now expects revenues from the Onshore Offshore segment in the band of  6  6 3 billion versus earlier guided range of  5 7  6 billion  The increased EBITDA margin of 14  versus prior forecast of 12  provides a ray of hope However  sales and EBITDA margin forecasts from the Surface Technologies segment have declined  denting investors  sentiments  It expects revenues within  1 6  1 7 billion versus previous guided range of  1 7  1 8 billion  EBITDA margin is also expected to fall to 12  from the prior forecast of 17   The company expects limited activity growth in North American markets for the remainder of the year  While TechnipFMC expects activities outside North America to improve at a high single digit to low double digit rate in 2019  the firm expects pricing pressure to continue this year   Subsea revenues and EBITDA margin remain unchanged at  5 4  5 7 billion and 11   respectively  Capex budget for 2019 also remains intact at  350 million Final ThoughtsWhile uptick in inbound orders and backlog  along with improved guidance for the Onshore Offshore segment raise optimism about this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  firm  dim prospects of Surface Technologies and Subsea units remain concerns  As it is  most of the upstream companies slashed their 2019 capex amid the crude crash toward the final months of 2018  which translated into lower demand for oilfield services  While oil prices rebounded  the improving energy landscape is not likely to filter down very soon to TechnipFMC  which is struggling with low margins  utilization rates and stiff competition  Meanwhile  investors interested in the same  can opt for some better ranked players like SEACOR Holdings  Inc    NYSE CKH    Archrock  Inc    NYSE AROC   and ProPetro Holding

197489,419005,FTI,RNGR Vs  FTI  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Oil and Gas   Field Services sector have probably already heard of Ranger Energy Services  Inc   RNGR  and FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Ranger Energy Services  Inc  has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while FMC Technologies has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that RNGR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
RNGR currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 24  while FTI has a forward P E of 17 47  We also note that RNGR has a PEG ratio of 1 85  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  FTI currently has a PEG ratio of 2 91 
Another notable valuation metric for RNGR is its P B ratio of 0 59  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  FTI has a P B of 1 02 
These metrics  and several others  help RNGR earn a Value grade of A  while FTI has been given a Value grade of C 
RNGR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that RNGR is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-05-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rngr-vs-fti-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200418761,200418761

Factors at PlayDuring fourth quarter 2018  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude plunged from a multi year high of  76 40 a barrel in early October to below  45 in late December  per the U S  Energy Information Administration  The overall decline in the commodity price will likely be unfavorable for Core Laboratories  as oilfield service businesses are positively correlated with crude price Per its guidance provided during the third quarter earnings release  Core Laboratories expects fourth quarter revenues in the  173  176 million range  While the expectation is almost in line with the year ago level  it represents a sequential fall  Moreover  the demand and pricing for North American oilfield services is expected to to have been weak in the October to December quarter due to pipeline constraints in the prolific Permian Basin and declining well productivity Further  the company is bearing the brunt of muted activities in international and offshore markets  To make things worse  Core Laboratories does not anticipate a recovery in the international markets anytime soon Considering all these factors  we expect Core Laboratories to post lackluster results in the to be reported quarter Earnings WhispersOur proven model also shows that Core Laboratories is unlikely to beat estimates this earnings season  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below    Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 18   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  Core Laboratories currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5 going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Core Laboratories  here are a few energy firms from the same industry that you may want to consider on the basis of our model  These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarterly release CSI Compressco LP   NASDAQ CCLP   has an Earnings ESP of  4 17  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release third quarter earnings on Feb 27  You can see TechnipFMC   NYSE FTI   has an Earnings ESP of  3 79  and holds a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to release third quarter earnings on Feb 20 Unit Corporation   NYSE UNT   has an Earnings ESP of  13 93  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is anticipated to report quarterly numbers on Feb 29 The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/core-laboratories-clb-q4-earnings-disappointment-in-store-200379426,200379426
197501,419017,FTI,What s In Store For Marathon Petroleum s  MPC  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Marathon Petroleum   NYSE MPC   is expected to release fourth quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Feb 7 In the preceding three month period  the independent oil refiner and marketer beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 19  on rising income from its midstream division As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the Findlay  OH based downstream operator is on a firm footing  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the company can continue winning ways by surpassing earnings estimates this time around as well The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is a profit of  1 98 per share on revenues of  33 1 billion  However  earnings estimates have moved south by more than 73  over the past 30 days  Nonetheless  the top and bottom line estimates reflect year over year improvement of 56  and 88 6   respectively Let s take a look at the factors that are likely to shape Marathon Petroleum s fourth quarter earnings Factors at PlayNarrowing crack spreads along with lower refined products sales and throughput volumes are likely to impact the performance of the Refining   Marketing segment   the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings  Per the company  the crack  or the margin for making petroleum products from crude  in fourth quarter 2018 was  4 32 a barrel  down from  7 17 a year ago  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for refined products sales volumes is pegged at 2 327 thousand barrels per day  mbpd   reflecting a decline from 2 414 mbpd a year ago  Further  the throughput is expected to decrease around 3  on a year over year basis to 1 967 mbpd  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the refining segment s bottom line stands at  679 million  lower than the year ago operating income of  732 million However  Marathon Petroleum s Speedway  or Retail  division is expected to benefit from higher year over year margins and sales  Notably  merchandise sales are expected at  1 222 million versus  1 200 million in the fourth quarter of 2017  Further  merchandise margins are pegged at  348 million compared with  337 million in the year ago quarter  Markedly  the number of convenience stores at the end of the quarter totaled 2 783 vis a vis 2 744 a year ago  As such  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly income from operations is  287 million  way higher than  149 million reported in the year ago level and also ahead of  161 million in the last reported quarter Also  midstream segment profitability is expected to reach  832 million  up significantly from  343 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 While the company is likely to feel the heat of lower refining margins and reduced refined product sales  improved midstream and retail earnings are likely to aid overall results What Does Our Model Say Our proven model does not conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to be reported quarter  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate Estimate stand at  1 98 Zacks Rank  Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of a positive surprise Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Petroleum  here are some firms from the energy space

197502,419018,FTI,FMC Technologies  FTI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of equipment and services to energy companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  85  
Revenues are expected to be  3 40 billion  down 7 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 07  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FMC Technologies 
For FMC Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 32  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FMC Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FMC Technologies would post earnings of  0 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 31  delivering a surprise of  18 42  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

FMC Technologies  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry  posted revenues of  3 32 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 54   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 68 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters

FMC Technologies shares have added about 22 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 10 9  
What s Next for FMC Technologies 
While FMC Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for FMC Technologies was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

197505,419021,FTI,TechnipFMC  FTI  Posts Q4 Loss On Impairment Cost  Cuts Capex,opinion,TechnipFMC plc   NYSE FTI   came up with unsatisfactory quarterly results on Feb 20  hit by massive impairment and accounting charges of more than  2 billion  leaving investors disappointed  The oilfield services provider swung to fourth quarter 2018 adjusted loss of 9 cents a share  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 37 cents  This negative earnings surprise of 124 32  was primarily attributed to operating loss of  1 7 billion in the firm s subsea segment  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a profit of  92 million  The bottom line also deteriorated sharply from the year ago earnings of 20 cents a share due to high impairment charges related to goodwill and fixed assets incurred in the quarter under review   Owing to the dismal quarterly results  TechnipFMC ended 2018 in the red territory  incurring net loss of  1 921 6 million against reported income of  113 million in 2017  Fourth quarter revenues came in at  3 323 million  which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 410 million and also decreased 9 8  from the prior year figure of  3 683 million  However  on an encouraging note  TechnipFMC s total backlog at the end of the quarter was  14 560 million  reflecting year over year growth of 12   While quarterly inbound orders marked a decline  full year orders rose 40 2  from the prior year quarter to  14 291 million TechnipFMC plc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Segmental Analysis Subsea  The segment s revenues in the quarter under review were  1 233 3 million  reflecting a decrease of 4 6  from the year ago figure of  1 292 2 million  While the company witnessed increased operations in North and South America  as well as Asia Pacific  completed projects in Africa impacted revenues   Markedly  the segment was hit by asset impairment charges of  1 775 6 million in the fourth quarter  resulting in operating loss of  1 739 5 million vis a vis reported income of  67 4 million in the year ago period  Adjusted EBITDAdeclined 39 2  from the year ago period to  148 5 in the quarter under review amid lower revenues and competitively priced backlog  Notably  vessel utilization rate declined to 62  from 65  in the prior year period  Weakness in commodity prices during the fourth quarter resulted in 49  year over year decline in the firm s inbound orders  which came in at  880 6 million  The diminishing inbound orders in turn impacted the segment s backlog  which totaled  5 999 6 million  reflecting a decline of 3 3  from the year ago period   Onshore Offshore  This segment generated revenues of  1 672 4 million  down 17 2  from the prior year quarter  The segment s revenues were negatively impacted by the completion of some key projects  especially Yamal LNG  Operating profit of the segment totaled  206 4 million  down 19 8  from the fourth quarter 2017 level due to lower revenues and margins  Adjusted EBITDA also fell 26 2  from a year ago to  217 2 million  However  the segment did offer some respite as its inbound orders jumped 84 1  year over year to  1 609 4 million in the quarter  As such  backlog also increased 27  from the prior year period to  8 090 5 million  Surface Technologies  The company s smallest segment  Surface Technologies  was the only one to record higher year over year revenues  The unit recorded revenues of  417 3 million  up 12 1  from fourth quarter 2017 figure of  372 3 million  The increase can be primarily attributed to rising momentum in the North American market as well as higher wellhead product sales  However  unfavorable product mix weighed on the company s operating profit and adjusted EBITDA  which declined 27 2  and 14 4 y y to  38 8 million and  64 9 million  respectively   On an encouraging note  the segment s inbound orders in the quarter rose 10 7  year over year to  435 1 million  Consequently  backlog increased to  469 9 million in the quarter from the prior year level of  409 8 million  Dividend   Stock Buyback The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents per share  payable on Apr 3  2019 to its shareholders of record at the close of business as of Mar 19  2019  During the quarter  TechnipFMC bought back  58 4 million shares  completing the  500 million stock buyback program implemented in October 2017  Bringing in some pleasant news for investors  the firm further boosted its repurchase program by  300 million in December 2018  Capex   Balance Sheet In the reported quarter  TechnipFMC spent  112 9 million on capital programs  Full year capex amounted to  368 1 million   As of Dec 31  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  5 540 million and a long term debt of  4 124 3 million  with a debt to capitalization ratio of 28 4   2019 Capex Cut  Sales and EBITDA Margin View Intact TechnipFMC slashed its 2019 capex forecast to  350 million from the prior guidance of  400 million   The company has reiterated its revenue and EBITDA margin forecasts for 2019 TechnipFMC expects subsea  offshore onshore and surface technologies revenues within  5 4  5 7 billion   5 7  6 billion and  1 7  1 8 billion  respectively  Revenue forecast of  12 8  13 5 billion for 2019 versus 2018 sales of  12 5 billion provides a ray of hope  However  respective EBITDA margin guidance of 11   12  and 17  for subsea  offshore onshore and surface technology segments may dent investors  sentiments  Final Thoughts While the company s acceleration in share buyback  higher y y revenue forecast and strong backlog raise optimism about this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  firm  its shareholders are still advised to exercise caution  especially amid low EBITDA margin guidance  As it is  growing volatility in the oil market has forced the company to downwardly revise its capex  Even if the energy landscape rebounds  it is not likely to filter down very soon to oilfield services companies  which are struggling with low margins  utilization rates along with competitively priced backlog amid stiff competition   Meanwhile  investors interested in the energy space may opt for some better ranked players in the energy space that include Repsol  MC REP  SA   OTC REPYY    Jones Energy  Inc    OTC JONE   and YPF Sociedad Anonima   NYSE YPF    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can

197512,419028,FTI,TechnipFMC  FTI  Down 10  Over A Month  Can It Turnaround ,opinion,Despite crude being on an upward trajectory for most part of 2018 and shale producers reaping profits  the picture for oilfield services players has not been rosy  One such offshore and land based drilling services provider TechnipFMC plc   NYSE FTI   has been in the red territory for quite some time now The company s stock price movement has not been quite impressive  with its shares declining almost 10  over the past month With oil prices dipping into bear market territory of late  the oilfield services industry has been badly hit  Further  weaker than expected results in the third quarter have dented investors  sentiments  Lower than anticipated profits from its subsea and surface technologies segment resulted in weaker results  In fact  the company has been delivering weaker than expected earnings over the trailing four quarters What s Weighing on the Stock TechnipFMC s subsea segment  which was once the company s largest and fastest growing unit  is facing pressure on revenues and margins due to volatile pricing scenario and competitively priced backlog  In the last reported quarter  Subsea revenues and operating profit dipped 18 2  and 22 5   respectively  Moreover  decline in margins and most of its key projects  in Africa  Europe and the Asia Pacific  nearing completion hit the segment hard  Also  lower vessel utilization and stiff competition reduced the company s pricing power It has also been facing top line pressure  both in the offshore and onshore segment  as revenues recorded a year over year decline of 34  in the last reported quarter  Unfortunately  TechnipFMC s best performing segment  Surface Technologies  is its smallest unit  accounting for just around 12 7  of the company s revenues  It forecasts EBITDA margin from this segment to drop to 16  from the prior guidance of 17 5   due to a reduction in overall activity in North America TechnipFMC also does not fare well in the cash flow parameter  which is a key metric to measure the financial health of a company  Notably  it has been posting negative free cash flow over the last four quarters  In the nine months ended Sep 30  TechnipFMC s free cash flow came in at negative  344 7 million Silver LiningNotably  the last reported quarter witnessed a major uptick in inbound orders  indicating promising prospects for the company  Notably  all the three segments witnessed gains in backlog and order activities  The inbound orders in the quarter under review came in at  3 6 billion  reflecting a 48  year over year increase  In fact  the inbound orders also surpassed sales  brightening prospects for future revenue growth of the company  Importantly  its backlog stands at  15 2 billion  reflecting a steady demand from customers  On a further encouraging note  it increased its full year revenue forecast to around  13 billion  up from the prior guidance of nearly  12 3 billion  on the back of improved outlook for the onshore offshore business The company also boasts a strong balance sheet  with long term debt to capitalization ratio of 23 8   lower than industry s average of 29 2   which provides it with ample flexibility to tap on growth opportunities  The company has also initiated dividend payments and share repurchase programs  which have boosted the confidence of investors  It remains committed to repurchase up to  500 million of common shares by the end of this year Bottom LineWhile the company s guidance and backlog raise optimism about this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  firm  we are not certain if the company can turnaround very soon  Even with the spike in oil prices  the improving landscape is not likely to filter down to oilfield services soon  as the upstream players are benefiting from discounted dayrates  We do appreciate the operational efficiency of TechnipFMC  along with its encouraging inbound orders and revenue forecast  However  increasing pressure from Trump to avoid production curb may push crude prices lower  which may spell further trouble for oilfield services companies like TechnipFMC Stocks That Warrant a LookInvestors

197535,419051,FTI,TechnipFMC  FTI  Down 5  Since Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for TechnipFMC plc   NYSE FTI    Shares have lost about 5  in that time frame 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is FTI due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts First Quarter 2018 ResultsTechnipFMC reported first quarter 2018 earnings on a diluted basis  excluding one time items  of 28 cents a share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents  The weaker than expected results can be primarily attributed to lower than anticipated operating profit in its Subsea segment  Precisely  the operating income in its Subsea segment amounted to  54 4 million  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  80 million However  the bottom line was higher than the year ago adjusted earnings of 26 cents a share on higher year over year profits  mainly in its Surface Technologies and Onshore Offshore segments Revenues in the first quarter came in at  3 125 2 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 110 million  However  revenues in the quarter under review decreased 7 7  from the prior year figure of  3 388 million Segmental AnalysisSubsea  The segment s revenues in the first quarter were  1 180 2 million  reflecting a decrease of 14 3  from the year ago figure of  1 376 7 million  Reduced project activities in Africa resulted in the weaker results  However  operating profit came in at  54 4 million  up 0 4  year over year due to synergistic benefits of the merger between Technip  PA FTI  S A  and FMC Technologies  completed last January Onshore Offshore  This segment generated revenues of  1 573 4 million  down 10 8  from the prior year quarter  Revenues declined due to the completion of some key projects including Yamal LNG project  partly offset by increased activities in the Middle East  Europe and Asia Pacific regions  However  operating income rose to  202 9 million versus  142 8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017 on strong project execution Surface Technologies  The segment s revenues in the first quarter were  371 6 million  up 49 6  from first quarter 2017 figure of  248 4 million  The increase is primarily attributed to the rising momentum in the North American market and increased demand for hydraulic fracturing  Further  higher global activity levels and rebounding prices in North America helped the company report operating profit of  30 6 million against operating loss of  18 6 million incurred a year ago BacklogAs of Mar 31  2018  TechnipFMC s total backlog was  14 012 million compared with  16 056 2 million a year ago  reflecting a decline of 12 7   Of this  backlog for Onshore Offshore was  7 491 6 million  while Subsea and Surface Technologies backlogs were  6 110 9 million and  409 5 million  respectively Capex   Balance SheetIn the reported quarter  TechnipFMC spent  53 2 million on capital programs  As of Mar 31  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  6 220 6 million and long term debt of  3 735 8 million  with a debt to capitalization ratio of 22  DividendThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents per share  payable on Jun 6  2018 to its shareholders of record as of May 22  2018 GuidanceTechnipFMC projects revenues for Onshore Offshore segment to be within the range of  5 3  5 7 billion in 2018  with an EBITDA margin of 11 5   up from the prior guidance of 10 5   The Surface Technologies segment is expected to generate revenues between  1 5 billion and  1 6 billion  with EBITDA margin of 17 5   The company estimates its subsea revenues to lie within  5  5 3 billion  with EBITDA margin of 14   Capex for 2018 is estimated to be around  300 million

    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Consider Though oil prices have recovered from their historical lows  it still lingers around  50 per barrel  which is far below the breakeven price for many oil and gas firms  As a result  top energy companies continue to reduce spending and equipment suppliers like TechnipFMC struggle to protect its backlog amid the volatile price environment  For the third quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total backlog order is pegged at  14 033 million as against  15 183 million reported in the prior quarter  The backlog for subsea technologies is anticipated at  1 080 million as against  1 773 million reported in second quarter 2017 The company s subsea revenues and margins are also expected to decline  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the revenues of the subsea segment is pegged at  1 612 million  lower than the  1 730 million recorded in the prior quarter  Operating profit for the energy infrastructure segment is expected to decline to  142 million compared with the preceding three month period reported figure of  177 million The company has already cautioned that 2017 would be difficult year with order growth set to remain weak  All these factors account for our bleak earnings outlook for the company in third quarter 2017 Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TechnipFMC is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is 0 00   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  TechnipFMC presently carries a Zacks Rank  4 Sell   Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Unit Corporation   NYSE UNT   has an Earnings ESP of  29 17  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is likely to release third quarter earnings on Nov 3 RPC  Inc    NYSE RES   has an Earnings ESP of  4 89  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is expected to release third quarter earnings on Oct 25  You can see Newpark Resources  Inc    NYSE NR   has an Earnings ESP of  33 33  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is slated to release third quarter earnings on Oct 30 Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2017-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-technipfmc-fti-disappoint-investors-in-q3-earnings-200220455,200220455

197597,419113,FTI,FMC Technologies  FTI  Q2 Earnings Hit By Low Rig Count ,opinion,"Oilfield equipment manufacturer FMC Technologies Inc  NYSE FTI   reported weak second quarter 2016 results  A stronger U S  dollar  record low rig counts in North America along with reduced land activity in the continent was primarily behind the downfall 
	The Houston  TX based company posted adjusted diluted earnings per share of 22 cents  which plummeted almost 58  from the year earlier adjusted figure of 52 cents  The bottom line also came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents 







	FMC Technologies reported revenues of  1 150 3 million  down 32  from  1 695 2 million generated in second quarter 2015  The top line also failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 260 million   Segmental Analysis
Subsea Technologies  Revenues were  854 2 million  down 31  from the second quarter of 2015  This was primarily due to the effect of a stronger U S  dollar

	So much so that the segment incurred operating loss of  21 7 million against a profit  27 5 million in the year ago comparable quarter Energy Infrastructure  Revenues for the April to June period came in at  85 1 million  16  lower than second quarter 2015  This was owing to reduced land activity in North America 
	Operating profit for the segment increased to  7 8 million from  5 3 million in the year earlier quarter Backlog
	As of Jun 30  2016  FMC Technologies reported a total backlog  including inter company eliminations  of  3 386 9 million  significantly below the prior year quarter level of  5 323 8 million  Out of this  backlog for Subsea Technologies was  2 898 8 million  while Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructure backlog was  357 million and  133 2 million  respectively           Balance Sheet

197612,419128,FTI,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  FMC Technologies  Technip SA  Baker Hughes  Schlumberger And Halliburton,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 20  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include FMC Technologies Inc  NYSE FTI       Technip  PA TECF  SA     Baker Hughes Inc      Schlumberger Ltd     and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co     
	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

More M A in the Oil Patch  FMC  Technip Combine

	Oilfield service players FMC Technologies Inc     and Technip SA    are merging in an all stock deal of equal proportions  in a sign that consolidation is picking up in the energy space  The tie up   which should close early next year   would combine Houston based FMC Technologies  a major underwater energy equipment maker  with Paris based Technip  an offshore oil and gas field developer 

	The merged organization will do business as TechnipFMC  stock symbol not stated   Based on May 18 closing prices  the joined company will be worth  13 billion boasting of 2015 pro forma revenue of  20 billion  EBITDA of  2 4 billion and total order backlog   as of Mar 31  2016   of  20 billion 

	In 2015  the two companies  both carrying Zacks Rank  3  Hold   entered into an agreement to form a 50 50 joint venture  Forsys Subsea  aimed at offering complete packages for subsea oilfield exploration at a reduced cost 

Low Oil Driving Sector Consolidation

	Oil s horror show has seen black gold s price come down from some  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  45 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb  The commodity s collapse has threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins 

	Oilfield services companies have been some of the hardest hit by diving commodity prices as top energy companies have resorted to spending cuts  particularly on the costly upstream projects  owing to lower profit margins  This  in turn  means cancellation or contract renegotiation for equipment suppliers like FMC Technologies and Technip  In fact  the latter s stock has fallen about 20  in the past year  while FMC Technologies is down 30  

	In these trying circumstances  merger and acquisition deals have helped service providers to cut their average costs and benefit from mutual technical expertise exchange 

Terms of the Deal

	Under the terms of the transaction  Technip shareholders will receive two shares in the new business for each share they hold  while each FMC Technologies share will be converted into one share of TechnipFMC  Post merger  Technip investors will own around 50  of the combined firm while FMC Technologies shareholders will own the remaining half 

	The combined company will maintain dual headquarters in Houston and Paris  FMC Technologies  President and CEO Doug Pferdehirt will head the management team of TechnipFMC as CEO  Technip CEO Thierry Pilenko will be Executive Chairman 

Benefits

	The combination of Technip and FMC Technologies  two of the best known names in oilfield services  will create an energy technology powerhouse with revenue more than Baker Hughes Inc     and the might to take on the top dogs in the oilfield services group   Schlumberger Ltd     and Halliburton Co     

	Uniting the complementary skills and capabilities of both firms  TechnipFMC is also expected to realize at least  400 million per year in pretax cost savings by the end of year three with impressive growth rates across the board   subsea  surface and onshore offshore
