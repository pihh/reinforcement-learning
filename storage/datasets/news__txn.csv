190402,411918,TXN,Texas Instruments Earnings  This Weather Vane Points to Sunnier Skies,news,"Semiconductor giant Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  reported results on Tuesday night  The report  which covered the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2019  delivered sales and earnings slightly above analyst expectations  Management also took this opportunity to sketch out some early signs it s seeing of an upcoming market recovery 
Texas Instruments  fourth quarter results by the numbers

Data source  Texas Instruments  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
TI s guidance for this quarter called for earnings near  1 per share on revenues in the neighborhood of  3 2 billion  On the other hand  those guidance targets were far below the Street s consensus projections at the time  Let s call this a mixed report 
There s a rebound in the cards
CEO Rich Templeton s descriptions of TI s last three earnings reports tell an optimistic story all by themselves 

Six months ago  Templeton saw widespread damage to the company s target markets   Revenue decreased 9  from the same quarter a year ago due to broad based weakness   he said 
Three months ago  the global markets continued to crumble   Revenue decreased 11  from the same quarter a year ago  as most markets weakened further   Templeton said 
It s a much more optimistic story this time   Revenue decreased 10  from the same quarter a year ago as most markets showed signs of stabilizing   the CEO declared 

The revenue drops aren t dramatically different  and the second quarter report s  broad based weakness  triggered a lighter top line decline than this quarter s  signs of stabilizing   Then again  the headline numbers never tell the whole story  Templeton didn t read  stabilization  in the revenue collection tea leaves but in a less photogenic metric 

May I take your orders 
We re talking about incoming orders  The vast majority of TI s business takes place under chip supply contracts of various types and lengths  The company takes in a new order  clears some space in its internal or external manufacturing processes to handle the new orders  then ships the chip against a revenue collecting invoice when the manufacturing process has run its course  There s a lag time within that order to revenue pipeline  usually about a few months 
That s why order flows typically show signs of whatever trend break is coming up next a quarter or two before the same effects start making a difference to the revenue tallies 
That was indeed the story this time  too 
 The stabilization is reflected in the order patterns  the demands that we see through consignment  and actually the results themselves   said the head of investor relations  Dave Pahl  in TI s fourth quarter earnings call   So we went from the third quarter  where those markets were declining high single digits  8   9   some of them at 10   so all those markets were declining at 3   4   So those numbers suggest that there is a bottoming process  
Meet the new normal  same as the old normal
Pahl suggested that many of TI s larger customers had built up excess component inventories in 2017 and 2018  slowing down their new orders as those stockpiles were depleted in 2019  The China U S  trade war arguably slowed down the entire process  stretching the inventory overload a couple of quarters beyond a typical stockpile correction 
 This suggests that demand this year will be more a function of our customers  end demand and therefore the macroeconomy  which may continue to be uncertain   Pahl said 
So TI has shifted away from artificial market pressure and into a healthier shipping pattern  but it won t be all red wine and roses until the international trade wars and other macroeconomic quirks have ended  It s an improvement but hardly a hockey stick growth trigger for TI s incoming order and revenue flows 
Is TI a buy today  based on these results 
Texas Instruments  stock barely moved on this report  but share prices have now climbed 41  higher from a 52 week perspective  The stock is trading at a somewhat frothy 26 times trailing earnings  suggesting that bullish investors already priced a gradual recovery into TI s market value 
So I wouldn t exactly bet the farm on TI shares at this point  even though the company just told us that the semiconductor market as a whole is starting to look normal again  Just stick that knowledge in your back pocket as a point of reference when you re looking at other chipmaking giants reporting their results during this earnings season ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmezo,2067150

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day and welcome to the Texas Instruments  Fourth Quarter 2019 and 2019 Year End Earnings Release Conference Call  Today s conference is being recorded  At this time  I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl  Please go ahead  sir Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsGood afternoon  and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2019 earnings conference call Rafael Lizardi  TI s Chief Financial Officer  is with me today  For any of you who missed the release  you can find it on our website at   This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website  A replay will be available through the web This call will include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI s results to differ materially from management s current expectations  We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description First  let me provide some information that s important for your calendars  We plan to hold a call to review our capital management strategy on February 4 at 10 00 AM Central Time  Similar to what we ve done in the past  Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy For today s call  let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing  I ll be covering the following topics  first  a high level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter  second  I ll provide some comments about what we re seeing with added insight by segment and end market and explain why we would characterize the market as showing signs of stabilizing  and finally  since this is the end of the calendar year  I ll provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2019  Rafael will then review profitability  capital management results and then the outlook  after which we ll open the call for Q A Starting with a high level summary of the fourth quarter financial results Revenue was  3 35 billion  a decrease of 10  from a year ago  and EPS was  1 12 per share  including a  0 01 benefit not in our original guidance  Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance  with the relative strength across all markets  At the Company level  our year on year decline abated slightly from 11  in the third quarter to 10  in the fourth quarter  While this is only a marginal improvement  all end markets reduced their rate of decline substantially with the exception of communications equipment where the year over year decline increased about as expected given the strength in this end market in the year ago quarter In fourth quarter 2019 Analog revenue declined 5  and Embedded Processing revenue declined 20  compared with the same quarter a year ago  Analog s year on year rate of decline went from 8  in the third quarter to 5  in the fourth quarter  and Embedded s decline slightly increased from 19  to 20  over the same period When we look at the market since 90 days ago  we moved from the third quarter where customers were increasingly cautious to the fourth quarter where results and behavior throughout the quarter reflected what we believe is best described is demand stabilizing  Based on history  this would imply that customer and channel inventory that built up during 2017 and  18 would now mostly be depleted  This suggests that demand this year will be more a function of our customers  end demand and therefore the macro economy  which may continue to be uncertain Moving on  I ll now provide some details on the fourth quarter by segment and end market  From the year ago quarter  Analog revenue declined 5  due to declines in signal chain  high volume and power  Embedded Processing revenue declined 20  from the year ago quarter  primarily due to processors  Connected microcontrollers also declined  Our Other segment declined 24  from the year ago quarter For the year in total  Analog declined 5  and Embedded declined 17   Analog and Embedded combined were 92  of revenue From an end market perspective  in the fourth quarter all markets declined year on year 3  to 4  with the exception of communications equipment  Communications equipment declined about 50  from the year ago quarter  about as expected  as all major customers  geographies and technologies declined Next  as we do at the end of each calendar year  I ll describe our revenue by end market for 2019  We break this into six categories  industrial  automotive  personal electronics  which includes products such as mobile phones  PCs  tablets and TVs  communications equipment  enterprise systems  and other  which is primarily calculators  As a percentage of revenue for the year  industrial was 36   automotive  21   personal electronics  23   communications equipment  11   enterprise systems  6   and other was 3  Looking at the changes versus 2018  automotive increased by 1 percentage point  enterprise systems decreased by 1 percentage point and the remaining markets were unchanged  In 2019  industrial and automotive combined made up 57  of TI s revenue  up 1 percentage point from last year and up from 42  in 2013  We ve established momentum in these markets and we see great opportunity ahead Next  one of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity  which can be measured in multiple dimensions  From a diversity perspective  we have over 100 000 customers and tens of thousands of devices  In 2019  almost two thirds of our revenue came from customers who bought  100 million or less of our products  In 2019 our top 10 devices represented about 5  of our revenue and the top 100th  Phonetic  device was less than 0 1  of our revenue  From a longevity perspective  over 40  of our revenue came from devices that we ve been producing for at least 10 years  Our investments are directed to continue to diversify our growth across products  markets and customers  strengthening this competitive advantage Next  we are announcing today that we will be closing our last two 6 inch or 150 millimeter wafer fabs  which are both more than 50 years old  This will be a multi year plan and is expected to be completed no earlier than 2023 and no later than 2025  There are no charges in this quarter s results and we ll keep you updated as needed in the future  Separately  our plans to build our next 300 millimeter factory in Richardson  Texas  are under way with dirt moving and cranes on site  We expect the building shell to be complete by the end of 2021 and ready to install tools when needed to meet market demand  which will allow us to continue to support growth and strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage So to wrap up  we remain focused on Analog and Embedded  the best products  We remain focused on the industrial and automotive markets  the best markets since they will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity  All of this translates to high terminal value of our portfolio Rafael will now review profitability  capital management and our outlook Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsThanks  Dave  and good afternoon  everyone Gross profit in the quarter was  2 1 billion or 63  of revenue  From a year ago gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue  Gross profit margin decreased 220 basis points Operating expenses in the quarter were  798 million  down 2  from a year ago and about as expected  On a trailing 12 month basis operating expenses were 22  of revenue  For the year  we have invested  1 5 billion in R D  an important element of our capital allocation  We re pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R D  which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term  Acquisition charges and non cash expense were  50 million  Acquisition charges will remain at about  50 million through the third quarter of 2021 Operating profit was  1 2 billion or 37  of revenue  Operating profit was down 18  from the year ago quarter  Operating margin for Analog was 42   down from 47  a year ago  and for Embedded Processing was 25   down from 30  a year ago  Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time Other income and  Technical Issues  net income in the fourth quarter was  1 1 billion or  1 12 per share  which included a  0 01 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook that we had discussed Let me now comment on our capital management results  starting with our cash generation  Cash flow from operations was  1 8 billion in the quarter  Capital expenditures were  163 million in the quarter  Free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis was  5 8 billion  down 4  from a year ago  In the quarter we paid  841 million in dividends  an increase of 17  per share  marking our 16th year of dividend increases  We repurchased  489 million of our stock for a total return to owners of  1 3 billion  In total  we have returned  6 billion in the past 12 months  consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow to our owners  Over the same period  our dividends represented 52  of free cash flow  underscoring their sustainability Our balance sheet remains strong  with  5 4 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the fourth quarter  Total debt was  5 8 billion  with a weighted average coupon of 2 99   Inventory days were 144  down 8 days from a year ago and up 5 days sequentially  We are pleased with our inventory and it is positioned to support growth Now let s look at some of these results for the year  In 2019 cash flow from operations was  6 6 billion  Capital expenditures were  847 million or 6  of revenue  Free cash flow for 2019 was  5 8 billion or 40  of revenue  Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model  As we have said  we believe free cash flow growth  especially on a per share basis  is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it s productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders We remain committed to return all free cash flow to owners  Over the last 12 months  we ve paid  3 billion in dividends and  3 billion of our own shares  reducing outstanding share count by 1 4  in 2019 and by 46  since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count Turning to our outlook for the first quarter  We expect TI revenue in the range of  3 12 billion to  3 38 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of  0 96 to  1 14 which includes an estimated  20 million discrete tax benefit  We continue to expect our 2020 annual operating tax rate to be about 15   Additional details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data In closing  as Dave mentioned  we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term  We continue to invest in our competitive advantages  which are manufacturing and technology  portfolio breadth  market reach and diverse and long lived products  We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products  Analog and Embedded Processing  and the best markets  industrial and automotive  which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term With that  let me turn it back to Dave Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsThanks  Rafael Operator  you can now open the lines for questions  In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question  please limit yourself to a single question  After our response we ll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up  Operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  We ll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  guys  congratulations on the solid results  I guess  Dave and Rafael  just relative to the March quarter guidance  at the midpoint you re guiding down about 3  sequentially  which is in line with kind of historic seasonality for the March quarter  But typically off the bottom of the cycle you can get some above seasonal on it  At the midpoint  the year over year is just modestly getting better from December to March  So I m just wondering what if there is anything specific in the March quarter as to why it s not a little bit better than seasonal and  specifically  anything around distribution strategy that might be a headwind in Q1  And then I have a follow up Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsYeah  John  I ll take that and Rafael can add if he d like  So the answer to the last part of that question  there is nothing in the sequential guidance that would suggest there is any headwinds from distribution  We ve talked about before that we would expect  as we make the transition in distribution it will look similar from a revenue headwind  as we ve seen with consignment  So there will be some there  but we ve already got some of the headwinds from the transitions that we ve made in consignment And I think the second part is  as we re seeing those signs of stabilization    and we talked about that history would suggest that the growth is going to reflect the end demand of the customers and therefore the macro economy  So as we go through the year  that s what will be the driving force overall Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsYeah  The only other thing I would add is  as Dave mentioned during the prepared remarks  comms equipment was down year on year significantly as there was a tough compare a year ago  Well  1Q  20 is going to have an even tougher compare on comms equipment if you recall what was going on in 1Q  19 on that front Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsIt was growing pretty significant year on year  Okay  Johnny  any follow on John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    AnalystYeah  And then my second question is just around the Embedded business  I know that the SIA MCU data is not necessarily the best proxy for that business  But when you kind of compare year results to that data  up until this most recent correction  you guys were sort of consistently outgrowing the SIA MCU data Your embedded business has now gone through five or six quarters of kind of under growing  and I m just wondering if you could help us talk through maybe potential share loss  And I know you talked about CPU specifically being weak within Embedded  Is that specific to an end market like comms  Or how do we think about that Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsYeah  So first  John  I think you re putting in a good context  And as you ve stated  we believe share changes just need to be judged over long periods of time  And so if you look at revenue performance of Embedded over the last several years  we ve had that significant outperformance  as you pointed out  in  17 and  18  Last year  we probably gave some of that back So  I d just point out that in the most recent quarter at the TI level  so Analog and Embedded  we saw those signs of stabilization but in every market  so behaving similarly except communications equipment  So thank you  John  and we ll go to the next caller  please OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi guys  thanks for letting me ask the question  Trying to get to the trajectory and maybe the stabilization in turn  Dave  I know you said it was pretty broad based in how you upsided the fourth quarter of last year  But can you give us what the sequential changes were by the end markets  I know you give the year over year typically  but if you could give that for the fourth quarter  that would be helpful Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsYeah  certainly  Ross  So these are all sequential compares  Industrial declined mid single digits  automotive was about even  personal electronics declined high single digits  comms equipment declined about 20   and enterprise systems grew in the low single digits  You have a follow on  Ross Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  I just wanted to think about the    you talked about shutting down the two 6 inch fabs  You told us about starting up the 300 millimeter  So maybe a two parter  if I may  Can you talk about the utilization plans in the first quarter  And how do we think about capex  I know you said you re moving dirt  and you have cranes there  but out of that  600 million or  700 million cost that you ve set for the new 300 millimeter fab  how does that hold then in 2020 Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsYeah  So Ross  you asked a bunch of questions there  Let me see if I    I ll answer the ones I remember  So first let me emphasize  Yes  we re closing our two fabs that still have some 150 millimeter equipment  And they are over 50 years old and they ll be closed by as early as 2023 or as late as 2025  somewhere in that time frame  We have about  1 5 billion of revenue that run through those factories  And of course  we re moving most of that revenue  virtually all to 300 millimeter  So it s a significant cost advantage  as we have talked about over the years The new factory    so let me talk about the new factory  Yeah  we ve got dirt moving  cranes are there  plans are under way  We should have the building finished by the end of 2021  and at that point we can put equipment as needed to support demand From a capex standpoint  you want to model that at 6  of revenue  We just finished 2019 with capex of 6  of revenue and you should model that going forward at about that same level Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsOkay  Thank you  Ross  And we ll go to the next caller  please OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Chris Danely  Citigroup Chris Danely    Citigroup    AnalystHey  thanks  guys  I m going to put the hindsighted 2020 theory to the test here  So  now that we ve kind of gone through this dip and recovery  maybe just talk about why you think your sales and bookings fell off so sharply in the late summer and then why are the customers a little more    I guess  a little more optimistic right now  And then do you feel better about your business now versus  let s call it  six months ago over the summer Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsOkay  Well  I ll start off and  Rafael  if you want to add anything  I think  as we go through any cycle  they re all similar in a lot of ways and different in others  And to put it in context  you d have to go back to third quarter of  18  Running up to that  we had 10 quarters of year on year growth  So  you never know as you re going through that  are you going to have 10 or 12 or 14 quarters of year on year growth  But you expect at some point that the industry will run below  And so  as we started that  we thought what we were seeing was mostly an inventory    industry  rather    correction as we re working through that  Certainly  trade tensions probably elongated that cycle and part of the reasons why we saw that other letdown later last year So  can you remind me the second part    oh  do we feel better about the business  I think that strategically we felt that we continue to stay focused on improving our four competitive advantages  We haven t slowed down investments and we talk about our fabs under way  If you look at the opex investments that we have made  those have stayed steady  focused on areas of diversifying our growth in industrial and automotive  So I think we feel just as good today as we did about the business  The cycles will come and go Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsYeah  I ll just add  As Dave mentioned  strategically  we are well positioned    have been  That hasn t changed  So we continue to build as good as ever on that front And then operationally  we ve got to be ready for whatever the market throws at us  So if this was going to last longer  we ve got to be ready for that  If things are going to head south  we ve also got to be ready  If things turn around  then we re going to start seeing year on year growth  So our business model allows us to do that and we re well positioned for that Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsGreat  And you have a follow on  Chris Chris Danely    Citigroup    AnalystYeah  just a longer term question on the Embedded Processing business  So if you look at the last couple of years  it has materially undergrown the overall business and we re still running at  I think it s about 10  lower margins than the corporate average  So what are you guys thinking about what should we be thinking about sort of the long term goals or aspirations for the Embedded business just in terms of relative revenue growth or profits  Do we expect it to improve or not improve  And if it s not going to improve  is there anything you could do to change that Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsYeah  I ll give you a few comments on that  As far as expectations    you mentioned margin  Frankly  that s not a    Embedded is lower margin than Analog  but that is a non issue  As long as Embedded contributes to free cash flow growth  that s the measuring stick  Obviously  the top line has gone through some challenges here that Dave talked about earlier  But longer term  with their focus on auto and industrial    in all their businesses  but that includes Embedded  we feel confident that that business will grow longer term Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsGreat  Thank you  Chris  We ll go to the next caller  please OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi guys  thanks a lot for taking the question  I was hoping to better understand what you re seeing in the comms business  I appreciate the year ago quarter was a high compare  But the business was down 50   as Dave  you noted  Curious how big Huawei was as a percentage of that decline in Q4  and more importantly  how are you guys thinking about the trajectory for this business into 2020  And then I ve a follow up Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsSure  Yeah  So Huawei last year was 3  to 4  of our revenue  That s really unchanged from what it was the prior year  And I think if you look at comms equipment overall  if you just look at the shape of the growth curve  you had the year kind of balanced with strong growth in the first part and followed by very weak growth in the second half  So the way that it s behaving I don t think is    well  it isn t a surprise to us  As we were going through that very strong growth  we tried to remind everyone at the time that that market is a market that s just choppy and it s that way primarily in early phases of technology deployment I think longer term  as we ve talked about on our capital management presentation  we don t believe that that will be a growth driver for us or for the industry  and that s just based on the number of subscribers that are out in the market and with the capital spending by operators will be longer term  So we really think that growth in our industry will be driven by industrial and automotive and hence why we ve biased our investments into those areas Any follow on Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  Great  And sort of related to that  Dave  it was encouraging to see R D intensity or R D as a percentage of sales pick up in 2019 versus 2018  We had felt like R D was in decline for a number of years  So it was good to see that pick up  Can you remind us which product areas  technologies and markets that you guys are focused on  I realize it s going to be industrial and automotive  But if you can give a little bit more color within those two end markets  that would be helpful  Thank you Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsSo  of course  from an end market standpoint  as you said  it s industrial and automotive  that s where we re focusing  From a product standpoint  it s Embedded and Analog  But of course inside of that there is a bunch of pieces  So I ll mention a few  I mean  at the highest level is  in the case of Analog  is signal chain and power  those are by far the biggest areas  And underneath that  there is just a bunch of things  Within power  there s all kinds of power categories  And then within signal chain    but  Dave  do you want to   Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsYeah  And I ll just say when we think of allocating capital to R D  there s really three major buckets  and the largest bucket goes directly to product    creation of new products  We release 300 to 400 new products a year  The other two is kind of a shared  centralized R D function that develops our process technologies  packaging tools that our engineers use like spice models and those types of things  And then the third category is Kilby Labs where longer term higher risk investments are made    new materials  new markets and those types of things  So that s where the R D has been directed I describe R D last year as steady and stable  and I think that even in a down market  keeping those investments stable  keeping focused on investing in our four competitive advantages is really important overall  So thank you  Toshiya  and we ll go to next caller  please OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan Harlan Sur    JPMorgan    AnalystGood afternoon  and thanks for taking my question  Looks like the year over year declines improved quite a bit in auto and industrial  moving from down high single digits year over year to down low single digits going from September to December  Of the 18 sub segments within these two end markets or by geography  where did you guys see signs of improvement or was it pretty broad based Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsYeah  It is the latter  It was very broad based  which I think continues to be encouraging on that front  And again  just given the diversity of our customers as well as the diversity    the intentional diversity of our investments to have that growth be broad based  it s good to see that that s the way the business is performing  Do you have follow up Harlan Sur    JPMorgan    AnalystYes  absolutely  As you guys mentioned  it looks like the team is now shipping to consumption  The guidance for this quarter is for a seasonal decline  But given that Q2 and Q3 are typically seasonally stronger quarters  do you guys anticipate increasing factory loadings here in the March quarter Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsWe only talk about utilization in factory loadings when there are significant inflection points  and in this particular comparison  fourth to first  we don t expect a significant inflection point  So we re not talking about it  Of course  wafer loadings is always a function of what we expect for future growth Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsYeah  And we ll vary those based on order patterns and as we see demand coming from customers  So  thank you  Harlan  We ll go to the next caller  please OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava of Bank of Montreal Ambrish Srivastava    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystI just wanted to peel back the comments on stabilization  Both these businesses  industrials and autos  and specifically industrials  I forget  but I think there is 12  13 sub segments  So when you talk about stabilization  I m assuming    well  you never had any channel inventory built up  Your channel inventory was pretty normal through the cycle and your lead times never extended out So  can you just help us understand a little bit what s the source of stabilization  It can t be the channel  so it s the end customer  But then you have thousands of end customers  So what s the right way to get comfort that you are seeing stabilization in that business  specifically Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsSo  Ambrish  it s reflected in the    the stabilization is reflected in the order patterns  the demands that we see through consignment and actually the results themselves  So we went from third quarter  where those markets were declining high single digits  8   9   some of them at 10   so all those markets were declining at 3   4   So  and those numbers suggest that there is a bottoming process and even we re holding    in consignment programs  we re holding that inventory on our balance sheet  certainly  our customers have inventory of their products and then they have inventories that are down their channel  So  just as the  Indecipherable  effect would suggest that you have a small change in end demand as that moves its way back that magnify  So we can see the results of that beginning to abate  Do you have a follow on Ambrish Srivastava    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystI did  Free cash flow margin  So you guys have powered through the 25   35  range you had given a couple of years ago and you just did 40  in revenues down    not getting the math right  but somewhere in the high single digit  and free cash flow was down 4   So  would it be fair to assume that that target should be moved up when we hear you talk about capital allocation in a couple of weeks from now Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsSo let me take that  So thanks for the Q on that  So we do have the capital management call coming on February 4  So we expect all of you to sign up for that and join us there  And we will talk about the various objectives there  But I ll give you a preview  We re not changing those objectives  and specifically that one that you talked about  we re not  And the reason for that  yeah  we just finished at 40  free cash flow as percent of revenue  But the focus is not that percent  right  The way we maximize value for the owners of the Company is growing the free cash flow per share for a long time to come  So we focus on that and that s how we create value Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsOkay  Thank you  Ambrish  And I believe we have time for one more caller  please OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Tore Svanberg    Stifel    AnalystYes  Thank you for sneaking me in  First of all  coming back to the sort of recovery question  I mean  stabilization and eventual recovery  Are you starting to see backlog further out now  Or do you think it s kind of more just in time and kind of just waiting for how macro unfolds throughout the year Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsYeah  Tore  Now  just for those that aren t as familiar with those  I ll just remind everyone or just point out that two thirds of our revenues are supported by consignment where we actually don t carry a backlog but we do get demand forecast  and most of the time that s at least six months of demand that we can see  And then there is no inventory  As John Pitzer was pointing out in his earlier call  there is no inventory between us and those manufacturing lines for those customers  So that s actually the strongest signal that we will get when we re looking at future demand  But certainly the backlog plays a part of that  So I just say that in general that it s consistent with the outlook that we have Our lead times haven t changed    hasn t really changed at all  So they have remained stable  So that allows customers to have confidence that they can get product when they need it So  do you have a follow on Tore Svanberg    Stifel    AnalystYeah  And I apologize for ending on this topic  But there is a lot of concerns about China in sourcing including analog and embedded processing  I was just wondering what the Company s strategy is on that topic  I mean  is sort of life as normal or do you actually have a long term strategy as it relates to that particular topic Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsYeah  I ll start and if Rafael wants to add anything  And certainly  as we ve worked through the year with the trade tensions  and as that has unfolded  we ve certainly heard discussions that Chinese customers and them wanting to ensure that they have got alternatives  But in the end  our customers are just very pragmatic and they re looking for components with the highest performance  the lowest cost  the most dependable delivery  and those are all areas that we re very  very strong competitively in So  OK  With that  I ll turn it over to Rafael to wrap things up Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and CAO Finance   OperationsAll right  So let me finish with a few comments on key items for you to remember We will remain focused on Analog and Embedded  the best products  and industrial and automotive  the best markets  Next  we will be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the Company  And lastly  we believe growing free cash flow per share over the long term is what will maximize value for the owners of the Company Dave Pahl    Head of Investor RelationsOkay  Thank you for joining us  Good night Rafael R  Lizardi    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial

190473,411989,TXN,Texas Instruments quarterly beat soothes demand jitters  shares up 6 ,news,"By Munsif Vengattil
 Reuters    Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  Inc provided some relief that a global slowdown in microchip demand would not be as long as feared  posting quarterly profit and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates on Tuesday 
Shares of the company rose 6 4  to  127 70 in extended trading and were on track to open at a record high on Wednesday 
The company had previously warned that the slowdown may last a few more quarters  as China s economy cools and manufacturers face the fallout of a prolonged U S  China trade dispute 
When asked whether the trade dispute was impacting the company s ability to conduct business in China  Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said   No  not at all  
The market was also encouraged by the numbers from one of the first chipmakers to report earnings for the quarter  as there were uncertainties around demand due to higher tariffs and the fallout from China s Huawei Technologies 
Texas  whose broad lineup of products makes it a proxy for the chip industry  said it expected third quarter revenue to be between  3 65 billion and  3 95 billion  The company also estimated a profit of between  1 31 and  1 53 per share 
Analysts on average were expecting revenue of  3 83 billion and profit of  1 38 per share  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
 Guidance reflects the improved sequential demand due to seasonality in all of its end markets  offset by the on going macro uncertainty   Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said 
Chan  however  expressed concerns about the continued choppy demand in industrial and automotive markets due to slowing growth in China 
Sales from industrial and automotive units  its fastest growing areas  together accounted for more than half of the company s revenue in 2018

And if 2019 is anything like the last quarter of 2018 long term investors are likely to be rewarded for their patience and their foresight when they own shares of this company    
From a macro standpoint  the semiconductor space is forecast to slow over 2019 and perhaps 2020  in what is expected to be a cyclical correction after a multiyear expansion since 2015  
It is also reasonable to assume that most technology stocks will be similarly affected by the general state of the sector given the interdependence of the sector especially the general dynamics of order flows and operational relationships 
So what sets this company apart from the crowd  Strong management  a wide book of system  its forward planning structure  obsessive attention to detail in its operations  factory operation  and a fountain of free cash flow  FCF   the money left over after expenses  
Indeed  FCF is the central metric for this company which reported a 40  growth rate in FCF with a  5 9 billion cache over the trailing twelve month period reported in Q3 2018  Specifically  FCF is a pool of cash for the company to distribute to its investors via dividends and stock buybacks 
The latter is especially important because the firm has an  18 billion buyback program in place  and recently increased its dividend by 24    3 08 per year   3 26  yield   its 15th straight year of dividend growth 
Texas Instruments has a pristine balance sheet with  5 11 billion in cash on its balance sheet and  5 1 billion in debt  which is averaging a 2 77  coupon rate  The company continues to grow its revenues and is expected to remain earnings positive for the foreseeable future  
Moreover  it s concentrating its efforts in automotive and industrial semiconductors where the potential for robotics and artificial intelligence continues to expand and should continue to do for the extended term 
As a result  I believe the stock is the best positioned company in its branch of technology  with a strong book of business  sound management and a strong balance sheet  The bottom line is that when it s all said and done  Texas Instruments should still be standing and poised to grow its business  Buy above  90   For full disclosure  Joe Duarte owns shares of Texas Instruments as of this writing

Texas Instruments  the third largest semiconductor company in the world  posted quarterly revenues of  3 15 billion for the first three months of the year  up 6  on a year over year basis  The revenues fell just short of analysts  estimates of  3 2 billion for the period   
Texas Instruments still reported revenue growth on a year over year basis for the sixth consecutive quarter  Rich Templeton  the chairman  president and CEO of Texas Instruments  attributed the growth in part to the company s strong performance in the automotive and industrial markets  The company  he added  was held back by a disappointing quarter with its wireless infrastructure equipment and by the sharp appreciation of the dollar against the euro   
 Even so  our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing delivered their seventh and tenth consecutive quarters of year over year growth  respectively  Combined  Analog and Embedded Processing comprised 86  of first quarter revenue   Templeton said in a statement   Our gross margin of 57 7  was also up almost 4 percentage points from a year ago  reflecting the diversity and longevity of our product portfolio  as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy    
In terms of net profit  Texas Instruments reported earnings per share of  656 million or 0 61 per share  above per share earnings of 0 44 during the first quarter of 2014

190686,412202,TXN,5 Steps For 15  Per Year For Bulls And Bears,opinion,"Will this bull market actually die of old age this year 
The macro picture is dicey and stock valuations are pricey  but we must stay invested  The stock market goes up about two thirds of the time  Permabears miss out on compounding and it s not as easy to be a part time bear as it sounds 
To illustrate this let s consider a study by Hulbert Financial  The firm looked at the best  peak market timers  the gurus who correctly forecasted the bursting of the Internet bubble in March 2000 and the Great Recession in October 2007 
These were the clairvoyant advisors who had their clients out of stocks and mostly in cash when the S P 500 was about to be chopped in half  Surely their clients did great over the long haul  given their capital was largely intact at the market bottoms  right 
Wrong  None of these advisors turned in top performances  The reason  While they were good at timing tops  they were terrible at timing bottoms  The bearish advisors didn t get their clients back into stocks anywhere near the bottom  They had their capital intact  but they didn t deploy it and they largely missed out on the epic bull markets that followed these crashes 
Think about the advisors and investors who sold in late December when the  bear market  became official  They moved to cash at the worst possible moment and have been on the sidelines waiting for a low risk  retest  of the lows  Mr  Market loves to confuse the most amount of people  and he really outdid himself this time 
Barely a Bear Market 






  And Right Back to a Bull 






Now we can be smart about staying in the market  While bull markets may not die of old age per se  this one is eleven years old  They don t run forever  so we should focus on pullback proof names  Here are five rules to follow for 15  per year returns regardless of what the broader market does 
Recession Proof Rule  1  Trust Your Dividends
Secure dividend yields are truly the  rubber duckies  of the investing world  Mr  Market can push them underwater for a period of time  but eventually  they rocket back up to the surface 

Let s consider Contrarian Income Report favorite  Omega Healthcare  Investors  NYSE OHI   a big paying landlord in the skilled nursing space  Anytime OHI rallies I get questions about whether we should book profits  Well  we rarely want to sell a great dividend stock like this even when our crystal ball forecasts impending doom 
We ll rewind 13 years to the top of the last extended bull market  If you were savvy enough to time the top in 2007  you would still have been doing yourself a disservice by selling your OHI shares  not least  how would know when to have  gotten back in    
This Dividend Payer Barely Went Below the Water






Five years later  as the S P 500 barely recovered its crash losses  OHI investors had enjoyed 133  returns  including steady  fat payouts throughout   And while the presence of a dividend does not guarantee protection from losses  examples like this one show that payout focused investors have a serious edge in the markets because 
Buying stocks for their dividends alone makes day to day price action irrelevant 
Recession Proof Rule  2  Buy Fast Growing Dividends
Dividends are magnets that pull their share prices along with them  If you re looking for the stock market s tail that wags the dog  pay attention to the payouts attached to a given share price 
Regardless of what the stock market does during any given trading session  or month  or whatever   share prices eventually follow their dividends higher  For example  let s consider Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN   which has increased its payout  orange line below  by an amazing 650  over the last decade  Its stock price  blue line  was pulled higher by its dividend 
TXN s Dividend Magnet






My Hidden Yields subscribers have made big money from TXN  Three generous dividend raises have provided much of this fuel  And the kicker  We bought when shares were  due  to pop because they had fallen behind their dividend curve 
Recession Proof Rule  3  Find the Lagging Stock Price
The best time to buy a stock like TXN is nearly anytime  But we can  cherry pick  our entries  and put option sales  by focusing on times when TXN s price falls behind its payout curve 

Regular readers will remember Medical Properties Trust  NYSE MPW   a hospital landlord we bought in CIR and later sold for 105  total returns  MPW s dividend magnet was part of our secret  and the fact that we bought when the price was lagging dividend growth and sold after it had overtaken it   The  up  arrows below show good times to be a buyer  while the  down  arrows indicate times to hold or sell 
The Cues from a Dividend Magnet






Recession Proof Rule  4  Buybacks Are a Nice Bonus
Share repurchases can provide fuel for dividend growth  When a firm buys back stock  it saves cash on dividends because it doesn t have to  dish out  for those retired shares 
Buybacks today are the gifts that keep on giving tomorrow  By reducing the share count  they make every  per share  metric of profit and cash flow look better  Plus  they make it easier to grow the dividends because there are fewer shares to pay them to 
Buybacks work best when the stock itself is cheap  After all  the price you pay for something always matters  Smart management teams take advantage of depressed stock prices to provide their investors with a nice bonus 
Recession Proof Rule  5  Low Payout Ratios  Where the Party s At
Some dividend income investors think they are following this strategy by purchasing dividend aristocrats  or stocks that have increased their payouts every year for 25 straight years 

 Brett  I don t own the S P 500 Index for income  I choose the best companies in the index  the ones whose dividends have gone up and up  The dividend aristocrats  
Problem is  many of these monarchs have their best years behind them and their payout ratios simply can t go any higher  This puts a ceiling on potential dividend increases 
So  let s look past these paupers for lesser known bargains that are primed to double their dividends and prices over the next five years  Some will double within three 
How is this possible  These five stocks are only paying 20  of their earnings as dividends  which means they could multiply their payouts by 2X  3X or even 4X today and still have room to grow without risk of a dividend cut 
They won t do it overnight  however  These firms will bump their dividends by 15   20  and even 25  or more per year  Which means their stock prices will eventually follow  and investors who buy today will double their money with these safe dividends

190687,412203,TXN,Texas Instruments  TXN  Surpasses Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Texas Instruments  TXN  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 12 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 02 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 27 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9 80   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  1 41 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 49  delivering a surprise of 5 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Texas Instruments  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   General industry  posted revenues of  3 35 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 93   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 72 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Texas Instruments shares have added about 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 8  
What s Next for Texas Instruments 
While Texas Instruments has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Texas Instruments was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 04 on  3 20 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 98 on  13 95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Semiconductor   General is currently in the top 24  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/texas-instruments-txn-surpasses-q4-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200500763,200500763
190695,412211,TXN,Earnings Preview  Texas Instruments  TXN  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Texas Instruments  TXN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 22 billion  down 13 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Texas Instruments 
For Texas Instruments  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Texas Instruments will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Texas Instruments would post earnings of  1 41 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 49  delivering a surprise of  5 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Texas Instruments doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-texas-instruments-txn-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200499057,200499057

Texas Instruments is one of 638 companies in the Computer and Technology group  The Computer and Technology group currently sits at  9 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors

Coming into today  shares of the chipmaker had lost 4 95  in the past month  In that same time  the Computer and Technology sector lost 6 46   while the S P 500 lost 5 01  
Investors will be hoping for strength from TXN as it approaches its next earnings release  The company is expected to report EPS of  1 41  down 10 76  from the prior year quarter  Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  3 81 billion  down 10 58  from the prior year quarter 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  5 34 per share and revenue of  14 70 billion  These totals would mark changes of  4 47  and  6 89   respectively  from last year 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for TXN should also be noted by investors  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month  TXN currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
In terms of valuation  TXN is currently trading at a Forward P E ratio of 22 9  This represents a premium compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 16 68 
We can also see that TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 26  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Semiconductor   General was holding an average PEG ratio of 1 83 at yesterday s closing price 
The Semiconductor   General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 217  which puts it in the bottom 16  of all 250  industries

190739,412255,TXN,Texas Instruments  TXN  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Texas Instruments  TXN   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  130 37 in the previous session  Texas Instruments has gained 37 5  since the start of the year compared to the 25 1  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 23 4  return for the Zacks Semiconductor   General industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 23  2019  Texas Instruments reported EPS of  1 29 versus consensus estimate of  1 21 
For the current fiscal year  Texas Instruments is expected to post earnings of  5 31 per share on  14 7 billion in revenues  This represents a  5 01  change in EPS on a  6 89  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 82 per share on  15 42 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 6  and 4 94   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Texas Instruments may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Texas Instruments has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 24 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 19 6X versus its peer group s average of 8 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 42  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Texas Instruments currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Texas Instruments meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Texas Instruments shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/texas-instruments-txn-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200447051,200447051

According to the Semiconductor Industry Association  SIA   the U S  is the largest producer of semiconductors with 44  market share  The group estimates that overall semiconductors grew 13 7  in 2018 driven by double digit growth in the automotive  computing  communications  government and industrial end markets 
Three major themes shaping the industry are 
First  being on the building block side of technology  it will continue to benefit from the proliferation of the Internet and the growing digitization of our lives in the foreseeable future 
Second  because of the growth potential in emerging markets  regulatory  and or political  issues  particularly in places like China  can play an increasingly important role  In this context  the government s strong stance against prime trading partner China has cast a shadow over the space  especially since a second half resolution to the conflict doesn t look likely any more 
Semiconductor companies in particular would have benefited because the Chinese government s drive to build its own industry would have required plenty of collaborations with leading semiconductor players  The government is more concerned about IP protection and is trying to delay as far as possible  China s own technological maturity  This is particularly negative for the industry because semiconductors typically go into manufacturing devices  the largest chunk of which is made in China 
Third  because end devices have to be priced lower to reach more people  the pressure on companies to bring down cost will remain  So companies will find it advantageous to move operations to places where labor may be cheaper or the proximity to manufacturing facilities can lower transportation and other cost 
Industry consolidation is also likely to continue as larger players add expertise through acquisitions  There s also likely to be close collaboration with device makers facilitating quicker consumption and better inventory management

The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has declined by 8 8

companies will find it advantageous to move operations to places where labor may be cheaper or the proximity to manufacturing facilities can lower transportation and other cost Industry consolidation

190749,412265,TXN,It s Just A Matter Of Time  Before The Market Tips Over Again ,opinion,"Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  reported its Q2 yesterday after the close  Revenues were down 9  YoY for Q2 and management forecast an 11  decline for Q3  The stock market rewarded this fundamental deterioration in TXN s business model by adding nearly  8 billion to TXN s valuation as I write this 
The Dow Jones Transports index is up 1  on the news that the U S  is sending envoys over to Shangai for a face to face love in with their Chinese counterparts to discuss the two Governments  differences of opinions on how to conduct bi lateral trade  The stock market momentum chasers are happy because the headline announced that the meeting would  face to face   therefore it s a given that the meeting will save the freight industry from the deep recession into which it s headed 
The U S   economic woes are not caused by the trade war anymore than China s issues are caused by the trade war  The trade war is a symptom of the underlying systemic structural issues  Trump s handlers crafted a clever strategy to enable the policy makers and war mongers of the Deep State to use China and the trade war as a scapegoat 
Fixing the trade differences   which likely won t happen in any meaningful manner   and taking interest rates to zero will not stimulate economic activity  The stock market is melting up because the western Central Banks have made money free to use for those closest to the money spigot  The banks and companies with access to the free money know that investing it in capital formation is a waste of time because real economic activity is contracting  Instead they plow this cash into the stock market  cheap loans to hedge funds from banks in lieu of margin credit and corporate share buy backs  
The real source of the problem is too much debt  The global financial system is on the precipice of a Von Mises   crack up boom   The melt up in the chip stocks and unicorns is stunningly similar to the melt up in the same chip stocks and the dot coms in late 1999 early 2000  The  unicorn  stocks are this era s  dot com stocks   Most of the hedge fund managers and daytraders were in grade school during the first tech bubble  They will remain clueless until the rug is pulled out from under them 
The stock and housing markets will eventually collapse because the foundation of debt on which both asset markets are propped will implode  This process of systemic cleansing started in 2008 but was deferred by the trillions in printed money and credit creation thrown at the problem  Rather than  fixing  the system  the  solution  did nothing more than add gasoline on the underlying fire 
Someone asked me yesterday what triggered the sell off in tech stocks in early 2000  I said   the market started to shit the bed for no specific reason other than it stopped going higher and decided to go south  The Fed jawboning was not nearly as pervasive although Greenspan was good at  talking  stocks higher  The President then never cheered on the stock market like Trump does  At some point  no one can for sure when  this stock market is going tip over   it s just a matter of time  ",2019-07-25,David I.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then

VGM Scores
Currently  Texas Instruments has a great Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  Notably  Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-05-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/texas-instruments-txn-down-98-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-rebound-200424301,200424301
190755,412271,TXN,Analysts Estimate Texas Instruments  TXN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Texas Instruments  TXN  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 21 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 60 billion  down 10 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 36  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Texas Instruments 
For Texas Instruments  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 28  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Texas Instruments will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Texas Instruments would post earnings of  1 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 22  delivering a surprise of  7 96  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Texas Instruments doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-texas-instruments-txn-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200440144,200440144
190756,412272,TXN,Texas Instruments  TXN  Beats Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Texas Instruments  TXN  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 29 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 21 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 37 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 61   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  1 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 22  delivering a surprise of 7 96  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Texas Instruments  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   General industry  posted revenues of  3 67 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 75   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 02 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Texas Instruments shares have added about 25 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 1  
What s Next for Texas Instruments 
While Texas Instruments has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Texas Instruments was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

190770,412286,TXN,Earnings Preview  Texas Instruments  TXN  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Texas Instruments  TXN  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 6  
Revenues are expected to be  3 48 billion  down 8 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 62  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Texas Instruments 
For Texas Instruments  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Texas Instruments will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Texas Instruments would post earnings of  1 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 27  delivering a surprise of  2 42  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Texas Instruments doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-texas-instruments-txn-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200407209,200407209

What s Next for Texas Instruments 
While Texas Instruments has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Texas Instruments was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Texas Instruments would post earnings of  1 53 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 58  delivering a surprise of  3 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Texas Instruments doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/texas-instruments-txn-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200376193,200376193
190808,412324,TXN,A Rich Quant s 61 Favorite Dividend Growers For 2019 ,opinion,"Eric Ervin was making his wealthy client so much money that he suggested   Hey  why don t you just quit your job  
The investor saw the opportunity to scale Eric s  secret strategy    and he wanted to help fund a new venture to bring this brilliance to the financial masses 
Both guys knew the power of dividend growth investing  But Eric s second level insight is what made them both a boatload of cash  He figured out a way to bet purely on the higher payouts   as close to a  sure thing  as you ll ever see in stocks  Here s what I mean 
Blue chip stocks tend to raise their dividends every year  Even if it s a token increase  it keeps shareholders happy  S P 500 dividend growth is the reason that index investing  works   Its collective payouts are almost always rising and they pull 500 share prices along with them 
This Orange Dividend Line Powers 500 Stock Prices
Problem is  traditionally there s been no way to bet on the orange line above  You d have to buy the index and hope its price  blue line  appreciates in tandem  That might be OK if you have a multi decade timeframe  but if you need your money in a few years then manic market plunges  like we saw in December  might derail your retirement hopes 
Well  Eric figured out that he could buy  swaps  on S P 500 dividend growth itself  This was an innovative way that he and his rich clients could bet on dividend growth only  without being exposed to price fluctuations 
He eventually launched the Reality Shares DIVS  NYSE DIVY  in 2015 to bring this strategy to individual investors  and was kind enough to walk through the specifics with me on the phone at the time  
The genius of DIVY is that it capitalizes on the underappreciated annual tradition of dividend raises  For 43 of the last 46 years  S P 500 companies have increased the total dividend payout  This results in steady gains that track payout growth rather than price action 
DIVY s  heartburn  levels  price ups and downs that cause digestive difficulty   are closer to that of bond funds  Here s how its volatility  measured by standard deviation  a statistical measure of price fluctuation  stacks up with two bond funds  left side below  and the price of the S P 500 itself  right side  
Dividend Growth Itself Causes Less Heartburn
So should we buy DIVY and call it a day  With S P 500 growth projected to be 8  in 2019  it s not a bad idea  But Eric has a newer fund that should provide us with even more upside 
One Click for the 61 Best Dividend Growers in 2019
Since launching DIVY  Eric and his team created a five tier rating system called DIVCON that provides a snapshot of dividend health for individual companies  It combines and weights seven factors  such as cash flow  earnings growth  and shareholder payouts  to provide a comprehensive snapshot of a company s dividend health 
DIVCON 5 is the best bucket  It means the dividend is in good shape  and there s a 97 4  likelihood that it ll be increased in the next year 
DIVCON 1 is the danger zone  It means the dividend is more likely to be cut than increased in the next 12 months 
Over the past 15 years  investors who would have traded off DIVCON ratings   buying the fives  and selling or shorting the ones  would have done quite well 
DIVCON s Dividend Prescience
By now you probably know that higher payouts drive stock prices up  But we can t look in the rearview mirror to predict future dividend growth and stock returns  We need a leading indicator   like DIVCON 
And Eric is making outperformance easy for us individual investors  Thirteen months ago he launched the Reality Shares Divcon Leaders Dividend  NYSE LEAD  to buy DIVCON s top stocks and hold them for a year  Many of them boast dividend charts like these beautiful staircases 
Stairway to Payout Heaven
Everyone loves dividends  but dividend hikes are often underappreciated  Not only do they increase the yield on your initial capital  but they also reflected in a price increase for the stock 
Let s say a stock pays a 3  current yield and then hikes its payout by 10   It s unlikely that its stock price will stagnate for long  Investors will see the new 3 3  yield  and buy more shares  They ll drive the price up  and the yield back down   eventually towards 3   This is why your favorite dividend aristocrat never pays a high current yield   its stock price rises too fast 
Heck  Visa  NYSE V  has never yielded even 1   But that hasn t stopped its stock from appreciating 892  over the last decade  thanks to a dividend that increased an equally amazing 852  
Life Takes Visa  and its Dividend 
The LEAD ETF is a convenient way to get exposure to stocks that are  at risk  of becoming the next Visa thanks to rapid share price appreciation  With DIVCON looking ahead  you can use this fund to create a diversified portfolio of the 61 blue chip stocks most likely to raise their dividends over the next 12 months 
My  1 Pick From LEAD s Screen
As Eric improved on the  dumb  yet effective dividend growth screen  we can further improve on his by cherry picking DIVCON s best  After all  he has to own 61 names so that his ETF has enough liquidity   but we individual investors can buy only the very best 
Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  is a great example of an underappreciated stock we ve profited from in my Hidden Yields research service   16 7  yearly returns while we ve owned it  
Since 2012  its share price  blue line below  as consistently lagged its payout  orange line below   Try as it might  TXN the stock   358   hasn t been able to catch up with TXN the dividend   464   
TXN s Magnetic Dividend Drives 358  Stock Gains
Since dividends follow their share prices higher  we can make the most money by buying when these payouts are most likely to  snap higher  towards their runaway dividend curves 
In other words  we buy the price dips when the dividend appears to be running away  Anyone who says you can t time stocks hasn t used this surefire strategy for buying shares ready to  catch up  to their runaway payouts 
It s simple 
Plot a stock price versus its dividend 
Look for a  lag  between the shares and the payout  and
Buy any big lags you see 
And thanks to the Q4 pullback in stocks  we have plenty of great snapback candidates  I ll share my favorite pick with my Hidden Yields subscribers this Friday 
Its next dividend hike is likely to be huge  and will place the stock in serious  snap back  territory  Which means the best time to buy it is today  before Wall Street wakes up  I ll be emailing my full analysis to my Hidden Yields subscribers this Friday   click here if you d like to sign up to receive it

190814,412330,TXN,Texas Instruments  A Growth Stock Paying A 3 2  Dividend Yield,opinion,"Traditionally  the tech sector has not been a source of dividend stocks  Many tech companies  particularly those at earlier stages of their development  do not pay dividends at all  Instead  they typically need to reinvest as much cash flow as possible back into growing the business  And even among tech companies that do pay dividends to shareholders  yields are usually low 
However  in rare cases investors can find highly profitable  mature tech companies with enough cash flow to pay high dividend yields to shareholders  For example  Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  currently has a 3 2  dividend yield  which beats the average yield in the S P 500 Index by a considerable margin  And  Texas Instruments is a dividend growth stock  It has raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years  including a 24  increase in 2018  Texas Instruments qualifies as a Dividend Achiever  a select group of stocks with 10  consecutive years of dividend growth 
Texas Instruments is a unique stock  It offers a mix of high yield and dividend growth  which makes the stock attractive for income and growth investors 
Powering The Technological Revolution
Texas Instruments operates in the semiconductor industry  It manufactures analog and embedded processors  primarily for the automotive and industrial markets  One of the company s strongest competitive advantages is that it has a focused operational structure  Texas Instruments operates in two segments analog and embedded processing equipment and dominates both categories  The company has dedicated greater amounts of research and development investment to these two categories  as they have the strongest growth potential moving forward 

Source  Investor Presentation  page 12
The company has approximately 100 000 customers globally  Its products include semiconductors that measure sound  temperature and other physical data and convert them to digital signals  as well as semiconductors that are designed to handle specific tasks and applications 
Texas Instruments reported its third quarter earnings results on October 23rd  The company grossed revenues of  4 3 billion  an increase of 3 6  year over year  Revenues were primarily driven by higher Analog revenues  which more than offset a 4  sales decline for the Embedded Processing segment  Texas Instruments grew earnings per share by 25  year over year  to  1 58 
Analog is arguably the company s strongest growth catalyst moving forward  as the category continues to see rising demand  In response  Texas Instruments is rolling out new products in Analog  such as its 300 millimeter wafers  which have about a 40  cost advantage over the company s 200 millimeter wafers 

Source  Investor Presentation  page 17
Another competitive advantage for Texas Instruments is its manufacturing efficiency  The company has a policy of purchasing smaller companies and manufacturing assets that have long operational lives but can be purchased at a discount  The company keeps internal production  rather than relying on outsourcing for its manufacturing  which gives it greater quality control that fuels its pricing power and high margins 
The overall result is that the company has generated excellent growth rates and huge amounts of cash flow over the past several years  Texas Instruments generated free cash flow of  4 7 billion in 2017  From 2004 2017  free cash flow has increased by approximately 13  each year  including 15 7  growth in 2017 

Source  Investor Presentation  page 19
This growth has enabled Texas Instruments to increase investment in future growth  and return lots of cash to shareholders each year  through dividends and share repurchases  Texas Instruments spent  1 51 billion on research and development in 2017  up 11  from the previous year 
Texas Instruments is also a very shareholder friendly company  Not only does Texas Instruments stock have a hefty 3 2  dividend yield  along with 15 consecutive years of dividend increases  but the company has also reduced its share count by 43  since 2004 
Value  Growth  And Dividends All In One
Texas Instruments stock could provide high returns to shareholders over the next several years  from a combination of valuation changes  earnings growth  and dividends  Each of these three factors is likely to positively contribute to Texas Instruments  shareholder returns 
Texas Instruments currently pays an annual dividend of  3 08 per share  At a recent share price of  95  the stock has a current dividend yield of 3 2   Texas Instruments is a premier dividend growth stock  Over the last five years  it has raised its dividend by 21  per year on average  This is a very high dividend growth rate  At 21  per year  an investor would see his or her dividends double every 3 4 years on average 
Texas Instruments  dividend yield of 3 2  is much higher than usual  In fact  its dividend yield is at the highest level in the last 10 years  One reason for this is the company s high rate of dividend growth  another reason for the abnormally high dividend yield is that the stock price has declined over 20  from its 52 week high of  120 75  Texas Instruments  valuation has come down substantially over the last few months  due to a combination of a broad market decline  pressure on semiconductor stocks  and the guidance for Q4 that came in below expectations 
At the same time  the decline in Texas Instruments  valuation has resulted in an attractive valuation  Using 2018 earnings estimates of  5 52 per share  the stock has a price to earnings ratio of 17 1  which could be too low for a company of Texas Instruments  quality  The stock has a fair value estimate of 19  which is a more reasonable valuation for a highly profitable and growing company  Using the fair value estimate of 19  Texas Instruments is undervalued  and a return to fair value could add approximately 2 1  to annual returns 
Dividends and valuation changes could result in 5 3  annual returns  The final contributor will be earnings growth  Texas Instruments is a growth company  Over the next five years  the company is expected to grow earnings by 11  12  per year  As a result  valuation changes  dividends  and earnings growth could cumulatively result in annual returns of nearly 17  over the next five years 
Final Thoughts
A stock with the combination of high earnings growth  a 3   dividend yield  and a modest valuation is a rare find  Texas Instruments has a leading industry position  durable competitive advantages  and an outlook for growth over the next several years  The company has always been associated with growth  and due to the recent share price decline  the stock is appealing for value and income investors as well

But is now the time to actually start panicking 
We re going to dive into that question today  I ll also reveal 1 fund that protects your nest egg with a unique form of  insurance  while handing you a huge 7 5  cash payout 
More on this lifesaving  pullback proof  dividend a little further on  First  we need to talk about  
Why the Pundits Are Wrong  Again 
The market wipeout has had one extra element that s added even more terror  dire warnings from the semiconductor industry  which sent Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  and Nvidia  NVDA  into free fall and badly beat up the benchmark VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF  SMH  
Bellwether Sector Tanks
True to form  CNBC responded with an article titled  Here s why the slump in semiconductor stocks may be a sign the US economy is slowing down   The reason  Because 28  of non residential fixed investment goes into IT equipment and software  or so says Moody s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi 
While this is true  you can only tie a fraction of that 28  to semiconductors  The lion s share goes to computers  software and IT infrastructure  And since semiconductor prices have been falling since  well  semiconductors were invented  it s not surprising to see them take a backseat to other tech spending 
But that isn t the biggest reason why Zandi is wrong 
There s a lot of other data to show that the semiconductor earnings problem is just that  a semiconductor problem  When you look elsewhere  things still look very good 
GDP Soars  Shoppers Splurge
Let s start with the overall growth numbers 
Last Friday  the Commerce Department reported that US GDP rose 3 5  annualized in the third quarter  above the 3 3  economists expected  While that isn t as high as the second quarter s 4 1   it does mean 2018 s GDP growth is set to be over 3  if the trend continues into the fourth quarter  which more economists now expect 
That isn t even the most exciting news 
Because many mainstream outlets ignore a crucial figure  GDP growth per capita  This is a true sign that individual Americans are getting richer   After all  you can grow overall GDP just by doubling the population with everyone making the same amount of money  
Per capita GDP has been climbing for two years  and it s still climbing 
Individual Americans Get Richer
It s no surprise  then  that American consumer sentiment has been rising over that same period and is near heights last seen in the middle of 2017 and 2018 
Confident Americans Tend to Spend More 
That s also why sales per share of the S P 500  another overlooked metric   are rising more quickly  Americans  simply put  have more money in their pockets  so they re buying more stuff 
  and They Are Spending  
What s truly amazing here is that sales are up even though the US dollar has been stronger against foreign currencies  which lowers sales per share of exported goods  But no matter  the US consumer is strong enough to take up that slack and then some 
That revenue growth has continued  by the way  Sales growth across the S P 500 for the third quarter is 7 6  for the nearly half  48   of firms that have reported so far 
Sales Are Up
These numbers have also beaten expectations 59  of companies have reported revenue above expectations 
Spiking Revenue Fattens Bottom Lines
But are those sales beats translating into stronger earnings 
In a word  yes 
So far  77  of the companies that have reported have seen Q3 earnings above estimates  In the tech sector it s actually 96  of companies a fact that flies in the face of the semiconductor hysteria 
Earnings Very Strong All Around
This strong profit growth combined with the recent share price declines has also made the S P 500 s P E ratio fall to 15 5  its lowest point in over a year 
Rate Hike Forecast Takes a Quiet Turn
There is only one thing that could crimp sales and earnings  inflation  which could force the Fed to hit the gas on rate hikes 
That s a fear you hear a lot these days  But the truth is  inflation is stuck  the personal consumption expenditure  PCE  price index  the metric the Fed watches like a hawk  showed 1 6  price growth in the third quarter  far below the 2 2  economists expected 
The Fed has said it s targeting 2  inflation over the long term  and anything below 2  would suggest it has more time to raise rates  meaning it s highly unlikely we ll see higher rates coming at a faster than expected pace 
So the question becomes  if we don t need to fear weaker earnings  poorer American consumers  lower sales or higher inflation  what  exactly  do we have to worry about 
The answer is simple  nothing 
1 Fund to Ride the Rebound
An easy way to buy into this market is to get the S P 500 SPDR ETF  SPY  NYSE SPY   and hold until stocks recover  This strategy will likely hand you double digit gains in just a few months 
But if you re an income investor  you might want to consider the Nuveen S P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund  SPXX  instead  Not only does this fund match SPY in its holdings  as its name implies  it buys S P 500 stocks   it also offers that nest egg  insurance  I mentioned before  while producing a 7 4  income stream  SPY holders  meanwhile  are stuck with a measly 1 9  yield 
How does SPXX protect your investment  In addition to holding all the S P 500 stocks  it sells call options against the index  meaning it takes advantage of derivatives to increase the income it earns so you get a higher yield while having no more risk than owning the index outright  This has resulted in similar returns and a higher yield for years  giving income investors the dividends they crave alongside their capital gains

CEO Rich Templeton described the situation clearly   Revenue increased by 4 percent from the same quarter a year ago  however demand for our products slowed across most markets   The Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF  NYSE SMH  was down nearly 4   indicating the lack of demand was sectoral in nature

Moreover  the housing market attracts more and more attention in the latest months  The data published on Wednesday reflected the decline in New Home Sales by 5 5  to lowest levels in almost 2 years  For today the release of the index of Pending Home Sales is scheduled  and another weak figure of sales can increase worry of investors 
On the one hand  it is hardly expected that banks and homebuyers will quickly forget the lessons of the previous decade  At the peak of the cycle in 2005  the sales of new homes were two and a half times higher  Now  banks and households are likely to be careful about issuing mortgages  despite the lower interest rates  However  stagnation and even declining sales are causing excitement  Earlier this data served as an excellent leading indicator of the consumer activity  The current recession is seen as a harbinger of falling household spending in subsequent quarters 

The upcoming publication of Durable Goods Orders is another indicator of the Business confidence  The impressive growth of orders for expensive equipment with long term use reflects confidence in economic prospects and can reduce the degree of anxiety around the prospects of the U S  economy because of the weakness of the housing market  The indicators of stronger expectations can support USD and the US stock indices 

In addition  the focus of the markets on Thursday is ECB s conference  The speech by the President Mario Draghi very often causes the increased volatility of the single currency  as the head of the bank gives answers to the most burning questions of journalists  This time  there will probably be questions about the influence of the Italian situation on the plans to minimize QE and higher rates

A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the recently reported quarter proved conducive to top line growth  The company s bottom line benefited fromhigher revenues and improved gross profit due to sales mix shift to higher margin subscription services  which were partially offset by elevated operating expenses  particularly sales and marketing  S M  
In fact  Fortinet has an impressive earnings surprise history  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 26 2   Backed by the impressive results  the company issued upbeat outlook for the second quarter and full year 

 
Let s take a look at what factors are driving Fortinet s back to back robust quarterly performances 
Shift in Business Model Driving Revenues   Margins
Fortinet is currently focusing on selling more subscription based services  This unique business model is helping the company generate stable revenues while expanding margins  Subscription based service is a high gross margin business  approximately 80   compared with the hardware centric model 
Notably  the company generates more than 50  of the total revenues from these services  which helped it generate a 70 bp gross margin expansion in 2017 and 220 bps  basis points  in the first quarter of this year  We believe the strategy will continue to improve the company s top and bottom line performances 
Gaining Market Share in UTM Space
According to industry analysis  Unified Threat Management  UTM  is believed to be one of the fastest growing segments in Network Security with high single to low double digits projected growth  Given Fortinet s sustained focus on enhancing its UTM portfolio through product development and acquisitions  we believe the company will continue to increase its market share in the segment and retain its leadership position 
Fortinet has a diversified product portfolio for PCs  mobile and enterprise security  This apart  its partnerships with Exodus Intelligence  Cisco ACI  NTT Communications and VMware NSX Partner Ecosystem have been helping it gain market share  Notably  the company holds a market share of 18 20  in the space 
Impressive Valuations
The stock currently trades at a forward earnings estimate at 40 9x  which is way lower than the industry to which it belongs to average of 82 9x  Given its recent track record of revenues and earnings growth  as well as the long term forecast  the stock is highly undervalued which indicates that it still has significant upside potential 
Moreover  Fortinet has a  of B  We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher  We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price

Earnings Results 
The company recently reported Q1 18 earnings results where they beat the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates   This was the ninth consecutive quarter where they either met or beat on both ends   Overall  the results were quite impressive   On a year over year basis  revenues rose by  11   and EPS increased by  39    Further  the company posted a  19  improvement in cash flow from operations while free cash flows grew by  17    On a segment basis  Analog revenues increased by  14  while Embedded Processing revenues rose by  15   
Management cited high demand for its products in both the Industrial and Automotive markets  and broad based order strength as the big drivers behind the impressive quarterly results  
Most importantly for the long term outlook for the company  the Q1 results eased fears that semi demand was decelerating   In the previous quarter there had been some concern that the semiconductor demand was hitting its peak cycle  but Q1 s performance  and strong Q2 guidance has eased those fears  
Looking Ahead
Going forward  management s Q2 EPS and revenue guidance was just above the midpoints of the consensus estimates  EPS now between  1 19 1 39  and revenues ranging from  3 78 4 1 billion   Further  management commented that its operating tax rates would be lower for both 2019 and 2020 than previously expected  16  for 2019 down from 18   and 20  in 2018 down from 23

The impressive employment numbers and current unemployment rate have brought staffing companies into focus   We received two reports that confirmed the jobs situation this week  the ADP jobs report  and the initial jobless claims report   The ADP announced that the private sector added 178 000 new jobs while jobless claims fell by 14 000   The unemployment rate held steady at 3 9   and remains on track to meet the Fed s expected level of 3 8  by the end of 2018 
This means that the tight job market is expected to continue into 2019 which is great news for staffing firms as companies need help filling many open positions  
BG Staffing is well positioned to take advantage of this situation as they fill many different job needs in a vast array of states   The company s success was seen in its last earnings report where revenues grew by  17 6  YoY  and net income jumped up by  89 4  when compared to the year ago quarter  
L  Allen Baker Jr  President and CEO commented on the impressive quarterly results   I m very pleased with our 1st quarter 2018 financial results   they are a reflection of BG Staffing s unique value proposition  the solid performance from our recent acquisitions  and our disciplined approach to cost control  We met or exceeded our goals in every significant category  
To add to all the positives surrounding BGSF  the company currently pays a  6 43  annual dividend yield  which is well above the S P 500 s 1 85  
Price and Earnings Consensus Graph
As you can see in the graph below the company has been doing very well since the second half of 2017  and its year over year consensus earnings estimates have risen as well 

Bottom line
The strong jobs and employment situation is a huge tailwind for the company  and is expected to remain a driver for the next several quarters   Further  the company s wide range of staffing services in a multitude of different states will enable it to capture several growing job sub segments as more companies turn to staffing firms for their employment needs

190851,412367,TXN,Should You Buy Texas Instruments  TXN  Stock Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Texas Instruments   NASDAQ TXN   dipped into the red during early afternoon trading Monday  just one day before the chip behemoth is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report  With concerns emerging that the dominant run for semiconductor stocks could be over soon  investors will want to key a close eye on the recent results of an industry bellwether like TXN 
Increased demand for its chips thanks to a variety of new applications throughout the tech landscape has helped Texas Instruments surge considerably over the past few years  However  volatility in the tech sector and semiconductor industry has taken the wind out of the stock s sails in recent months 
Still  earnings growth in our  Semiconductor   General  group is expected to exceed 20  in 2018  and investors will hope that Texas Instruments can get things started with a strong report on Tuesday  Let s take a closer look 
Latest Outlook and Valuation
Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  we expect Texas Instruments to report adjusted earnings of  4 99 per share and total revenue of  15 64 billion  These results would represent year over year growth rates of 16 6  and 4 6   respectively 
Heading into the week  TXN was trading at 19 2x forward 12 month earnings  Over the past year  its Forward P E has been as high as 26 2 and has low as 18 9  It has traded with a median forward earnings multiple of 20 6x in that time  Its industry peers are currently sporting an average Forward P E of 18 3  Investors might conclude that the stock is slightly discounted compared to where it has traded recently but also slightly more expensive that its industry average 
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Texas Instruments surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Texas Instrument is currently holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an Earnings ESP of  1 4   This means that the most recent analyst estimates have been slightly lower than the consensus  In other words  our model is not conclusively calling for a beat 
Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of Texas Instrument s report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices  The firm has met or surpassed estimates in each of the trailing ten quarters  but the stock has not always generated positive momentum during earnings season 
We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report  Over the course of Texas Instrument s streak  shares of turned positive in just five of these windows

According to Texas Instruments chief executive Richard Templeton  who will be leaving the company  the company s revenue growth was due to the ongoing and stronger demand from the automotive and industrial businesses and sector  Texas Instruments chief operating officer Brian Crutcher is set to replace Templeton in June as chairman 
Weak Q1 2018 Outlook

But I ve changed my tune on Texas Instruments  There really is no negative to this stock  It is a powerhouse that consistently delivers for shareholders  And looking toward the future  it looks as though it will continue to deliver 
Let s take a closer look at Texas Instruments so you too can see how this might be the safest stock to invest in 
Investing In Texas Instruments
To fully understand Texas Instruments  you have to go back to the beginning  back in 1930  This is when the company was founded as an oil company  It wasn t until the 1970s when it shifted its focus to computer processors when things started to happen 
Today  Texas Instruments makes computer chips  They have 2 main areas of expertise here  in both embedded and analog processors  Here is what each of these do 

Embedded processors  the brains of any electronic device
Analog processors  allows the computer to interact with humans by turning the real world into the digital world

Over the years  Texas Instruments has been a steady source for both income via dividends and through share price appreciation 
In their most recent earnings release  earnings per share came in at  1 24 beating estimates by  0 12  Revenues were up as well  coming in at  4 1 billion  This was an increase of 12  and they beat estimates here as well by  210 million 
In fact  the company has a history of consistently beating earnings reports  The company also has a history of increasing the dividend it pays too  They have raised the dividend for 14 straight years and the grow rate of the dividend alone is 24  
The Future For Texas Instruments
Of course  when investing  we want to make sure that the future looks bright for any stock we are considering  and Texas Instruments fits the bill here 
On the production front  new technologies in manufacturing are driving down the costs to produce processors  This is growing the profit margins for the company 
On top of that  they are also growing sales  Two areas in particular are automobiles and industrial  With automobiles for example  as more car makers add technology to their vehicles  Texas Instruments is there to supply the processors 
And we haven t even talked about the potential Internet of Things market yet 
Finally  Texas Instruments has a diverse list of clients it sells to  And for me  this is the best feature of the company  They have over 100 000 customers in 6 different user markets  These user markets can be further broken out to 35 sub markets 
So any decline in one area should not have a major impact on how Texas Instruments does business 
When it comes to earnings  analysts expect the company to grow 10  in 2018 and around this same target for the next 3 years 
Final Thoughts
Overall  Texas Instruments is a slam dunk  They are keeping costs low  growing sales and have a diverse customer base  In all  they are a prime target for any investor looking for long term  steady growth  And when you look that their stock chart  you see this played out perfectly 
Add in a growing dividend and there isn t anything to dislike about the stock  That is unless you want an investment that provides a sky high growth rate  But for me  I d rather invest in Texas Instruments and enjoy the smooth ride

First  we must understand that the most basic idea of technical analysis  that the idea of  old resistance becoming new support   and when that new support becomes a  confirmed  support  that s when the powerful move can commence  which I would like to describe it as an  inauguration of a the primary term uptrend  
Once the primary term uptrend is established and cultivated  it can very well last for years  I mean YEARS    and it won t be easily dismantled without the proper topping pattern 
Today  it seems like everyone is complaining about how so many stocks are in  high valuation  or  extended  or  overbought   however  these stocks I am going to present to you are not in that category as you will see in the charts below 

MGM Resorts International  N MGM 
After the major crash in 2008 2009  MGM bottomed in 2010 and stayed in the  accumulation  phase  aka  Stage 1   for about 4 years before it started to breakout around 2014 
What we have to understand is  that the  breakout  itself can be very difficult to predict because we all know that the trend does not establish with straight up move and there coule always be traps  so what does stocks do  It pulls back down to the  old resistance  level for a retest 
This stock did that mid to late this year and currently bouncing back up  I can t say that MGM is ready for a  trip to the moon  right now  but what I can say is  that as long as the buyers can protect that  15  18 level  the true power move might be in stored in the long term perspective if we can confirm the bounce on that support 


Broadcom Corp  O BRCM 
Same scenario here   45 level must be protected for a continuation to the upside 
Currently  the price action is in  retesting  phase meaning we are now retesting the old resistance as new support  It s  testing  so we must confirm the bounce before concluding that the price is going higher  which we haven t seen much as of today 
Once we can confirm the bounce right on that new support level  green arrow   primary term uptrend development might be on it s way looking at a long term perspective  

Texas Instruments Incorporated  O TXN 
It looks like TXN has found support in  40ish level  and finding buyers last few months as the price is now back at the recent highs at  59ish  So unlike the MGM and BRCM  this stock has progressed to the upside and now retesting the previous highs again 
We may or may not fall from this level  but I would not engage right now  but rather wait and see how it s going to deal with this level first  Long term outlook is still very much attractive  but in the event that the price falls back down to  40ish level  we want to see  35  40 level holding and bouncing back up to keep this move resuming back up 

Why Important  QQQ 
Since the crash in 2000  QQQ was in a long consolidation accumulation phase from 2000   2010  That s whopping 10 years 
In early 2012  it finally broke above the resistance level  red arrows   and in late 2011  it came down to retest that level as new support  green arrow  
Once the bounce was confirmed right on that new support area  it got into a strong bullish uptrend for 4 years  and that s a strong bullish move  That s what we call   Public Participation  Stage 2   
MGM  BRCM    TXN all have very similar price pattern sentiment occurring  and I am proposing the high possibility of that  Public Participation  Stage 2   phase coming into these names",2015-11-02,Kay Kim,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-set-to-soar-270027,270027

Texas Instruments  O TXN   broke a falling expanding wedge to by moving higher to start October  It consolidated briefly under the 200 day SMA before gapping higher to the prior high from March  It has consolidated since then 
The price action in consolidation is a bullish Deep Crab harmonic  That is good news for long holders  But the pattern looks for a reversal higher  after attaining the Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  at 53 18 below  This would close the gap as well 
The momentum indicators are supporting a continued move lower  lining up with this view  The RSI is running down and into the mid line with the MACD is falling  There is support lower at 56 and then at 53 followed by 51 80 and 51 15  Resistance higher comes at 57 75 and 59 65  Short interest is low at 2 3  
Looking at the options chain this week shows large open interest at 60 and 60 5 above on the call side  There is also big open interest at 57 above on the put side  These could influence it higher by the end of the week  In the December chain the open interest is large at 50 on the put side and 60 on the call side  January options see open interest spread but mostly to the downside

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into November Options Expiration and the last week before the shortened Thanksgiving holiday  sees the Equity markets have again shown an inability to make new highs  without giving up the positive longer term perspective 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its downtrend  but with a possible short term reversal while Crude Oil works lower  The US Dollar Index looks to continue higher while US Treasuries are biased lower  but also may see a short term reversal  The Shanghai Composite is building energy for another leg higher while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside again 
Volatility looks to remain above the lower range  making things difficult for equities  but looking for a pullback after the spike in short order  The equity index ETF s N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  all look better to the downside this week  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
