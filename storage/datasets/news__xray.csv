to  678 million  up 16  from the prior year quarter s figure  TAVR underlying sales grew 18  in the quarter  Per management  the solid performance can be attributed to the recent clinical evidence supporting SAPIEN 3 therapy In Europe  TAVR sales improved in the mid teens from the year ago quarter  In fact  Edwards Lifesciences is continuing with the commercial introduction of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra system in Europe  which is estimated to account for major portion of TAVR sales in Europe by 2019 end  Additionally  the company s landmark PARTNER 3 low risk trial demonstrated superiority for the SAPIEN 3 valve over surgery in the low risk patient population Surgical Structural Heart sales in the quarter totaled  218 million  increasing 15  from the prior year quarter s figure and 2  on an

aortic valve procedures Critical Care sales totaled  184 million in the second quarter  up 9  from the year ago quarter  both on a reported and an underlying basis  Per management  all the product categories contributed to this upside  bolstered by substantial growth in HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform sales in the United States TMTT sales totaled  7 million primarily attributable to

significant clinical and regulatory milestones in 2019  Additionally  the company estimates global TMTT opportunity to reach  3 billion by 2024 MarginsIn the second quarter  gross margin expanded 200 bps to 76 4   due to favorable impacts from foreign exchange rates and product mix  However  investments in the global supply chain expansion partially offset the improvement SG A expenses rose 12  year over year to  308 million  driven primarily by field personnel related expenses  partially negated by the strengthening of the U S  dollar R D expenditures increased 25  year over year to  192

rate  up 40  year over year   led by FreeStyle Libre  Libre is once again expected to perform exceptionally well  registering strong worldwide sales in the to be reported quarter  In the first quarter  Libre sales growth was 80  According to Abbott  FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership among CGM systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users  In order to meet the spurt in demand for Libre  Abbott is currently adding a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity  which will come online  starting from the second half of 2019 Meanwhile  on Jun 17  the company announced the launch of its Afinion HbA1c Dx assay for use on the Afinion 2 Analyzer and the Afinion AS100 Analyzer  This is the first and the only rapid point of care test cleared by the FDA to aid the diagnosis of diabetes and the assessment of patients  risk of developing the condition This new development is expected to contribute to the company s to be reported quarter s top line Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  598 million for second quarter Diabetes Care revenues indicates a rise of 27 2  from the year ago period s reported figure Alike the prior reported quarter  Abbott in the impending quarterly release  is anticipated to gain from a solid performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division  EPD  business  which has been recording operational sales growth over the last few quarters  Per Abbott  its EPD business is growing at a faster pace than the market rate across the key emerging markets  which represent the most attractive long term growth countries for branded generics portfolio  These include India  Brazil  Russia and China among others Management expects a mid single digit uptick within EPD in the second quarter comprising mid to high single digit growth in the priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales  which reflects the recent discontinuation of a non core low margin third party supply agreement Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 11 billion for EPD revenues suggests a 1 9  slip from the year earlier period s reported number We are optimistic about the consistently sturdy Diagnostics business  courtesy of robust contributions from all sub segments  namely Core Laboratories Diagnostics  Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care  We are impressed by the accelerated output of the company s Alinity international sales  Currently in Europe  the company is converting its existing customers to Alinity and is winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate   In the United states  this business is growing more rapidly than its market rate Per Abbott  it is well positioned for sustainable growth in years to come  based on the company s rollout of the full suite of Alinity systems across additional geographies including the United States Within Rapid Diagnostics  the company forecasts low to mid single digit sales growth for the second quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 93 billion for Diagnostic revenues implies a 3  improvement from the figure registered in the comparable quarter last year We also encouragingly note that Nutrition is Abbott s most speedily growing business owing to aging population  increasing rate of chronic diseases and the rise of the middle class in the emerging markets  Furthermore  Abbott s pediatric nutrition business continues to thrive in the United States  For the second quarter  the company currently projects mid single digit sales growth However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 88 billion for Nutritional revenues indicates a 1 23  dip from the number registered in the prior year quarter What the Model SuggestsThe proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

operational issues at the European Distribution Center in Venlo  Netherlands  Further  the company is likely to witness better performance at Technology   Equipment in the first quarter  which can partly be attributed to resolution of the 2018 inventory destocking and introduction of substantial innovations The company is likely to have reported higher European revenues  primarily driven by solid consumable sales and recovery from the Venlo distribution center  This apart  the company s global platform helps it to benefit from faster growing international markets  This in turn  might have resulted in higher world revenues in the to be reported quarter Per management  the company might record lower revenues in the first quarter  compared with the year ago quarter owing to dentists

124349,345864,XRAY,Top MedTech Stocks Safe From Graham Cassidy Repeal Bill ,opinion,"Over the past few months  the medical device space has been witnessing considerable upheaval owing to a confluence of factors  This has affected the fortunes of MedTech bigwigs like Cardinal Health Inc   NYSE CAH    DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc   NASDAQ XRAY   and Penumbra Inc   NYSE PEN   
The investment climate for medical device majors has become increasingly volatile due to political potshots in Capitol Hill  for and against Obamacare  This is due to the fact that the GOP is making one final push on an Affordable Care Act repeal bill  The legislation  commonly referred to as Graham Cassidy  aims to convert the Medicaid and premium subsidy dollars into a block grant structure giving freedom of spending to states 
Past fortnight has witnessed extensive lobbying for and against the Graham Cassidy bill by legislators to garner for and against the required 50 votes at the Senate  The trend is expected to continue till September 30  Earlier  Obamacare assured coverage to people with pre existing ailments and restricted insurers from charging them based on health conditions 
The Senate Bill  however  will allow insurers to provide less than required coverage in states that get waivers for essential health benefits  However  the changes would not take effect until 2020 but would slash Medicaid budgets to the tune of almost 25  by 2026 
How Is MedTech Positioned 
Though the space remains volatile  there are many stocks in the MedTech domain that promise growth  The question now arises that how to pick  safe stocks from the various industries of the MedTech space  in such a scenario  Within the Zacks Industry classification  it is broadly grouped into the  sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into important areas like Medical   Instruments  Medical   Products and Medical   Dental Supplies 
Screening Criteria
In this article  we have picked a winner from each of the aforementioned areas that have traded higher than the S P 500 index through the past one year  Also  based on their strong fundamentals  strategic implementation  planned execution and certain positive catalysts  they carry a huge upside potential and a high probability of outperforming the S P 500 index in the coming days 
These stocks currently flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a  of A or B  Here  V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics  Such a score allows investors to eliminate negative aspects of stocks and select favorable ones  Their market capitalization is in multi billions  testifying to their strong liquidity 
The 2017 estimate revision trend is significantly positive and earnings growth expectation is above the S P 500  Finally  the industry s lower than market positioning calls for more upside to offset any further volatility in Capitol Hill 

The Dental Supplies industry is currently ranked  185  It fell from last week s  170  The industry has underperformed the S P 500 by shedding 0 25  over the past month  The index  on the other hand  has gained 1 94   By applying Zacks wisdom in this space  we are bullish on STAAR Surgical Company   NASDAQ STAA   
Monrovia  CA based Staar Surgical develops  manufactures and distributes products used by ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals to improve or correct vision in patients suffering from refractive conditions  cataracts and glaucoma  With a price surge of approximately 14 06  over the last six months  this Zacks Rank  2 stock is an attractive pick  Earnings for this company are expected to grow 9 25  over the next five year period  You can see  


The Instruments industry is currently ranked  97  It fell from last week s  88  The industry has underperformed the S P 500 by registering a gain of only 0 97  over the past month  The index has gained only 1 94   In this space  we are bullish on Masimo Corporation   NASDAQ MASI   
Irvine  CA based Masimo develops  manufactures and markets a family of non invasive monitoring systems  With a price surge of approximately 27 26  year to date  this Zacks Rank  2 stock is an attractive pick  Earnings for this company are expected to grow 11 10  over the next five year period 


The Products industry is currently ranked  174  falling from  161 during last week   The industry has underperformed the S P 500 by registering a gain of only 1 80  over the past month  The index on the other hand has rose 1 94    In this space  we are bullish on Smith   Nephew  LON SN  plc   NYSE SNN   
Smith   Nephew  headquartered in London  U K   is a manufacturer and distributor of advanced medical devices in the sports medicine  joint reconstruction  trauma and wound management areas  With a price surge of approximately 19 68  year to date  this Zacks Rank  2 stock is an attractive pick  Earnings for this company are expected to grow 9 09  this year

124384,345899,XRAY,Medical Device Consolidation Frenzy  Here s How To Play It,opinion,By now we all know how Medtronic knocked Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   from its indisputable position as the top firm in the medical devices space  thanks to the  43 billion Covidien merger last year  It s really amazing to see how a single mega consolidation reshuffled the dynamics of the entire medical devices space And after that the industry hasn t taken a breather  Deals like Zimmer Biomet   NYSE ZBH    Johnson   Johnson  Synthes and Thermo Fisher Life Technologies and many more gave birth to unprecedented leaders in their respective niche markets  A number of untoward factors in the global economy over the past one and a half years did nothing to stop the pace of these consolidations In fact  going by the last available EvaluateGroup data  the first half of 2015 saw 86 mergers and acquisitions  totaling  83 billion  a rise of 166  from the year ago period  Although the next report is not yet released  the unofficial talk is that the full year target of  100 billion of M A valuation was effortlessly reached with the legacy continuing into 2016 Behind M A Boom in Turbulent TimesOver the decades  medical device companies resorted to acquisitions to harness their strength and diversify offerings  The medical device majors struggling with their core businesses are often on the lookout for emerging therapies through acquisitions and alliances  which help them to stay on the top with respect to market capitalization  Small scale players  on the other hand  capable of cultivating new value offerings  are often seen to develop themselves as potential acquisition targets for the stalwarts Historically  this has been the key distinctive feature of the medical device market  But what is surprising is the fact that these transactions have grown in pace in defiance of mounting economic concerns   Delving a little into this has made the whys and wherefores clear Large deals are more strategic now  According to many economists  earlier consolidation opportunities were not necessarily strategic  Instead  those were more focused on building a particular solution  However  big players are now exploring opportunities to capture an entire disease area or certain emerging problems so that the consolidated company can come out with the best possible solution set  Becton Dickinson s  13 billion acquisition of CareFusion is a perfect example of such a consolidation Increasing consolidation outside U S   Since 2014  M As by U S  firms have significantly increased outside the nation  While this was partly because of growing regulatory demand  tax related hazards  reimbursement and pricing pressure  the fact remains that the competitive nature of the U S  market has left no space for these players  A report by Financier Worldwide Magazine stated that  investments in the sector  particularly in cost efficiency technologies  are witnessing a gradual spike as efforts to cut reimbursements as well as healthcare costs take shape  Dearth of venture funding  As if the smaller MedTech players didn t have trouble enough  the growing difficulties related to the venture funding landscape have made their lives even worse  2015 s data by Evaluate MedTech shows that the value of venture financing dropped 14  in in the first half with a 13  decrease in deal count  This was in fact part of an ongoing trend of falling investment observed over the past few years  affecting the early stage businesses the most  This funding situation is getting more challenging day by day  forcing smaller companies to join the big hands to survive and pursue product development Complex and Time Taking Product Approval Process  The highly regulated U S  medical device industry is hampered by stringent and complex procedures leading to product approval delays  In fact  according to a report based on a survey of over 200 medical technology companies  FDA Impact on U S  Medical Technology Innovation   the U S  FDA takes significantly more time to review compared to its European counterpart  These complications often drive MedTech companies to consolidate with their larger peers to brace themselves from the loss generated from these delays Recent Mega Consolidations at a GlanceA glance of the recently developed M A agreements shows that each of these deals falls in line with at least one of the above discussed reasons Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT     St  Jude Medical   NYSE STJ    in April  Abbott announced its decision to consolidate with St  Jude Medical for a deal value of  25 billion  Post completion  this will create a leader in high growth cardiovascular markets  including atrial fibrillation  structural heart and heart failure as well as earn a leading position in the high growth neuromodulation market DENTSPLY International   NASDAQ XRAY     Sirona  A  that closed in March  The consolidation is aimed at forming a leading global manufacturer of professional dental products and materials Thermo Fisher   NYSE TMO     Affimetrix  Thermo Fisher  following the Life Technologies buyout  has undertaken several meaningful acquisitions as part of its strategy to effectively deploy capital  The latest in the league was the company s  for a value of  1 3 billion  The acquisition is expected to boost Thermo Fisher s biosciences and genetic analysis portfolio Thermo Fisher   FEI Company   NASDAQ FEIC     for  4 2 billion will enable it to access FEI s industry leading high performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study  which in turn facilitates life science research Medtronic   NYSE MDT     HeartWare   NASDAQ HTWR    This June  Medtronic entered into an   for a total value of  1 1 billion  This acquisition is expected to significantly boost Medtronic s cardiac rhythm and heart failure business  alongside providing a strong foothold in the global niche How to Gain from the Race to Merge The increasing trend of strategic mega consolidations and sector convergence among medical device companies reveal ways of how they re seeking new sources of revenues and R D opportunities at optimum costs and minimum risks While nothing can be said conclusively about where the sector is headed  an opportunistic investor may take advantage of the changing dynamics by investing in stocks of the companies for which the benefits from consolidation are clear or a turnaround is underway Here are 3 such stocks Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY    This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company s recent decision to buy agrochemical giant Monsanto Company  NYSE MON  for a colossal  62 billion is expected to provide accretion to Bayer s core earnings in the mid single digit percentage in the first full year of the closing of the transaction  followed by double digit percentage growth thereafter Another Zacks Rank  2 holder Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc  s spine portfolio is expected to get a major boost with the impending acquisition of the French spine device maker LDR Holding Corp    NASDAQ LDRH    for a total deal value of  1 billion NuVasive  Inc    NASDAQ NUVA    a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company  is also a solid pick in this respect based on its recent agreement to acquire privately held Biotronic NeuroNetwork for a deal value of  88 million  This acquisition will not only enhance NuVasive s spine

124413,345928,XRAY,I Like These Two Health Care Stocks,opinion,"One of the problems with pure play biotechnology stocks is that they are 100  risk capital securities in which the probability of success is entirely beyond your control 
But healthcare and related industry investments are very much worthwhile in an equity market portfolio for the simple reason that they can be so profitable 
One company that serves the healthcare industry  but isn t a pure play drug discovery enterprise  is Bio Reference Laboratories  Inc   NASDAQ BRLI  Based in Elmwood Park  New Jersey  this stock is an interesting way to play the sector 
Bio Reference is the third largest diagnostic laboratory in the U S  The company s customers are physicians  hospitals  long term care facilities  and government institutions  It has laboratory testing facilities in nine states and provided 7 8 million laboratory test requisitions in 2013  which continue to grow at a double digit rate 
The company s latest quarter set a new record in total revenues  Sales grew a solid 20  to  222 million on a 16  increase in patient count and a three percent increase in revenue per patient 
Quarterly earnings came in at  15 3 million  or  0 55 per diluted share  compared to  14 7 million  or  0 53 per diluted share  in the same quarter last year 
Company management said its earnings per share for the upcoming fiscal quarter should grow approximately 15  above the most recent quarter 
Over the last 10 years  Bio Reference has really found its stride as an enterprise and the stock is finally breaking out of a two year price consolidation 
The company is now involved in genetic testing and believes that this will be a growth business going forward 
The stock jumped after the company s recent earnings results and is likely to experience more capital gains near term 
Healthcare related equity investments have proven to provide good returns over time  In the specific case of biotechnology stocks  investment risk is extremely high 
The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was taking a well deserved break since this past March  but is breaking out once again and pushing new all time highs 
Speculative fervor for risk capital stocks diminished earlier in the year  but it s slowly returning to both biotechnology and the broader healthcare sector 
Picking stocks in this area offers a gamut of opportunity and investment risk 
DENTSPLY International Inc   NASDAQ XRAY  is a company we looked at late last year in these pages   See  Why These Stocks Are Long Term Portfolio Must Haves   
This company is what I view as recession resistant  It s not the fastest growing medical supplier  but it s still a good business and has proven to be a consistent wealth creator over the long term 
Generally speaking  right now isn t a great time to be a new buyer of equities  But it is a good time to be re evaluating your investments  Long term holdings should have exposure to the healthcare sector for its stability  growth  and income potential 
There are 16 stock market subsectors within the massive healthcare industry  The most valuable in terms of stock market capitalization are the major drug manufacturers  followed by biotechnology companies  generic drug manufacturers  and then medical appliances and equipment
