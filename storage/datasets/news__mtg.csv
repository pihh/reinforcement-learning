highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  4 Insurance Stocks for Your Investment Portfolio in 2020The insurance sector has had an impressive 2019  following a decline in 2018  Insurance price gains across most of its business lines  introduction of new products and services  ongoing consolidation and robust capital position drove the insurance industry in 2019  This was  however  partially offset by low interest rates and losses from catastrophes The insurance sector is considered a defensive sector for investors in times of economic uncertainty  The year 2019  was marked by global economic volatility induced primarily by U S China trade war The Zacks Insurance industry in the past year rose by 22 1  in contrast to the decline of 6 5  in 2018    The S P 500 index rallied 26 7  in 2019 Growth Drivers for 2020The industry has witnessed persistent increase in premium pricing over past several quarters and the momentum is likely to continue in the days ahead  which in turn will drive the top line  Insurance rates for commercial  property  personal  financial and professional lines of business have been rising over the past quarters A report by Marsh stated that  U S  pricing has been trending up and continues to firm  The general trend was toward a firming of prices across the majority of coverage lines  There has been a steady upward trend in pricing in the US since the third quarter of 2017  Strength of the U S  economy as evident from low unemployment and strong consumer confidence will keep the federal interest rates on hold for now  Insurance companies will be better off investing their surplus funds in 2020  then they had been in 2019 when the federal interest rates were slashed thrice A strong economy will also favor businesses to scale up and grow  This  in turn  will fuel demand for commercial insurance  which protects business owners and their employees  It includes protection from damage to property or injury to employees  or more commonly referred to public liability and employers  liability in insurance parlance Further  life insurance companies have made changes to their products to make them more resilient to headwinds arising from low interest rates  This has been done by limiting or removing products that offered guaranteed returns of the shelves and shifting toward protection products of unit linked savings products  which pass the investment risks onto policyholders Moreover insurers are adopting analytics  technology  AI  in order to gain operating efficiency and reduce cost   This shift to technology should continue in 2020 as well While sturdy capital level will support consolidations  strategic investments and dividend increase and share buybacks will continue to drive growth In the backdrop of favorable operating

151888,373404,MTG,Avoid AIG  Add These 3 Insurance Stocks To Your Portfolio,opinion,The stock of American International Group Inc    NYSE AIG   fell out of favor with investors  mainly due to its weak General Insurance segment  high debt level and catastrophe loss  Moreover  the company has witnessed its 2019 and 2020 estimates move 0 4  and 0 2  south  respectively  over the past seven days The company s earnings missed estimates in two of the last four quarters  the average negative surprise being  51 90   Given the headwinds plaguing the company  we believe that its stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters Shares of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company have lost 6 5  in the past six months against its  s growth of 0 2  and the S P 500 Index s gain of 9 2   In 2018  the company lost 33 9   higher than its industry s decline of 16  Why is the Stock Down American International Group s revenues have been declining since 2013  The lackluster results were an outcome of lower premium in the company s Life and Retirement business and high catastrophe losses  Although the metric increased marginally in the first nine months of 2019  its persistent downtrend poses a threat to the company The company s property and casualty business exposes it to weather related losses  It has been incurring catastrophe losses over the years  which weighed on its underwriting margins  The company s susceptibility to weather related losses might continue to hurt its earnings Moreover  the company s debt load has been consistently rising since 2015  Its debt to equity ratio of 52 3  is higher than the industry average of 41 7   Further  times interest earned ratio declined to 3 43X from 7 1X in 2014  lower than the industry average of 8 8   reflecting the company s reduced ability to meet interest payments  thereby exposing it to high financial risks The company s 4 2  return on equity is lower than its industry average of 8 1   This underlines the company s relative inefficiency in utilizing its shareholders  funds Will the Stock Bounce Back Soon The company has taken a number of growth initiatives  such as containing expenses to generate operating efficiency  reduction in headcount  freezing of pension plans and divestiture of its underperforming units  However  a complete impact of these strategic steps is yet to reflect on the company s results The company continues to execute actions focused on organizational simplification  operational excellence and business rationalization It has also been streamlining its core insurance operations and restructuring businesses by axing unwanted operations  thereby enhancing capital allocation and operating leverage  Since 2008  the company has made more than 50 asset sales and divestitures  leading to proceeds in excess of  100 billion  These divestments were done to generate money for repaying the bailout funds to the U S  government  realign the company with huge unrelated operations creating very little synergistic benefits  focus on core operations to reap higher returns on equity and utilize finances for share buybacks The company has also been trying to expand its business through strategic acquisitions  CEO Brian Duperreault made a significant shift in its capital deployment and now expects to utilize the same for possible buyouts in the international markets  thus boosting the company s personal and life segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resources for share repurchases A Glance at the IndustryThe insurance industry is thriving on the back of rising premium in most of its business lines  sound financial strength and the use of technology for increasing operational efficiency Also  surplus capital levels across the industry led to record share buybacks and dividend hikes  increasing shareholders  returns The companies are well poised for growth on the back of tactical acquisitions  higher premium pricing  etc  Growing adoption of technologies like AI  robotic process automation  cognitive intelligence or blockchain and cloud computing should help insurers control costs  A solid financial standing should continue to support growth strategies  mergers and takeovers  et al However  multiline insurers  profits are vulnerable to catastrophes because of the presence of property coverage in their bundle   Choosing Favorable Insurance StocksWhile American International Group doesn t appear an attractive pick right now  there are a few insurance stocks that can be good investment options  Before we check out those  let s see how the industry is performing The group s  is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks The Zacks Multi line

Officer  Nathan Colson I want to remind all participants that our earnings release of this morning  which may be accessed on our website  which is located at mtg mgic com under Newsroom  includes

that such guidance or forward looking statements are current at any time other than the time of this call or the issuance of the 8 K Now with that  let me turn the call over to our CEO Tim Mattke Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mike  Good morning  I m pleased to report that the solid financial results for the fourth quarter capped a strong 2019 as we continued to execute on our strategies and kept our focus on the long term success of our Company  In a few minutes  Nathan will cover the details of the financial results  But before he does  let me make a few comments First  our GAAP net income of  674 million was an all time high and we are very proud of this accomplishment  Our insurance in force increased approximately 6  year over year  despite the increase in mortgage refinancings that lowered our annual persistency  Reflecting the size of the origination market  our market presence and our increased share of refinancing transactions  we rolled 26  more new insurance than we did in 2018  In addition  the new insurance we rolled has strong credit characteristics and is expected to generate meaningful returns for shareholders Overall  current credit conditions are favorable  The number of new delinquency notices received continues to be low and cure rates remain strong  both of which should be good news for losses incurred in 2020  We increased the amount of capital we are able to upstream from our insurance subsidiary MGIC to our holding company from  220 million in 2018 to  280 million in 2019  There is more news on that front for 2020 that I ll address in a minute We used a portion of the increased holding company liquidity to return capital to our shareholders  repurchasing shares of our common stock and reestablishing our common stock dividend  These actions supported our strategy to manage and deploy capital to maximize our long term value  Over the last year or so  we have been asked about this capital management strategy Let me take a moment to address that issue  First  let me say that capital strategy cannot be static  it must be dynamic  This is particularly pertinent today because our business model has transitioned to one where we still acquire  manage mortgage risk  but we now more actively seek to reduce the volatility of losses and diversify our capital base to reinsurance and capital market transactions We have used quota share transactions since 2013 and have used insurance linked note transaction executed in the capital markets portions of the 2016 through 2019 books  We have been able to execute these transactions at attractive cost of capital and intend to continue to use these capital sources when it makes long term economic sense  In addition to diversifying our sources of capital  these transactions enhance our returns and reduce losses in weaker economic environments With our business model  there will be times where we generate more capital than we can prudently deploy in acquiring residential mortgage risk that meets our risk adjusted return targets  In those times  we assess our next best alternatives for our capital  including returning it to shareholders  We prefer to deploy capital by acquiring residential mortgage risk as a primary mortgage insurer  but we certainly will look to other ways to use our capital and expertise  such as by participating in GSE credit risk transfer transactions The increased use of quota share insurance linked notes decreases our reliance on traditional debt and equity sources of capital  This impacts how we consider the allocation of our capital in the future  So as we routinely consider the level of capital that we retained for future deployment versus return to shareholders  the levels will vary based upon the business environment we are or expect to be in Our balance sheet is currently strong from both a statutory and PMIERs perspective  reflecting our balance sheet strength and our outlook over the next 12 to 24 months  I m pleased to tell you that in January of this year  MGIC received the necessary approvals to pay a  320 million special dividend and a  70 million quarterly dividend to our holding company  Our Board also authorized an additional  300 million share repurchase program  This is in addition to the  111 million remaining under the 2019 authorization Circling back to the core business  I would characterize the total mortgage origination market as healthy  Consumer confidence remains strong and mortgage rates remain attractive  While the supply of homes available for sale is still tight  there is strong demand for homeownership  Our current expectation is that the 2020 total mortgage origination market will be approximately  2 trillion  which is down modestly from 2019  primarily due to fewer refinancing transactions  And of course  keep in mind that the amount of refinancing transaction is clearly the most difficult item to forecast  so there could be some variability in this outlook As we look ahead to 2020  I remain optimistic about our ability to prudently grow our insurance in force given the healthy mortgage origination market  our capital strength and our position in the market  We estimate that our primary insurance in force will grow in the mid single digit range in 2020  This rate of growth assumes annual persistency improves over the course of the year from its current level and then we write new insurance in the  55 billion to  60 billion range  We are focused on the long term success of the Company  We do that by offering competitive products and services to customers  while maintaining a sharp focus on expected risk adjusted returns on capital and expenses  We think this is a winning strategy for all stakeholders With that let me turn it over to Nathan Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Tim  In the fourth quarter  we earned  177 1 million of net income or  0 49 per diluted share  which compares to  0 43 per diluted share from the same period last year  For the quarter  we generated an annualized 17  return on beginning shareholders  equity Net premiums earned increased 8   compared to the same period last year  which was primarily driven by two factors  First  insurance in force was higher  although this was partially offset by lower average premium rates on that insurance in force  which I will discuss later  Second  accelerated premiums from single premium policy cancellations increased  5 million in the fourth quarter    increased from  5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 to nearly  20 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 reflecting the strong refinancing market Net losses incurred were  24 million  compared to  28 million for the same period last year  Losses incurred consists of reserves established on new delinquency plus changes to previously established loss reserves  The decrease in net losses incurred  primarily reflects a lower number of new delinquency notices received and a lower claim rate on those notices  During the quarter  we received approximately 3  fewer new delinquency notices than we did in the same period last year  Positive loss reserve development on previously received delinquency notices was modestly higher year over year as well In the quarter 60  of the new delinquency notices were from the legacy books of 2008 and prior  While continuing to diminish in number  we expect that the majority of the new notice activity in the coming quarters will continue to be from the pre 2009 books  As of December 31st  2019  88  of our risk in force is from the 2009 and later  The portfolio supplement we published gives you some insight into the strong credit trends of these books The estimated claim rate on new notices received in the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately 8   which is consistent with the prior quarters of 2019  This estimate reflects the current favorable credit conditions and was lower than the 9  claim rate in the fourth quarter of 2018  The number of loans in our delinquency inventory remains near 20 year lows  The percentage of insured loans that were current at the beginning of the fourth quarter  but were subsequently reported as delinquent during the quarter  continues to remain below 1 5  Reflecting the low level of delinquency inventory and improved cure rates  the number of claims received in the quarter declined by 34  from the same period last year  Primary paid claims declined by 32  from  62 million to  42 million  The net premium yield for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 48 4 basis points  down from 49 6 basis points in the third quarter of 2019  but up from 47 3 basis points in Q4 of 2018 Net premium yield has several components  The largest component is what we call our in force portfolio yield  which reflects the premium rates in effect on our insurance in force  Premium rates on new business have been trending lower over the past several years  As a result  we expect our in force portfolio yield will continue to trend lower as older books of business written at higher premium rates continue to run off and are replaced with new books of business written at lower premium rates The other components of the quarterly net premium yield include accelerated premiums from single premium policy cancellations  changes in premium refunds and the levels of premium ceded to our various reinsurance transactions and the associated profit commission  While the newer books have lower premium rates associated with them  they are also expected to generate low levels of losses and meaningful risk adjusted lifetime returns  In addition  our reinsurance coverage on these books is expected to increase the risk adjusted returns we otherwise would have earned on a direct basis  This is a good point to mention the information we plan to report on a going forward basis We ve been previously reporting quarterly statistics    pardon me  we have been reporting quarterly statistics about our premium rates on new insurance written from monthly premium policies and single premium policies  We d also been reporting monthly statistics about delinquency notices and insurance in force  As we previously announced  we will no longer publish the monthly data about delinquencies  but as we have again this quarter  we will continue to publish the same detailed quarterly statistics about delinquency notices and activity that we currently do  We think that the detailed quarterly information along with the data in the supplement provides insights to how credit is performing on the policies we insure In the beginning of the first quarter of 2020  we will transition away from providing direct premium rates and quarterly NIW to providing information about the quarterly premium yield on our insurance in force  including a reconciliation of the direct yields of the net premium yield  To this quarter  we have included both sets of information  We will continue to report information about new insurance written and insurance in force  both in the press release and the supplement  we post to our website  We believe that our disclosure of direct premium rates on new insurance written has increasingly become sensitive competitive information and overemphasizes one element of estimated risk adjusted returns on new business  which were also impacted by  among other things  expected losses  the amount of required capital and the cost of capital In addition  the disclosure was not an immediate indicator of near term revenues  because it takes a number of years before the premium yield would converge to the premium rates on new business  We believe that our new disclosure of the trends and the components of the net premium yield on the insurance in force can provide meaningful insights into the trend of our near term revenue and value Continuing on with the discussion of the quarter  net underwriting and other expenses before ceding commission were  63 million in the fourth quarter of 2019  which is flat to the same period last year  For 2020  we expect those expenses will increase modestly higher than inflation as we continue to make investments in our franchise  During the fourth quarter  MGIC paid a  70 million dividend to the holding company and we utilized approximately  20 million under our 2019 share repurchase authorization and repurchased 1 4 million shares  We have approximately  111 million of authorization remaining under that program  which runs through the end of 2020 After considering the payment of the common stock dividend  and our share repurchases  the total amount of capital returned to shareholders in the fourth quarter was approximately  42 million and for all of 2019  was  156 million  As Tim mentioned  because of our strong capital and earnings position in January of this year  we received approval from both our Board and our regulator for MGIC to pay the  70 million quarterly dividend and an additional  320 million special dividend to the holding company  We expect MGIC to be able to continue to pay the quarterly dividend at this level going forward The Board also declared a common stock dividend of  0 06 per share payable on February 28th  As a reminder  any future dividend payments to our holding company are subject to approval of our Board and we notify the OCI to ensure it does not object any dividend payments from MGIC  Associated with the approval of the  320 million special dividend from MGIC to our holding company  our Board approved an additional  300 million share repurchase authorization that runs through the end of 2021 The timing and volume of share repurchases in any given period may vary for a variety of reasons  but as we have with prior authorizations  I expect us to execute both the remaining  111 million on the 2019 authorization  as well as the  300 million that was just authorized  Given the strong balance sheet we currently have and the expected outlook for capital generation and needs of the writing company  we feel that the additional share repurchase authorization represents a good use of a portion of our capital and importantly does not limit the Company s strategic options At the end of the fourth quarter  our debt to total capital ratio was approximately 17  and MGIC s available assets for PMIERs purposes totaled  4 6 billion  resulting in a  1 2 billion excess over the Minimum Required Assets  It s difficult to precisely manage our excess available assets  However  some level of excess not only preserves strategic optionality  but it provides an offset against adverse economic scenarios  reliance on third party capital and the potential for increases in capital requirements from the GSEs  should they occur in the future At quarter end  our consolidated cash and investments totaled  5 9 billion  including  325 million of cash and investments at the holding company  Investment income increased year over year  primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio  The consolidated investment portfolio had a mix of 81  taxable and 19  tax exempt securities  a pre tax yield of 3 1  and a duration of 3 9 years So to wrap up  I would say is that 2019 was a great year and we are off to a great start in 2020  And with that  let me turn it back to Tim Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Nathan  Before moving to questions  let me give a quick update on the regulatory and political fronts  Regarding housing finance reform  we remain encouraged about the future role that our Company and industry can play in housing finance  but it continues to be difficult to gauge what actions may be taken and the timing of any such actions As we discussed last quarter  the US Treasury Department issued a plan that outlines administrative and legislative reforms for the housing finance system  The reforms are aimed at reducing taxpayer risk  expanding the private sectors role in housing finance  modernizing the government housing programs and achieving sustainable home ownership  The plan did not contain any detailed directives  so the impact of the plan on our Company and industry is still uncertain Treasury plan calls for the FHFA and CFPB to continue to co ordinate their efforts to avoid market disruptions  To that end  the FHFA is focused on developing their plan for the eventual end of GSE conservatorship  This includes finalizing the capital rule for the GSEs  We expect another proposed capital rule to be released early this year  The FHFA has selected an advisor to assist in developing their plan  The pathway to the end of GSE conservatorship is complicated and will take time to develop and implement The FHFA continues its process of reviewing various pilots and programs the GSEs are involved in  but there have been no updates regarding the IMAGIN and EPMI programs  Our discussions with lenders continue to support the notion that these programs have not gained significant traction to date Regarding the CFPB  we and other mortgage market participants are awaiting the CFPB s update to the definition of Qualified Mortgage or QM and specifically any updates that relate to the so called GSE patch  which is set to expire January 2021  The GSE patch expands the definition of QM to include mortgages eligible to be purchased by the GSEs  even if the mortgages do not meet the debt to income ratio limit of 43  The CFPB has recently indicated that it expects to issue for comment  no later than May 2020  a proposed new ability to repay rule that would replace the use of DTI ratio in the definition of QM with an alternative measure  such as pricing threshold  The CFPB also indicated that it would extend the expiration of this GSE patch until the earlier of the effective date of the proposed alternative or until one of the GSEs exits conservatorship At this point  it s hard to predict an effective date for the proposed alternative as it is yet to be published  and once it is published  it will take several months to request and review public comments before the final rule can be determined  We do not believe that the intent of the CFPB is to restrict access to credit for deserving homeowners or make homeownership materially more expensive or unobtainable  We continue to be actively engaged on all of these topics and we continue to advocate for and remain optimistic that what changes do occur will include the use of private capital  including private MI Our Company and industry offer many solutions and a great value proposition for lenders and consumers to overcome the number one barrier to homeownership  the down payment  I believe that our Company is well positioned to acquire  manage and distribute mortgage credit risk in variety of forms  supported by a robust capital structure that includes our strong balance sheet and where appropriate reinsurance treaties and the capital markets Our business is performing well financially  and we are generating meaningful returns  We are writing high quality new business in what is expected to be a low loss environment  That new business is being added to an existing book of businesses performing exceptionally well  and we are generating significant shareholder value and given our outlook for economic and labor market conditions  we expect that to continue  I m very excited and confident about the future for MGIC With that operator  let s take questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  At this time  we would like to take any questions from the conference today   Operator Instructions  And we have our first question comes from the line of Bose George from KBW  Your line is open  Please go ahead Bose George    Keefe Bruyette   Woods    AnalystHey guys  good morning  Actually first  I wanted to ask about the insurance in force growth  the guidance that you gave for the mid single digits  Do you think your insurance in force growth for    stays in line with the industry  so the modest decline that you re talking about is really something you expect for the industry as a whole Michael J  Zimmerman    Investor RelationsHi  Bose  this is Mike  Still getting a handle on that  right  I mean  obviously market share within individual companies can influence that  but the refi volume    it s really reflecting as we sit here today in expectation of lower refinance volume  And then as to what  how much volume we would get of the market opportunity  So it would seem like the overall market is small    MI market is smaller  but exactly the    the straight pro rata share  Indecipherable  Bose George    Keefe Bruyette   Woods    AnalystOkay  But it s not suggesting anything on share shift  it s really just looking at your size and your expectations there  etc  Okay Michael J  Zimmerman    Investor RelationsYes  that s correct  Yeah  Right  right Bose George    Keefe Bruyette   Woods    AnalystOkay  No  That makes sense  And then  your comments about the repurchase authorization  you mentioned you expect to complete it  The    in terms of timing  can you just say are you expecting to complete it by the  with the goal be to complete it by the 2021 timeline for the authorization Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerYes  it s Tim  I think  yeah  when we put out the date our expectation would be that we complete it by the timeline that s the authorization is in place for Bose George    Keefe Bruyette   Woods    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from B  Riley FBR  Your line is open  Please go ahead Randy Binner    B  Riley FBR    AnalystHey  thanks  Just following up on Bose s  last question  So the    it would be ratable the use of the buyback through the end of the authorization  Just trying to understand how it might come through the forecast Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerHi  This is Tim  I guess from ratable  I guess  when I think about that  I almost think about it being sort of even amount across all the periods  I wouldn t think about it necessarily that way  I think you can think about us being fairly programmatic if we intend to utilize at all  but we might not utilize the same amount of the authorization in every quarter as an example Randy Binner    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  And then the other I guess is a kind of a follow up  and it has to do with MiQ  And just thinking about how the market s reception of that pricing tool  has stabilized or is that still changing  And trying to understand where you might end up on market share this year  I think last year  you gave some share up as you transition to the new tool  And I think my perception is the market is stabilizing there  but would be interested in your perspective on that Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  it s Tim  again  I think when we look at our customers and their adoption of MiQ  I think your reflection that it seems stable at this point  I would tell you I don t    when we talk with our sales group  I don t feel like we have customers that we re trying to push MiQ onto that will not accepted by any means  Our view all along has been  we want to provide the pricing through mechanism that the customers want I think as we roll through 2019  once we got in third early fourth quarter  we felt like we probably hit a fairly stable level on MiQ from a penetration standpoint  And now we just continue to execute on that and sort of customer relationships and feel really good about that moving forward OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Douglas Harter from Credit Suisse  Your line is open  Please go ahead Douglas Harter    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  So take advantage of this question  Since it s the last quarter you re providing it but if you could just talk about the decline in the premium yield on the NIW  it does look like the mix shift continues to kind of move toward lower risk  does that account for kind of all of the sequential decline or is there anything else on sort of the competitive nature of the market that that s driving that decline as well Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThis is Nathan  I would say one of the key parts of returns and our premium rates is the capital required  And we ve seen really throughout 2019 a decline in the required capital under PMIERs as a threshold  but even under    that obviously doesn t include DTI and we ve seen DTIs improve throughout the year as well  So as we think about the capital necessary for the business  we have really seen a pretty big decline throughout the year and continuing through the fourth quarter Douglas Harter    Credit Suisse    AnalystSo that require  is that    is that required capital  is that factoring in kind of the ILNs or is there something else that s or is that just in the mix shift of the better credit quality that you re writing that s lowering that capital requirement Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think it s certainly true  I guess what we would call on a direct basis  So before considering reinsurance or insurance linked notes  but it s    it s true net of those as well  So those continue to be kind of attractive tools in the capital structure as well Douglas Harter    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mackenzie Aron from Zelman   Associates  Please go ahead  Your line is open Mackenzie Aron    Zelman   Associates    AnalystThanks  Good morning  First question on the timing of the special dividend review with the regulator  Can you just talk a little bit about the rationale and their thinking there  And then going forward  is that expected to be an annual conversation Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  This is Nathan  I would say the timing was we really started to have conversations in the second half of last year relative to our capital position  the risk distribution mechanisms available in the market  how we were utilizing them and also the credit quality of the business being written on a direct basis  Those conversations continued into January  And then when we formally requested the  the  320 million dividend we received the approval In terms of going forward  I think the way I would think about it is  we feel like this is the appropriate thing for us to do at this time in the future  we re kind of continuing to reevaluate the capital structure and what we want to do part of this is a function of the business being written today  a function of the reinsurance and ILN markets continuing to be really attractive  If those things persist  then we could be in a position where we have additional capital  but there is other situations that could exist where this might not become something that we do every year So I wouldn t want to leave the impression that the special dividend is an annual special dividend  but a reflection of the strong position that we re currently in Mackenzie Aron    Zelman   Associates    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then  Nathan  can you just quantify the amount of single premium amortizations during the quarter Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  It was  20 million Mackenzie Aron    Zelman   Associates    Analyst 20 million  Okay  Thank you Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Dunn from Dowling   Partners  Your line is open  Please go ahead Geoffrey Dunn    Geoffrey Dunn    AnalystThanks  good morning  I wanted to follow up on the question about the pricing and Tim ask you maybe a different way  Well  I guess  specify what you said about the capital charge coming down over the last year or years  Can you give us maybe the amplitude of the average PMIERs capital charge change over the last year Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGeoff  this is Nathan  I had mentioned that before  but I think the right way to think about it is from the    from like the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019  we ve seen on a PMIERs basis and have moved from the low 7  of risk in force to the low 6s  So I think pretty meaningful change Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think  Geoff  just to that point as Nathan mentioned  that doesn t taken account all the things that we price on for example DTI and so PMIERs cuts DTI at 50 plus DTI  And so when you consider the amount of above 45 DTI and how that changed from 2018  2019  I d argue that it s probably even more pronounced than that Geoffrey Dunn    Geoffrey Dunn    AnalystOkay  And then when you look at your pricing and I d be curious in your thoughts on what you re seeing competitively as well  Do you think    or is MGIC sticking to its normalized loss expectations and longer term cost to capital estimates or have those estimates changed given credit performance and given the recurring nature of the reinsurance and ILN executions Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerGeoff  I know it s a really good question  It s tough to obviously know how others look at it  I can tell you that we look at it through a number of different lenses  We re very focused on making sure we think about things through the cycle  whatever that cycle might look like  And obviously  we ve had a nice extension for a period of time here  but when we consider pricing  we think about different stress environment  so we can be in and what the book will look like I can tell you with the credit quality being where it is  I think there s less volatility around those scenarios  And I think that can be reflected in the pricing  I think the access to the capital markets and their reinsurers is something that you can t ignore  although  I would tell you that we look at returns both on a direct basis as Nathan would say  without that being in place as well as consider how it looks like with those structures in place But again  part of that process is  while we think we have very good relationships with our reinsurers  We think we can sell in the capital markets  we know that those markets can change over time  And so we don t want to become dependent upon those versus take advantage of those outlets when they are available and they are priced attractively  So all that is really what I think we really look at it both on a direct basis and that s what we really prepare most of our information on  but we re not    we don t turn a blind eye to what some of the leverage on returns going to happen from the ILNs and the quota share reinsurance  But we need to also be focused on through the cycle  But with the higher credit quality that does reduce some of the variability and volatility around the losses  I would say Geoffrey Dunn    Geoffrey Dunn    AnalystAll right  So I guess  it sounds like some adjustments going on  but not getting overly aggressive Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think that s a very nice short succinct way to put it Geoff  And that s I think    I think that s what you d expect from us Geoffrey Dunn    Geoffrey Dunn    AnalystOkay  Thanks Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerSure OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko  Your line is open  Please go ahead Jack Micenko    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystHi  good morning  I wanted to come back to the dividend question a little bit  If I look at the run rate  so you re run rating like a  280 million number up to the holdco and then you ve got  320 million one timer  so put that at  700 million  And then if I look at the buyback plus what s not drawn down plus two years a dividend  I get close to like high 600s number  So I guess the question is do we    is it safe to assume you re going to be out of the special dividend conversation now through the end of 2021 when you sort of look at all the sources and uses that you ve laid them out today Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThis is Nathan  I mean  I would say like the way I answered the similar question previously  I wouldn t want to say that we will or won t do anything over the next kind of two year period  We ll continue to reassess the capital structure  the availability of alternative capital  our other needs for that money at the operating company level  and I think could be in a position  where we would go back and ask for kind of beyond the  70 million run rate at some point in the future  We re not    we obviously just got done with this conversation  but I don t think that precludes us from having a conversation about that over the next two years either Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think  Jack  when you think about    we ve had questions before  can we get larger dividends out of MGIC and with the ILN activity being out there  The one thing we ve    I guess  I always been a little bit cautious about is tying dividends out with any one transaction versus viewing sort of the capital in MGIC sort of on a more ongoing basis  And so I think it s a natural spot for us sort of annually to go to the OCI and have a conversation about where we re at  I think we feel really good about the quarterly dividends being sustainable through all different sorts of cycles  And so I think the conversation on the special dividend was really about where we are at this time  And I think we have the opportunity to have those conversations in the future with them as well Jack Micenko    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystOkay  Thanks  And then  Tim  in the prepared comments  you suggested that delinquencies would come down in 2020 versus 2019  The notices ticked up a little bit in  19 versus  18  so I m guessing  while    we re thinking notices now sort of retrade lower or do you expect better cure activity to bring that net delinquency number down next year Michael J  Zimmerman    Investor RelationsJack  this is Mike  I mean you re right at the comments on there  but I mean  we re in a pretty low level right now  So as I think 3  year over year decline in new notice activity  So it s going to be in that range  we re running like 1 3   1 4  of the portfolio rolling delinquent each quarter  I think it s    those are kind of the metrics  So we re looking for any dramatic changes to those numbers Jack Micenko    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystOkay  So it s more of the same Michael J  Zimmerman    Investor RelationsYeah Jack Micenko    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystAll right  Okay  Thanks Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Gamaitoni from Compass Point  Your line is open  Please go ahead Chris Gamaitoni    Compass Point    AnalystGood morning  everyone Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Michael J  Zimmerman    Investor RelationsGood morning Chris Gamaitoni    Compass Point    AnalystI wanted to follow up on the same questions everyone else is asking  So if I do my math  I get there is  there ll be roughly  200 million more coming in from the sub over the next two years based off the quarterly dividends and the announced special versus kind of the usage  Just what    what s the plan for that  What are the opportunities out there for that additional  200 million given  you have  325 right now at the holdco 16  debt to cap  It doesn t seem like there s not a lot of deleveraging or additional capital you need for deleveraging at this point Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey Chris  it s Nathan  Can you just    I m not following on the  200 million above the    can you just walk me through the math that you re   Chris Gamaitoni    Compass Point    AnalystSure  So it s to  280 million regular dividends each year  it s  560 million   320 million is special  880 million  annual dividends  I believe   165 million debt expense of  110 million to  75 million to get you  600 million  So there is  880 million coming in   600 million going out  about  200 million delta Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So you re looking out through  20   21   Phonetic Chris Gamaitoni    Compass Point    AnalystYes   20   21  two year period  Just because the authorizations for two years for the  300 million Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGot it  Yes  I mean I think at this point  we ll continue to evaluate the uses for that money  We obviously have the quarterly dividend  the share repurchase authorization  As we ve kind of demonstrated here  we ve been able to get increased authorizations over time  we ve been able to get them even before the other authorizations have expired  So I think over time  we ll have options for that money  but nothing to kind of highlight today Chris Gamaitoni    Compass Point    AnalystOkay  Yes  I was wondering  if there s any other non buyback opportunities you re thinking about or anything we should put in our mind that might become interesting Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt s certainly something that we continue to evaluate  but nothing to highlight at this point and nothing that I would think in the near term we d be communicating in that front Chris Gamaitoni    Compass Point    AnalystOkay  that s all I had  Thank you so much Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Chris OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America  Your line is open  Please go ahead Mihir Bhatia    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my question  Just want to go back real quick to the premium yields and maybe since we re going to talk about in force premium yields going forward  maybe I ll talk about that  Just wondering  is there something special that we should be focused on in Q4  maybe it s like    it was refis or something  where the    it seems like the in force  the decline in force premium yields accelerated pretty materially in Q4  What would drive that Michael J  Zimmerman    Investor RelationsMihir  this is Mike  I mean  I think you have a number of things  right  that are going into that  you have the cumulative effect of all the  the pricing that has been going on and the new business that s been coming on for the last several quarters  excited by a little bit faster prepaid in the fourth quarter  So you re going to be a little bit higher turning up   Phonetic  again  we look at annual persistency  you look at that quarterly persistency would see it much lower  So you had a little bit more churning going on that of the existing in force is being replaced than what the newer business coming on  So I think you ve got some of that dynamics that s taken place Mihir Bhatia    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  Is there a good  I guess a good run rate in terms of just how much you expect that in force yield to decline just given how things have been trending that you would be willing to share Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThis is Nathan  I mean  I would say it s  a difficult thing to kind of project over    over a longer period of time  because I do think it s a function of refinance activity  it s a function of the future credit quality that writing in the premium rates on that business  So I think there is a number of factors  I would look to the larger change in the fourth quarter as we wrote a lot of business in the fourth quarter at a much better risk profile than our in force book  so a lot of that is just reflecting the improved credit profile of the in force book  as a result of the refinance activity in the fourth quarter Mihir Bhatia    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAll right  Got it  Maybe just turning quickly to credit  you ve had some pretty nice development on the cures  particularly the cure to default ratio  It s been steadily climbing  Is that just driven by the economy better credit quality  you ve been writing anything else that    anything that you would comment on that anymore color  And where do you expect that rate to stabilize  I think it s up to like 40  Michael J  Zimmerman    Investor RelationsHey  It s Mike  I mean  the credit quality is simple as    yes  I mean it s  that could obviously driven  right  We ve got a solid economy and the new    and    such a small piece of the legacy books that s contributing  And the new business is so strong  Where the cure rates kind of    we re testing kind of all time lows claim rates  if you will  So the inversement  Phonetic  on the cure rates  I mean  because they go lower  I think that s just something you have to see why we ve been focusing last few calls about that kind of that roll rate from clean to delinquent hovering in that kind of 1 3   1 4  range or so is being a good indicator of where things are at  so that s been pretty stable  So you might see a little bit of variance in the other numbers  but nothing material Mihir Bhatia    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAll right  And then just last question  how are you thinking about reinsurance and ILN plans for the rest of this year  I think you have an option to reduce the amount  do you see it on your 2019 QSR in July  if I m remembering correctly  And then just thoughts on ILN  it s been a    I think almost six  seven months now since you did the last one Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  this is Nathan  I would say for the  for the quota share  forward looking  we have agreed to terms with our panel for our 2020 quota share transaction  so that will again be a 30  quota share with generally similar terms to what we ve had in the past  So really nothing to highlight there  The one interesting thing that we were able to accomplish with  with some of the panel was we got coverage extended to the 2021 vintage  So that s not for the full 30  quota share  But for 17 5   So we have coverage on the 2020 and kind of a little bit reduced coverage on the 2021 book already in place relative to kind of optionality on previous deals Our main optionality points are still out in 2021 on a couple of our    of our older quota share agreements  But you re right  we do have some of these kind of reduced    reduced session options  but frankly  the quota share continues to be I think really attractive for us  We like the structure of it  We like the benefits that it provides you like the loan level coverage  So it s certainly  it s nice to have the option  but I wouldn t give any either kind of keeping it or executing on that option as being something we ve already decided Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think on the ILNs  it s Tim adding in  I think you d expect us to continue to be active there  and I think as Nathan said on the quota share  I think the way that we re able to structure the quota share and the ILNs  it doesn t    having the quota share in place  it doesn t preclude us from utilizing the ILNs to the extent that we think are valuable to us  So I think you should expect us to continue to be active in that space as well Mihir Bhatia    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  Thank you for taking my question Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerSure Operator Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank  Your line is open  Please go ahead Phillip Stefano    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  thanks  So just wanted to go back to the question about the outlook for a decline in new notices  and it felt like mid 2019 that there was an inflection  And I think the messaging at the time was around the new notice or the recently written vintages were just coming into their peak loss years and that was helping to drive up the new notices year over year  Has there been a change since mid  19 in what you re seeing  does it feels like new notices should be coming down  And again  I appreciate that  It s not material  It s kind of more of the same  But it feels like we had an inflection mid  19 and it feels like in some ways  we re backing off of that Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerI would say it s probably more nuance  I think the one thing that s persisted that we talked about a little about here and again  I don t think this moves the numbers dramatically  but obviously  the quality of the book that we wrote in 2019 and those credit characteristics  I think help us feel really good about it compared to the booking we wrote in  18  And so I think you have all those factors as far as some of those larger books coming into sort of the peak loss years  that s true  I think it s similar where we talk about how you project where premium might go in the future  It s sometimes difficult to predict exactly  especially at the low level  We are right now on losses  where exactly the bottom is and a lot of that has to do with again  where    what vintages are coming into the sort of their peak loss years but also the credit quality of those vintages So  as Mike said earlier  I think we don t view it as anything material really that we re talking about there  but there are subtle changes  obviously as we try to project things out based upon the quality of the books and what years they originated Phillip Stefano    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  And the topic du jour  the uses of excess capital  maybe to ask this one a little differently  How is debt reduction involved in the conversation  is deleveraging there something that s being contemplated  And  I think 15  was aligned that one of the other rating agencies have given you maybe they look more favorable on your rating to the extent you got below that 15   Is debt reduction a mechanism you re contemplating to get there or is it just equity growth through earnings is going to get    naturally get you there over the coming years Nathan Colson    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThis is Nathan  I would say  it s certainly something that we continue to talk about  We do have as part of the consolidated debt  We do have a draw on the Federal Home Loan Bank  which if we felt like getting under that 15  threshold was important  That s really prepayable kind of any time for us  So we have a mechanism to pretty quickly get under that 15  that s a cap threshold  But frankly  haven t viewed as it s kind of a bright line that we need to get over  But it s an active conversation with the rating agencies  And frankly  if we ever viewed as that then we will take action to do that Relative to the other debt outstanding  no strong desire to reduce the overall debt level at this time  And part of that is driven by the market prices of that  the 2063 is traded in the  130 upwards of  140 range  So while it s something that we continue to evaluate  I d say that s more    if there was a good opportunity for us to do that  we would think about it versus something we feel like we need to do Phillip Stefano    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGot it  Thank you Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Art Winston from Pilot Advisors  Your line is open  Please go ahead Arthur Winston    Pilot Advisors    AnalystGood morning  Following up on the last question  is there any way to force conversion of those 9  junior conversions that are trading at  130   140 Timothy Mattke    Chief Executive OfficerThere is  it involves the share price needs to be above a certain threshold that threshold is 17 46  Phonetic  strategy  Yeah  it varies  now that we re paying the cash dividend on a quarterly basis  The forced conversion price will continue to adjust over time  But right now  I mean  I think if you think a mid 17s is the level at which we can force convert Arthur Winston    Pilot Advisors    AnalystThank you OperatorAnd there are no questions at this time  please continue Timothy Mattke    Chief

stocks lower  or oil higher  Will the change last  or will trading revert to normal after a few days  These normal questions  but they can sometimes push rational investors into irrational trades CNBC crunched some numbers on the effects of world events and financial market price movements  and found an interesting patter for stock investors  Using data covering the past 30 years  the analysis showed that after oil  stocks show the best positive gain from  crisis trades   For stocks purchased one day before an event occurred  the average return on the S P 500 was 0 9  after one month   and 2 8  after three months That s a pattern to keep in mind  after news of the US airstrike in Baghdad that killed a top Iranian general  Importantly  major investment banks are giving similar advice to their clients  In a published note  Evercore ISI said to investors   Barring an escalation  the backdrop for equities remains favorable  Of course  the news is like lightning  and you never know when

the company s 20  annual growth target 5 star analyst Daniel Perlin  of RBC Capital  sees plenty of reason to believe that FOCS will continue growing  In his analysis of the firm s strengths  the analyst noted   The ability to accelerate organic growth at acquired firms  Focus s services can often lead to accelerating revenue growth at acquired firms  in our estimation  In 2017  55 partner firms utilized an average of at least four of Focus s value added services  Furthermore  partially reflecting these services  the annual revenue growth of acquired partner firms accelerates from a year 1 average of 5 7  to 9 5  by year 5   Perlin s Buy rating on FOCS is backed by a  37 price target  indicating confidence in 26  upside growth over the coming 12 months   To watch Perlin s track

152002,373518,MTG,Should Value Investors Pick MGIC Investment  MTG  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put MGIC Investment Corporation   NYSE MTG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  MGIC Investment has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 82  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 77  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts MGIC Investment s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 9 64  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 25  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that MGIC Investment has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 54  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case MGIC Investment s P CF ratio of 9 26 is higher than the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry average of 3 79  which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  MGIC Investment currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MTG a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though MGIC Investment might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F  This gives MTG a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter consensus estimate has risen 2 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 5 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below MGIC Investment Corporation Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMGIC Investment is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a formidable industry rank  top 4  out of more than 250 industries  and a top Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to

152151,373667,MTG,Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks To Counter Uncertainties ,opinion,A company needs exogenous funds for smooth operations  to meet obligations and expand business  Depending solely on retained earnings for business growth is not possible  The two financial resources often resorted to are debt and equity A comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity as debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity  especially in periods of low interest rates  Yet  the word  debt  is unnerving for many This is because while debt brings with it the capacity to spend a little bit more  it also carries the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  In particular  companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario Given the widespread uncertainty  no one can be fully sure of how a company will perform the next day  Companies bearing large amount of debts are more prone to financial crisis  Naturally  the amount of debt a company bears plays a crucial role in an investment decision And here comes the importance of leverage ratios  which have been constructed to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio indicates improved solvency for a company In general  investors target companies with solid earnings growth projections  But  in the uncertain world of investment  markets can trip anytime  particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage  Therefore  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level is not a wise move The

expenses  run operations smoothly as well as expand the realm of their business  Among equity and debt   the two most common options used to boost a company s future earnings   debt is more popular  This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing Many companies opt for debt financing to pursue their business operations  As long as they generate a higher rate

152155,373671,MTG,Fed Hikes Rate Fourth Time This Year  6 Solid Insurance Picks ,opinion,As widely expected  the Federal Reserve has increased interest rate again this year  This marks the fourth rate hike in 2018  With the latest raise of one quarter percentage points at the last held FOMC meeting  the interest rate now stands at 2 5   However  Fed officials now project two raises in 2019  down from the earlier expectation of three hikes Major indexes  namely S P 500  Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average declined in yesterday s trading session Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated  we have seen developments that may signal some softening    In early 2018  we saw a rising trajectory for growth  Today  we see growth moderating ahead  Fed officials now expect two hikes in 2019 to take the interest rate to 2 9   down from 3 1  as projected in its September FOMC meeting  Also  interest rate for each year has been revised down   For both 2020 and 2021  the rate is now projected to be 3 1   down from 3 4  expected earlier  The same should be 2 8  over the long haul  down from 3  predicted at the meeting held in September The Fed also provided an updated view on unemployment   Fed officials still expect the unemployment rate at 3 7  for 2018 and 3 5  for 2019  However  for 2020  unemployment is expected to increase a bit to 3 8   up from 3 5  projected at September FOMC meeting  and 3 8  in 2021  up from 3 7    Over the longer term  unemployment rate is estimated to be 4 5  A spurt in employment shows average increase of 0 17 million in jobs over the past three months  Per U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  unemployment rate was 3 7  in November for the third month in a row The Fed now estimates GDP to rise 3  in 2018 and 2 3  for 2019  However  these are down from 3 1  and 2 5   respectively projected in the September meeting  Expectations for 2020 and 2021 remain consistent with September projections of 2  and 1 8   respectively  Over the longer term  GDP is expected to improve 2 9   up from 2 8  expected earlier Inflation is expected to be about 1 9  in 2019 and remain 2  in 2020 and 2021 Although an improving rate environment comes as good news for some  for others  it s just the opposite  While companies can have more at their disposal  borrowers will feel the pinch as they have to pay more interest  Capital intensive industries will have to bear the rising cost of capital  Meanwhile  banks and insurers will continue to be major beneficiaries of a rising rate environment because of their sensitivity to interest rates Courtesy of the progressing

Moreover  the Northern California wildfires are anticipated to affect the insurance industry in the fourth quarter  Therefore  the latter half of the year proved even costlier for the insurance industry  pertaining to the damages and losses suffered that in turn hurt the market as a whole  Notably  per Swiss Re  the total economic losses from natural and man made disasters in 2017 are projected to be  306 billion The insurers  underwriting results took a major hit  denting their overall performance  Despite the mounting losses affecting the insurers  overall results  there were a few insurers  which weathered such setbacks and emerged as winners  on the back of their core fundamental strengths Interest Rate Hike and Whatnot   Positives Influencing the IndustryThe steady increase in interest rates has benefited the insurance industry to a huge degree  The Federal Reserve delivered in its promise to raise the rates thrice in 2017 by announcing the third and the final interest rate hike at its last FOMC meeting held on Dec 13  Notably  the interest rate now ranges between 1 25  and 1 50   which in turn has boosted the insurance industry s prospects and helped the companies strengthen their market position Therefore  a progressing rate environment will also lessen the pressure on the insurers  investment income  thus boosting their earnings  This in turn will accelerate the insurance companies  overall growth in the future This apart  there are a few factors having impacted the industry performance so far  Inflation is expected to remain at 1 7   falling shy of the 2  target  which is considered good for the economy  A reviving housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written  Additionally  an improving employment scenario and a positive consumer sentiment buoy optimism Insurers exhibiting a decent progress graph  addressed all the aforementioned factors and headwinds in this volatile  dynamic industry and came out on top by demonstrating bottom line profitability as well as top line growth Stocks More Than Doubling the S P 500 IndexDespite adversities spurting concerns for the insurers this year  positives like rising interest rate environment and an improving economy have helped the following stocks perform well and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification We have zeroed in on four stocks having more than doubled the S P 500 index so far against all odds  These stocks have also seen positive estimate revisions supporting a favorable Zacks Rank   Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018  Be among the first to see our   Chicago  IL based Kemper Corp    NYSE KMPR   provides property and casualty plus life and health insurance to individuals and businesses in the United States  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 31 8  upward to  1 74 and moved 6 5  up to  2 80 for 2018 over the last 60 days  This is reflected through the company s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Shares of Kemper Corp  have gained 55 3  year to date  which crushed the S P 500 index and have also outperformed the  
Milwaukee  WI based MGIC Investment Corp    NYSE MTG   provides private mortgage insurance and ancillary services to lenders and government sponsored entities in the United States  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for both current year earnings and 2018 has been raised 3 4  to  1 21 over the last 60 days  This is evident from the company s Zacks Rank of 1 Shares of MGIC Investment have gained 44 4  year to date  which more than doubled the S P 500 index and have also outperformed the industry

152377,373893,MTG,Radian Group Raises Notes Offering To  450M  Gets Rated ,opinion,"Radian Group Inc   NYSE RDN   has expanded the amount of 4 50  senior unsecured notes offering to  450 million from  400 million announced earlier  These notes are scheduled to mature on Oct 1  2024 
Radian Group intends to utilize the net proceeds along with available cash to fund a tender offer  buy back some outstanding senior notes and for general corporate purposes  Interest on these notes will be paid half yearly on every Apr 1 and Oct 1 
The company exited the last reported quarter with debt balance declining 7 5  from 2016 end level  Long term debt to equity ratio was 0 34  improving 320 basis points  With the new issuance  the long term debt to equity ratio would deteriorated by 1540 basis points 
Additionally  Radian Group needs to dish out about  20 million in interest annually  In the last reported quarter  interest expense declined 28  to  16 2 million  Nonetheless  we still believe the company is well positioned to smoothly clear debts  banking on operational strength 
It seems a prudent approach by the company to capitalize on the still low interest rate environment to procure funds Also  this might lower the interest burden on borrowings  facilitating margin expansion 
Concurrently  these senior notes have been assigned a  Ba3  rating by Moody s Investor Service  a wing of Moody Corporation  The outlook of the ratings remains positive These ratings reflect the company s enhanced credit profile as poor quality insurance policies are replaced by high quality mortgage business 
These ratings are also driven by the company s diversified client portfolio and refined profitability standards  These positives are weighed down by lack of unrestricted dividend capacity  significant debt maturities and an unsettled tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service 
According to the rating agency  the disbursement of the new seven year notes and the concurrent tender offer for a portion of its 2019  2020 and 2021 senior notes will improve Radian Group s debt maturity profile by reducing its outstanding debts 
Moody s stated that the ratings could be upgraded if the parent s debt maturity profile is better aligned to its anticipated dividend capacity  adjusted financial leverage stays below 20  and Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements are compliant with the rising capital adequacy 
Also  Moody s warned that the ratings would be subject to downgrade if Radian Group is not compliant with the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements  shareholders equity plunges by 10  over a period of 12 months  the parent company is unable to meet its debt service requirements and if there is any unfavorable result arising out of the Internal Revenue Service tax dispute 
Assessments of financial performance by credit rating agencies have always played a vital role in instilling investor s faith as well as in sustaining the credit worthiness of the companies  This rating by Moody s exhibits the sturdy financial position of the company which would enable it to meet its debt obligation in the future as well as its likely capital needs 
Zacks Rank and Share Price Movement
Radian Group carries Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Shares of Radian Group s shares have increased 26 6  in a year s time  outperforming the  s 23 2  growth  Nonetheless  we expect the company s diversified product offerings and higher net premiums to drive its shares in the near term
