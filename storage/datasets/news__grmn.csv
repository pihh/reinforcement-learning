13035,234550,GRMN,U S  insurers get inside cars  mouths  grocery carts in profit search,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn NEW YORK  Reuters    Twice a day  Scott Ozawa s Bluetooth enabled toothbrush tells his dental insurer if he brushed for a full two minutes  In return  the 41 year old software engineer gets free brush heads and the employer which bought his insurance gets premium discounts   The scheme  devised by Beam Technologies Inc  is just one of the latest uses of technology by insurers hungry for more real time information on their customers that they say lets them assess risk more accurately and set rates accordingly   In theory  everybody wins  as policyholders adopt better habits and insurance companies save money on claims   However  there are concerns that insurers will eventually use the data they get to cherry pick the best and most profitable customers  while hiking rates or even denying coverage to people who choose not to participate   It s not expected today  but in the near future it will be used to penalize people   said Mitchell Wein at Novarica Inc  who advises clients on insurance technology  Insurers are still in the data collection stage  said Wein  but he predicts that in about five years  tracking tools will have a direct impact on pricing and coverage on a range of policies  Insurers recognize the dangers but consumers have nothing to fear  according to Michael Barry  a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute  an industry funded communications group   Insurance is such a heavily regulated industry that insurers must justify  in actuarial terms  the reason for any rate increase they re seeking in almost any line of business   he said   Moreover  the insurance marketplace is competitive   If any insurer raises rates to the point where a consumer is dissatisfied  the consumer can go elsewhere   he added   TECH LEAP  Beam s technology follows auto insurers using devices in cars to find out how far and how safely policyholders drive   known as telematics   and life and health insurers giving customers wearable devices such as Fitbit and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Watch to keep track of their activity   U S  insurers and their customers have generally been slow to adopt new monitoring techniques  which have been common in auto insurance in South Africa  Italy  Brazil and Britain for years   But the world s biggest insurance market  with  1 3 trillion in premiums in 2015   more than a quarter of the global total   is catching up   Mayfield  Ohio based Progressive Corp  N PGR   an early leader in the area  said its telematics based  Snapshot  auto policy allows it to  attract  identify and reward good drivers while also retaining those customers longer   Progressive has more than 2 million Snapshot policies in force  about a fifth of its total U S  auto business   About 30 percent of North American auto insurers now have telematics programs  according to a survey last year by insurance consultants Strategy Meets Action  SMA   That will rise to 70 percent by 2020  SMA said   In health insurance  health insurer Anthem Inc  N ANTM  has been working since 2013 with  Fitbit Inc   N FIT  and  Garmin Ltd   O GRMN  to offer premium discounts to eligible customers who wear the devices and transmit information to the insurer   In life insurance  John Hancock Financial started offering a policy in 2015 that gives customers discounts on healthy groceries when shopping at certain retailers and rewards for hitting exercise targets as measured by a wearable device  The program  designed in partnership with Vitality Group  includes a free Fitbit or an Apple Watch for as little as  25 if a customer hits their targets   We get to know you better than your doctor does   said Brooks Tingle  head of insurance marketing for John Hancock  owned by Canada s  Manulife Financial  Corp  TO MFC   COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE Insurers generally do not disclose data on premiums or profit on specific types of policies  so it is hard to tell what effect such approaches have had on their bottom lines  or whether riskier customers are being asked to pay more   However  people in the industry agree that increased data from technology means insurers can target more desirable customers  The benefit for insurers is  competitive advantage  pure and simple   said Katie DeGraaf  a senior consultant at insurance advisory firm Willis Towers Watson  in a recent report   Companies that have integrated granular telematics data into rating plans are better positioned to attract and retain the most profitable customers    Much of the pioneering work in the area has taken place in South Africa  which suffers chronic high crime and accident rates   Johannesburg based financial services firm Discovery Ltd  J DSYJ   whose car insurance unit has been tracking customers  driving and using the information in pricing since 2011  said it has seen a 10 percent drop in accident claims since then  Discovery s ratio of losses to premiums for drivers in the tracking scheme is more than a quarter lower than those not participating  the company said  Data has also upended a longstanding rule of thumb in the insurance industry that younger drivers are the riskiest   The whole beauty is that someone who might be seen to be a bad risk can turn out to be a good risk   said Anton Ossip  CEO of Discovery Insure  the company s auto insurer   The new approach has  substantially improved the quality of new business and our ability to attract and select high quality clients   Discovery Insure said in its latest financial report  Still  Ossip is concerned about consumers who do not want to use the telematics devices to relay data   Generally  someone who chooses not to use it is a worse risk   he said  FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE Insurers interviewed by Reuters said better data collection allows them to underwrite risk better  and customers tend to take better care of themselves when confronted with numbers   They described participation in data tracking programs as voluntary  and said they are transparent about what information they collect and confident about data security  Some of that might be changing  however  Root Insurance Co  a Columbus  Ohio based startup  immediately uses the information it gathers and only insures what it believes are good drivers   Root s smartphone app tracks car movements for two weeks before offering eligible customers a quote  according to CEO Alexander Timm  An algorithm assesses risk using factors such as tailgating  fast turns and texting   Using data to segment risks in such a way is only set to spread    Pricing will change   said Anand Rao  a principal at consultancy PwC who focuses on analytics and uses of artificial intelligence in business   Not everyone will change their behavior  which will start translating into different pricing and different types of products   Some industry watchers worry that approach will fundamentally change how the insurance business works  But for now  consumers do not seem too concerned    There are a lot of pieces of information that companies are tracking about you anyway   said Ozawa  referring to  Facebook Inc   O FB  and other social media   
While Ozawa no longer works for the company that introduced him to Beam  he expects the impact will be long lasting  The two minute requirement has motivated his kids to do more than a simple  swish swish  when they brush  he said ",2017-01-15,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-insurers-get-inside-cars,-mouths,-grocery-carts-in-profit-search-453232",453232

13100,234615,GRMN,Chief justice calls U S  patent challenge process bizarre,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday described as bizarre the legal process used by companies to challenge competitors  patents as the Supreme Court heard a case involving a vehicle speedometer that alerts drivers if they are driving too quickly  The eight justices heard an appeal filed by Cuozzo Speed Technologies LLC  whose speedometer patent was invalidated in a U S  Patent and Trademark Office review board procedure after being challenged by GPS device maker  Garmin Ltd   NASDAQ GRMN  in 2012  The issue before the justices during a one hour argument in the case was whether the U S  government has made it too easy for companies to pursue challenges to the patents of other companies   New Jersey based Cuozzo challenged the board s action in federal court  and an appeals court last year upheld the agency s action  Cuozzo then asked the Supreme Court to reverse the appellate decision  Garmin is no longer involved in the case  Roberts was the most outspoken critic among the eight justices of the current system in which companies can adopt a dual track strategy by challenging patents simultaneously in federal court and through the agency review board  Roberts described the system as a  bizarre way to     decide a legal question  and a  very extraordinary animal in legal culture to have two different proceedings addressing the same question   Justice Stephen Breyer appeared more sympathetic to the patent office  He said the 2011 law that set up the review board procedure may have intended to counter criticism that the patent office issues  too many patents that shouldn t have been issued in the first place   So called patent trolls  entities that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products  have benefited from that generosity  Breyer indicated that the patent office views the law as allowing a second bite at the question of whether a patent should have been issued  Breyer called it a  partial Groundhog Day statute   referring to the 1993 film  Groundhog Day  in which Bill Murray s character repeatedly re lives the same day  Companies that are frequent targets of patent suits  including Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  and  Google Inc   NASDAQ GOOGL   have turned to the patent office procedure  known as  inter partes review   IPR   to try to fight off patent challenges  Google and Apple joined court papers backing the patent office  Cuozzo told the justices that in nearly 85 percent of cases some or all of the patents challenged were canceled  
A ruling is due by the end of June ",2016-04-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/chief-justice-calls-u.s.-patent-challenge-process-bizarre-397784,397784

13111,234626,GRMN,New Apple Watch that makes calls turns comic book fantasy into reality,news,"By Stephen Nellis CUPERTINO  Calif   Reuters    More than two years after releasing the Apple Watch  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  has finally been able to replicate 1940s comic strip technology  an advance that analysts say will spur sales  The Series 3 of the Apple Watch  released on Tuesday along with the much anticipated iPhone X  features wireless LTE connectivity  That means customers will be able to make phone calls or send text messages from the watch without needing to have an iPhone nearby  as they do with earlier models  The ability to make calls with a wristwatch has captured the imagination of tech enthusiasts at least since it was prominently featured in  Dick Tracy   the comic about a private detective who  starting in 1946  used calls from his wrist to help bust bad guys    This has been our vision from the beginning   Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said at the launch event    Now you can go for a run with just your watch and still be connected  It s really nice to know you can be reached if needed   To be sure  Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co Ltd has sold smart watches with mobile data connectivity since 2014  but the first devices were bulky and suffered from poor battery life because the data connection consumed extra power  They also require a separate phone number   Apple claims its new Series 3  on the other hand  will have up to 18 hours of battery life and is just a fraction of a millimeter thicker that its previous Series 2  And it will have the same phone number as a customer s iPhone  which will still be required for the initial set up of the watch  Apple said that all four major U S  carriers will offer service for the watch  and AT T Inc  NYSE T  and T Mobile US Inc both said it would cost an extra  10 a month  Analysts generally believe the new connectivity could ignite sales  though there is little consensus as to how much  At  399  the new Watch is only slightly more expensive than the previous model  the  329 Series 2  which introduced standalone GPS capability  That  70 extra buys much more useful capabilities   including the ability to stream music from Apple Music    The third time is the charm for the watch   said Bob O Donnell of Techanalysis Research  What may hold some consumers back is the monthly recurring charge  which would far exceed the extra cost of the Series 3 over older watches over time  said Brian Blau  an Apple analyst with Gartner   Yes  you do have to pay for that extra data plan  but it sounds like the carriers are at least going to make it relatively easy to do   Blau said  Apple does not say how many Apple Watches it sells  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi believes Apple will sell 12 million watches in its fiscal 2017 and 14 million to 15 million in fiscal 2018  Gene Munster with Loup Ventures predicted a much bigger bump  to 26 million units in 2018  Either way  Apple is putting new pressure on smartwatch rivals such as Fitbit Inc and  Garmin Ltd   NASDAQ GRMN   which would be hard pressed from a technical and business standpoint to match Apple s wireless features   But the new Apple Watch still requires an iPhone  which Fitbit believes leaves it ample market room to sell wearable devices that work with all phones  not just iPhones   With Android comprising approximately 80 percent of the global smartphone market  broad compatibility remains a core differentiator for Fitbit   the company said in a statement to Reuters  Garmin did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours  
The Watch will remain a blip in Apple s sales  which were  215 billion last year  But it may be taking its place as part of a family of products that Apple loyalists cannot do without   all by making a schoolboy fantasy from the 1940s into reality for the masses ",2017-09-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/new-apple-watch-that-makes-calls-turns-comic-book-fantasy-into-reality-528159,528159

 Participants noted that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for a time posed few risks at this point   the minutes said   The current level of the federal funds rate was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate  
The Fed flagged  softening in consumer or business sentiment  and  a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic growth  as headwinds to tightening monetary policy 
On the balance sheet  the minutes showed that   a lmost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve s asset holdings later this year

share  easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents Gross margin expanded to 60 7   while operating margin hit 28  in the third quarter Garmin also unveiled its Autoland system for general aviation  the system will help land small aircraft  without pilot assistance  in the event of an emergency Overall  CEO Cliff Pemble attributed the company s successful quarter to  our lineup of great products in every market segment  GRMN on the RiseShares of GRMN are up over 53  since January compared to the S P 500 s return of about 28   Earnings estimates have been rising too  and Garmin is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  pick right now For the current fiscal year  four analysts have revised their bottom line estimate upwards in the last 60 days  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up 26 cents from  3 90 to  4 16  earnings could see about 12 75  growth compared to the prior year period  2020 looks pretty strong too  with earnings and revenue expected to continue positive year over year growth GRMN currently trades around 22X its forward full year earnings estimates  slightly above the broader Computer and Technology Market  21 3X  Garmin is one of the few tech stocks that has embraced diversification  as well as successfully moved away from risky business segments like its auto GPS devices  The company upped its 2019 outlook back in October  and looks to meet those targets thanks to positive expectations for this holiday season  If you re an investor searching for a broader tech stock to add to your portfolio  make sure to keep GRMN on your shortlist  Headquartered in Paramus  NJ  Movado Group is one of the world s premier watchmakers  designing  manufacturing  and distributing high end timepieces and fashion watches  Its brand portfolio includes Coach  Tommy Hilfiger  Hugo Boss  Concord  and Movado Shares Slump on Underwhelming Q3 EarningsNon GAAP earnings came in at 82 cents per share  well below our consensus estimate of  1 03  Revenue fell 1 6  year over year to  205 6 million  analysts expected sales of  220 million Movado s Q3 performance was hurt by declining sales and increasing marketing investments  and lowered its full year revenue outlook as a result Analysts have turned bearish on Movado  with one cutting estimates in the last 60 days for fiscal 2019 Earnings are expected to see double digit negative growth for the year  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 64 cents for that same time period from  2 27 to  1 63 per share This sentiment has stretched into 2021  though sales growth is expected to be positive MOV is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Shares of the watchmaker are down almost 36  since January  and the stock took a major hit after its Q3 earnings release  MOV plunged 24 6  in the wake of the report  The S P 500 is up about 28  this year in comparison Bottom Line                                                Movado has been impacted by currency headwinds and the underperforming watch category and overall retail environment  It now expects fiscal 2020 revenue to fall between  690 million to  700 million compared to the previous range of  725 million and  740 million The Year Tesla  TSLA  Finally Met Its Management GoalsTesla is the most volatile stock on the market due to an overzealous CEO and a management team that over promises and under delivers  This year may be the first year that the company finally meets its lofty goals TSLA slid hard at the beginning of 2019 due to liquidity concerns as the company was quickly running out of money and not turning a profit  These concerns were alleviated with debt and equity offering raising over  2 billion  The record number of deliveries in Q2 of 95 000 units kept the rally going into its Q2 earnings  Q2 results missed on both top and bottom line metrics  and these shares upward trajectory stalled only to be reignited by another record number of deliveries in Q3 and a massive EPS beat Overenthusiastic CEO Elon Musk may actually hit the 360 000 400 000 unit target that he set for his company earlier in the year Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai is ahead of schedule with cars appearing to be already out for delivery  This is another example of Tesla management hitting their lofty 2019 goals  once again surprising investors This Chinese factory will allow them to bypass tariffs and gives them access to the largest EV market on the planet  In phase 1 the firm wants to produce 250 000 annually in Gigafactory 3 and eventually reaching its 500 000 unit capacity  I don t expect the 250 000 unit goal to be reached for a few years  A fourth European factory is expected to be announced by the end of the year  which would further demonstrate Tesla s EV world dominance plans  Still concerns about steep competition and global economic slowdown loom Cyber truck is the latest news coming out of Tesla  and critics had a field day when they first saw this vehicle  Critics are calling it a stencil drawn by a child  or something straight out of an 80s Sci Fi movie  These critics were quickly silenced with 200 000 customer pre orders within the first 48 hours of its announcement  The car will have a battery range of 500 miles  the longest on the consumer markets  This EV will start at  39 900 and expect to see these on the streets by 2021 Take AwayThe company is finally meeting management s excessive goals  and the share price is beginning to reap the benefits as the short seller slowly exit their positions  This stock still has upside potential with the ahead of schedule Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai being a significant catalyst 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities

13748,235263,GRMN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Garmin  Martin Marietta And SK Telecom,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 19  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN    Martin Marietta   NYSE MLM   and SK Telecom   NYSE SKM   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  U S  Retail Reports In  Global Week AheadComplacency reigns supreme  All major U S  stock indexes have been rising  day after day  taking the Q3 earnings season in stride  Don t fight the Fed   as they always  always say The latest Fed rate cut  and a de facto re start of  QE  by Powell  are two major U S  monetary pistons firing This week  Christine LaGarde opens her game at the ECB  China is going to cut rates slightly Along with fresh pulses of pure financial market liquidity  Zacks Research Director Sheraz Mian believes stock traders  steady appreciation of Q3 results likely reflects relief Specifically  we see relief that earnings outlooks have not taken a big hit  as many feared  following growing evidence of a global slowdown Entering the week  455 S P 500 companies have reported  Total net earnings are down  1 7  on  4 6  higher revenues  72 3  beat EPS estimates  A much lower 57 8  beat revenue estimates For the Tech sector  we have Q3 results for 86 9   Tech earnings are down 7 4  on 2 4  higher revenues  75 5  beat EPS estimates  66 0  beating revenue estimates For the Finance sector  we have all results in  Finance sector earnings are up 3 0  on 9 3  higher revenues  72 2  beat EPS estimates  70 1  beat revenue estimates The Retail sector is the sole S P 500 sector left with a substantial number of reports to go  In the Global Week Ahead  those major retail firms report in Next are the latest Reuters  five world market themes  reordered for equity traders  1  The Q3 S P 500 Earnings End Game  Big Box U S  Retailer Earnings Walmart  NYSE WMT dodged the trade bullet on Thursday with an earnings beat showing its growing market share in groceries helped insulate it from tariffs on Chinese imports  Soon we ll learn whether other retailers have been as well positioned to weather the trade dispute Home Depot  NYSE HD   Kohl s  Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN   Target  NYSE TGT   Macy s  NYSE M  and Gap are among the chains reporting in what will be the end game for third quarter earnings  Based on results from 458 S P 500 companies that have reported  earnings are down 0 4  from Q3 2018  Refinitiv data shows  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  s weak holiday quarter guidance last month fed worries that the trade spat is hurting the U S  retail industry Friday brings advance readings on November purchasing manufacturing indexes  PMIs   as well as the final University of Michigan consumer sentiment print  That should play into the outlook from retailers  2  Wither Mainland China and Hong Kong China isn t in a great place right now With the economy slipping deeper in the trade war quagmire  the case for lowering the new lending reference rate  the LPR  is getting stronger Industrial production growth has slowed below 5   steel output is at seven month lows and third quarter economic growth is at its slowest in a generation  The central bank has fiddled monetary settings to get things moving  trimming the medium term lending facility last week by 5 bps  The LPR was cut in August and September  glacial progress towards a trade truce makes another step down in interest rates likely Then there s Hong Kong  racked by increasingly violent pro democracy protests and in recession for the first time since 2009  E commerce titan Alibaba  NYSE BABA  s  13 4 billion IPO  due in coming days  is seen as a vote of confidence  But demand for the stock has started sucking out cash  raising short term borrowing costs  These have already shot towards decade highs marked in July and will rise further if capital starts fleeing  It s not a situation China will be keen to deal with at this point  3  Given Recent Data  Is a Global Recession Less of an Issue How big a risk is a global economic recession  Recently  hopes of a fledgling growth turnaround were doused by data showing China s factory output growth slowing in October and Japan s economy grinding to a standstill in Q3  And Germany only narrowly avoided a recession in that period Cue  flash  PMIs due on Nov  22 from Japan and the Eurozone  numbers widely regarded as a forward looking indicator of economic health October PMIs pointed to some stabilization  raising expectations that hefty central bank easing had helped the global economy to bottom out On the flip side  Sino U S  trade uncertainty drags on  making it harder to call a turnaround in the data  No wonder then  that after weeks of heavy selling  government bond yields are heading down again  4  U K  Election a Month AwayBritain s election is less than a month away and with the two main parties set to release their election manifestos  One thing is for sure  both plan to spend big The opposition Labor Party pledged on Friday to nationalize BT s broadband network  proposing to fund that through extra tech sector taxes  It has already suggested nationalizing water and utility firms  an exercise that S PGlobal estimates could cost 160 billion pounds  The Conservatives  favorites to win  are also wooing voters  with the biggest public service spending increases in 15 years and plans to spend up to 3  of annual output on infrastructure    almost double historical averages Under any election outcome  state spending looks set to rise to levels unseen since the 1970s  predicts think tank Resolution Foundation  And there s only one place the government can find the money  bond markets  UK public debt stands around 80  of GDP  below U S  and Japanese levels  but higher spending plus the Brexit hit to growth mean that that ratio can only rise Government 10 year borrowing costs have almost doubled since early September and could move higher  especially if Britain s rating is cut  Moody s recently cut the rating outlook  citing among other things  rising public debt  5  The Aftermath of a Spanish ElectionSpain looks set for a coalition government comprising the Socialists and the far left Unidas Podemos   a prospect that doesn t sit well with markets given Podemos has called a rise in public spending  taxing banks more and rethinking privatization plans for lender  Bankia Given that all this coincides with an economic slowdown  it s no surprise that Madrid stocks plunged when the coalition pact was announced  The share index  the IBEX  has since fallen to the lowest level relative to the pan European STOXX benchmark since the latter was created in 1998  The IBEX is up 7 6  so far this year  while the STOXX has surged 20   After four Spanish elections in as many years  one would expect investors to be inured to political uncertainty  Indeed  bond yields  while at four month highs  have reacted less than shares  But the equity selloff shows sentiment remains fragile The Socialists Podemos accord is not a done deal yet  The coalition would also rely on other parties for a parliament majority  potentially tempering big policy swings to the left  And investors also hope Nadia Calvi o  the acting economy minister and respected economist  stays in the new government Top Zacks Stocks  Garmin  This is an  18 9B market

13749,235264,GRMN,Does This Stock Rally Continue Next Year ,opinion,"Despite this current stock market boom that doesn t seem to be losing momentum  it s been a struggle to find revenue growth among the S P 500 companies that have reported Q3 earnings so far  Chief Equity Strategist and Economist  John Blank  is here to elaborate 
1  Why do you think this is 
2  Is one reason we re doing so well because the rest of the global markets aren t 
3  Stock valuations are high  Have we seen anything in this earnings reporting season though  that justifies these high valuations 
4  What do you think retail earnings will say about this holiday shopping season and the consumer in general

6  Last month  the Federal Reserve began buying up short term Treasury debt to the tune of  60 billion per month  Is this more quantitative easing 
7  Will our stock market rally continue through the end of the year or will uncertainty over the trade situation derail it

13750,235265,GRMN,3 Dividend Paying Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now On Growth Opportunities   ,opinion,"The S P 500  Dow  and Nasdaq all closed at new highs to start the week as they continue their strong November run amid better than feared quarterly earnings results and solid U S  jobs and consumer data  Stocks did slip Wednesday and Thursday  as the U S  and China hit another bump in the trade war road 
With this in mind  investors might want to search for strong and established companies that pay a dividend to help bolster their portfolios amid renewed uncertainty  Despite the apparent U S  China setback  stocks could still climb in 2019 and beyond  and the tech industry remains a key growth driver 
Therefore  we searched for tech companies with our that also pay a dividend 
Intel   NASDAQ INTC  
Intel is the largest semiconductor maker in the U S  by revenue  The company posted impressive Q3 results on October 24  with its shares up 12  since then and 23  over the last 12 months  The chip giant also raised its full year outlook as part of what looks like a broader industry wide comeback that includes the likes of Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   and others 
Intel showed strength in its data center focused business that is projected to play a key role in the firm s future amid the continued expansion of cloud computing  CEO Bob Swan boasted that the recently reported quarter highlighted the progress of Intel s data centric businesses  which made up nearly half of total revenue   We ve been on a multiyear journey to reposition Intel s portfolio to take advantage of the exponential growth of data   Swan said in prepared remarks

Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN  
Garmin  like Intel  topped quarterly estimates in October  with revenue up 15   and raised its sales and EPS guidance  The firm  which is famous for its in car GPS devices  fitness trackers and smartwatches that compete against the likes of Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Fitbit   NYSE FIT    also sells a ton of other products from high end fish finders to advance radars for aviation and boating  In fact  Garmin s aviation  fitness  outdoor  and marine units drove most of Q3 s revenue  with auto down 17  
Garmin s Fitness unit surged 28  as part of a booming wearables industry  which is part of the reason why Google   NASDAQ GOOGL   decided to buy Fitbit  The firm s aviation division also climbed 28   And perhaps more importantly  Garmin on October 30 announced its new Autoland system that will  control and land the aircraft without human intervention  in the event of an emergency   Today  aviation is forever changed as we introduce one of the industry s most significant innovations   the first Autoland system for general aviation aircraft   CEO Cliff Pemble said in prepared remarks 
Shares of GRMN have surged 23  in the last three months and 51  in the last year to crush its industry s 10  average climb  In fact  Garmin stock hit a brand new high on Thursday  The GPS firm s climb makes its current 2 35  dividend yield all the more impressive and it easily tops Apple s 1 17   Garmin is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports an  A  grade for Momentum  Garmin s full year FY19 sales are projected to jump 9 2  to reach  3 65 billion to help lift earnings by nearly 13  
Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   
Shares of Microsoft have skyrocketed nearly 50  in 2019 and 145  in the last three years  The historic tech firm s cloud computing expansion helped drive this growth  For example  Microsoft s Q1 fiscal 2020 sales jumped 14  on the back of 27  expansion in its Intelligent Cloud unit  which beat Wall Street estimates and topped Q4 s 19  growth 
Microsoft is now the second largest cloud firm behind only Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    The Redmond  Washington headquartered firm has also continued to innovate within Office  Windows  and devices  as it completes key acquisitions such as LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD   Peeking ahead  Microsoft s revenues are projected to pop roughly 11  in fiscal 2020 and 2021  And MSFT s adjusted full year EPS figures are expected to surge 12 3  in each of the next two years 
MSFT s longer term positive earnings estimate revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now  along with an  A  grade for Momentum  Microsoft returned 28  more to shareholders through dividends and repurchases last quarter  Plus  MSFT announced in September that it raised its quarterly dividend by 11  and approved a new share repurchase program  The firm currently pays an annualized dividend of  1 84  for a 1 36  yield its new quarterly payout will amount to an annualized dividend of  2 04 per share

13751,235266,GRMN,Tech Stocks Ride On Trade Optimism  5 Must Haves,opinion,U S  stocks hit fresh highs at the beginning of a holiday shortened week  mostly buoyed by a rally in technology companies  The broader S P 500 and the tech laden Nasdaq  in particular  ended Monday s trading session at record highs on reports that the United States and China are nearing a trade truce The Nasdaq gained 1 1   while nine out of 11 major S P 500 sectors finished in the green  What s more  the technology sector rose the maximum on the benchmark index  at 1 9   Trade sensitive chip stocks also jumped  including Lam Research and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   eventually lifting the Philadelphia Semiconductor index 2 3   Nvidia was the top gainer on the chip index  up 4 4  By the way  tech behemoths  including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   rose 1 3  and was the second biggest gainer among blue chip companies listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Of late  U S  China trade tensions have been bogging the tech stocks down  Things have been especially bad after Huawei was added to the Commerce Department s Entity List  which restricted U S  companies from doing business with the Chinese tech giant  Lest we forget  the move affected revenues of Skyworks  NASDAQ SWKS  Solutions and Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   to name a few Nonetheless  the recent developments on the U S  China trade front have been quite encouraging for tech players  Recently  the Chinese government asked for more protection of intellectual property rights  IPR   which has been one of the primary issues brought up in the trade negotiations with the United States The document released by the General Offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Chinese State Council provides details on China s initiatives to protect intellectual property rights in the coming two years by cracking down on the violation of such rights The document states  strengthening IPR protection is the most important content of improving the IPR protection system and also the biggest incentive to boost China s economic competitiveness   Needless to say  disputes related to intellectual property theft had affected trade deals between China and the United States as they scramble to reach  phase one  of a trade deal 5 Top Tech PicksAs trade war worries dissipate and broader markets move north  investing in solid tech stocks which are making the most of the recovery seems judicious  And why not  The broader tech sector has also a lot to gain from scaling down of trade war fears  The components of the SPDR Technology Select Sector had seen significant amount of revenues coming from China in recent years  In fact  China is in the second place in terms of revenue generation  after the United States Hopes of abatement in the U S  China trade tensions undoubtedly provided strength to the chip sector  After all  China relies heavily on U S  chipmakers  while semiconductors make up one of its largest

13777,235292,GRMN,MG Vs  GRMN  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Electronics   Miscellaneous Products sector might want to consider either Mistras  MG  or Garmin  GRMN   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Mistras is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Garmin has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that MG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
MG currently has a forward P E ratio of 21 88  while GRMN has a forward P E of 22 39  We also note that MG has a PEG ratio of 1 29  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  GRMN currently has a PEG ratio of 3 05 
Another notable valuation metric for MG is its P B ratio of 1 45  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  GRMN has a P B of 4 16 
These metrics  and several others  help MG earn a Value grade of A  while GRMN has been given a Value grade of D 
MG is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that MG is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mg-vs-grmn-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200474534,200474534

Prior to today s trading  shares of the maker of personal navigation devices had gained 2 34  over the past month  This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector s gain of 0 35  and the S P 500 s loss of 0 1  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from GRMN as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be October 30  2019  In that report  analysts expect GRMN to post earnings of  0 94 per share  This would mark a year over year decline of 6   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  863 92 million  up 6 66  from the prior year quarter 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  3 90 per share and revenue of  3 60 billion  These totals would mark changes of  5 69  and  7 58   respectively  from last year 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for GRMN  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant  GRMN currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Digging into valuation  GRMN currently has a Forward P E ratio of 22 46  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 20 81  so we one might conclude that GRMN is trading at a premium comparatively 
Meanwhile  GRMN s PEG ratio is currently 3 06  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  Electronics   Miscellaneous Products stocks are  on average  holding a PEG ratio of 1 47 based on yesterday s closing prices

13779,235294,GRMN,Analysts Estimate Garmin  GRMN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Garmin  GRMN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of personal navigation devices is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6  
Revenues are expected to be  863 92 million  up 6 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Garmin 
For Garmin  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Garmin will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Garmin would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 16  delivering a surprise of  16  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Garmin doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-garmin-grmn-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200476882,200476882

13795,235310,GRMN,Apple Roundup  Tariff Exemptions  Updated Recs   More,opinion,"Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   announced that the USTR approved 10 out of 15 exemptions requested on Mac pro components from China  submitted its position on DACA to the Supreme Court  saw a number of positive analyst reports and some commentary from Apple bull Mark Gurman 
Apple Getting Some Exemptions
The U S  Trade Representative  USTR  has approved 10 out of the 15 exemptions Apple requested for its Mac Pro parts that were being sourced from China 
In granting the approvals  the USTR considered whether the products are made only in China  are strategically important for Chinese industrial programs and whether the duty would cause severe harm to the company or U S  interests in general 
So it was determined that Apple  failed to show that the imposition of additional duties  on things like optional wheels for Apple s Mac Pro  a circuit board for managing input and output ports  power adapter  charging cable and a cooling system for the computer s processor  would cause severe economic harm  to itself  or other U S  interests   So these requests were rejected 
On the other hand  the Mac Pro frame was exempted  presumably because these things are so complicated that only China can make them with the added advantage that China s industrial progress isn t dependent on them  Note  Apple doesn t sell that many Mac Pros 
The whole drama was started by the WSJ  which stated that Apple was planning on moving production from the plant it has been operating since 2013 to China  After that  Trump initially said he wouldn t make compromises  then said that they were working on it  Finally  they patted their own backs with Trump announcing that Apple was keeping production in the U S  and Apple announcing how it had won important exemptions 
What About DACA 
Ahead of the Nov 12 Supreme Court hearing on President Trump s 2017 plan to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  program  it was opposed by Apple CEO Tim Cook and HR head Deidre O Brien 
The two made a written submission to the court saying things like  We are distressed at the prospect of ripping our DACA colleagues from the fabric of our company   and that its 443 DACA colleagues from across 25 countries  spark creativity and help drive innovation  They are among our most driven and selfless colleagues   and further that  We did not hire them out of kindness or charity 
 We did it because Dreamers  as they re called  embody Apple s innovation strategy  They come from diverse backgrounds and display a wide range of skills and experiences that equip them to tackle problems from different perspectives 
 Because they thrived in the face of adversity  they often exhibit extraordinary levels of grit and drive    They have earned the right to continue to contribute to our company and to our society  
And to drive the point home  they said   Apple would quite literally not exist without a brilliant and driven population of immigrants   noting that even Steve Jobs was a Syrian migrant 
Of course legal migration is not the issue here  DACA relates to children belonging to people  mostly Hispanics  who crossed the border without legal papers 
Analysts Turn Positive on Apple
Samik Chatterjee  a JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  analyst  raised his 2019 and 2020 iPhone volume estimates and said that improving sales led by the iPhone 11 family would raise Apple share prices by more than 20   Maintaining his Overweight rating  he raised his price target from  243 to  265 
iPhone units are now expected to be a million  units more in the current quarter and 3 million units more in the December quarter  The introduction of a 5G enabled device in 2020 will drive demand for high end devices in North America and ensure buoyancy in prices  As a result  iPhone units will touch 198 million in 2020 and 200 million in 2021 
Earlier  Jeffries analysts Kyle McNealy and George Notter took their price target to  260 and asked investors to buy Apple shares  They are optimistic about 5G  saying that  current expectations for Apple s first 5G iPhone lineup are too low  They underestimate Apple s competitive position for 5G devices    Their iPhone unit forecast is 190 million in 2019 and 208 million in 2020 
The reasons for their optimism include the huge marketing push for 5G across the industry that Apple will also benefit from  the scope for differentiation the new generation devices will allow  increased smartphone penetration across the world and expansion of Apple s own line with mid range offerings 
Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  analyst Jeriel Ong sees average selling price declines in 2020  driven by the lower price points of iPhone 11  which starts at  699 compared to the iPhone XR starting price of  749 and lower pricing on older generation iPhones  The analyst thinks that lower priced models will account for 40  of iPhone shipments in the next 12 months  He also expressed uncertainty about the lower prices yielding higher unit sales because we don t know how feature additions in new models will be taken up by the market 
Apple Growing Walled Garden
So what else is new 
Long time Apple bull  Bloomberg s Mark Gurman  recently pointed out that the list of pre installed  default apps on the iPhone had jumped from 17 in 2007 to 38 in the latest edition  So whether you want to message a friend  look up a map  check your email  search information in the browser  or a host of other things  you really have no choice except to go with Apple  And nothing else  no matter how good or useful or preferred  gets to be the default  Something like what Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   was earlier 
On the other hand  IDC data shows that the company had a 35  share of the U S  smartphone market while Sensor Tower data shows that consumers spent  25 5 billion on Apple devices in first half 2019  or a two third share   
It s definitely an antitrust situation  even considering that Apple eased up a bit on messaging after the Bloomberg report  allowing Siri to pick the platform most commonly used with a particular contact  For example  if you asked Siri to send a message to X  it will check out the platform you normally use to send messages to X  If that happens to be WhatsApp  it will send the message on that platform 
No wonder that regulators have started taking a closer look at Apple

that they were working on it  Finally  they patted their own backs with Trump announcing that Apple was keeping production in the U S  and Apple announcing how it had won important exemptions What About DACA Ahead of the Nov 12 Supreme Court hearing on President Trump s 2017 plan to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  program  it was opposed by Apple CEO Tim Cook and HR head Deidre O Brien The two made a written submission to the court saying things like  We are distressed at the prospect of ripping our DACA colleagues from the fabric of our company   and that its 443 DACA colleagues from across 25 countries  spark creativity and help drive innovation  They are among our most driven and selfless colleagues   and further that  We did not hire them out of kindness or charity  We did it because Dreamers  as they re called  embody Apple s innovation strategy  They come from diverse backgrounds and display a wide range of skills and experiences that equip them to tackle problems from different perspectives  Because they thrived in the face of adversity  they often exhibit extraordinary levels of grit and drive    They have earned the right to continue to contribute to our company and to our society  And to drive the point home  they said   Apple would quite literally not exist without a brilliant and driven population of immigrants   noting that even Steve Jobs was a Syrian migrant Of course legal migration is not the issue here  DACA relates to children belonging to people  mostly Hispanics  who crossed the border without legal papers Analysts Turn Positive on AppleSamik Chatterjee  a JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  analyst  raised his 2019 and 2020 iPhone volume estimates and said that improving sales led by the iPhone 11 family would raise Apple share prices by more than 20   Maintaining his Overweight rating  he raised his price target from  243 to  265 iPhone units are now expected to be a million  units more in the current quarter and 3 million units more in the December quarter  The introduction of a 5G enabled device in 2020 will drive demand for high end devices in North America and ensure buoyancy in prices  As a result  iPhone units will touch 198 million in 2020 and 200 million in 2021 Earlier  Jeffries analysts Kyle McNealy and George Notter took their price target to  260 and asked investors to buy Apple shares  They are optimistic about 5G  saying that  current expectations for Apple s first 5G iPhone lineup are too low  They underestimate Apple s competitive position for 5G devices    Their iPhone unit forecast is 190 million in 2019 and 208 million in 2020 The reasons for their optimism include the huge marketing push for 5G across the industry that Apple will also benefit from  the scope for differentiation the new generation devices will allow  increased smartphone penetration across the world and expansion of Apple s own line with mid range offerings Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  analyst Jeriel Ong sees average selling price declines in 2020  driven by the lower price points of iPhone 11  which starts at  699 compared to the iPhone XR starting price of  749 and lower pricing on older generation iPhones  The analyst thinks that lower priced models will account for 40  of iPhone shipments in the next 12 months  He also expressed uncertainty about the lower prices yielding higher unit sales because we don t know how feature additions in new models will be taken up by the market Apple Growing Walled GardenSo what else is new Long time Apple bull  Bloomberg s Mark Gurman  recently pointed out that the list of pre installed  default apps on the iPhone had jumped from 17 in 2007 to 38 in the latest edition  So whether you want to message a friend  look up a map  check your email  search information in the browser  or a host of other things  you really have no choice except to go with Apple  And nothing else  no matter how good or useful or preferred  gets to be the default  Something like what Microsoft was earlier On the other hand  IDC data shows that the company had a 35  share of the U S  smartphone market while Sensor Tower data shows that consumers spent  25 5 billion on Apple devices in first half 2019  or a two third share   It s definitely an antitrust situation  even considering that Apple eased up a bit on messaging after the Bloomberg report  allowing Siri to pick the platform most commonly used with a particular contact  For example  if you asked Siri to send a message to X  it will check out the platform you normally use to send messages to X  If that happens to be WhatsApp  it will send the message on that platform No wonder that regulators have started taking a closer look at Apple RecommendationsApple shares carry a Zacks Rank  4

13827,235342,GRMN,3 Dividend Paying Tech Stocks For Income Investors To Buy Right Now,opinion,"The U S  Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest for the second time this week by 25 basis points to between 1 75  and 2   Yet  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has not committed to additional rate cuts because the U S  economic picture remains relatively strong  despite the specter of the ongoing trade war between the world s two largest economies 
The broader global economic picture is somewhat gloomy  but both the Dow and the S P 500 sit less than 1  below their record highs  And with interest rates so low  investors will likely stay in stocks  at least for now  With this in mind  we searched for strong tech companies that also pay a dividend  utilizing our  
These three tech stocks should remain attractive to investors even during a potential downturn 
1  KLA Corporation   NASDAQ KLAC  
KLA Corporation  formerly known as KLA Tencor  is a semiconductor equipment firm based in Milpitas  California  KLAC makes process control and process enabling solutions for everything from wafers and reticles to integrated circuits and flat panel displays  The firm posted stronger than projected top and bottom line results last quarter  Q4 fiscal 2019  and its shares have soared 25  since then  Better yet  KLAC stock is up a whopping 77  in 2019  which blows away its industry s 26  average climb  KLAC has also jumped 52  in the past 12 months  compared to its industry and the S P 500 s roughly sideways movement 
Over the past three years  KLAC stock has easily outpaced its industry  up 127   against 48   The impressive run helps the company rest right at its all time highs  Despite the climb  KLAC is trading at 16 2X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus earnings estimates  which marks a discount against its industry s 18 5X average and its own three year high 
KLAC currently pays an annualized dividend of  3 00 per share for a 1 91  yield  which comes in above the 10 year U S  Treasury s 1 77  payout  The company is also projected to see its current full year earnings jump 11 1  on 21 2  higher revenue  KLAC is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  at the moment and has seen its fiscal 2020 and 2021 earnings estimates surge 
2  Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   
Microsoft is not a Zacks Buy Ranked stock at the moment  sitting at a  3  Hold   Nonetheless  the historic tech titan  which does earn  A  grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system  looks strong after it hit brand new highs earlier this week  The Redmond  Washington based firm announced an 11  dividend increase and a new  40 billion share buyback program on Wednesday 
MSFT has now raised its quarterly dividend every year since it began paying one in 2004  The firm s new  2 04 per share annualized payout puts its yield at 1 45   This dividend yield is more impressive considering that Microsoft shares have climbed 22  over the last 12 months to top all of the FAANG stocks second place Facebook   NASDAQ FB   stock is up just 16   with Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   down 6   Shares of MSFT have also skyrocketed 142  in the last three years  against its industry s 41  
The company has expanded its cloud computing segment over the last several years to become the second largest player in the quickly growing space  Peeking ahead  our estimates call for Microsoft s fiscal 2020 revenue  last reported Q419  to jump 11 2   with 2021 projected to come in 10 5  above that  These estimates come on top of 2019 and 2018 s 14  sales expansions  Meanwhile  MSFT s EPS figures are projected to pop 10 1  and 12 8   respectively  Despite all the positivity and growth  the firm s valuation picture is hardly that bloated  trading at a discount against its industry and its peer group  which includes Oracle   NYSE ORCL    Salesforce   NYSE CRM    and other giants 
3  Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN  
Many investors might only think of Garmin as a retail level maker of GPS devices  smartwatches  and fitness trackers that compete with the likes of Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and Fitbit   NYSE FIT    The firm s in car navigation systems did help it become a household name  but Garmin sells a ton of other products from high end fish finders to advance radars for aviation and boating  The Switzerland headquarter firm s Q2 revenue popped 7  to come in above our quarterly estimates  with its Aviation and Marine units up 20  and 13   respectively 
Garmin is a Zacks  2  Buy  that has seen its stock surge 35  in 2019 and 64  over the past two years  to top its industry s 13  climb and S P 500 s 20  jump  The GPS firm s climb makes its current 2 67  dividend yield almost 1  above the 10 year Treasury look all the more impressive  Garmin s forward earnings multiple of 21 4X also marks a discount against its own two year high of 23 8X 
Plus  GRMN is part of the Electronics   Miscellaneous Products industry that sits in the top 15  of our 255 Zacks Industries  And Garmin s Q3 revenue to is projected climb to 6 7   with Q4 sales expected to jump 9  to  1 02 billion  At the bottom end  the company s 2019 earnings are projected to pop 5 7

13831,235346,GRMN,Why I Like Garmin  GRMN  Stock,opinion,"Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN   shares have appreciated nicely over the past year  but I believe there s further upside 
This is despite the negative political environment  It has in fact been seen that historically  political events like the impeachment of a president has had only a temporary impact on the stock market  Shares have instead traded on any number of other considerations  such as the state of the economy  the conditions impacting the industry  company specific factors  and so on  So there s no reason to think that this time will be any different 
As far as Garmin is concerned  the company is in good hands  it has a strong track record of delivering on its strategies and it last reported a classic beat and raise quarter  Plus  the valuation indicates that further upside is likely  Let s see some details 
A Beat   Raise Quarter
Garmin had a strong second quarter with 7  growth in total revenue  and easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 9   EPS grew 17  over the prior year  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16   Gross margin expanded around 180 basis points  bps   operating margin expanded around 250 bps and operating income grew 18   All of this goes to show that the company is very efficient at converting revenue to profit 
Moreover  the highest margin Aviation segment grew gross margin by 78 bps  operating margin 191 bps 
Outdoor  with the second highest margins  also grew gross margin by 49 bps although operating margin dropped 176 bps 
Marine was third  with gross margin expansion of 201 bps and operating margin expansion of 759 bps 
Fitness was fourth  with gross and operating margin contraction of 247 bps and 331 bps  respectively  The Tacx acquisition  which added the indoor category brought some inventory with it  and may have accounted for some of the margin pressure 
Auto saw gross and operating margin expansion of 567 bps and 882 bps  respectively 
It appears that the company is seeing increased competition in its wearable products from stalwart Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   and others like Fitbit   NYSE FIT   and Fossil   NASDAQ FOSL    requiring increased investment in the business 
Garmin raised the guidance for 2019  Revenue is now expected to be  3 6 billion  previous  3 5 billion   gross margin 59 5   unchanged   operating margin 23 2   previous 22 7    tax rate 16 5   unchanged   and EPS  3 90  previous  3 70   Revenue growth in the Aviation  Fitness  Marine  Outdoor and Auto segments is expected to be 17   previous 10    13   unchanged   12   previous 10    10   unchanged  and  15   previous  18    respectively 
Delivering on Strategy
I first started looking at GRMN stock more than a decade ago  And in all this time  one thing that always shone through was the discipline in its management and its ability to deliver on key strategies 
So when smartphones rendered its personal navigation devices obsolete  and it was a business that contributed more than half its revenue and profit   the company was able to come up with the innovation and energy required to build out its other segments to offset the steady decline in auto  which includes PNDs   Today  Garmin remains the leading supplier of PNDs  but the secular decline in that business is being offset with steady growth in its other businesses    
The margins and profitability in each of those businesses continue to be worked upon and acquisitions have been smoothly integrated to build new product lines or augment an existing one 
Above all  it s really comforting to know that Cliff Pemble  the person at the steering wheel  has been around forever and seen all the ups and downs and good and bad 
Valuation
Being the kind of company it is  Garmin has always traded at a premium to the S P 500 and also its industry  which includes other buy ranked companies like Fujitsu General Ltd    KLA Tencor Corp    NASDAQ KLAC    SMC Corp    OTC SMCAY   and Kopin Corp    NASDAQ KOPN    You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
So it is more meaningful to compare its current performance with its performance over the past year  But just to give you an idea  the stock has gained 21 1  over the past year compared with the S P 500 s 1 0  and the industry s 10 4  

 
So why do I think that there s still upside left  from a valuation perspective  
Based on its forward 12 month P E  the stock is trading at 21 07X  which is closer to its median value of 20 46X than at either end of the high low range of 23 78X to 17 28X  The S P  which is also trading relatively close to its median value of 16 75X  is moving in a much tighter range of 17 63X to 15 09X  However  the electronics   miscellaneous products industry is trading at 16 42X  which is closer to the high end of its trading range of 16 79X to 12 72X 

 
On a price to trailing twelve months sales basis  GRMN is trading at 4 64X  higher than its median value of 4 33X but comfortably within its high low range of 4 99X to 3 47X  The S P is trading close to its median value  but in a tighter range  as in the previous case  Also  we find that while Garmin is trading 7 2  above its median value  the industry is trading 12 2  above its median value 

 
On a price to adjusted free cash flow basis  Garmin is trading above its median value while the S P 500 is trading at the median value and the industry is trading well below it  But as in the above cases  Garmin trades in a wider range  meaning there is more room for upward movement  
So the top end of its trading range over the past year is 19 8  above its median value and 17 4  above its current price  For the S P 500  the top end of its trading range is 14 6  above the median value  Investors typically don t pay as much for the industry s cash flow  so the difference is significantly wider for the industry  at 38 4

13864,235379,GRMN,Garmin  GRMN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Garmin  GRMN  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of personal navigation devices is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1  
Revenues are expected to be  919 07 million  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Garmin 
For Garmin  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Garmin will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Garmin would post earnings of  0 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 73  delivering a surprise of  2 82  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times

What s Next for Garmin

34288,255803,GRMN,Garmin  Harley Davidson  Beyond Meat  Campbell Soup And General Mills Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 2  2019    Shares of Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN   as the Bull of the Day  Harley Davidson   NYSE HOG   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND    Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   and General Mills   NYSE GIS   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Garmin reported earnings Wednesday morning and posted stronger than expected results beating both top and bottom line estimates  Management was very optimistic in the earnings call with Garmin CEO Clifton Pemble asserting that this past quarter s  strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance   Sell side analysts have been boosting EPS estimates for GRMN propelling this stock into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  The BusinessA company that started as a pure play GPS business was able to survive the smartphone revolution and now operates a diverse portfolio of recreational technology  Garmin produces a wide breadth of tech from smartwatches for golfing to marine trolling motors  The company is separated into 5 segments  fitness  outdoor  auto  aviation  and marine with revenue share being in that order Garmin is expected to post its strongest annual sales figures since the inception of the business in 2019  proving its ability to evolve to meet consumer demands successfully Garmin just posted a record high Q2 sales  its most robust quarterly revenues since 2009 demonstrating a 7  increase  The firm is dialing back its low margin auto segment  and if you adjust revenue for that decline  the firm exemplified 12  year over year sales growth  Since 2016 Garmin has been able to grow its topline year over year every quarter consistently Gross margins have continued to expand as the business realizes economies of scale  I believe this trend will continue as Garmin grows and focusses on higher margin production  As the firm dials back on its low margin auto segment  it focuses on growing its highest margin aviation division which grew 20  this past quarter and management is estimating that its full year growth will be around 17  Garmin is now attempting to enter the commercial aircraft space  which would significantly increase demand for its high margin aviation products  If it can penetrate this market successfully  I believe Garmin s share price will skyrocket Performance and ValuationGRMN has grown 21  thus far in 2019  outperforming the broader market by 3 5  percentage points  I am confident that this stock has much more room to appreciate  Below is a 52 week performance chart for GRMN   Harley Davidson just posted its worst 2nd quarter sales figures since 2011 as this firm continues its descent into the abyss  HOG has lost over 35  of its value in the past 5 years  and sell side analysts continue to lower EPS estimates pushing this stock into a Zacks Rank  5 The primary issue with Harley Davidson is its aging demographic  Millennials are now the largest consuming generation they are not interested in the archaic gas guzzling chopper  Millennials are much more likely to buy a smaller crotch rocket that is likely electric because this generation is saving the planet from the devastating climate change Harley is attempting to pivot with the shifting consumer  The firm has an electric motorcycle in their product line that is being marketed to the millennial  but the issue is the Harley brand  It is not easy to shift a brand image that has been instilled in Americans for as long as Harley Davidson has Harley hit its peak levels of profitability in 2006 with its net income exceeding  1 billion  This year its bottom line could be less than half of that figure as demand slows substantially  Gross and net margins have been falling quickly as the firm s economies of scale start to reverse with decreasing volume  The company is expected to continue to decelerate  This year is expected to see a double digit EPS decline along with a roughly 7  drop in sales Take AwayHarleys and bulkier motorcycles have entered the declining phase in their products long cycle  There is not a lot that Harley can do short of completely revamping its image  which would take a significant amount of capital  An economic downturn would further deteriorate this consumer discretionary company s financials  Harley is highly leveraged  which adds volatility to this already declining security At best  Harley will be forced to discount its vehicles to drive more demand  In the long run  I see this stock falling further as its products decline deepens Additional content Beyond Meat  BYND  Has a Good Problem  Too Bad Investors Don t Like It Beyond Meat shares took a beating this week as the alternative protein supplier made the most of its soaring valuation to raise some more capital The dilution to existing shareholders notwithstanding  this was a really good move to raise a neat  40 million by issuing just 250 000 additional shares  The IPO price of  25 a share fetched just  240 million Some early investors also took profits  which is one of the concerns people seem to have because usually  insider sales are a red flag that means the company isn t headed in the right direction But honestly  there doesn t appear to be reason for fear  not on this count anyway  Because first  they are offloading just a teensy bit of their holdings  totaling 3 million shares  and second  the company is putting up towering growth numbers that really makes it look like they underpriced the shares at the IPO  The insiders were released from their legally required six month long lock in period  which must count for something And as far as growth is concerned  which number would you rather pick Revenue growth in the just reported quarter was 67 3  and 287 2  from the previous and year ago quarters  respectively  Take your pick The Fresh platform  by far its larger segment  grew 74 5  sequentially and 347 9  from last year The emerging Frozen platform grew 25 0  sequentially and 25 1  year over year Retail  50 7  of sales  was up 74 3  sequentially and 192 0  year over year Restaurant   Foodservice  49 3   was up 60 6  and 483 0   from the two periods  respectively It s hard to find a weak spot  but one does wonder why the company needs to offer such a hefty discount  which grew 96 3  sequentially and 170 6  year over year  more on this in a minute   The company still managed to expand its gross margin  which went from 15 0  a year ago to 33 8  in the last quarter Moreover  positive EBITDA  earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  is not just in sight  it s a reality today  So in the last quarter  adjusted EBITDA came in at  6 9 million compared to   5 6 million last year We can t even complain about the net loss  which at 24 cents a share  shrank from  1 22 last year  The pro forma profit of a penny was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an 8 cent loss The company even raised its full year guidance To sustain such high growth rates  it s only natural that the company would need to invest in capacity  And this is actually value creation  because if numbers are to get anywhere close to justifying the sky high valuation  the company has got to keep the growth rates up  And there are opportunities both in the domestic market and internationally  because soy free  gluten free  plant based  responsibly sourced processed stuff is just so much in demand  The company just can t seem to sell enough  which is a good problem to have We should of course consider competition  which will no doubt intensify somewhere down the line  from both existing fresh frozen processed meat producers and vegan suppliers like Beyond Meat  This will pressure supplier sources for inputs  it recently expanded suppliers  which is another positive  on the one hand and prices on the other For many  the vegan burger is a novelty and they ll just go back to what they were eating earlier  or it ll be more like a once in a while sort of thing  So the  1 4 trillion meat market  which is what alternative meats are looking to eat into  is also part of the competition Producing plant meat is more expensive than traditional meats  which is likely the main reason for the heavy discount on its products  But that day may not be far away when the benefits of scale reduce eliminate the difference While the gross margin expansion looks attractive now  it s an obvious indication of improving utilization  So when the company adds capacity sometime next year  those numbers aren t going to look as good  But it wouldn t be something to panic over either ConclusionFor a company with the kind of solid fundamentals that Beyond Meat is displaying and more importantly  the kind of growth it is seeing  there shouldn t be so much concern  In fact  we should probably not look at the numbers from a quarter to quarter perspective  other than to see that it remains on track directionally The volatility in share prices is because of the high valuation with many investors expecting the shares to tank  this is a heavily shorted stock   The new shares will increase the float  there could even be more volatility with prices receding to a more realistic level  where it could be worth a buy  So it s all good RecommendationsSince we can t recommend BYND at the current valuation and therefore have a Hold rating  Zacks Rank  3  on it

34400,255915,GRMN,Apple  AAPL  Q2 Earnings To Benefit From Non iPhone Segments,opinion,Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   non iPhone segments   Services  Wearables  Mac and iPad   are expected to play significant roles in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  scheduled to be released on Apr 30 The Services business  which includes revenues from Internet Services  App Store  Apple Music  Apple Care  Apple Pay  and licensing and other services  has become the new cash cow for the company  Services revenues accounted for 19 1  of sales in first quarter 2019 Moreover  the Wearables business  which includes Apple Watch  Beats and AirPods  is expected to stay in limelight  In the last reported quarter  revenues from Apple TV  Apple Watch  Beats products  iPod  and Apple branded and third party accessories accounted for 8 7  of sales      Notably  Apple s non iPhone businesses grew 19  year over year in the last reported quarter  However  non iPhone segments  strong performance was not enough to drive the top line in the last reported quarter  Net sales decreased 4 5  year over year to  84 31 billion  primarily due to weakness in iPhone sales  which fell 15  and accounted for 61 7  of total sales Hence  performance of these non iPhone segments in the second quarter will be eagerly watched by investors to measure the success of Apple s revenue diversification strategy Apple Inc  Revenue  TTM     to know how Apple s overall second quarter performance is likely to be Non iPhone Businesses to Aid Top Line GrowthServices business is expected to benefit from the increasing size of installed base  Moreover  the segment is expected to benefit from robust spending on subscription based apps such as Tencent Video  Spotify   NYSE SPOT   and Tinder Additionally  Mac revenues are expected to benefit from the launch of MacBook Air and Mac mini  The company also bolstered its iMac line up in the last reported quarter The 21 5 inch iMac features 8th generation quad core  and for the first time  6 core processors  which will help it perform up to 60  faster  Additionally  the 27 inch iMac  which can deliver up to 2 4 times faster performance  is available in two variants  9th generation 6 core and 8 core processors  However  sluggish PC market is expected to hurt Mac sales  Notably  worldwide PC shipments  4 6  year over year in first quarter 2019  per Gartner Apple Updates iPad Portfolio in Q2Apple also launched the ultra thin iPad Air that measures 10 5 inches diagonally and is supported by Apple Pencil  Moreover  iPad Air performance is expected to be 70  better  due to the A12 Bionic chip and Apple s Neural Engine Apple also launched the new 7 9 inch iPad mini that delivers  three times the performance and nine times faster graphics   The device is 25  brighter and has the highest pixel density among any of the iPads  powered by the advanced Retina display with True Tone technology However  since both the devices were launched toward the end of the quarter  they are not expected to have a material impact on sales Apple Dominating Wearables MarketFurther  the wearables business is likely to grow  driven by robust adoption of Apple Watch and AirPods  Notably  total revenues from wearables surged more than 50  year over year in the last reported quarter According to Strategy Analytics    Apple Watch maintained its  1 position with 51  global smartwatch market share in the fourth quarter of 2018  Samsung  KS 005930  was positioned at  2  followed by Fitbit   NYSE FIT   and Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN   Toward the end of the March quarter  Apple started rolling out watchOS 5 2 update in its Apple Watch 4 along with electrocardiogram  ECG  app and irregular heartbeat or atrial fibrillation  AFib  detection feature in 19 European countries and Hong Kong Notably  the ECG app and the AFib detection feature were launched in the United States in December  Apple Watch 4  which is an FDA approved device  is also equipped with an in built accelerometer and gyroscope  which track the wrist trajectory and impact acceleration for fall determination Apple Watch s European Availability to Boost Market ShareAlthough the European roll out will not materially impact second quarter results  the expansion is expected to boost Apple Watch s market share  The ECG and AFiB features are expected to provide Apple a competitive leverage over the likes of Xiaomi  Huawei  Samsung  Garmin and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   division Google in the smartwatch and wearables markets Further  Apple s new AirPods are powered by the new H1 chip and expected to provide 50  more talktime compared with the earlier version  Due to the H1 chip  the new device is likely to have better connectivity with iPhone or iPad  The model also offers hands free support due to integration with Siri  However  the updated AirPods will not materially impact second quarter fiscal 2019 results Apple currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Today s Best

and applications designed for people who live an active lifestyle  Garmin has five primary business units  automotive  aviation  fitness  marine  and outdoor recreation Strong Q4 PerformanceThe GPS technology company beat estimates on both the top and bottom line Earnings of  1 02 easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents per share  while revenues of  932 million grew 4  year over year Despite a 28  decline in its automotive segment revenue  Garmin s aviation  marine  outdoor  and fitness products climbed a combined 13   which helped offset the automotive underperformance Notably  outdoor product revenue grew 25  thanks to Garmin s adventure watch lines In the company s earnings release  CEO Cliff Pemble said that 2018 was a remarkable year of revenue and operating income growth   He continued   Entering 2019  we see many opportunities ahead and believe that we are well positioned to seize these opportunities with a strong lineup of products across all of our segments  GRMN GainingYear to date  shares of GRMN are up 41  compared to the S P 500 s return of almost 16  Along with strong Q4 results  Garmin announced upbeat forward guidance for 2019 For full year 2019  the company projects revenues of  3 5 billion  up from  3 35 billion seen last year and above consensus estimates of  3 43 billion  Earnings are expected to come in at  3 70 per share for

last 60 days GRMN does report its next quarterly results right at the beginning of May  so be aware that the company s current outlook could be impacted But  thanks to high consumer demand  steady sales and a strong product portfolio  the future is looking bright for Garmin  If you re an investor looking for a tech stock to add to your portfolio  make sure to keep GRMN on your shortlist  Tailored Brands  Inc  is a men s retailer that specializes in suits and tuxedo rentals  and is headquartered in Houston  Texas   The company used to be known as The Men s Wearhouse  and provides customers with a wide range of suiting options including suit separates  sport coats  slacks  dress shirts  sportswear and outerwear  and shoes and accessories Q1 Guidance Hurts TLRDAfter Tailored Brands cut its outlook for the fourth quarter back in January  its Q4 results were mostly expected An adjusted loss of 28 cents per share came in slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus  but adjusted revenues of  770 million missed our consensus estimate and declined 10  year over year Men s Wearhouse comparable sales for the quarter decreased 3 2   while JoS A  Bank saw comps fall 0 5  As a result  TLRD cut their outlook once again for the first quarter  which was not expected  The retailer now expects adjusted earnings of  0 10 to  0 15 per share  well below analysts   0 50 forecast Same store sales at both Men s Wearhouse and JoS A  Bank is expected to be be down 3  to 5  due to  significant headwinds  like the late Easter holiday  foreign exchange impacts  and current business trends Many analysts cut their price targets following this earnings release  For instance  Susan Anderson at B  Riley FBR cut TLRD from  20 to  11 and downgraded the stock to  neutral  from  buy  Estimates Keep FallingAnalysts have since turned more bearish on Tailored Brands  with two cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  Earnings are expected to decline roughly 17 3  for the year  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 55 cents during that same time period from  2 46 to  1 91 per share This sentiment has stretched into 2021  While earnings could grow almost 12   our consensus estimate has dropped significantly in the past two months TLRD is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Shares of the retailer have fallen over 46  since January  In comparison  the S P 500 is almost 16  year to date Bottom LineTailored Brands  management team does have a few strategies in place that  if successful  could help bolster its e commerce presence and the company s move towards fresher  more modern product TLRD does boast a forward P E of just under 4X and a dividend yield of 9 7   but neither of these two factors mean much of anything if the company won t be able to increase growth on all fronts A New Earnings Season    With Trade WorryA new U S  earnings season makes its major entry this week  49 S P 500 firms report their latest Q1 results  including 25 Financial Sector firms Don t forget about international affairs  though  as the domestic earnings scene pops more fully into the headlines On Monday  U S  Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer is set to meet his Japanese trade counterpart in Washington DC  On Wednesday  Indonesia s general elections get held and Mainland China s latest GDP growth print comes out That makes the economist in me think  Asia will become a second big focus in the Global Week Ahead  Fully enabled effects from the U S  China trade war will begin to reveal themselves  in manifold ways Trade war influences can take many shapes Firstly  they surely bend company earnings  and depress country trade accounts  Note the negative import and export trade flows from Indonesia out today Second  trade war effects are likely visible inside the political situations of many  many locales  Particularly those countries with close ties to the Mainland China economy  Japan s trade rep visit and Indonesia s election this week supply two classic examples Finally  we will get updates to Europe s lousy manufacturing PMIs this week  That region delivers the best evidence on a global U S  China trade war effect Next  I list Reuters  five world market themes  in order of importance to equities  These most likely dominate thinking for both investors and traders in the Global Week Ahead  1  Q1 Earnings Flood InThe focus is on the hotly anticipated U S  results  First quarter earnings for S P 500 companies are expected to fall 2 5 percent on the year in what would be the first quarterly decline since 2016  But revenue is expected to rise 4 8 percent Those earnings will be crucial to see if the bull market can keep running  Some have argued the Federal Reserve s patience on rate increases this year as well as stock buybacks will add fuel to the S P s rally  Also boosting the S P 500 Index are the recent performance of the banks and financials  which had suffered more than the broader market in the fourth quarter  when recession fears scared investors away First out of the blocks was JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   which reported a better than expected quarterly profit as higher interest income and gains in its advisory and debt underwriting business offset weakness in trading Bank of America  NYSE BAC   Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  are all scheduled to release their results in days to come  Large banks have indicated that muted capital market activity at the start of the year caused by sluggish trading volumes will be a drag on overall results  Financials are expected to deliver 1 8 percent earnings growth  according to I B E S Refinitiv Share performance may boil down to valuation  For the next 12 months  Goldman Sachs appears the cheapest  with investors paying  8 30 for every dollar in expected earnings  compared with  11 80 for Bank of New York Mellon  The former is the worst performing stock over the last two years among U S  banks  2  It s a Shortened 4 Day Trading Week  Due to EasterIt s the start truncated trading   the first of four consecutive shortened trading weeks  as a series of public holidays in Europe begins with Easter  Japanese markets will also be closed for a string of holidays in late April The truncated weeks come just as volatility in financial markets has slumped  In equities  the VIX  known as the  fear index   is close to its lowest levels since October  Foreign exchange price swings have fallen to their lowest for several years  according to the Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  Currency Volatility Index Even the British pound  long the vent for Brexit related angst  has turned increasingly calm   and traders are not expecting many big moves for sterling in the months ahead after this week s six month Brexit delay Caught between mixed economic data releases of recent weeks  a postponement to figuring out how Britain will extricate itself from the European Union until as late as October and elusive progress in the Sino U S  trade war have left markets treading water But with fewer traders at their desks on fewer days  the rest of April will see heightened risks of a spike in volatility  or even flash crashes  should a surprise hit markets just as calmness descends  3  Manufacturing PMI CheckupApril manufacturing activity data will give a glimpse of the economic health of the United States and the Eurozone  Chinese GDP data will provide an update on the health of the world s second largest economy Dismal March PMIs for the United States and Eurozone sent shivers through markets  They were taken as ominous signs for the global economy as international trade tensions hurt factory output But robust factory data from Beijing offered hope that efforts to shore up China s economy are kicking in  which injected further fuel to the global equity rally The IHS Markit flash Purchasing Managers  Index due on April 18 should indicate if that optimism was justified   and if stocks have further upward momentum  China s first quarter GDP data is out on April 17 Many investors say low expectations for first quarter earnings  dovish central bank policies and hopes for Chinese stimulus and a trade truce between Washington and Beijing are largely priced into equity markets  With all that baked in and investors still scrambling for consensus on what happens over the rest of 2019  there s a lot riding on that data  4  The Turkish Lira and Argentine PesoFor all the relief in emerging markets that the Federal Reserve doesn t expect to raise interest rates anytime soon and that commodity prices are hot again  there are still the troublesome twosome  The Turkish lira and Argentine peso The peso has slumped to fresh lows in the past 10 days  although the International Monetary Fund s unlocking a  10 8 billion tranche of funds helped the battered currency to regain some of its footing Meanwhile  nine weeks of losses in the last 10 have the lira sliding back toward six to the dollar  the level that set alarm bells ringing last year Ankara s economic reform plans   announced on Wednesday   failed to impress markets and investor meetings with Finance Minister Berat Albayrak at the IMF and World Bank spring meetings did little to change that Ankara s row with Washington over plans to buy a Russian missile defense system and declines in its FX reserves have only added to the concern of investors still smarting from last month s pre election move to temporarily freeze the London lira market  5  Indonesia Holds ElectionsThe world s largest and third largest democracies are going to the polls  Indonesia holds parliamentary and presidential elections on April 17  India s elections are spread over seven phases and 39 days Both countries face similar issues around anti incumbency and flailing economic growth  Betting on continuity  investors have pumped money into their markets  driving up bonds and stocks Polls in Indonesia suggest President Joko Widodo  or Jokowi  who faces his opponent from 2014 once again  will not only win re election but will also emerge with a stronger coalition  Indonesian markets have also always scored well in election years So it s India that investors should be sweating over  Even if the February tensions with neighbor Pakistan have given Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his coalition an edge  the risks are that he will lose his majority and may cobble together a new partnership that could slow down reforms Top Zacks Stocks  1  Amazon  The behemoth is back on our Zacks  1 Rank list  The Growth score is A  The Value score

According to Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   the global space industry could generate revenue of  1 1 trillion or more in 2040  up from   350 billion in 2018  Bank of America  NYSE BAC  estimates the space economy to grow to  3 trillion by that time  UFO provides a convenient way to invest in the fast growing space industry

A Japanese start up is developing a shooting star creation technology and plans to offer meteors on demand  Noted astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson says that space mining will produce world s first trillionaire 
Will space tourism  mars colonization and asteroid mining become real things in the next few years 
While billionaire investors like Bezos  Musk and Branson are investing a lot in the space economy  their companies are not publicly traded  However  there are many other innovative companies in the space related industries  UFO focuses mainly on pure play space companies as at least 80  of its constituents derive a majority of revenues from space related businesses

34477,255992,GRMN,Garmin  GRMN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Garmin  GRMN  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of personal navigation devices is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 4  
Revenues are expected to be  721 85 million  up 1 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Garmin 
For Garmin  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Garmin will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Garmin would post earnings of  0 79 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 02  delivering a surprise of  29 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Garmin doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/garmin-grmn-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200410346,200410346

remote control systems  GPS navigation  home automation systems  healthcare devices  industry factory automation  robotics  semiconductor applications  and energy management solutions In addition to the United States  a number of companies in this industry are domiciled in Japan  Germany  the Netherlands and Switzerland  The common factor is that either these have manufacturing operations in China and South East Asia or generate significant revenues from this region Here are the three major industry themes Tariffs that resulted from the trade dispute between the United States and China  particularly in areas such as robotics  industrial automation and semiconductor applications  severely affected industry participants  The tariffs imposed on  200 billion worth of imports from China in September 2018 are applicable for parts and materials used in these segments of the industry  The dispute has forced a number of industry participants to find new sources of production and supply  However  the transition has delayed shipments affecting revenues  Uncertainty over settlement of the trade dispute remains an overhang on industry participants  Original equipment manufacturers  OEMs  are exposed to volatility in prices of commodities like copper and steel  Commodity prices are likely to increase in the near term due to growing demand and concerns over tightening global supplies  Tariffs on key components procured from China have also increased raw material costs  Moreover  short supply of transistors and capacitors is hurting production capabilities  Further  volatility in foreign exchange  particularly in currencies like Japanese yen and Thai baht negatively impact industry participants  The resurgence in Japanese yen is expected to continue due to growing threat of recession  slowing global economy and headwinds in the emerging markets  Moreover  weakening currencies of emerging economies against the U S  dollar do not bode well Zacks Industry Rank Clouds

34569,256084,GRMN,PHG Or GRMN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Electronics   Miscellaneous Products stocks are likely familiar with Royal Philips  PHG  and Garmin  GRMN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Royal Philips has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Garmin has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PHG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
PHG currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 97  while GRMN has a forward P E of 19 93  We also note that PHG has a PEG ratio of 1 12  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  GRMN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 71 
Another notable valuation metric for PHG is its P B ratio of 2 50  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  GRMN has a P B of 3 49 
Based on these metrics and many more  PHG holds a Value grade of B  while GRMN has a Value grade of D 
PHG sticks out from GRMN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that PHG is the better option right now ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/phg-or-grmn-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200384313,200384313
34570,256085,GRMN,Garmin  GRMN  Reports Next Week  What To Expect,opinion,"Garmin  GRMN  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of personal navigation devices is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 79 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  889 72 million  up 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Garmin 
For Garmin  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Garmin will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Garmin would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1  delivering a surprise of  33 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

34606,256121,GRMN,Shenandoah  NVIDIA  Garmin  Qualcomm And Hewlett Packard Enterprise Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 23  2018    highlights Shenandoah   NASDAQ SHEN   as the Bull of the Day  NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN    Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM   and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE   Here is a synopsis of all the five stocks   With stocks searching for bottoms here  it s really beginning to temp the value seekers  The Tuesday morning low could prove to be the swing low of the market here in November  That could potentially lead to a Santa Claus Rally that has the shorts running up the chimney  Rather than blindly buying the dip  I m looking for stocks which have positive earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts  They always know more than the average Joe  If they are pushing up their estimates on a stock  maybe there s something good coming around the corner One stock with positive earnings momentum is today s Bull of the Day  Shenandoah  Shenandoah Telecommunications Company  through its subsidiaries  provides regulated and unregulated telecommunications services to customers and other telecommunications providers in central and western Virginia  south central Pennsylvania  West Virginia  Maryland  North Carolina  Kentucky  Tennessee  and Ohio  It offers integrated voice  video  and data communications services  The company operates in three segments  Wireless  Cable  and Wireline  The Wireless segment provides digital wireless mobile services  and wireless mobility communications network products and services Currently  Shenandoah is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in an industry that ranks in the Top 25  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is the series of earnings estimate revisions to the upside coming from analysts  Over the last thirty days  two analysts have increased their estimates for the current quarter and current year  The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zack Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 14 cents to 26 cents while the current year number has gone from 55 cents to 81 cents The bullish revisions have helped underpin a strong move in the stock  Prior to its last earnings report  SHEN was trading down under  36  A solid beat  coupled with estimate revisions to the upside  have shot the stock up over  48  All this has been taking place while the broad market has come under serious pressure  I can already see the crowds with their pitchforks and torches while I write this  Before I get into this discussion I want to make one thing perfectly clear  The Bear of the Day is not a recommendation to sell a stock  Rather  it s meant to point out a particular stock which has seen bearish earnings estimates coming from analysts  It s not an indictment on the long term idea of ownership  I m merely bringing to light issues that investors may not have been aware of  In other words  don t kill the messenger Today s Bear of the Day is none other than NVIDIA  That s right folks  the tech giant famous for graphics cards  chips for data centers  and autonomous driving tech  NVIDIA Corporation operates as a visual computing company worldwide  It operates through two segments  GPU and Tegra Processor  The GPU segment offers processors  which include GeForce for PC gaming and mainstream PCs  GeForce NOW for cloud based game streaming service  Quadro for design professionals working in computer aided design  video editing  special effects  and other creative applications  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  for AI utilizing deep learning  accelerated computing  and general purpose computing  GRID provides power of NVIDIA graphics through the cloud and datacenters  DGX for AI scientists  researchers  and developers  and cryptocurrency specific graphics processing units  The Tegra Processor segment provides processors designed to enable branded platforms   DRIVE and SHIELD  DRIVE automotive computers and software stacks  which offer self driving capabilities  SHIELD devices and services designed for mobile cloud in home entertainment  AI  and gaming applications  and Jetson TX 2  an AI computing platform for embedded use Ground zero here was the last earnings report  EPS came in just shy of expectations but that wasn t the reason for the tailspin  You can chalk that up to the abysmal revenue guidance  Analysts were looking for revenues of  3 4 billion for next quarter  NVIDIA came out and guided at  2 7 billion  That s a huge readjustment for analysts to make  This made for a brutal selloff in the stock and justifiably so  Investors had to readjust their growth expectations  thus changing the valuation model on the stock  Once willing to pay as much as 15 8x TTM sales  that multiple has now been reset to just 7 5x  To give you some perspective  the semiconductor industry average price to sales ratio is 3 3x  Granted  NVDA still enjoys a sales growth rate of 26  for the current year  That growth is expected to slow to 5 9  next year This caused a rush of earnings estimates to the downside  Eleven analysts cut their estimates for the current quarter  while twelve cut their numbers for next year  The bearish sentiment has sent the Zacks Consensus Estimate down from  2 03 to  1 41 for the current quarter while next year s number has been cut from  8 73 to  7 11  It s the main reason that the stock has dropped down to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Management simply dropped the ball here  It s not about missing the number  which is a whole other argument  This is about not managing expectations  Had they done a better job of communicating with analysts  they would have allowed them to adjust their models sooner  This would likely have led to a much softer landing for shares  rather than the downward death spiral they were put on following this disastrous report  It was so bad that it sent the entire NASDAQ down into the gutter along with it Additional content 3 Tech Stocks for Dividend Investors to Buy NowTech stocks have been unpredictable at times recently  but the sector has proven it can rebound from volatility strongly  and there is no question that tech has been the leader of the market s strong multiyear run up to this point However  this might mean that income investors those focused on finding companies with solid dividends might be feeling left out  as tech stocks aren t really known for their payouts Finding a strong dividend yielding tech stock might feel like searching for a golden goose  but investors should not feel too intimidated  In fact  dividend focused investors can search for the best tech stocks by using the   the perfect one stop screening tool for investors of all kinds By limiting our search to companies in our  Computer and Technology  sector with Zacks Rank  2  Buy  or better rankings  we can ensure that we are finding the highest quality stocks to buy right now  Throw in your preferred dividend yield and voila the best tech stocks for dividend investors to target Check out three of these stocks to buy now 1  Garmin Ltd Garmin is a designer of GPS navigation and wearable technology equipment  The stock is holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and presents a dividend yield of about 3 3   Investors have to pay a slight premium for GRMN right now  but a valuation of 19x forward earnings and a PEG ratio of 2 5 are certainly not outrageous Meanwhile  Garmin generates  3 42 in cash per share and sticks out from the rest of the technology group with its net margin of 19 5   which dramatically outpaces its industry s average  Garmin is also an efficient company  evidenced by its RoE of 17  2  Qualcomm Inc Qualcomm is one of the world s largest telecommunications equipment and semiconductor manufacturing companies in the world  QCOM currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a dividend yield of 4 5   Management has a great track record of adding to the payout and has hiked the dividend annually since 2009 Chip stocks have been volatile  but Qualcomm offers exposure to different businesses  including large swaths of untapped growth in 5G  This is part of why the company is expected to improve earnings by 9 5  this fiscal year and see a long term annualized EPS growth rate of 11 5   This should further improve its financial position and allow it to reward shareholders even more 3  Hewlett Packard Enterprise CompanyHewlett Packard Enterprise is an integrated systems company focused on enterprise offerings like IT solutions  servers  and cloud based products  The old Hewlett Packard Company might have been losing some of its clout  but the spinoff has created new efficiencies for HPE  and the potential here is great for income investors HPE is sitting at a comfortable Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has a dividend yield of 3 1   The firm will report earnings next week  and analysts expect the quarter to reveal earnings growth of more than 48   That estimate has also trended higher over the duration of the quarter  so sentiment is trending in the right direction  HPE has only missed once since the spinoff and also looks undervalued at just 9x earnings Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just

34644,256159,GRMN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Fitbit  Apple  Garmin And Fossil,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 9  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Fitbit   NYSE FIT    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN   and Fossil   NASDAQ FOSL   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Smartwatch Showdown  Apple vs  FitbitRecently  wearables company Fitbit reported better than expected earnings thanks to the addition of new products  Fitbit is the number two player in the smartwatch area in the U S   entering the market with zero share only 14 months ago  It is interesting to see that sales of smartwatches are still increasing  even though it seems as if the craze has died down  However  companies like Fitbit and Apple are coming out with newer versions of their smartwatches  which is continuing to entice consumers  So  let s take a closer look at Fitbit s Versa smartwatch and the Apple Watch Series 4 Fitbit Versa  Fitbit sold 3 5 million wearable devices in the third quarter  with the average selling price up 3  year over year  Since the introduction of many new devices such as the Versa  Charge 3 and Aria 2  62  of revenue came from these different wearables and smartwatches  More specifically  sales of the Versa smartwatch increased from the year ago period  taking the lead over similar performers like Garmin  Samsung  KS 005930  and Fossil  Throughout this year  the company has seen a 49  increase in revenue just from the Smartwatch sector of the company In its Q3 report  CEO James Park mentioned that the company saw sequential growth in both tracker and smartwatch products throughout the year  Due to that  they are re affirming their full year guidance of  1 5 billion The watch has proved to be more popular among female consumers  making up almost 72  of consumers  A reason for this could be Fitbit s female health tracking feature  which has seen a lot of engagement since its launch  But if the company wants to see growth and success  they can t solely rely on the sales of their smartwatches  A lot of the company s products are fitness trackers  which have lacked sales in the past  In Fitbit s recent quarterly report  their full year 2018 guidance projects a decline in sales of tracker devices but an increase in sales of smartwatches  Although the company has seen a decline in sales until now  it is apparent that Fitbit is trying to turn things around and is sticking to its promise to deliver products that its consumers want Apple Watch Series 4 According to   the Series 4 Apple watch is the best  most accessible Apple Watch to date  Apple has a very die hard consumer base and it s those consumers that buy almost all of Apple s new products  With a brand new design  features and updates  Apple has captured its consumers to buy the  perfect  smartwatch in the market right now In Apple s Q4 report  the company reported revenue of almost  63 billion  an increase of 20  from the year ago quarter  The company ended with a record year with September being their best quarter ever  growing double digits in a lot of the different segments  Although the company didn t specify numbers for the Apple watches  CEO Tim Cook mentioned that the company set records for iPhones and Wearables and that with the launch of many new products  they are entering the holiday season with their strongest lineup of products and services If what Cook mentioned in the quarterly report to be true and that this will be their greatest holiday season ever  investors can look towards higher sales and more demand for Apple products in the upcoming months  It seems as though no matter what product or new update Apple comes out with  its most loyal customers will always have it  It s no surprise that investors have become used to Apple reporting better than expected results and saying only positives about the company in their press releases  Therefore  investors will look towards the individual units Apple produces and especially during the holiday season Which Smartwatch Takes the Reign  It can be said that both brands of smartwatches have their pros and cons  Seeing as the Versa is almost half the price of the Series 4 and includes many of the same features  it would be reasonable to purchase the Versa over the Series 4 watch  However  for those consumers who are loyal to Apple s brand would lean more towards buying their products instead of Fitbit s  If we look towards the design and processing features of the Series 4  it can be said that more consumers would lean towards buying that  However  for those looking to buy a simpler and cheaper version of Apple s smartwatch  Fitbit would be your best bet with its Versa smartwatch Bottom Line It is clear that Apple has consumers buying their watches and it s also clear that people are buying Fitbit s Versa smartwatch  However  during Q3  Fitbit s competition wasn t as stiff as it will be now  Apple s Series 4 watch came out at the end of Q3  so there wasn t really much to compare to  But with the holiday season coming up  both companies can look towards competition with their respective products Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities

34677,256192,GRMN,Verizon s MERIT Ready To Protect Network Assets   Facilities,opinion,"Verizon Communications Inc  s   NYSE VZ   specialized group of engineers known as MERIT  Major Emergency Response Incident Team   recently finished their annual training to ensure the protection of the company s network assets and facilities in the event of natural disasters or hazardous materials incidents  Formed in 1992  Verizon s MERIT team consists of more than 30 technically skilled communications employees  These members are certified and capable of entering into an area hit by hazardous materials spill and responsible for completing network repairs 
In fact  the MERIT team is known to have a wide range of expertise in areas such as wireless and wireline telecommunications network equipment like fiber optic cables  routers  transmission equipment  customer premise equipment  wireless mobile assets  radio networks and critical infrastructure like Heating  Ventilation and Air Conditioning  HVAC  systems  Trained in emergency response management  this team of specialized engineers are also capable of operating at the highest operational protection level  The use of multiple tools enables them to detect over 30 chemicals  biological as well as radiological containments 
Notably  the team s training has been completed under the guidelines of Occupational Safety and Health Administration   OSHA   and National Fire Protection Association   NFPA    Verizon s MERIT team is equipped with an onsite  climate controlled mobile command center with a conference room  workspaces  external cameras  communications equipment  an on board generator as well as a weather station 
Our Take
Verizon expects its Wireless and Wireline businesses to perform impressively in 2018  Solid margin expansion owing to expected savings from tax reform and continued strong FiOS fiber optic network and strategic services in the Wireline business is also anticipated in the same period  Further  the company is looking forward to capitalize on the countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things and telematics ecosystem across multiple industries  Verizon s focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising is likely to drive growth as well 
In the past three months  shares of Verizon have lost 0 5  compared with the  s decline of 4 3  

Moreover  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is systematically diversifying itself as a major player in the digital content and online advertising space   Also  the company has been forging ahead to expand its fiber optics networks to support 4G LTE and upcoming 5G wireless standards as well as wireline connections  Verizon too has an attractive fundamental outlook based on increasingly favorable growth prospects for its Wireless business and the possibility of improved performance from its Wireline operations 
However  Verizon continues to struggle in the competitive and almost saturated U S  wireless market  The industry is likely to witness more competition in 2018  with the entry of cable MSOs  multi service operators   Furthermore  in an effort to expand its customer base  the company is spending heavily on promotion and offering lucrative discounts  which might weigh on margins 
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the same space include AMETEK  Inc    NYSE AME    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN   and Intuit Inc    NASDAQ INTU    All these three companies carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
AMETEK surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 6 03  
Garmin outpaced estimates in the preceding four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 12 26  
Intuit exceeded estimates in the preceding four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 37 79

34684,256199,GRMN,ChemoCentryx  58 com  Seagate  Garmin And Texas Instruments As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate Release         Chicago  IL   June 22  2018    highlights ChemoCentryx   NASDAQ CCXI   as the Bull of the Day and 58 com   NYSE WUBA   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onSeagate Technology PLC   NASDAQ STX    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN   and Texas Instruments  Inc    NASDAQ TXN   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks                                                 When the Trump administration came to power  one of the cornerstones of his plan was to cut regulation  One industry which has benefited dramatically from the scaling back of this regulation has been the biopharmaceutical business  With fewer restrictions on experimental drugs  biotech is having its day in the sun  One biotech enjoying a very nice run up lately is today s Bull of the Day  ChemoCentryx ChemoCentryx  Inc   a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  develops new medications for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  and cancer in the United States  The company targets the chemokine and chemoattractant systems to discover  develop  and commercialize orally administered therapies  Its lead drug candidate is Avacopan  an orally administered complement inhibitor of the complement C5a receptor  C5aR   is in Phase III development for the treatment of anti neutrophil cytoplasmic auto antibody associated vasculitis  AAV  The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank lies in future earnings estimate numbers  Analysts have adjusted their estimates to the upside for the current year and next year  Current year consensus has gone from a  1 18 loss up to a  1 loss  Often times  biotech companies working on new drugs have to take losses while their products go through research and development  Seeing estimates increase should help ease investor fears in the meantime The stock has run up aggressively since trading down at  6 to start the year  A couple of very solid earnings reports in a row  along with earnings estimates moving to the upside have helped underpin a rally into the teens  Yesterday s aggressive selling sank the stock  serving up a potential opportunity on the pullback  With threats of a trade war continuing to loom over the market you probably want to avoid going face first into Chinese stocks right now  Eventually the selling could lead to a great opportunity  but if you are one of those contrarians  you may want to find stocks that have earnings estimates moving in a positive direction  Today s Bear of the Day is a Chinese internet stock that s seen its earnings estimates move to the downside  Perhaps something to avoid even if you re looking to play a bounce I m talking about 58 com  58 com Inc  operates online classifieds and listing platforms that enable local merchants and consumers to connect  share information  and conduct business in China  It primarily operates online multi content category classified advertising platforms under the 58 and Ganji names  and Anjuke  an online real estate listing platform  The company s platform contains local information of approximately 500 cities or towns in various content categories  including jobs  real estate  used goods  automotive  and yellow pages  It offers membership services  such as merchant certification and listing benefits  as well as display of online storefronts  and online marketing services comprising listing services  such as real time bidding and priority listing  as well as marketing services through collaboration with third party Internet companies Currently  the stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank is the string of recent earnings estimate revisions to the downside  Looking the current year numbers  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped from  2 07 to  1 97  That s enough to give it the unfavorable Zacks Rank 3 Tech Stocks for Dividend Investors to Buy NowTech stocks have been unpredictable at times recently  but the sector has rebounded from volatility strongly  and there is no question that tech has been the leader of the market s strong multiyear run  However  this might mean that income investors those focused on finding companies with solid dividends might be feeling left out  as tech stocks aren t really known for their payouts Finding a strong dividend yielding tech stock might feel like searching for a golden goose  but investors should not feel too intimidated  In fact  dividend focused investors can search for the best tech stocks by using the Zacks Stock Screener  the perfect one stop screening tool for investors of all kinds By limiting our search to companies in our  Computer and Technology  sector with Zacks Rank  2  Buy  or better rankings  we can ensure that we are finding the highest quality stocks to buy right now  Throw in your preferred dividend yield and voila the best

products for the enterprise  client computing  and client non computing market applications  Seagate is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  The firm is currently generating a staggering  6 78 in cash per share on the back of 32  cash flow growth  Seagate takes advantage of its strong cash position by offering investors a dividend yield of 4 3   making it one of the most attractive income options in the entire technology sector 2  Garmin Ltd Garmin is a designer of GPS navigation and wearable technology equipment  The stock is holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and presents a dividend yield of about 3 5   Investors have to pay a slight premium for GRMN right now  but a valuation of 19 5x forward 12 month earnings and a PEG ratio of 2 3 are certainly not outrageous  Meanwhile  Garmin generates  3 42 in cash per share and sticks out from the rest of the technology group with its net margin of 18 6   which dramatically outpaces its industry s average of 1 7   Garmin is also an efficient company  evidenced by its RoE of 15 7  3  Texas Instruments  Inc Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators  Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world  TXN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   It should be a solid year of growth for the firm  with current estimates calling for earnings to expand by 28  in 2018  The company is also witnessing cash flow growth of 19 5  right now  Texas Instruments is really a cash cow  bringing in a total of  5 34 in cash per share  Management uses its solid financial position to reward shareholders with a dividend yield of roughly 2 2  currently Want more market analysis from this author  Make sure to

34690,256205,GRMN,Smartwatch Showdown  Apple  AAPL  Vs  Fitbit  FIT ,opinion,"Recently  wearables company Fitbit   NYSE FIT   reported better than expected earnings thanks to the addition of new products  Fitbit is the number two player in the smartwatch area in the U S   entering the market with zero share only 14 months ago  It is interesting to see that sales of smartwatches are still increasing  even though it seems as if the craze has died down  However  companies like Fitbit and Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   are coming out with newer versions of their smartwatches  which is continuing to entice consumers  So  let s take a closer look at Fitbit s Versa smartwatch and the Apple Watch Series 4 
Fitbit Versa  
Fitbit sold 3 5 million wearable devices in the third quarter  with the average selling price up 3  year over year  Since the introduction of many new devices such as the Versa  Charge 3 and Aria 2  62  of revenue came from these different wearables and smartwatches  More specifically  sales of the Versa smartwatch increased from the year ago period  taking the lead over similar performers like Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN    Samsung   OTC SSNLF   and Fossil   NASDAQ FOSL    Throughout this year  the company has seen a 49  increase in revenue just from the Smartwatch sector of the company 
In its Q3 report  CEO James Park mentioned that the company saw sequential growth in both tracker and smartwatch products throughout the year  Due to that  they are re affirming their full year guidance of  1 5 billion 
The watch has proved to be more popular among female consumers  making up almost 72  of consumers  A reason for this could be Fitbit s female health tracking feature  which has seen a lot of engagement since its launch  
But if the company wants to see growth and success  they can t solely rely on the sales of their smartwatches  A lot of the company s products are fitness trackers  which have lacked sales in the past  In Fitbit s recent quarterly report  their full year 2018 guidance projects a decline in sales of tracker devices but an increase in sales of smartwatches  Although the company has seen a decline in sales until now  it is apparent that Fitbit is trying to turn things around and is sticking to its promise to deliver products that its consumers want 
Apple Watch Series 4 
According to   the Series 4 Apple watch is the best  most accessible Apple Watch to date  Apple has a very die hard consumer base and it s those consumers that buy almost all of Apple s new products  With a brand new design  features and updates  Apple has captured its consumers to buy the  perfect  smartwatch in the market right now 
In Apple s Q4 report  the company reported revenue of almost  63 billion  an increase of 20  from the year ago quarter  The company ended with a record year with September being their best quarter ever  growing double digits in a lot of the different segments  Although the company didn t specify numbers for the Apple watches  CEO Tim Cook mentioned that the company set records for iPhones and Wearables and that with the launch of many new products  they are entering the holiday season with their strongest lineup of products and services 
If what Cook mentioned in the quarterly report to be true and that this will be their greatest holiday season ever  investors can look towards higher sales and more demand for Apple products in the upcoming months  It seems as though no matter what product or new update Apple comes out with  its most loyal customers will always have it  It s no surprise that investors have become used to Apple reporting better than expected results and saying only positives about the company in their press releases  Therefore  investors will look towards the individual units Apple produces and especially during the holiday season 
Which Smartwatch Takes the Reign  
It can be said that both brands of smartwatches have their pros and cons  Seeing as the Versa is almost half the price of the Series 4 and includes many of the same features  it would be reasonable to purchase the Versa over the Series 4 watch  However  for those consumers who are loyal to Apple s brand would lean more towards buying their products instead of Fitbit s  If we look towards the design and processing features of the Series 4  it can be said that more consumers would lean towards buying that  However  for those looking to buy a simpler and cheaper version of Apple s smartwatch  Fitbit would be your best bet with its Versa smartwatch 
Bottom Line 
It is clear that Apple has consumers buying their watches and it s also clear that people are buying Fitbit s Versa smartwatch  However  during Q3  Fitbit s competition wasn t as stiff as it will be now  Apple s Series 4 watch came out at the end of Q3  so there wasn t really much to compare to  But with the holiday season coming up  both companies can look towards competition with their respective products

34705,256220,GRMN,Fitbit Rating Downgraded By Morgan Stanley  Shares Fall 9 4 ,opinion,"Fitbit  Inc    NYSE FIT   has reportedly been downgraded by Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst Yuuji Anderson  The analyst downgraded Fitbit s stock from equal weight to underweight  Also  he lowered the target price by 20  to  4 on the stock  prompting a massive decline of 9 41  in its share price
The company s growth has been hampered by increasing competition in the fitness wearable category  lack of upgrades among existing users and lackluster growth in the Asia Pacific region 
The impact of these headwinds has been significant on the stock 
Notably  the company s shares have lost a mammoth 85  since Jun 18  2015  the day it started trading on the New York stock exchange at  30 40  Also  the stock has underperformed the  on a year to date basis  While its industry has gained 18 4   the stock has lost 19 1  

Why the Downgrade 
This activity tracker and fitness device maker has introduced a number of new products in the recent past  Just last month  the company launched a modern fitness tracking device   Fitbit Versa  which is more akin to Apple Watch 3 and Samsung  KS 005930  Gear Sport  It is a light metal smartwatch that provides a personalized dashboard to users with many other fitness and smartphone features 
However  Yuuji Anderson believes that the new device isn t much capable to offset the decline in Fitbit s sales  He believes that though the company is making efforts to diversify its product portfolio  yet these products are unable to drive enough revenues for the company  Coming to the company s sales figures  Fitbit sold only 15 3 million devices in 2017  a decrease of 32  from 22 3 million sold in 2016 
The analyst believes that one of the main reasons for weak sales was the increasing competition  especially from Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    The company faced a stiff competitive pressure from Apple s Apple Watch that is a smartwatch combined with fitness tracking feature 
Not only Apple  there are other big manufacturers too who are developing connected devices on Alphabet owned Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  s Android operating system 
Yuuji Anderson wrote   We see more downside to the stock as revenues struggle to stabilize and cash burn resumes   In addition   We think new smartwatches will be outweighed by declines in legacy products  while software opportunities in health coaching will take time to ramp  
Conclusion
Fitbit  which became a prominent name for its simple fitness wearables  has been hurt by massive competition in the market 
It faces competition in both the high and low end product range  On the high end front  it competes with Apple Watch  Although Fitbit expected Ionic to help the company take on Apple  it is hardly an easy task to compete with one of the biggest companies in the world  Also  many big manufacturers are developing connected devices on Google s Android operating system 
On the lower end  fitness tracking devices from Jawbone  Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN   and Xiaomi also pose tough competition 
Even the launch of its flasgship Ionic and addition of innovative features have not helped it stay ahead of its competitors  However  we need to wait for a while and see if Fitbit s new products can help it gain any meaningfully share from the rising opportunities in the health care business Fitbit  Inc  Price and Consensus

Apple Leads in Wearable Devices
The device category that Fitbit   NYSE FIT   pioneered is rapidly changing character as consumer tastes move from basic bands to smartwatches offering greater functionality and cellular connectivity  That s the market that Apple has latched onto so well to become the leading player with fourth quarter unit shipments of 8 million  market share of 21  and representing growth of 57 5   according to IDC 
Despite its purchase of smartwatch maker Pebble and the subsequent launch of its Ionic smartwatch  Fitbit has been pushed to second place with 5 4 million units  which is 14 2  of the market and represents a 17 3  decline from last year  Xiaomi  Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN   and Huawei follow with 13   6 5  and 4 3  market share  respectively  Huawei saw the strongest growth of 93 2  in the last quarter   

 
Other News  EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told CNBC that the European Commission will withdraw its complaint against Ireland for not recovering 13 billion euros   16 billion  in unpaid taxes from Apple if it recovers the full amount  Considering the complex process  she has offered to overlook the considerable delay in recovery  Irish authorities have said that their calculations thus far are close to the commission s 13 billion euro figure Apple could be taking baby steps in healthcare with its new subsidiary AC Wellness Network  LLC  first spotted by CNBC  which has the stated mission of delivering  the world s best healthcare experiences for Apple employees   On the face of it  Apple is adding to its corporate responsibilities by ensuring that its employees stay healthy  But it s worth noting that the Cupertino based company sells a smartwatch that s expert at tracking healthcare metrics  as well as a very useful Health app  Last January  it introduced a new feature into the app that allows users to check their medical records on their iPhones  Tech peer Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   has  made more public moves into healthcare with its startups  Recently  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   has done likewise through its collaboration with leading banks  So it s not too much of a stretch to think that Apple would also be in the fray President Trump has proposed a 25  tariff on imported raw steel and 10  tariff on imported raw aluminum that is broadly expected to increase the price of many products that use these materials for packaging or otherwise  While a number of Apple products use Aluminum  it won t be affected  As Gene Munster of Loup Ventures says   The only thing they make in the U S  right now is the high end Mac Pro   which probably accounts for about 1  of sales  So even if the cost of producing that 1  goes up 10   there will hardly be any impact on Apple s profits Apple shares carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   But you can see

34774,256289,GRMN,GoPro  GPRO  Sinks  Reports Massive Q4 Loss As Sales Tank,opinion,GoPro  Inc  s   NASDAQ GPRO   shares were still reeling from the shock of its dismal preliminary results  when the company reported weaker than expected fourth quarter 2017 earnings that hurt the stock even more The company slipped back into the red as it reported an adjusted net loss of 30 cents per share for the fourth quarter  in stark contrast to earnings of 29 cents per share posted in the year ago quarter  The bottom line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents per share by a wide margin  The company has lost money in seven of the last 10 quarters Not surprisingly  the company s shares were trading 6 6  lower in pre market trading at the time of writing For the full year  the company lost  182 8 million on a GAAP basis  which was  nonetheless  better than the 2016 net loss figure of  419 million Inside the HeadlinesGoPro s revenues for the all important holiday quarter missed the mark as well  as sales plunged 38 1  year over year to  334 8 million  marking it as its worst holiday season since the company went public  The tally missed the company s preliminary estimate of  340 million  which was already well short of its original estimates  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged much higher at  384 million before the company released the preliminary figures The top line took an  80 million hit due to discounting of the Karma drones and Hero cameras during the holiday season For 2017  revenues came in at  1 18 billion  underlining a marginal decline compared to 2016 The weakness in revenues was broad based across geographies  The company witnessed a 35 9  decline in the Americas to  175 7 million  while Europe plummeted 46 7  to

below the expected range of 25 27   Non GAAP operating loss came in at  37 4 million  considerably down from operating income of  31 6 million generated in the comparable quarter last year Further  camera units shipped tanked 40 4  year over year to 1 361 million Even so  there was a silver lining in the company s bleak quarterly earnings release  GoPro noted that it holds more than 80  of the action camera market in the United States  by unit volume  The camera manufacturer also saw its unit sales rise 28  and 96  year over year in China and Japan  respectively For the reported quarter  R D expenses continued the downward trend and slumped 43 4  year over year  Additionally  sales and marketing expenses dropped 42  year over year  Fourth quarter operating expenses came in at  138 1 million  down 42 1  year over year Restructuring MeasuresGoPro has been aggressively cutting costs in recent times through a series of layoffs  Last year  the company conducted two rounds of layoffs  cutting 7  and 15  of its workforce in January and November  respectively  GoPro also shuttered its entertainment and media business as part of the restructuring last year Just last month  GoPro announced that it has decided to abandon its drone business  citing intense competition and a hostile regulatory environment  The company is also slashing 20  of its workforce after a sub standard holiday quarter  Specifically  GoPro is letting go of around 250 of its staff and will reduce CEO Woodman s salary to  1  in order to curtail operating expenses further The current job cuts and restructuring will result in an estimated charge of  23  33 million  most of which will be recognized in first quarter 2018 LiquidityExiting the fourth quarter  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  202 5 million  up from  192 1 million as on Dec 31  2016 GuidanceIn light of such bleak results  the company refrained from providing any guidance for 2018 Our TakeNot a long while ago  GoPro had hoped Karma would help turn its fortunes around and stoke growth for the beleaguered action camera company  Karma has been a roller coaster ride for the company  punctuated mostly by lows rather than highs  as problems like production delays to a recall of 2 500 units due to a battery issue plagued the drone from the beginning  GoPro is now shuttering its drone business  citing stiff competition and regulatory hassles Amid its multiple operational issues  production delays and bungled up product roll outs  GoPro has already lost significant ground to competitors like Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN   and Nikon Corporation   OTC NINOY   Late in 2017  GoPro slashed prices for the Hero 5 Black and Hero 5 Session cameras  It also cut the price of its latest camera  HERO 6 Black  to  399 from  499  The constrained demand and price cuts will impact the top line in the coming quarters as well  For now  it appears that investors don t believe GoPro s initiatives can outweigh the weak demand for its only real products  particularly as it exits a potential major revenue generating business In fact  GoPro has reportedly hired banker JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM  to advise on a potential sale Not surprisingly  GoPro currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   You can see  Breaking News  Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market

34793,256308,GRMN,GoPro  GPRO  Sees A Rough Start To 2018  Catalysts Limited,opinion,Investors who stuck through thick and thin for GoPro  Inc   NASDAQ GPRO   have had their faith badly shaken lately  The stock has lost a whopping 46 5  in the past six months against the  s rally of 22 2  Huge  multiple layoffs  heavy discounting  decaying fundamentals and a dismal track record of missing targets have hurt GoPro s brand image in the market  Not surprisingly  we have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on GoPro You can see  GoPro s revenues have been highly volatile in the past three years  and have largely followed a downward trend  particularly in recent months  In fourth quarter 2017 results  the top line took a severe hit  down 38 1  year over year  due to sluggish demand for GoPro s Hero gadgets  and discounting of the Karma drones and Hero cameras during the holiday season The company is anticipating revenues to contract further in the first half of 2018  as it clears inventory from sales channels Bad KarmaThe company is shutting its drone business  Not a long while ago  GoPro had hoped Karma would help revive the company s fortunes and stoke growth for the beleaguered action camera company  Karma witnessed a roller coaster ride  punctuated mostly by lows rather than highs  thanks to problems like production delays and recall of 2 500 units due to a battery issue Karma was  no doubt  facing mounting margin challenges in a tremendously competitive aerial market  dominated by the likes of DJI Technology and AeroVironment  A hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States further reduced Karma s total addressable market and made its future untenable The Bottom LineComing to the bottom line  GoPro has actually lost money in seven of the last 10 quarters  The company reported an adjusted net loss of 30 cents per share in the fourth quarter against earnings of 29 cents in the year ago quarter  The bottom line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents Recently  GoPro has been aggressively cutting costs through a series of layoffs  In 2017  the company conducted two rounds of layoffs  slashing 7  and 15  of its workforce in January and November  respectively  Last month  the company announced another 20  layoff of its workforce  After the latest round  GoPro will end up with less than 1 000 employees The company is targeting to limit operating expenses to less than  400 million in 2018 compared with  476 million incurred in 2017  This is likely to aid GoPro s attempts to revive bottom line  However  the company already expects to book a net loss in 2018 What Went Wrong According to the company s founder and CEO Nick Woodman  the blame for GoPro s third consecutive holiday season shortfall lay at the door of poor pricing decisions on its flagship cameras  This suspiciously sounds like the company is trying to downplay weak demand for its action cameras  At the very least  it shows that that for all its brand recognition  GoPro doesn t really have any pricing power In 2017  GoPro slashed prices for the Hero 5 Black and Hero 5 Session cameras  It also cut the price of its latest camera  HERO 6 Black  to  399 from  499  The constrained demand and price cuts are likely to affect the top line in the upcoming quarters In light of the dismal developments  the analysts  community has become bearish on the stock  with estimates plunging headlong in the past 60 days  For 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate nosedived from earnings of 44 cents per share to a loss of 37 cents over the past couple of months  highlighting acutely negative expectations from the company GoPro  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Tough Road Back to ProfitabilityDespite multiple challenges  GoPro still holds about 80  of the action camera market in the United States  In the fourth quarter  its unit sales grew 28  and soared 96  year over year in China and Japan  respectively  We are optimistic about the company s subscription offerings CEO Nicholas Woodman also expects that the cameras  to be introduced in the second half of 2018  will drive margin expansion  Thus  investors should watch margin trends as the year unfolds to see if the company can deliver on its commitment Woodman is committed to revive the company s business in 2018 and outlined strong restructuring measures to achieve the same  For now  it appears that investors don t believe that GoPro s initiatives can outweigh soft demand for its only real products  particularly as it exits a potential major revenue generating business An Easier Way Amid severe operational issues  multiple layoffs and decaying fundamentals  GoPro has already lost significant ground to competitors like Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN   and Nikon Corporation   OTC NINOY    Further  GAAP losses might result in additional cash burn  thus weakening the company s balance sheet even more There is no easy answer to GoPro s troubles  If the company doesn t turn its performance around soon  GoPro may have to sell itself  In fact  there were some reports recently that indicated that GoPro hired banker JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM  to advise on a potential sale Don t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year  giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more  Those gains  however  came with serious volatility and risk  Bitcoin sank 25  or more 3 times in 2017 Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly ,2018-02-13,Zacks Investment

34851,256366,GRMN,Garmin  Fabrinet  Salesfore com  Hewlett Packard Enterprise And Deere   Company Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 20  2017    highlights Garmin Ltd   NASDAQ GRMN   as the Bull of the Day and Fabrinet   NYSE FN   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Salesfore com   NYSE CRM    Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE   and Deere   Company   NYSE DE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Wall Street has always welcomed second chances  Once known for its in car GPS devices  Garmin Ltd has emerged as one of the most exciting  second chances  of the year  and investors are finally starting to reward the company for its shift to wearable technology Founded in 1989  Garmin became a household name thanks to its affordable and reliable GPS technology  which was quickly integrated into consumer navigation devices in the early 2000s  On top of that  Garmin has always been a market leader in GPS technology for the aviation  marine  and outdoor industries But Garmin s management has also been proactive and forward thinking  The company s traditional GPS units are less popular in today s smartphone dominated world  but Garmin has successfully shifted to a wearable tech focus  Now  after another great quarter  GRMN is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and looking like one of the strongest stocks in the consumer gadgets space Latest Earnings ReportEarlier this month  Garmin reported third quarter results of 75 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents  The company notched revenues of  743 1 million  outpacing our consensus estimate by  25 million and expanding 2 9  year over year Product line expansion and innovation remained a key component of Garmin s performance  In the quarter  the company launched the Descent dive watch  the Impact bat swing sensor  and the TXi series of touchscreen flight displays  Garmin also unveiled several new wearables and partnered with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to launch Garmin Speak  a device that brings full range of Alexa skills inside car Gross margin for the quarter was 58 4   up 215 basis points from the year ago period  Solid demand drove volume in all segments except Auto  helping to lift segment gross margins on a year over year basis  OEM services company Fabrinet started 2017 strongly  but the stock has toppled since hitting new highs in February and has been unable to garner any positive momentum recently  Now  after a disappointing quarter  it could be time to ditch FN for good Fabrinet provides precision optical  electro mechanical and electronic manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers of complex products  such as optical communication components  modules and sub systems  industrial lasers and sensors After sluggish results in its most recent quarter led to slipping earnings estimate revisions  Fabrinet is now sitting at a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   with shares already down about 20  on the year Latest Earnings ResultsIn its most recent quarter  Fabrinet posted earnings of 75 cents per share  missing our Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents per share  The company also saw revenues of  357 million  which missed our consensus estimate of  359 million Management also announced guidance for its upcoming fiscal period  Fabrinet now expects current quarter earnings to fall in the range of 69 cents to 71 cents per share  Revenue is expected to be in the range of  328 million to  332 million In the comparable quarter last year  Fabrinet reported earnings of 91 cents per share and revenues of  351 million  so the company s projections signal some significant retraction Additional content We have already moved past the traditionally busy stretch of earnings season  but there are still several key reports to look forward to next week  So far  Q3 earnings have been strong across the board  so it will be interesting to see whether these reports will continue that trend and inspire strong trading for the remainder of the calendar year With that said  investors can always use the  to plan out their schedules for earnings

market closes on November 21  Salesforce has never missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings  and shares of the company are up over 56  so far this year  Nevertheless  increased competition in the cloud CRM space  as well as expensive international investments  could create new pressures this quarter Based on our latest consensus estimates  we expect Salesforce to report earnings of 37 cents per share and revenues of  2 65 billion  which would represent year over year growth of 52  and 23   respectively  Investors will want to focus on the company s international growth  as a series of strategic partnerships and investments have made this segment the company s key growth catalyst 2       Hewlett Packard Enterprise  HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise is slated to release its latest earnings report after the bell on November 21  Things have been relatively up and down for HPE since its split from the former Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ  in late 2015  Still  the company is coming off a strong earnings beat in the most recent quarter  and a recent spin off could help improve margins According to our latest consensus estimates  HPE is poised to post earnings of 28 cents per share and revenues of  7 71 billion  During the third quarter of fiscal 2017  the company sold its Software business to British firm Micro Focus  so the most important year over year comparison

the market opens on November 22  Deere has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in 13 consecutive quarters  and the company s stock has gained more than 30  this year Based on

34852,256367,GRMN,GoPro  GPRO  A Solid Bet Now  Invest In The Stock ,opinion,"Shares of GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   have underperformed the  in the past year  The stock has declined 16 3  in contrast to the industry s surge of 50 5  in the same time frame  The company recently reported decent quarterly numbers but disappointed with its guidance issued for the fourth quarter  This is one reason why shares of this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock have declined post release of its results 

If the company s soft growth projections have let the market down on one hand  its satisfactory quarterly report offered some relief  The company reported earnings of 15 cents  substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of break even level 
Also  GoPro surprised investors with its sales figures as its quarterly revenues soared 37 1  from the prior year quarter s tally  The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  which marked the company s second consecutive quarter of revenue growth 
The company s revenue growth was driven by robust sales of the latest Hero5 cameras and launch of its premium priced HERO6 Black with global on shelf availability  HERO5 cameras are enjoying impressive market traction  which is likely to reflect well in the company s upcoming quarters  The HERO5 camera is proving to be particularly popular in China and Europe  Also  the company has been recently logging strong accessory revenues that should continue to drive the metric higher in the near term 
GoPro has also significantly curbed operating expenses  limiting the possibility of making illogical decisions like selling the Karma drone at low margins and pushing inventory into the retail channel  Operating expenses in the third quarter were down a whopping 42 4  year over year  having significantly contributed to the earnings beat  In fact  the company expects operating expenses to fall below  500 million to boost profits and expand margins 
GoPro has been aiming to transform itself from the  camera maker  to  content maker   and has taken significant steps to diversify into higher margin businesses including video editing and virtual reality 
GoPro has definitely struggled of late with messed up product launches  operational stumbles and several attempts to hit the right price points  Shares of the company have slumped over 56  in the last couple of years as the company grappled with production delays and bungled up product roll outs  As a result  it lost ground to competitors like Sony Corp    NYSE SNE    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN   and Nikon Corp    OTC NINOY    This culminated in some significant layoffs  restructuring measures and the decision to shutter its nascent entertainment business 
However  the current year has been kinder to GoPro with the company having cut down on losses and started to inch toward profitability  We remain optimistic about the company s encouraging new product line up  including the HERO 6  the new Fusion camera and a software update on the Karma Drone  which should drive growth and incremental margins for the company in times ahead 
GoPro  Inc  Price and Consensus
   Further  analysts have been witnessing positive estimate revisions of late  boosting a bullish sentiment around the stock  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 being sharply revised upward from a loss of 3 cents to earnings of 5 cents over the past couple of months 
Its robust product arsenal  positive analyst outlook  decreasing expenses and expanding margins bode well for the company  This uptrend should impact the share price as well  Investors  too  could benefit from the stock riding high on these positives

However  all investors could focus on was GoPro s outlook for the fourth quarter 
Gray Skies Ahead 
GoPro expects its holiday quarter sales to be subdued  which is curious  given a complete range of product offering and better supply chain management  Compared to last year s holiday quarter  this year GoPro ought to benefit from a full holiday season of Karma  two new cameras  GoPro 6 and Fusion 360  and a complete range of complementary accessories  Further  GoPro seems to have solved its supply chain issues which have plagued the company s performance in the past 
Despite all these supposed growth catalysts  GoPro estimates its fourth quarter revenues to come in at about  470 million      10 million   This figure represents a 13  contraction from last year s tally and a massive 26  decline from 2014 s fourth quarter  And GoPro suffered from major supply chain issues last year which meaningfully impacted the holiday season  which should also be taken into account in year over year comparisons 
Projected full year 2017 results don t look good either  and actually reflect negligible growth when normalized for supply chain issues and messed up product launches which supposedly hurt growth  Additionally  a free cash flow shortfall  and continued margin compression are other red flags that cast doubts over GoPro s growth story 
Evidently  weakness in the holiday season of 2017 would likely spill over to the first half of next year as well  And we have yet to talk about the intense competition and soft demand that GoPro faces 
As GoPro grappled with production delays and bungled up product roll outs  it lost significant ground to competitors like Sony Corp    NYSE SNE    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN   and Nikon Corp    OTC NINOY    Amid an onslaught of tough competition and reviewers increasingly recommending cheaper alternatives  we believe GoPro s market share faces a very real threat 
Right now  it is prudent to wait for the numbers of GoPro s holiday season and its revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2018 
GoPro currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

to  313 2 million  but it was at the high end of the company s guidance Gross margin rose 180 basis points to 54 2  compared to the year ago quarter due to improved product and better management of inventory It also saw a favorable response to its Spring Summer 2017 collection  especially its clogs and sandals Even men s fashion bible  GQ Magazine  highlighted that  this summer Turnaround Still OngoingIn March 2017  Crocs announced it was closing about 25  of its stores By the end of 2018  it expects to have about 400 stores versus 558 at the end of 2016 This is part of its turnaround plan which also includes focusing on its core molded products and reducing inventory Estimates for 2017 and 2018 RiseAnalysts are liking what they are seeing and getting more bullish on the company Although sales are expected to drop by about 2 2  this year  they expect a rebound of 3  in 2018 The estimates are now on the rise  The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to a loss of  0 03 from a loss of  0 07 over the last 30 days  That s still an improvement from 2016 where the company lost  0 36 By 2018  analysts expect the company to be back in the green as far as earnings  with the Zacks Consensus jumping to  0 30 from  0 22 over the last month  Tractor Supply Company  Nasdaq     is feeling the pinch of a changing retail environment  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is expected

quarter of 2016 due to continued strength in year round products  with the Livestock and Pet categories leading the performance Gross margin fell 10 basis points to 34 9  from 35  last year due to higher freight expense from increased diesel fuel prices and a mix shift to more freight intensive products It s not throwing in the towel against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   as it has a robust online sales

store sales guidance for the full fiscal year to the range of 1 1  1 7  from 2  3  Earnings guidance was also lowered to a range of  3 22  3 27 from  3 44  3 52 As a result  the analysts slashed full year estimates for 2017  12 estimates were lowered in the last 60 days pushing the Zacks Consensus down to  3 26 from  3 41 That s an earnings decline of 0 4  as Tractor Supply made  3 27 last year But analysts were also bearish on 2018 as 11 estimates were also cut for that year  pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to  3 58 from  3 81 Additional content Here s Why GoPro  GPRO  Soared on ThursdayOn Thursday  shares of wearable action camera maker GoPro Inc   Nasdaq    are soaring  up over 14  in morning trading after the company updated its third quarter guidance GoPro said that it now expects revenue and gross margin to be at the high end of its previously expected ranges  with Q3 revenues coming in between  290 million to  310 million and gross margin between 36  to 38   GoPro also forecasts adjusted profitability for the quarter In an interview with CNBC s  Squawk Box   GoPro Chief Operating Officer CJ Porber said that  We set some stretch forecasts at the beginning of the year to be profitable on a non GAAP basis for all of 2017 and post double digit revenue growth  And we expect to do that   The bigger picture even beyond this quarter is that we re seeing really strong consumer demand for our products and were successfully turning the business around   he continued Since October  GPRO has fallen almost 50  due to investor skepticism and broad concerns that the company is losing ground to smartphones and similar devices from competitors like Garmin  Nasdaq     and Sony  NYSE      On top of this  the delay in the launch of its much hyped Karma drone and production issues with its Hero 5 camera negatively affected sales and put unwanted pressure on GoPro s stock However  GoPro did say it is still on track to launch the Hero 6  which is the latest edition of its flagship action cameras  in addition to the company s new Fusion 360 camera  by the upcoming holiday season GoPro In DepthSince its June 2014 IPO  GoPro has undoubtedly struggled  While the stock jumped nearly 31  on its first day of trading  and soon hit an all time high of almost  94 per share just a few months after  GoPro shares have lost roughly 90  of its value since then  as of Wednesday s close  GPRO is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Along with its updated third quarter guidance  GoPro expects earnings growth for current year of over 97  and sales growth of 12 6  in the same time frame  From a growth perspective  the company looks promising  though perhaps it s because GoPro has finally worked out some major production issues GoPro s valuation  however  is tricky  and because it has suffered a long bout of losses  it currently has no price to earnings  Looking at the camera maker s price to sales ratio  GoPro sits at 0 97  which matches the  industry s P S Based on P S  GoPro s value has significantly cheapened  steadily decreasing since it hit its all time high about three years ago  Its guidance announcement today is a step in the right direction  especially after its smaller than expected second quarter loss  to boosting profits  increasing sales  and regaining some of its value back One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more

34880,256395,GRMN,GoPro Likely To Turn Around In Q3  Product Launches On Track,opinion,Late last week  GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   raised its outlook for the current quarter  emphasizing that it s on track to deliver profits  after a long trail of posting quarterly earnings in the red  which was broken only once over the last seven quarters   Investors were already feeling hopeful about GoPro sprospects  after the company reported better than expected results for second quarter 2017 recently Last Thursday  the action camera maker said it expects to be profitable on an adjusted basis in third quarter 2017  which catapulted its shares up nearly 17   Its shares are now back in the double digits  which was not the case for the better part of a year In fact  GoPro s shares have appreciated 20 3  in the past three months  outperforming the  average of 7 4   The analyst community has also been showing favor toward the stock in recent times  with estimates being revised north sharply  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings narrowed from a loss of 16 cents to a loss of 3 cents per share over the past 60 days  led by three upward revisions versus one downward Facts   FiguresPer the latest information  GoPro now anticipates revenues and gross margin for the third quarter to come in at the higher end of its previous guidance  Just last month  the company released the said outlook  concurrent with its second quarter results  which called for third quarter revenues in the range of  290  310 million  with gross margin coming in between 36 38  GoPro had earlier expected to report a loss of 1 11 cents in the third quarter on an adjusted basis The company also affirmed that its plans to launch the Hero 6  the latest edition of its flagship action cameras  and the new Fusion 360 camera by the holiday season were perfectly on track GoPro will likely officially release its third quarter results in early November  But the quarter ends in a few weeks  on Sep 30   so it s heartening to know that GoPro has seen enough this quarter to make such a confident forecast Focusing Through the LensGoPro s cameras might have a massive following among action junkies  but its sales have taken a thorough beating in recent quarters  after a series of missteps On the face of it  things seem to have turned around for the better for GoPro  and the stock is showing signs of life too  Still  the company has lost money in six of the last seven quarters  and investors need to dig a little deeper to glean whether the improvement is sustainable The action camera market is still grappling with serious demand issues and ever increasing competition  GoPro s shares have slumped nearly 70  in the last couple of years  as the company grappled with production delays and bungled up product launches  and lost ground to competitors like Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN    and Nikon Corporation   OTC NINOY   In fact  the company is likely on track for its third consecutive year of margin compression  and this does not bode well for its bottom line  In the recently reported second quarter results  its gross margins contracted a whopping 650 basis points year over year Also  GoPro s inventory levels have been causing serious hiccups over the last couple of years  Excessive inventory is not good for either new releases or retailers  So  management recently decided to revert to its old system of limiting releases  regardless of whether demand exceeds supply  This sets up the company for leaner channels and better inventory levels  and bodes well for GoPro s upcoming product launches as well Also  the fact remains that sales really have rebounded after the release of HERO5 in the fourth quarter of last year  If the market was truly saturated or the company was losing market share amid such intense competition  GoPro would have seen a persistent decline in sales The upcoming holiday season will serve as the true test for the company  and will determine whether GoPro s management will be able to right the ship and return the company to profitability  Notably  this will be the first holiday season in which the Karma Drone will be fully available  after the recall disaster last season In order to restore investor confidence  GoPro will need a series of strong quarters   and this means no operational glitches  sub par guidance  production delays or messed up product roll outs We currently have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  on GoPro You can see  More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of

34901,256416,GRMN,Can GoPro s Fusion 360 And Hero 6 Fend Off Competition ,opinion,GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   has been in the news again  thrust into the spotlight by the launch of the latest camera equipment from technology giant Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL    The move was preceded by similar releases from other established tech companies  thus pitting GoPro s flagship cameras against tough competition  and forcing investors to question whether the Hero cameras can continue to hold their own in a rapidly expanding industry The Evolution of CompetitionIn early days  GoPro had taken the action camera market by storm  but in recent times the company has grappled with stiff competition from lower priced action camera alternatives Earlier this week  Google rolled out a camera called Google clips  which has a 12 megapixel sensor and a 130 degree field of view lens  with 8GB of internal memory  The camera is priced at just  249  which is half the cost of GoPro s new Hero6 camera  Even though Clips is not as advanced and high tech as the Hero line up  it is cheaper and comes from a well known company  GoPro s market could suffer further as Alphabet leverages its brand value and channels to aggressively market this product Another such product is Sony Corporation s   NYSE SNE   latest action camera RX0   which has features similar to GoPro s line  and is waterproof and shockproof as well  The RX0 is due to be released in October Then there is competition from Spectacles   Snap Inc  s   NYSE SNAP   augmented reality and camera glasses   priced at  130  Olympus Tough TG  Tracker   299   Garmin s VIRB Ultra 30   380  and VIRB XE   310   Sony s FDR X300   368   TomTom s Bandit Action Cam   170  and Nikon s KeyMission 170   397  are a few of the other leading products which compete with the Hero cameras  GoPro s latest Hero6 camera is priced at  499 Such lower priced alternatives could corrode GoPro s market share and now  even its new video editing software has a formidable competitor in Alphabet Amid an onslaught of such tough competition and with reviewers increasingly recommending cheaper alternatives  we believe GoPro s market share faces a very real threat  Granted  the company has a huge fan following  but it s increasingly plausible that its brand value might not be enough to fend off competition at this scale  Even its subscription and licensing revenue plans stand at risk  and might not be as successful as previously anticipated GoPro s KittyLate last month  GoPro unveiled the next version of its flagship action camera   the Hero6 The latest Hero6 Black camera enables 4K video recording  with 60 fps  and 1080p recording  with 240fps  It boasts enhanced video stabilization  a built in zoom that can be controlled from the touch screen  and packs 5Ghz for faster video offloads  The Hero6 Black operates on GoPro s new processor   GP1  and is quite a bit faster than its predecessor The company also launched Fusion  its new 5 2k 360 degree spherical camera designed to capture both virtual reality  and standard video and picture  Earlier there was Omni  a video rig with six cameras  but the Fusion looks to be a more user friendly  affordable version for the masses Fusion s USP is something the company calls  over capture    which enables users to capture an entire scene  and then frame just the shots they want afterward in the GoPro app   Priced at  699  the camera s shipping commences in November  No doubt  Fusion will face tough competition from Garmin  VIRB 360 camera of which seems impressive  but costs a steep  800  There are several other spherical cameras already in the market  With GoPro s brand recognition and deep foothold in the action sports world  the company has a real chance to take the lead in this market  provided it gets Fusion right Getting it RightGoPro has struggled in recent years  with messed up product launches  operational stumbles and hitting the right price points  GoPro s shares have slumped nearly 70  in the last couple of years  as the company grappled with production delays and bungled up product roll outs  and lost ground to competitors like Sony  Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN    and Nikon Corporation   OTC NINOY    This culminated in some significant layoffs  restructuring measures and the decision to shutter its nascent entertainment business This year has been kinder to GoPro  as the company cut its losses and started to journey toward profitability  In fact  the company has been increasingly aligning itself with the smartphone era  Consider the content creation war between Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Snap   it shows a secular trend toward individualized  social content creation  GoPro s concept fits perfectly with this trend However  the company s products have failed to achieve mass traction in the absence of an effective sharing aspect   which is a key element  Interestingly  GoPro is now working on making the smartphone the central focus of creating stories  which could help the company break out of its shell To keep a hold of its fragile market share  GoPro has to make sure that it gets its products and pricing exactly right  We remain optimistic on the company s products  and hence have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on GoPro  You can see  5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your

34933,256448,GRMN,Can GoPro s Standout Quarter Change Investors  Perception ,opinion,It seems that investors are feeling better about GoPro  Inc  s   NASDAQ GPRO   prospects  after the company reported better than expected results for second quarter 2017 recently  considering the sharply rising share price of the company The action camera maker s bottom line figure crushed expectations in the recently reported quarter  as GoPro s adjusted loss of 14 cents trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 34 cents by a whopping 58 8   It seems that the company s substantial cost cutting initiatives were highly successful in stemming its earnings decline In addition  the company posted better than expected revenue numbers for the quarter and reduced its operating expenses significantly  GoPro surprised investors with its sales figures  as its quarterly revenues grew an impressive 34 3  from the prior year quarter tally to  296 5 million  The revenue growth was fueled by robust sales of the latest Hero5 cameras  Karma growth and strong accessory revenue This marked the company s third consecutive quarter of revenue growth after four successive quarters of sales declines On the face of it  things seem to have turned around for the better for GoPro  and the stock is showing signs of life too  Still  the company lost money in six of the last seven quarters  and investors need to dig a little deeper to glean whether the improvement is sustainable The action camera market is still grappling with serious demand issues and ever increasing competition  Players like Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN    Nikon Corporation   OTC NINOY    and several others have entered the market  which is turn is evidently contracting GoPro s margins In fact  the company is likely on track for its third consecutive year of margin compression  and this does not bode well for its bottom line  In the second quarter results  its gross margins contracted a whopping 650 basis points year over year GoPro s negative cash generation has also been worrisome of late  Net cash used in operating activities rose 89 7  year over year in the last reported quarter Also  GoPro s inventory levels have been causing serious hiccups over the last couple of years  Excessive inventory is not good for either new releases or retailers  So  management decided to revert to its old system of limiting releases  regardless of whether demand exceeds supply  This sets the company up for leaner channels and better inventory levels In the second quarter  we witnessed that GoPro s focus on improving inventory and channel management resulted in a 39  reduction in inventory sequentially  and forward weeks of supply in the channel are down 25   This bodes well for GoPro s upcoming product launches Also  the fact remains that sales really have rebounded after the release of HERO5 in the fourth quarter of last year  If the market was truly saturated or the company was losing market share amid such intense competition  GoPro would have seen a persistent decline in sales The upcoming holiday season will serve as the true test for the company  and will determine whether GoPro s management will be able to right the ship and return the company to profitability  It will be launching both the Hero6 camera and Fusion   a 5 2k spherical camera soon  Also  this will be the first holiday season in which the Karma Drone will be fully available  after the recall disaster last season In order to restore investor confidence  GoPro will need a series of strong quarters   and that means no operational glitches  sub par guidance  production delays or messed up product launches Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking SecretSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars But here s something even more remarkable  You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar  And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month ,2017-08-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-gopros-standout-quarter-change-investors-perception-200207286,200207286

34946,256461,GRMN,Will Apple  AAPL  Unveil IPhone 8 At Its September Event ,opinion,It seems that Apple Inc   NASDAQ AAPL   is on track to unveil its latest iPhone right before the holiday season Per media reports  Apple will host its product announcement event on Sep 12  Apple usually holds a big event in September to reveal its latest offerings  which start retailing a week after the event Reportedly  at this year s event  Apple will be announcing three new phones  iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are updates to its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions unveiled last year  In addition to these  a mega edition  widely labeled as iPhone 8  will likely be introduced to the world  per reports Apple Inc  Price   Apple s Mega iPhone For some time now  Apple s mega edition phone has caught the fancy of one and all  Apple is likely to make a big innovation leap with iPhone 8  The phone is rumored to have features like a glass body  a dual curved edge to edge OLED  organic light emitting diode  display with wireless charging  USB C  and higher storage options  The camera is likely to be far better than its predecessors Reportedly  iPhone 8 will be the first of its kind to support OLED display  Per reports  the company has ordered nearly 100 million OLED screens from Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   OLED display is being increasingly adopted as it comes with improved brightness  contrast and efficiency compared with LCD or Plasma displays  Television sets have long been equipped with OLED displays  Smartphones are fast catching up now The revolutionary iPhone released first in June 2007 had changed the world forever  The iPhone was the first phone to have a touch screen and was a  breakthrough internet device    The original iPhone was powered by an ARM based 1176JZ  F  S processor and had a PowerVR MBX Lite 3D graphics chip  It had a 1400mAH battery Upon release  the phone received a terrific response  Following that  the success of iPhone over the last decade is well chronicled  Apple has sold over a billion iPhones across the globe  However  over the past few quarters  Apple s iPhone sales have been marred by increasing competition from cheaper handsets like Oppo and Vivo Since the first iPhone release  Apple shares have skyrocketed compared to the  to which it belongs  Over the last decade  Apple stock has returned 826  while the industry saw a rally of 382 3  Delay Rumors Losing FizzLast month  it was widely reported that there could be a  in the launch as the company faces technological issues involving fingerprint and 3D sensors  Consequently  analysts had lowered their iPhone shipment expectations for the quarter ending September Expectations regarding the upcoming iPhone 8 are humongous  as it will mark the tenth anniversary of the first iPhone  Analysts have already dubbed sales of iPhone 8 as a  super cycle   Hence  any delay can severely impact Apple s quarterly results The latest developments assuage concerns regarding a delay in the launch to a great extent  Per a Barron s report   the consensus sales estimate for Apple s fiscal year ending September 2018 has climbed to 247 million units from 239 million since the end of March  That would mark 14  growth from the current fiscal year  Also  Apple had given an upbeat guidance along with its  results for the quarter ending in September  thereby widely alleviating fears of a delay in the launch of the next edition iPhone  For fourth quarter fiscal 2017  the company forecasts revenues in a range of  49  52 billion compared with  46 9 billion reported in the year ago quarter when it released iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Plus  if we go by Broadcom s   NASDAQ AVGO   recent results  reported a couple of days back  the concerns are further mitigated  Broadcom supplies chips for iPhones  The company recently reported better than expected  results  The company s Wireless Communications  28 7  of total revenue  revenues were up 27 3  year over year and 11 6  quarter over quarter to  1 28 billion Broadcom s top line benefited from the rise in production volumes of the company s large North American smartphone customer s  Apple  next gen platform  iPhone   Management noted that increase in total dollar content in the upcoming platform drove revenues Further  management noted that Wireless Communications revenues are expected to grow strongly in the fourth quarter  both on a sequential and year over year basis  The upside is likely to be driven by higher dollar content in the company s large North American smartphone customer s next gen platform  This implies that iPhone 8 will be up for sale in September Will Price Prove to be a Deterrent to Sales Nonetheless  it is the price point that might prove to be an impediment as observed by various analysts  Reportedly  iPhone 8 could be priced more than  1 000 dollars  Many analysts argue that the existing iPhone 7 and 7 Plus editions with 256GB storage carry price tags of  849 and  969  respectively  So a price tag north of  1000 should not be considered unreasonable for a fully redesigned OLED iPhone 8 iPhone  4GB model  was priced at  499 way back in 2007  which was unheard of back then  Yet  Apple scored a home run with iPhone  The power of Apple s fan base cannot be undermined Other Things to Watch Out For at the EventApart from the new iPhones  per media reports  Apple could launch a new Apple watch  Then there could a new Apple 4K TV  Apple is likely to speak at length about iOS 11 and new MacOS and watchOS At the WWDC earlier this year  Apple gave a sneak peek into its AR efforts

34967,256482,GRMN,Why GoPro  GPRO  Stock Is Soaring Today,opinion,"On Thursday  shares of wearable action camera maker GoPro Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   are soaring  up over 14  in morning trading after the company updated its third quarter guidance 
GoPro said that it now expects revenue and gross margin to be at the high end of its previously expected ranges  with Q3 revenues coming in between  290 million to  310 million and gross margin between 36  to 38   GoPro also forecasts adjusted profitability for the quarter 
In an interview with CNBC s  Squawk Box   GoPro Chief Operating Officer CJ Porber said that  We set some stretch forecasts at the beginning of the year to be profitable on a non GAAP basis for all of 2017 and post double digit revenue growth  And we expect to do that  
 The bigger picture even beyond this quarter is that we re seeing really strong consumer demand for our products and were successfully turning the business around   he continued 
Since October  GPRO has fallen almost 50  due to investor skepticism and broad concerns that the company is losing ground to smartphones and similar devices from competitors like Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN   and Sony   NYSE SNE    On top of this  the delay in the launch of its much hyped Karma drone and production issues with its Hero 5 camera negatively affected sales and put unwanted pressure on GoPro s stock 
However  GoPro did say it is still on track to launch the Hero 6  which is the latest edition of its flagship action cameras  in addition to the company s new Fusion 360 camera  by the upcoming holiday season 
GoPro In Depth
Since its June 2014 IPO  GoPro has undoubtedly struggled  While the stock jumped nearly 31  on its first day of trading  and soon hit an all time high of almost  94 per share just a few months after  GoPro shares have lost roughly 90  of its value since then  as of Wednesday s close  
GPRO is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Along with its updated third quarter guidance  GoPro expects earnings growth for current year of over 97  and sales growth of 12 6  in the same time frame  From a growth perspective  the company looks promising  though perhaps it s because GoPro has finally worked out some major production issues 
GoPro s valuation  however  is tricky  and because it has suffered a long bout of losses  it currently has no price to earnings  Looking at the camera maker s price to sales ratio  GoPro sits at 0 97  which matches the  industry s P S 
Based on P S  GoPro s value has significantly cheapened  steadily decreasing since it hit its all time high about three years ago  Its guidance announcement today is a step in the right direction  especially after its smaller than expected second quarter loss  to boosting profits  increasing sales  and regaining some of its value back 
One Simple Trading Idea
Since 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars

35002,256517,GRMN,Tech Earnings Roundup  AAPL  FB  AMD  GRMN  FIT  More,opinion,"A host of technology companies reported last week including Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD    Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN    Fitbit   NASDAQ FITB   and more  In fact  around 71 0  of tech companies have reported thus far according to the latest earnings trends report  of which 79 5  beat on revenue and 77 3  beat on earnings  Moreover  while sector revenues grew just 6 4   earnings growth was much stronger at 16 5   
So let s jump straight to the top earnings for the week 
Earnings
Apple  Apple s second quarter revenue and earnings were both   The expected negatives that didn t take anyone by surprise were the decline in iPhone units and ASP  decline in iPad units  and weakness in China 
Although not a good quarter by any means  there were some bright spots  continued growth in Other revenue  up 31    Services  up 18    App Store  up 40   and Macs  up 14   helped by the new MacBook Pro   India holds promise  continuing to grow at a double digit rate off a relatively small base 
Moreover  enterprise penetration continues to increase  important new clients in the last quarter include Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  and Capital One   helped by partnerships with companies like Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO    IBM  NYSE IBM   and more recently  SAP and Deloitte  Overall  Apple increasingly looks like a solid value buy 
Facebook  Facebook also  for both revenue and earnings  Monthly active users  MAUs  were up 17  year over year to 1 94 billion  Daily Active Users  DAUs  were up 18  to 1 28 billion  The price per ad also continues to increase  proof of the platform s popularity 
As a result  total advertising revenues were up 51  and mobile advertising revenues up 58   Although  of course  with markets saturating  it may have to increase the ad load to keep on the growth path and this will affect user experience 
Offsetting that negative  however  is the prospect of increased sharing of original and licensed content that could make it a video hub  Then there s the increasing number of platforms it has with billion plus users  further increasing revenue prospects  So this one remains a growth stock for the foreseeable future 
AMD  Advanced Micro Devices  on the bottom line while beating on the top line  The company s guidance disappointed however because investors generally expected its exciting new products  Ryzen in PCs and Naples in servers  to generate more in revenue and contribute more to profits this year 
To make matters worse  management said that AMD probably wouldn t gain significant share from Intel   NASDAQ INTC   in 2017  This could just be caution on management s part and it s worth nothing that even small share gains could be meaningful for the struggling chipmaker  The uncertainties make AMD a risky bet 
Garmin  In the seasonally softer first quarter  Garmin s results  on both top and bottom lines  Garmin has a very well balanced business across the Auto Mobile  Fitness  Aviation  Outdoor and Marine segments  The last quarter is typically a stronger quarter for the Marine business  but Aviation  longer sales cycle  and Outdoor  driven by wearables  also did well 
This is a very well managed company showing relatively consistent margin expansion despite a segment  Auto Mobile  in secular decline  It also has a healthy balance sheet  no debt  and manages to return cash to investors 
Fitbit  Fitbit  on the bottom line while exceeding on the top line  The company is seeing increased competition from Garmin and Jawbone  which is impacting results  The company has reorganized itself under the consumer and enterprise segments 
The company is doing relatively well in the EMEA and Asia where revenues grew 15 4  and 61 5   respectively  But this was offset by weakness in the Americas  particularly the U S

35005,256520,GRMN,GoPro  GPRO  Stock Gains 6   Should You Buy ,opinion,"Shares of GoPro   NASDAQ GPRO   have climbed on Monday morning  marking one of the stock s best days since the company announced in mid March that it expected to meet the upper end of its previously projected first quarter 2017 outlook  But should you really consider buying the struggling action camera maker s stock now 
Recent Performance
GoPro was up 6 34  through morning trading on Monday  and the company is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
GoPro did indeed go on to beat both Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenue and earnings last quarter  The company posted  219 million in first quarter revenue  and a loss of  0 53 per share was enough to surpass expectations 
Today s movement comes without much real news surrounding the mounted camera maker  so instead  here is a quick look at what might be going on with GoPro 
Good News 
GoPro once dominated the niche action camera market that it helped create  but smartphone camera improvement and more competition has seen its sales fall off  Yet  despite the competition  there is room for growth  Today  GoPro scores a B for Growth in our Style Scores system 
 research firm Global Market Insights  the global action camera market could grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 22  between 2016 and 2023   calls for the action camera market to balloon into a  5 81 billion a year industry by 2021 
The company also has potential to expand its 360 degree video technology and move more heavily into the quickly growing world of virtual reality  GoPro announced its 360 degree  six GoPro cameras fused into one   
Furthermore  on March 15  GoPro announced its plans to cut 270 jobs to reduce expenses in order to try to become profitable in 2017 
Bad News 
GoPro has seen its stock price fall off a cliff from its all time high of  86 97 in September 2014  For the last year  its shares have shown little sign of life as they have floated around the  8  10 per share range 
Despite its potential growth markets  GoPro  with a current market cap of  1 31 billion  might lack the resources to fully compete as companies such as Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Samsung  KS 005930  invest further into VR technology 
What s more  in the first quarter  GoPro reported that shipments fell to 730 000 units the expectation was it would only fall to roughly 805 000  Action cameras from Drift  Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN    and iON are now all players in the market 
Bottom Line
GoPro s once meteoric rise seems light years away at this point  But the company s small first quarter beats  along with its cost cutting intiatives  showed GoPro still had a bit of life left  Still  at this point it seems like investors will have to wait and see if 360 degree video and VR can save the struggling action camera giant

35035,256550,GRMN,The Pebble Crumbles  Are Smartwatches Just A Fad  ,opinion,"Rumor has it that Fitbit   NYSE FIT   is buying smart watch maker Pebble for a paltry sum that could be as low as  34 40 million  If media reports are to be believed  that barely covers its debts  It s a pity that the company passed up opportunities to sell out at  740 million  Citizen s offer last year   or even  70 million  Intel s   NASDAQ INTC   offer earlier this year provided it held off launching the Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2  
In fact chief executive Eric Migicovsky s refusal to go with Intel proved costly because it led to a fallout with key personnel including product head Itai Vonshak  HR head and legal counsel Jeff Hyman  and VP of software engineering Kean Wong  Vonshak and Wong have since moved to Intel 
But Fitbit is getting a good deal for what it s worth  as the most popular wrist worn wearable maker has seen better times  Despite being the market leader  the company s shares have struggled and remain at a fraction of the IPO price  
Why Fitbit Wants Pebble
The attraction for Fitbit seems to be the Pebble OS  which doesn t pick sides between iOS and Android  and consequently has one of the largest app ecosystems that any wearable can boast of  Fitbit does attempt to connect users through its own platform  which can be important as a retention tool when products are upgraded or for corporate customers  But incorporating Pebble technology will allow users to do much more 
IDC estimates that the total number of basic wearables  that don t run third party apps  will touch 80 7 million units this year  that includes wristbands  clothing  watches and other things that don t run third party apps   This is much bigger than the smart wearables market that isn t expected to cross 21 5 million units by year end 
But between 2016 and 2020  the research firm believes that basic wearables will grow at a CAGR of 20 2  while smart wearables will grow at a CAGR of 30 6   Just as well because smartwatch demand has dropped off significantly over the past year 
The growth prospects have prompted all the other top wearables makers  refer the table below  to launch smarter devices  Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   only sells smartwatches   So as things stand today  Apple and Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN   are tops in the smartwatch category  while Samsung  KS 005930  is a strong number 3  Xiaomi launched its own smartwatch earlier this year but doesn t figure in the top five yet 
On the other hand  Pebble has a small  3   share in the smartwatch category that is declining due to share loss to its stronger rivals 
So by buying out the struggling smartwatch maker  Fitbit gets to add important technology to its brand  and thereby  storm into the smartwatch segment 
Wearables Market Share  IDC

Is This a Smart Move 
On the face of it  this seems like a great idea especially when you consider that IDC appears highly optimistic about future growth  IDC has attributed the current weakness  smartwatch demand has halved over the past year  to the lack of new products major upgrades  so its optimistic forecast for the next few years must mean that there will be much more to these gadgets going forward 
On that note  it s worth remembering that Fitbit is the only one of the top 5 wearable companies that is a pureplay  in a market where even a company like Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   couldn t really make headway  This is a reason for caution because having other successful products can help market players absorb some of the losses and investments that a new or emerging product category with uncertain demand would entail   
Second  both Apple and Garmin make differentiated high margin products and are understood as premium brands  This isn t the case for Fitbit  which is generally perceived as more of a value brand  as is Pebble   In consumer gadgetry  the brand is a very important factor  Companies spend a lot of money establishing a brand  so it s extremely difficult for a newcomer value brand to snatch some of that mindshare 
Fitbit has an uphill task changing consumer perceptions about its brand and this will involve a ton of marketing cost as well  Failing this  Fitbit will have a hard time selling a premium device  Or it may choose to undercut on pricing to steal share from the market leaders  This is never a good idea for a small company with limited resources and narrow margins   
Fitbit generates very low margins compared to leading smartwatch makers  roughly a fifth  and those margins were hit hard in the last quarter  most likely because of the triple digit increase in R D headcount  It s commendable that the company is preparing to enter the smartwatch category but execution will be key FITBIT INC Price    
In the meantime  since this segment isn t so hot for investors  you might want to take a look at  
Conclusion
From the numbers currently available  it does look like smartwatches are something of a fad  Even Apple has seen declining sales  mostly attributed to the lack of notable upgrades 
While reaching for the phone can be cumbersome in certain cases and there s a certain joy in being hands free  the only real USP for smartwatches as they exist today   people by and large don t want to carry too many devices and they can t give up their phone  So unless they really need it to connect with the gadgets in the home or track their health fitness  or serve some other specific purpose  people will tend to buy them in a craze and then leave them in the drawer 
General purpose bands need to be really cheap  or come with a voice controlled personal assistant that can keep you updated on everything you care about  Because even if they come with a ton of apps  the watch face is too small to enjoy looking at it too much  Smartwatches also need to have classic styles  to suit different personality types and occasions  so people will want to wear them all the time

The MBA Mortgage Application Index declined 2 0  last week  following the previous week s 3 7  drop  The decrease came as a 1 0  decline for the Refinance Index was met with a 2 8  fall for the Purchase Index  The average 30 year mortgage rate rose 4 basis points  bps  to 4 36  
In afternoon action  the Federal Reserve released the minutes to the January February Federal Open Market Committee s monetary policy meeting where it opted to keep interest rates unchanged  The report showed that  many  Fed officials indicated support for raising rates  fairly soon  if the economy stayed the course or strengthened  However  policymakers voiced uncertainty over the fiscal policy plans of the Trump administration and Republican controlled Congress  as well as headwinds the rising dollar may present  Following the meeting on Feb 1  the Committee s statement appeared to foster a dovish takeaway by the markets  However  last week s Congressional testimony by FOMC Chief Janet Yellen suggested a March rate hike was still on the table 
An elevated earnings and economic expectations could lead to a pullback or more sideways action but we believe the bull market in U S  stocks will continue  If economic data continues to surprise on the upside  a March rate hike is likely to be on the table  while there is an additional risk that the Fed may be forced to speed up the tightening process should inflation accelerate from here

Europe mixed after recent run  Asia mostly higher
European equities finished mixed  with the markets assessing the recent rally and the U S  markets pausing from all time highs that have been driven by upbeat economic data and optimism of reflationary policies from U S  President Donald Trump  The markets digested some mixed earnings reports in the region  along with festering European political uncertainty as a key French Presidential election looms 
Europe s economy is performing the best in many years on many key measures and stock markets are currently behaving as if there is nothing to worry about  but that may be about to change now that we are within 45 trading days of the French Presidential election 
The euro ticked higher and the  British pound dipped versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mostly lower  In economic news  German business confidence unexpectedly improved for this month  and preliminary UK 4Q GDP growth topped expectations  while Eurozone core consumer price inflation rose in line with forecasts 
Asian markets finished mostly higher as the U S  markets returned to action yesterday from a long holiday weekend  continuing a rally to all time highs  despite political uncertainty in Europe and the U S  Stocks in China and Hong Kong advanced  with financials leading the way despite a report that showed a slowdown in property price gains  Australian equities increased modestly  overcoming early losses that stemmed from hawkish commentary from Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Lowe  and showing some resiliency in the face of weakness in technology and financial issues  Markets in South Korea and India rose  with the latter extending a winning streak to five sessions  However  Japanese securities finished flat  as the yen rebounded from recent weakness

35090,256605,GRMN,Is Fitbit Stock A Buy ,opinion,"Fitbit Inc  NYSE FIT   the wearable technology devices company  has seen its stock face immense pressure since its IPO in June 2015 
Whilst their health tracking devices have gained popularity over the past few years  rising competition from the likes of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Nike  NYSE NKE  and Garmin Ltd  NASDAQ GRMN   threaten to diminish Fitbit s market share 
After falling about 59  below its IPO price and reaching a bottom of  11 65  the stock has come to attractive valuations  In fact  some long  term bulls have already picked up the stock  and it is now trading at  14 78 
Regardless of the recent rally  the stock is still trading at a P E ratio of 29 1  which is an attractive level for a young technology company with future growth potential 

Whilst revenue growth has slowed down since 2015 due to rising competition  it is undoubtedly still growing at a fast pace  In fact  the tech stock currently has a Price to Sales ratio of just 1 7  compared to a 1 9 ratio for the S P 500  hence Fitbit has an attractive valuation from this perspective as well 
And as a pioneer of its industry  the company has tremendous brand recognition  which will allow it to retain its market share over competitors 
Though some analyst have expressed concerns over the fact that the firm is unable to translate high revenue growth into higher net income  due to soaring operating costs  The chart below demonstrates the trend in operating costs and net income since 2012 

However  a deeper look into Fitbit s income statement reveals that a notable proportion of the rise in operating costs has been a result of soaring Research and Development costs  which has grown from  16 million to  150 million between 2012 and 2015  almost a 10x fold surge 
It is definitely normal for a growth company to have rising R D expenses  as constant innovation is required to fuel future growth  So whilst net income may not be growing robustly at the moment  new innovations should help drive profit margins higher and maintain competitiveness over the long  term 
In fact  its latest innovations  Fitbit Blaze and Alta  have been greatly successful  and contributed 54  to Fitbit s Q2 2016 revenue  The company also has notable customer loyalty  as 40  of those sales were by users of older Fitbit models 
Technical Indicators
Technical indicators are presently also favourable for the stock  The monthly Williams  R for the stock is currently  92 25  A reading between  80 and  100 usually indicates strongly oversold conditions  hence Fitbit stock has been heavily oversold from this perspective  encouraging traders to pick up the stock recently 
The chart below shows the recent crossover of the 20 day and 30 day moving averages over the 50 day moving average  signalling that the bullish momentum will to continue 
Moving Averages Crossover

In fact  the stock s Average Directional Index is currently 47 89  A reading above 25 reflects strong momentum in the stock s movement 
Therefore  both fundamental and technical indicators reveal that Fitbit stock is a good buy at this price level  The tech stock has great growth potential through constant innovation  which will enable the firm to compete against rising competition and maintain market share over the long term ",2016-08-18,Sankalp Soni,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-fitbit-stock-a-buy-200148780,200148780

At the time of this writing  Garmin shares had appreciated 11 21  

Revenues
Garmin s second quarter revenues of  811 6 million were up 30 1  sequentially and 4 9  year over year  Revenues were helped by higher demand across marine  outdoor  fitness and aviation segments

Seasonality results in considerable variations in Garmin s quarterly revenues 
The Auto Mobile segment was up 25 6  sequentially and down 17 8  on a year over year basis  The year over year decrease was due to the shrinking of the personal navigation device  PND  market and headwinds caused by additional revenue deferrals 
The Fitness segment increased a massive 49 5  sequentially and 34 2  year over year  The growth has mainly been sourced from sale of new products   vivoactive HR and vivofit 3 activity trackers  Forerunner 735XT multi sport capable running watch and vivosmart HR   smart activity tracker with GPS

Outdoor revenues were up 37 5  sequentially and 20 6  year over year  Introduction of new products like Approach X40 and Oregon 700 series of handheld GPS units and contribution of recently acquired DeLorme products drove this growth 
The Marine segment increased 34 7  sequentially and 7 6  year over year  It was driven by strength in chartplotter  fish finder and entertainment product lines  The inland fishing category improved on market share contributing significantly to this growth 
Revenues by Geography
While America generated 50   up 28  sequentially but down 4 2  year over year  of total revenue  EMEA and APAC contributed 38   up 37 2  sequentially and 12 8  year over year  and 12   up 18 1  sequentially and 15 2  year over year   respectively 
Operating Results
Gross margin was 57 0   up 258 basis points  bps  sequentially and 286 bps year over year  Stronger demand drove volumes across all segments  pulling up segment gross margins  The relatively low margin Fitness segment did particularly well  resulting in a slightly negative mix 
Operating expenses of  262 3 million were up 3 8  from  252 6 million in the year ago quarter  Operating margin of 24 7  was up 319 bps year over year due to the higher gross margin and expense control 
GAAP net income was  161 1 million or 85 cents per share compared with  137 6 million or 72 cents per share a year ago 
On a pro forma basis excluding foreign currency effects net of tax  Garmin reported net income of  165 6 million compared with the year ago tally of  138 1 million 
There were no one time adjustments in the quarter 
Balance Sheet
Inventories were down 1 9  sequentially to  508 1 million  Cash and marketable securities were approximately  2 4billion compared with  1 06 billion in the previous quarter

Guidance
The company has updated its 2016 guidance issued in February  Management expects revenues of  2 9 billion  gross margin of around 55   operating margin of roughly 19   pro forma tax rate of nearly 19 5  and pro forma earnings of  2 50 per share  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings stands at  2 83 billion and  2 28 per share  respectively GARMIN LTD Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Conclusion
Garmin reported robust second quarter results with both earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The results were driven by solid performance in each and every segment
Product line expansion was top priority for Garmin  In the quarter  the company realized positive contribution from the DeLorme acquisition  the provider of the inReach series of affordable two way satellite communication devices for consumers  DeLorme helped in adding device and recurring service revenue to the outdoor segment 
Garmin also started shipments of vivoactive HR and vivofit 3 activity trackers  Forerunner 735XT multi sport capable running watch and vivosmart HR   smart activity tracker with GPS 
Management focuses on continued innovation to deliver compelling products across served markets 
However  the macroeconomic challenges remain part of the operating environment

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 13 cents on  588 96 million in revenue  slightly higher than the Wall Street consensus
The Fitbit Blaze and Alta have been successful in their short time on the market and will be available in China
Fitbit must prove that its products have a sustainable use case and can continue to move off the shelves in order to revitalize the beaten down stock
Fitbit s scheduled second quarter results next week is among a handful of reports coming from companies that have recently gone public  Many of these recently listed companies have struggled in their short histories on the market  In the past 12 months Box  NYSE BOX  is down 30   PartyCity 24   and Etsy  NASDAQ ETSY  46   But Fitbit takes the cake  with shares down over 70  from a year earlier  Fitbit  like many of its peers  has suffered from decelerating revenue growth as consumers have more options in the wearables market  Early signs look as though these themes are persisting and will adversely impact Q2 earnings 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 13 cents  down 37  from the same period last year  That estimate has declined 59  since Fitbit s last report in May  Revenue is anticipated to increase 46  to  588 96 million  continuing the trend down in sales growth 

The biggest problem for Fitbit has been proving that its products have a sustainable use case and can continue to move off the shelves  Last quarter saw the launch of the Fitbit Blaze and Alta which have so far performed remarkably well  Approximately 40  of user activations from those products were by users with prior devices and 20  were those who rejoined the Fitbit community after 3 months of being inactive  This is a remarkable achievement for a company that in the past suffered from limited upgrade demand 
In May of this year  Fitbit announced the availability of its two newest and most popular products  Fitbit Blaze and Alta  in China  Fitbit has also partnered with Alibaba  NYSE BABA  to organize a health and wellness initiatives called  China is Getting Fit   Its products will also be available on Alibaba s third party platform  a move that is certain to drive sales  China has a wealth of resources and consumers that Fitbit should be able to leverage for its success 
As more competition emerges in the wearable space  Fitbit will need to ramp up its efforts to stay relevant  At the moment the industry has a handful of players including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Garmin  NASDAQ GRMN   Samsung  KS 005930  and Under Armour  NYSE UA   Despite how beaten down Fitbit has been in the past year  it will only take one strong quarter to right the ship

Wednesday  August 3

Friday  August 4

Fitbit  NYSE FIT 
Information Technology   Electronic Equipment   Reports August 2  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings of 14 cents per share on  589 million in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier  earnings are expected to fall by 36  with revenue increasing 47   Revisions activity since Fitbit s last report show that EPS estimates have fallen 61  in the last 3 months  while sales estimates are up 9  

What to watch  It s been a rough year for Fitbit shareholders  with the stock down 53  year to date and almost 71  in the past 12 months  Troubles have only been exacerbated as more competition emerges in the wearables space  At the top sits names like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Garmin  NASDAQ GRMN   and Samsung  KS 005930   all offering similar products at a range of different price points 
Fitbit s two newest products  the Alta and Blaze  have done a good job of differentiating themselves from the competition  The two products have also been successful in attracting new customers and upselling old ones 
Last quarter saw the launch of the Fitbit Blaze and Alta which have so far performed remarkably well  Approximately 40  of user activations from those products were by users with prior devices and 20  were those who rejoined the Fitbit community after 3 months of being inactive  This is a remarkable achievement for a company that in the past suffered from limited upgrade demand

Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA 
Information Technology   Software   Reports August 2  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 1 cent on  662 million in revenue  Per share and revenue estimates have been cut considerably since EA s last report in May  with profits slashed by 94  and sales by 11   Compared to a year earlier  this represents a 94  decline on the bottom line and a 4  decline on the top 

What to watch  Electronic Arts begins the week with second quarter earnings today after the market closes  The game publisher took a major leap in the past year  largely driven by the success of its sports titles like Madden and Fifa  as well as Star Wars  Battlefront  Star Wars synergies aren t expected to have a huge impact on the quarter to be reported as the game nears its 1 year anniversary 
Without any blockbuster titles this quarter  EAs prospects appear relatively subdued on a year over year basis 
The second half outlook for EA still looks promising regardless of muted Q2 expectations  The company Is showing strong growth in digital sales and continued traction in the mobile market  Downloadable content is replacing physical games as its fastest growing source of income  With the next iterations of Fifa and Madden scheduled to hit the market within the next month  don t be surprised if tomorrow s results are an aberration from the rest of the year 
Tesla Motors  NASDAQ TSLA 
Consumer Discretionary   Automobiles   Reports August 3  after the close 
The Estimize community has set the bar very low for Tesla this quarter  Analysts are calling for a 53 cent loss per share right in line with earnings from a year earlier  That estimate has declined by 442  since Tesla s last report in May  Revenue is anticipated to increase by 35  to  1 55 billion  marking a considerable slowdown from the previous two quarters 

What to watch  Tesla has been in the news a lot recently and not for good reasons  Just last month the company agreed to buy SolarCity for  2 6 billion  which will unite two Elon Musk founded companies  Tesla is also dealing with its first fatality due to the autonomous feature and attempting to meet sales expectations 
The model 3 has been very successful to date  with demand outpacing supply  This compact and inexpensive version of the model S has accumulated an astronomical amount of pre orders  500 000 to be exact  Tesla even raised an additional  1 7 billion in an offering to meet production  However  when Elon Musk decided that resources were better off in acquiring the struggling SolarCity  the deal sent Tesla shares tumbling and now the stock is down 15  in the past 12 months
Its other vehicle  the Model X  is receiving mixed reactions nearly a year after Tesla delivered the first units  Customers have complained about glitches and inefficiencies that weren t apparent in the flagship Model S vehicle  At the current pace  Tesla is unlikely to meet its 80 000 deliver goal by the end of the year 
LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD 
Information Technology   Internet Software   Services  Reports August 4  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  0 81 on  902 million in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  4 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this reflects a 47  increase in earnings and 26  in sales  Earnings estimates have increased 8  since the last quarterly report  with sales estimates unchanged 

What to watch  This is likely one of the last quarterly reports we will get from LinkedIn as a publically traded company after Microsoft s bid last month to acquire the social media brand for  26 2 billion  Linkedin s official vote regarding the Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  acquisition will take place on August 19  meaning this report should not greatly impact the stock no matter which way it turns out  In preparation  MSFT just sold  20B in debt today to fund the deal 
For the last four quarters  LinkedIn has blown expectations out of the water  with EPS greatly surpassing estimates in each period  and revenues doing so for all but one of those quarters  Bottom line growth has continually hovered around the 50  mark  while sales growth has been a bit lower in the 30s 
LinkedIn has often come under fire for stagnant user growth  especially when compared to other social media companies such as Facebook  However  in the first quarter of 2016  the company saw the largest growth in cumulative members since 2014  up 19  to 433 million 
Both core business  Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions have remained LNKD s strongest segments  growing 41  and 29   respectively  last quarter  The company is also making Sales Solutions and Learnings   Development focal points as well 
Priceline  NASDAQ PCLN 
Consumer Discretionary   Internet   Catalog Retail   Reports August 4  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  12 79  10 cents higher than Wall Street s consensus  Revenue expectations are slightly higher than the sell side  with the Estimize community expecting  2 6 billion  as compared to  2 58 billion  Earnings expectations have trended downward by 17  since last quarter  while revenue estimates are down 3   This puts YoY growth expectations at 4  for EPS and 14  for sales 

What to watch  Lately the online travel industry has been one of the hottest industries  much to the delight of Priceline and its peers  In the past 3 months  shares of Priceline have increased nearly 8  on indications of a reversing trend in the travel industry  However  Expedia s report last week featured better than expected earnings  but sales that fell short of estimates  perhaps foreshadowing a trend that could be realized for other online travel companies this quarter 
Priceline s fourth quarter was highlighted by significant gains on both the top and bottom line  This featured a 21  increase in gross travel bookings  23  increase in international operations  and continued growth in Booking com  Priceline has guided for double digit growth in almost all key metrics for the second quarter  Including a 15   22  increase in room nights booked  total gross travel booking growth of 11   18  and gross profits increasing 9   16  
This biggest concern this quarter is around fallout from Brexit  Priceline currently generates more than two thirds of its revenue from Europe  far more than Expedia or TripAdvisor  The company is still expected to report 15  revenue growth this quarter  but estimates have come down considerably due to negative currency exchange fluctuations ",2016-08-03,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-8-2---fit,-ea,-tsla,-lnkd,-pcln-200145721",200145721
35167,256682,GRMN,Flex Your Portfolio s Muscles,opinion,"Many New Year s resolutions start off with good intentions  but seem to fall by the wayside faster than you can hit the snooze button 
But this year  with the help of new apps and devices that track your every move  many people may find themselves more motivated to stick to their workouts 
Wearable technology is a rapidly growing trend  particularly in the exercise fitness space  Thus  while building muscle and or endurance  you could also consider beefing up your portfolio by adding some wearable tech innovators 
Step Aside  Fitbit
At this point  the wearable fitness space has extended well beyond the usual suspects of Fitbit Inc  N FIT  and Apple  O AAPL  Inc 
Today s apps offer a slew of features that focus on sleep  fitness  activity  and nutrition 
They can tell you how many calories you burned  how to build endurance  and how to run  swim  and box more naturally  Even more impressive  they can track how forcefully you re hitting the ground  how long your stride is  and how many steps you take per minute 
Here s a brief overview of some of the latest wearables   along with the companies making them  the shares of which you could consider owning 
The UA Healthbox Band is made by Under Armour Inc  N UA   a Baltimore based company known for its sports clothing and accessories  The Healthbox Band is the world s first connected fitness system created specifically to measure  monitor  and manage the factors that determine how you feel   and why 
The Garmin Vivosmart HR is made by Garmin Ltd  O GRMN   a company widely known for automotive  aviation  marine  outdoor  and sports products  Given that Garmin started to incorporate optical technology into its running watches  a heart rate monitoring fitness tracker was inevitable 
Columbia Sportswear Company  O COLM  joined the likes of Nike  N NKE  in the move to wearable technology with its Singletrak watch  It s hard to get lost as long as you re wearing this watch   it detects even the slightest shift in compass coordinates on the journey out and then provides the user with a clear direction for the journey back 
Though it s hardly a pure play  Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  has developed the Silver Star Gear S2  a smartwatch with a whole host of apps including S Health  a comprehensive fitness and health platform 
The Swatch Group  VX UHR   known for its stylish watches  offers the Touch Zero  This device is great for sports like volleyball as it can measure the power and accuracy of your hits 
The TomTom Spark Cardio   Music  made by TomTom  AS TOM2   eliminates the need for your mp3 player at the gym  as it can store up to 500 songs while still tracking your swimming  cycling  and running activities 
The REFLEX Watch  by Reflex  owned by the Ritmo Group  a subsidiary of Bomi Italia SpA  MI BOMI   is a silicone LED slap watch that was launched as an icy fresh interpretation of the modern digital watch  Available in a full palette of colors with a futuristic face  its minimalist design caters to an audience less inclined toward overly complex wrist electronics 
Data Overload
Like most successful new technologies  the number of entrants in the space tends to grow exponentially in the early adoption phase  Thus  there are a number of privately held players in the wearable fitness space that are ripe for takeover 
Meanwhile  look for companies that do something innovative and unique with the data they collect 
Take Moov  for example  Instead of serving as a stat collector  Moov acts like a digital trainer 
Even while fitness trackers actively encourage you to get healthier  some people shy away from them  believing they present a myriad of useless data that s of little concern to the user  Moov not only tracks workouts  it also helps you exercise more efficiently 
It s powered by a nine axis motion sensor  found in the latest military grade and gaming technologies  that measures and records precise movements while simultaneously guiding you through workout templates  If it catches you slumping  it may say to you   Straighten your back   or bark at you to  keep going  
Watch Out
Another example is the Pebble Time  which arrived long before the Apple Watch or any Google  O GOOGL  tracking device  This smartwatch  funded by a Kickstarter campaign  provided the first draft for many smartwatches that came after it  but with one key difference   battery life 
Pebble Time s color e ink display isn t a traditional LCD screen  which means it uses the battery only if something changes on screen  not whenever the display is on 
Then there s Jawbone  financed through private equity  Jawbone prides itself on blending art and technology  as its wearable designs are modern  light  and brilliant with fashion forward colors  textures  and styles 
Finally  Misfit  who has partnered with insurance companies in order to get their clients to be more active  is also developing a host of apps  Users can do something as simple as start and stop a Spotify playlist with Flash   or they can connect Misfit s sleep tracking functionality and alarm with the Nest Learning Thermostat  to wake up at their ideal temperature 
Bottom line  According to the FDA  the diet and weight loss industry today rakes in over  60 billion per annum  Based on the growth and popularity of wearable fitness technology  now looks like a good time to get in on the action   both physically and financially

Fabrinet  N FN  has a really nice chart  It had a breakaway gap about two weeks ago  it pulled down gently over a five day period  the volume got quiet  and in the last three days it moved up again  holding the gap support  It broke out above the prior high at 29 68  and on Wednesday  it reached a high of 29 90  closing up 63 cents to 28 08  or 2   on 441 700 shares traded  Volume was good  but not great  Look for it to run up to 331 2  roughly  on a swing trade 
Ocular Therapeutix  Inc   O OCUL  broke out with an explosive move on Wednesday on 5 6 million shares  which is historic volume for this stock  It jumped 2 41 to 8 67  or 38 1 2   This stock has come from the 40s down to the 5 00 range  and after almost a year it broke out with a breakaway gap  It did pull back  break through the declining topsline  above the 50  and above the gap  Watch this one going forward  because if it doesn t make the move up  it could slip back to below 8 00  or slip into the gap and have a deeper retest  perhaps down toward the prior high at 7 35  I like this for a move up to 11  and then 14 
Swift Transportation Company  N SWFT  continues to form in a steady wedge that looks intriguing  After the recent breakout  and the moving averagescrossing over  it s consolidating nicely  On Wednesday  it was up 15 cents to 17 43  on 2 1 million shares  Look for it to run up to 20 1 2 3 4  followed by 24 24 1 2

35172,256687,GRMN,S P 500 Breaks Out From The Slippery Slope,opinion,"T2108 Status  85 3 T2107 Status  53 1   11 month high VIX Status  13 8General  Short term  Trading Call  cautiously bullishActive T2108 periods  Day  43 over 20   Day  42 over 30   Day  39 over 40   Day  36 over 50   Day  32 over 60   Day  31 over 70   overbought   Day  1 over 80 
Commentary T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200 day moving averages  DMAs   is the new star of the show  Wednesday  this technical indicator broke out to an 11 month high and once again affirmed the underlying strength of the stock market 

T2107 breaks out in bulish form
The S P 500 obliged T2107 with its own breakout  The slippery slope I was watching  and the churn I was expecting  were all wiped away by a breakout on the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    The index gained 1  and closed at its high of the day  The S P 500  SPY  is on the edge of a fresh run up guided upward by the upper Bollinger Bands 
The S P 500  SPY  shows off its own breakout  closes on the high at a level last seen December 4  2015 
At the same time  T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   hurtled over the 80  threshold again  Its close at 85 3  provided the exclamation point to the market s bullish day  It seems the lift off implied by the chart below may finally be underway  yes  I keep showing this chart over and over    T2108 has traded above 70   in the overbought range  for 31 days 

S P 500 Performance By T2108 Duration Above the 70  Threshold
The VIX dropped close to recent lows and is approaching the  caution  zone of complacency  roughly below 13  

The volatility index  the VIX  completes another flip around the 15 35 pivot 
I have bumped the trading call off neutral and back to cautiously bullish  My second moment of wariness proved unwarranted  The S P 500 is already breaking through resistance created by last year s declining congestion from November to December  History is on the side of the market as the expected performance for this overbought period increases linearly from here with each passing day  My main challenge is to navigate around this earnings period  just because the overall tone and the underlying structure of the market are bullish  individual stocks do not get automatic passing grades after reporting earnings 
This was the kind of day where a lot of bullish trades went very well  I start my review of individual stocks with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   It finally broke out from 200DMA resistance and held its ground  During my last moment of wariness  I concluded AAPL would likely remain capped by resistance until earnings could provide a breakthrough catalyst  Instead  AAPL has now joined the ranks of stocks pushing T2107 upward 
Apple  AAPL  breaks free of resistance  Trading volume remains surprisingly low 
The theme for Wednesday  and for most of these charts  is clear  breakout 
iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  held up its end of the bargain  Sticking to my theme of buying IBB  with confidence   I added to my call options on the strong open  I locked in profits at the close  I am reloaded and ready to keep buying dips from here 

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  holds the line on its breakout from a base  IBB is now one step closer to confirming a bottom 

I am back to even on my latest round of Joy Global  NYSE JOY  call options  My timing continues to be a bit off on these trades  At least I seem to be getting closer to a big pay off on this  catch up  stock  If this breakout holds  I will move to holding shares for a longer period  Time is ticking away on my current position  I decided to hold out for a follow through day  Either way  I will need to close out on Thursday 

Joy Global  JOY  stands up to be counted among the 200DMA breakouts 

It was very appropriate for JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  to breakout on a day like this 

In a very bullish sign  earnings propel bottom maker JPMorgan Chase   Co   JPM  to a 3 month high  200DMA resistance looms directly overhead 

I mentioned in the last T2108 Update that I was impressed by Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  s ability to hold support at its 50DMA  but I did not think it would hold up  Wednesday s trading looked like it would validate my skepticism as the stock had a near apoplectic reaction to analyst commentary  or at least I assume THAT was the catalyst   At the low of the day  FB was trading on high selling volume  a 50DMA breakout  AND a bearish engulfing move  Perhaps FB lucked out selling off on such a strong market day   it was able to bounce all the way back to flatline by the close  I sold my call options on FB as it hit the 20DMA  That move was in itself extremely fortunate  I did not think about trying to play a fake breakdown 

Facebook  FB  was hit by an analyst downgrade that received a nastier reception than I would have expected 
You guessed it  Another breakout  I sold my call options on Garmin Ltd  NASDAQ GRMN  into this move  They expire this Friday and this breakout delivered the profits just in time  GRMN has built a solid base supported by 50 and 200DMAs 

You guess it another breakout  Garmin Ltd   GRMN  surges to an 8 month high
My call options on iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  expire next month  so I decided to keep holding  SLV was able to fight off a small dip despite a strong dollar day  Silver has lagged gold  so I want to hang on here in anticipation that this breakout will release some pent up momentum  I was also motivated to hold on because commodity related plays are still delivering some of the biggest upside moves in the market   I am now waaay overdue to get a dedicated commodity related piece done   especially for iron ore  
iShares Silver Trust  SLV  broke out to a new 5  month high 
At the time of typing  the U S  dollar  DXY0  is continuing its momentum from Wednesday in overnight trading  I was most surprised to see commodity related plays soar despite the U S  dollar s strength  However  a look under the covers suggests that carry traders are finally waking up to shorting the euro  NYSE FXE  and or the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  in order to get on the commodity train  With interest rates still poised to rise in the U S   it makes little sense to short the U S  dollar for a carry trade 

The U S  dollar  DXY0  soared on the day in a move that should surprise anyone assuming that a strong dollar is bad for the market 


The euro s upward momentum has come to a screeching halt 
Daily T2108 vs the S P 500
Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes

35173,256688,GRMN,4 Stocks To Watch Today  CYNO  ERX  INO  MDVN,opinion,"It was a wild and wholly day on Wall Street on Wednesday  down in the morning  back up  a retest  then the FOMC  a nice pop  and then a little bit of a pullback at the end of the day  but it was a mixed close  The NASDAQ is still under pressure  the S P 500 is doing great  but the blue chips and NYSEare doing much better  Let s take a look at some of the stocks highlighted here

Direxion Daily Energy Bull 3X Shares  NYSE ERX  is one of the swing trades we had for the oil sector that has now had a five wave move  and has reached a couple of our targets  Be careful about this one going forward  but if it does get more momentum  it could see mid 30 s 
Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ INO  just continues to push  It was up 46 cents to 10 44  or 4 39   on 1 7 million shares on Wednesday  and has been acting great  The inverse head and shoulders is what caught my attention  When it broke out we put a swing on it  and its gone from the 7 1 4 1 2 area to 11  My short term target is up in the 11 zone  and the secondary target is around 13  It has 6 32 days to cover 
Medivation Inc  NASDAQ MDVN  is coiling beautifully  It was up 23 cents to 52 05  on 2 2 million shares  If it pops  this stock should run up to the high 50 s  as well as potentially a takeover at some point  It could reach the mid 60 s first

35174,256689,GRMN,Fitbit Shares Were Up 3 2  Yesterday  Should You Buy Too ,opinion,"Wedbush analyst initiated Fitbit   NYSE FIT   shares with an  18 price target  immediately sending shares up 3 2   But since they barely moved in extended trading it s apparent that investors aren t going overboard 
 FITBIT INC Price and EPS Surprise    
The analyst pointed to some factors that could drive future growth  including co branding opportunities  accessory sales and corporate wellness opportunities  So let s take a look at each of these 
The Question of Co Branding
The Fitbit brand is growing in popularity as the company s brand awareness campaigns appear to be generating results  Despite Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   entry into the segment  Fitbit sales have held up relatively well  And increasingly  the analyst feels  the brand is becoming a common noun with the words  fitness tracker  being replaced with  Fibit  
Independent market research from IDC indicates that this theory could have merit  In its wearables market tracking report published on May 16  the research firm says that Fitbit s  well segmented portfolio  pricing strategy  and a strong brand  have played an important role in establishing its leading market position  It estimates that Fitbit s newer Blaze and Alta products   a new chapter of fashion oriented fitness trackers   sold a million units each  while the older Surge  Charge  Charge HR and Flex products declined 
Fitbit saw shipments grow 25 4  in the first quarter  Xiaomi saw much stronger growth based on its strength in China  Apple and Garmin   NASDAQ GRMN   were relatively distant third and fourths with single digit market shares 
The fact that it is able to sell new products and or get its customers to upgrade is also a sign of strong brand awareness 
Fitbit already resorts to a kind of co branding  since its products are better known as Fitbits than by their individual names  This makes it difficult for competing brands to encroach on its market share even when they have a couple of strong features  Co branding with competing products doesn t seem like a good idea at this stage  but is an interesting thought if you consider other wearable products coming on the market 
For instance  Benzinga recently wrote about a number of wearable products for babies  devices for tracking babies  heart rates  pressure  oxygen levels  thermometers  pacifiers  etc   Co branding with market adjacent products could help it grow market share 
The Question of Accessory Sales
Fitbit tells us nothing about accessory sales  but one would assume that there would be some correlation with Fitbit device sales  So continuing strength in the main product lines should be positive enough for growth in accessories  Although  accessories are unlikely to ever grow into a significant percentage of sales  so we will probably never have more granularity on numbers  We can of course theorize about it    
The Question of Corporate Wellness
Corporate wellness makes perfect sense  and the company has actually made some progress on this front  The sales strategy here is that if companies subsidize encourage employees to buy fitness devices lead more healthy lives  corporate healthcare costs will go down 
It may sound like a tough sell  but companies are clearly buying it  Fitbit currently has over a thousand enterprise customers  of which Target   NYSE TGT   is one of the better known  The company s growing mindshare will continue to help on this front 
Will Brand Strength Beat Product Quality Issues 
The accuracy of heart rate readings by Fitbit s PurePulse heart rate monitors used in its Fitbit Blaze  Fitbit Charge HR and Fitbit Surge bands has recently been questioned by two groups 
The first was a Ball State University test in Indiana that included journalists at NBC affiliated TV station WTHR  The study found that the Fitbit Charge HR recorded an average heart rate error of 14   Fitbit said its devices  are designed to provide meaningful data to our users to help them reach their health and fitness goals  and are not intended to be scientific or medical devices  
More recently  the California State Polytechnic University  Pomona tested heartbeats of 43 healthy adults during rest and exercise  including jump rope  treadmills  outdoor jogging and stair climbing using the Fitbit s PurePulse heart rate monitors  The test sho
wed inaccuracy up to 20 beats per minute during more strenuous workouts  The study was commissioned by Lieff Cabraser  the law firm behind a class action suit targeting the Fitbit Blaze  Fitbit Charge HR and Fitbit Surge  Fitbit called this test  biased    baseless  and lacking in  scientific rigor  
While adverse test results have created some negative sentiment for Fitbit  it s worth remembering that these consumer health monitoring devices are not priced the way an advanced scientific instrument might be  They should be treated as utility items with reasonable accuracy much along the lines of accucheck devices for measuring blood sugar levels 
This level of accuracy is perfectly acceptable and useful for most people and only professionals or geeks fans would possibly want more  So Fitbit shouldn t be in any trouble as long as it doesn t make false claims about its products 
Final Words
Fitbit has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and its already rich valuation could limit upside at these levels  But this is a stock worth watching for the following reasons 
The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 167 9   The Zacks Growth score is A  indicating that there are solid growth prospects 
Despite the fact that it s a relatively new company  Fitbit generates profits  has a leading share of a fast growing market  has a well articulated growth strategy  steady flow of new products and very strong international growth prospects because of low penetration levels  Besides  even if competition continues to increase because of the commodity nature of the products  low penetration levels mean we shouldn t worry about it yet  In the long run  its first mover advantage may mean stronger brand value and protect it from downside risk ",2016-06-10,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/fitbit-shares-were-up-3.2-yesterday,-should-you-buy-too-200135349",200135349

Consumer discretionary stocks have gotten killed this year  as Liz reports  noting that 22 consumer discretionary stocks in the S P 500 have issued profit warnings this quarter 
Looking abroad  I recommended avoiding the U S  market altogether  focusing instead on Europe   The Eurozone is a couple years behind the U S  in terms of both economic recovery and stock returns  and that is where the better bargains are today   I highlight Spanish stocks as a contrarian value buy  and recommend German stocks as a leveraged bet on a global recovery   Germany is the world s premier high end exporting nation 
Nicole Petallides carries the torch from there  noting that not all U S  consumer discretionary stocks have performed poorly   Under Armour  NYSE UA   Harman International  NYSE HAR  and Garmin  NASDAQ GRMN  have all had solid returns this year   Later  Nicole recaps the recent action in the energy sector  highlighting one of Macro Trend Investor s best performing stocks this year  Williams Companies  NYSE WMB

35235,256750,GRMN,Could Apple Buy a Third of the World s Gold ,opinion,"Is there anything Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  can t do  First it revolutionized the personal computing business  Then  with the launch of the iPod in 2001  it forced the music industry to change its tune  Against initial market reservations  the company succeeded at making Star Trek like tablets hip when it released the iPad in 2010  And in Q1 2015  a record 75 million units of its now ubiquitous iPhone were sold around the globe  The smartphone s operating system  iOS  currently controls a jaw dropping 89 percent share of all systems worldwide  pushing the second place OS  Google s Android  down to 11 percent from 30 percent just a year ago  As you might already know  the company that Steve Jobs built is history s largest by net capitalization  In its last quarterly report  Apple posted a record  75 billion in revenue and is now sitting pretty on a mind boggling  180 billionin cash  Many analysts believe the company will reach a jaw dropping  1 trillion in market cap  So what s Apple s next trick  How about moving the world s gold market  iGold This April  Apple will be venturing into the latest wearable gadget market  the smartwatch  joining competitors such as Samsung Electronics PK  OTC SSNLF   Garmin  NASDAQ GRMN  and Sony  NYSE SNE   All of the models in Apple s stable of watches look sleek and beautifully designed just what you d expect from Apple and will no doubt be capable of performing all sorts of high tech functions such as receiving text messages  monitoring the wearer s vitals and  of course  telling time  But the real story here is that the company s high end luxury model  referred to simply as the Apple Watch Edition  will come encased in 18 karat gold  What should make this news even more exciting to gold investors is that the company expects to produce 1 million units of this particular model per month in the second quarter of 2015 alone  according to the Wall Street Journal  That s a lot of gold  if true  It also proves that the Love Trade is alive and well  Apple chose to use gold in its most expensive new model because the metal is revered for its beauty and rarity  To produce such a great quantity of units  how much of the yellow metal might be needed 
For a ballpark estimate  I turn to  which begins with the assumption that each Apple Watch Edition contains two troy ounces of gold  From there  If Apple makes 1 million Apple Watch Edition units every month  that equals 24 million troy ounces of gold used per year  or roughly 746 metric tons  or tonnes   That s enough gold to make even a Bond villain blush  but just how much is it  About 2 500 metric tons of gold are mined per year  If Apple uses 746 metric tons every year  we re talking about 30 percent of the world s annual gold production  To put things in perspective  the Sripuram Golden Temple in India  the world s largest golden structure  is made from  only  1 5 tonnes of the metal  TidBITS acknowledges that the amount of Gold is speculative at this point  Two troy ounces does seem pretty hyperbolic  But even if each luxury watch contains only a quarter of that  it s still an unfathomable perhaps even unprecedented amount of gold for a single company  even one so large as Apple  to consume  Ralph Aldis  portfolio managers likens the idea of Apple buying a third of the world s gold to China s voracious consumption of the metal  As I mentioned last week  China is buying more gold right now than the total amount mined worldwide   If the estimates of how much gold each watch contains are close to reality  and if Apple s able to sell as many units as it claims  it really ought to help gold prices move higher   Ralph says  But Can Expectations Be Met  Here s where this whole discussion could unravel  Although we don t yet know what the Apple Watch Edition will retail at  it s safe to predict that it will fall somewhere between  4 000 and  10 000  placing it in the same company as a low end Rolex  With that in mind  are Apple s sales expectations too optimistic  Possibly  But remember  this is Apple we re talking about here  Over the years  it has sufficiently proven itself as a company that more than delivers on the  if you build it  they will come  philosophy  Steve Jobs aggressively cultivated a business environment that not only encourages but insists on  thinking different  to use the company s old slogan risk taking and developing must have gadgets   Our whole role in life is to give you something you didn t know you wanted   says current Apple CEO Tim Cook   And then once you get it  you can t imagine your life without it   A perfect case study is the iPhone  When it launched in June 2007  the cell phone market was decidedly crowded  Consumers seemed content with the choices that were already available  Why did we need another phone  Yet here we are more than eight years later  and as I pointed out earlier  75 million iPhones were sold in the last quarter alone  So it s not entirely out of the realm of possibility for Apple to move 1 million  10 000 Apple Watch Editions per month  Early in January I shared  which shows various analysts  Apple Watch shipment forecasts for 2015  ranging from 10 million to 60 million units  Of course  all models are included here  not just the luxury model  Looking at it now  many of the predictions seem a little understated  After all  Apple hasn t released a dud product in at least two decades  remember the Newton    Come April  we ll see for sure what the demand really is for the Apple Watch as well as gold  Please consider carefully a fund s investment objectives  risks  charges and expenses

35236,256751,GRMN,Should You Buy Garmin s Dip ,opinion,"If you ve driven a car in the past 15 years  odds are you ve also used a GPS 
Yet the emergence of smartphones quickly made the stand alone GPS devices obsolete 
It was a huge wake up call for Garmin Ltd  NASDAQ GRMN    the company that was once synonymous with automobile GPS navigation 
However  the company has been hard at work diversifying its business  and it remains relevant today 
In fact  Garmin pays an extremely enticing dividend  and the stock looks cheap right now  That s an unusual combination in today s market 
But is it actually worth an investment 
On April 29  the company reported first quarter 2015 earnings  Garmin missed on both revenue and earnings per share  and shares plummeted more than 4  on the day  reaching a new 52 week low 
That s a bad start to the year  but it s not enough to write off the stock entirely  Thus  to determine if this is actually an opportunity or merely a value trap  we turn to our  for finding safe  high yield 
1  Simple Business
It s been years since Garmin could rely solely on its automobile GPS systems  and the company has been working hard to diversify its products  Today  Garmin cites five different segments to its business  automotive  marine  outdoor  fitness  and aviation  According to its website  57  of Garmin s revenue comes from non automotive products  a sign of how little the company relies on the products that initially powered its growth 
Unfortunately  Garmin s business has grown increasingly complicated in an effort to remain relevant   and profitable   following the demise of its GPS niche  With products ranging from bicycle pedal power meters to fish finders to Cessna flight decks  Garmin s business is no longer quite so simple  and that s not what we re looking for 
2  Steady Demand
Generally speaking  Garmin s revenue has been in precipitous decline since it peaked in 2008  The chart below shows annual revenue over the last seven years 

As you can see  the trend is downward   though revenue did increase in 2014  And while that s a positive development  much of last year s revenue growth was powered by the fitness segment  which is facing significantly increased competition 
Specifically  the growth in fitness has been powered in large part by the Forerunner smartwatch  and  as everyone knows  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  recently invaded the smartwatch arena 
In Garmin s most recent earnings call  analysts asked about increased competition  particularly from the Apple Watch  CFO Doug Boessen replied that  our products are positioned differently than the Apple Watch  and we appeal to strong active lifestyles   Forgive me if I m not totally convinced by that logic 
Revenue from the outdoor segment was below expectations  falling 10  this quarter  Similarly  auto revenue was down 11  this quarter  In the marine segment  revenue grew 7  year over year  but this is attributable to Garmin s acquisition of Fusion Electronics  The organic business  on the other hand  remained flat year over year  Finally  aviation revenue grew 2  in the quarter  though operating profits were down on a year over year basis Meanwhile  demand was mixed in Garmin s latest quarter  Its fitness division reported 31  year over year revenue growth  but other divisions haven t fared so well 
3  Cash Flow Positive
Strictly speaking  Garmin is cash flow positive  having generated  64 million in free cash flow in the most recent quarter  However  both free cash flow and cash from operations have declined significantly since peaking in 2009  as you can see in the chart below 

What s more  the gap between cash from operations and free cash flow has expanded recently  meaning Garmin s capital expenditures  capex  are increasing  In fact  Garmin s capex reached  73 3 million in 2014  a 128  increase since 2010  This is problematic because the business is becoming more capital intensive at the same time that revenue has suffered 
Meanwhile  in the most recent quarter  the company paid significantly more in dividends than it generated in free cash flow   92 million versus just  64 million   while also repurchasing  16 million worth of shares  This is definitely a trend worth watching  as an extended period of uncovered payouts could put Garmin s dividend at risk 
4  High Cash Balance
Garmin s cash and cash equivalents have declined about 7  since peaking in 2011  but the company still maintains a relatively strong balance sheet  Indeed  its dividend is well covered by its cash reserve  However  as noted above  if cash flow continues to fall short of dividend payouts  even a high cash balance won t last forever 
5  Minimal Need for Credit
According to Bloomberg  Garmin has had no debt for the last eight years  Combined with a high cash balance  it s a safe bet that Garmin has little need for credit 
6  Earnings Buffer
According to Morningstar  Garmin has a dividend payout ratio of 100 8  for the last 12 months   and that s not a good sign  Once again  if Garmin can t cover its dividend for an extended period  then it s possible the company could slash its payout 
7  Dividend Grower 
When it comes to dividend paying stocks  companies that are growing their dividends   not the ones with the highest yield   have proven to be the best investments  Unfortunately  though Garmin s yield is quite attractive  the company s dividend growth leaves much to be desired 
Garmin s one year dividend growth is a measly 6 3   which is in line with the bump from 2013 to 2014  as well  6 7    The year before that  the dividend remained flat  At the end of the day  a three year dividend growth rate of just 4 3  is not what we re looking for in a stock 
In Conclusion
Based on our seven step system  Garmin doesn t qualify as a worthy dividend investment  Revenue peaked all the way back in 2008  while capex is increasing rapidly  Meanwhile  some of the company s most profitable products are facing new competition from heavyweights like Apple  Finally  the dividend is growing at an anemic rate 
Bottom line  Steer clear of this once dominant GPS manufacturer

35237,256752,GRMN,The Fitbit IPO  Winner Or Washout ,opinion,"The market is buzzing today about the next big tech IPO   Fitbit    
For the record  I fully expect shares of the fitness tracking firm to rally well above the offer price  which will whip the mainstream media into a frenzy and bombard us with the company s  wildly successful debut  
Don t fall for the hype 
And  more importantly  don t rush out to buy shares for fear of missing out 
The IPO market isn t set up to reward everyday investors like us  It s set up to make us the bag holders  not the profiteers 
This could be particularly true when it comes to Fitbit s IPO  Here s why 
Fitbit in Perfect IPO Shape  But Investors Beware
IPOs are all about maximizing value for existing owners and private investors 
That line bears rereading  because you and I  i e   everyday investors  are nowhere to be found in the equation 
Instead  IPOs are all about venture capitalists  investment bankers  and well heeled insiders raking in the profits  And in this case  we re dealing with the savviest among them 
On the VC side  I m talking about Foundry Group  True Ventures  SoftBank Capital  and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Ventures  among others 
On the banking side  we re dealing with the likes of Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Deutsche Bank  XETRA DBKGn   and Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  
With so many heavyweights involved   and salivating at the prospects of lining their pockets   it s no surprise that Fitbit is going public at precisely this time 
The company s headline financials are off the charts impressive  Consider 
Sales have leapt almost 10 fold in the last two years   from a mere  76 million in 2012 to  745 million in 2014 
In the most recent quarter  year over year sales tripled to  336 million 
Gross margins have swelled from 41  to 50  
Fitbit is profitable   a rarity for IPOs 
And Fitbit s global market share checks in at a chart topping 34  
As Jan Dawson  analyst at Jackdaw Research  said   These revenue growth and margin metrics help to explain why the company is going for an IPO now   the numbers are very  very good  
Indeed  And there s no better time to demand top dollar than when a business is firing on all cylinders

What makes the timing even more compelling   and reinforcing the  it s going to get even better  storyline for Fitbit   is the fact that the  market appears poised to launch into the stratosphere 
Tech research firm IDC expects wearable device shipments to triple from 21 million in 2014 to 144 million in 2017 
And we re well on the way  too  as first quarter wearable device sales soared by 200  
Simply put  the market is as ripe as it possibly could be for early investors to monetize their investment in Fitbit 
So much so  in fact  that the company was able to increase the size and price of its IPO 
Fitbit now expects to offer 34 5 million shares between  17 and  19  compared to earlier plans to offer 29 85 million shares between  14 and  16 
So what s the problem 
A little thing called  history  
History Repeating 
The Fitbit IPO is eerily similar to the climate that preceded the IPOs for Groupon Inc  NASDAQ GRPN  and Zynga Inc  NASDAQ ZNGA  
Each went public at the pinnacle of their respective industries  And while early investors and owners made a fortune  both stocks proved to be disastrous investments for everyday investors 
 And yes  I warned about both Groupon and Zynga in advance  

And there s good reason to believe the same fate awaits Fitbit 
Peak Problems
To its credit  Fitbit pioneered the connected health and fitness market back in 2007  Much like Groupon pioneered the daily deals market 
That s crucial  because as a first mover in the industry  Fitbit has enjoyed unparalleled success  selling over 20 million devices to date 
But as markets mature and time passes  competition always heats up 
And increased competition is precisely what promises to undermine an investment in Fitbit 
Especially since Fitbit sells a commodity product  I mean  its devices are nothing more than sensors and software 
China s Xiaomi realized this  and immediately pounced on the opportunity  Over the last year  it s flooded the market with its  15 Mi Band   By contrast  Fitbit s fitness trackers are priced between  59 and  249  
Sure enough  Xiaomi snatched a staggering 25  of the wearables market in the first quarter of 2015 
As a result  Fitbit s market share has already fallen from 44 7  at the end of 2014 to 34  today  And further declines are all but guaranteed  as new entrants gain more market traction 
It s not simply about competition from lower cost devices  either 
Breaking up the Band
The risk of further market share erosion is far greater  because Fitbit s entire product line could be consolidated as a feature in another product  Much like Garmin s  NASDAQ GRMN  standalone GPS units were essentially consolidated into smartphones 
As Forrester Research technology analyst Julie Ask points out   Nobody knows yet if these fitness wearables are sustainable or go the way of low end digital cameras  
But the data doesn t bode well for Fitbit 
Very few people end up purchasing a second device  What s more  nearly 50  of users end up abandoning their device in the first year 
If history is any guide  there s a greater chance of fitness tracking becoming a feature within a larger product than remaining a standalone one  In that regard  the Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Watch looms as the biggest threat to Fitbit 
Bottom line  Don t believe the hype  Fitbit is coming to market at the best possible time for its existing shareholders  not future ones 
The fact that insiders suddenly decided to sell more shares   35  of the offering  compared to 25  previously   only reinforces my conviction  They re cashing out while they can  Don t be their bag holder ",2015-06-21,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fitbit-ipo:-winner-or-washout-255728,255728

 Turning Japanese  by The Vapors 
 Groove Is in the Heart  by Deee Lite 
In the music industry  we call them  one hit wonders   The artist notches a big winner  then disappears 
In the technology sector  such a fate often befalls tech companies  too  Only we call them  one product wonders  
They design items that go from being all the rage  Palm digital organizers or Blackberry  TO BB  smartphones  for example  to almost non existent  if not completely extinct 
Ditto for their stock prices  Well  we ve got our next two big candidates in the tech world 
Reality Bites 
Writing in Barron s  Alexander Eule argues that point of view camera maker GoPro Inc   NASDAQ GPRO  is the next tech company to earn this illustrious distinction 
If he s right  shares are in for a nasty downturn 
But I m convinced that Fitbit Inc   NYSE FIT  could just as easily beat GoPro to it  Here s why 
When Fitbit shares debuted in mid June  the usual IPO hype propelled the stock to a peak of  51 90 in August 
But as is usually the case  reality quickly set in and the price came crashing back down to a low of  31 25 in September 
Analysts swear that the pullback is a great buying opportunity  In fact  both FBN Securities and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  recently pounded the table and called for lofty price targets of  50 and  58  respectively 
I couldn t disagree more 
At current prices  Fitbit is anything but a bargain 
Shares currently trade hands at nearly 40 times forward earnings and six times sales  Yet  the average stock in the S P 500 trades at 17 6 times earnings and 1 7 times sales 
Can you say  overvalued  
Granted  companies growing at above average rates should command premium multiples  And Fitbit definitely falls into that category  In the last quarter  year over year sales blasted 252  higher 
But that type of growth can t last indefinitely  And it won t 
A Garmin esque Tumble Looms for Fitbit
In fact  analysts already expect revenue growth to slow to about 40  in 2016 
But I expect it to be even slower because I believe analysts are underestimating the industry dynamics 
Tech research group Gartner predicts the wearable tech market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 49  through 2020 
Fitbit has benefited handsomely from this robust trend  commanding the majority of the market share  But since the Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Watch entered the scene in June  it s quickly changed the competitive landscape  It s already within striking distance of Fitbit s pole position 
In the second quarter  for example  Apple shipped 3 6 million Watches  compared to Fitbit s 4 4 million wristbands  according to market research firm IDC 
IDC concludes 

 It s worth noting that Fitbit only sells basic wearables   a category that s expected to lose share over the next few years  leaving Apple poised to become the next market leader for all wearables  

That s being charitable  I m convinced that total market share erosion is possible  Why 
Because Fitbit s entire product line is going to be consolidated into a feature within another product 
Remember how Garmin Ltd  s  NASDAQ GRMN  standalone GPS units were essentially consolidated into smartphones  We ve got the same situation here 
It gets worse for Fitbit  The company can t even pin any hopes on maintaining market share   or relevance  for that matter   by being the most affordable option  Because it s not 
That distinction belongs to China s Xiaomi  It sells a Mi Band fitness tracker for  15  By contrast  Fitbit s trackers are priced between  59 and  249 
And of course  this isn t a three horse race  Fitbit also faces competition from Misfit  Withings and Jawbone  among others 
Fierce Competition   Big Trouble
What happens when companies are faced with a super competitive market 
They usually do two things to boost sales   spend more on marketing and reduce product prices 
We re about to witness both in the wearables market  And don t just take my word for it 
 The current competitive environment in the fitness market necessitates more aggressive pricing with higher advertising expenses   says Garmin  NASDAQ GRMN  CEO Cliff Pemble 
He should know  too  In the last quarter  Garmin reported its slowest ever sales growth for its fitness segment 
Fitbit is treading down the same rocky path  Its future holds higher expenses and lower margins  which is nothing but a negative for share prices 
Corporate Wellness Won t Save the Day
Fitbit bulls believe the trend towards  corporate wellness  could be a new and lifesaving growth driver for the firm 
Indeed  Fitbit shares rallied by 12  back on September 16 when Target Corp   NYSE TGT  announced that it s offering all 335 000 of its employees the Fitbit Zip   the company s most basic device  priced at  59 95   to help promote fitness and reduce healthcare costs 
Wishful thinking on the part of investors and Target executives 
Giving habitually sedentary employees a new gadget isn t necessarily going to change their habits 
At best  their usage rates will match Fitbit s existing user base  Remember  few people end up purchasing a second Fitbit device  And nearly 50  of users abandon their device in the first year 
Worst case  employee usage rates will be  well  worse 
If anything  the news shouldn t have emboldened Fitbit bulls  It should have enraged Target shareholders  as executives more than likely wasted about  20 million on the employee  benefit  
Fitbit Looking Flabby
Overly optimistic analysts might be able to prop up Fitbit s share price in the short term  But eventually  reality is going to set in  And it s not pretty 
Slowing growth  shrinking margins  no pricing power  increased competition  and eventual obsolescence all loom on the horizon 
Look for a strong holiday season showing for the Apple Watch  coupled with a mass exodus of Fitbit insiders when the IPO lock up period expires on December 15  as a wake up call for Fitbit investors 
In short  Fitbit remains a stock to avoid  And speculators might want to consider some long dated put options ",2015-10-08,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fitbit:-the-world’s-most-dangerous-tech-stock-267512,267512
111555,333070,GRMN,Garmin Stock Clears  100    Does It Still Have Room to Run ,news,"Longtime Garmin  NASDAQ GRMN  shareholders may remember the roaring rally in late 2007  followed by the collapse along with the market during the Great Recession  Since then  the stock s upward climb hasn t been as steep  but it finally worked its way back to the  100 mark this month   

Data by YCharts
Let s take a look at what the business has done along the way  and what the future may hold  
No longer an automotive GPS company
The last decade for Garmin has been one of transition as it shifted from a reliance on automotive Personal Navigation Devices  PND  to other segments of the business  fitness  outdoor  marine  and aviation 

The table below illustrates this transition  showing a snapshot of the percentage of sales for each category from 2007 to the present 

Data Source  Garmin financial filings   Fiscal 2019 data for the first three quarters of the year    Data shown as even split between outdoor and fitness segments  which were previously reported as a single unit 
The transition from the automotive space has been notable  
Solid business fundamentals
The segments powering the business are still in growth mode  The table below shows the compound annual growth rate  CAGR  for each segment s revenue over the past three years 

Data source  Garmin financial filings  Calculated for full year revenue from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018 
These trends have only accelerated in fiscal 2019  as outdoor  fitness  and aviation each exhibited the strongest year over year growth rates of the year during the third quarter 
Investing for further growth
These results have given management the confidence to raise guidance over the course of the year as well  Going into 2019  guidance for the year was for  3 5 billion in revenue and  3 70 of earnings per share  It most recently updated those figures after the third quarter for revenue of  3 65 billion and  4 15 per share of earnings  increases of 4 3  and 12 2   respectively  Both gross and operating margins are also predicted to increase for the third consecutive year 
There s no reason to think this outperformance can t continue  The company is investing in research and development  increasing that expense by mid single digits throughout 2019  And contributions from the 2019 acquisition of indoor cycling and training firm Tacx are beginning to be realized in the fitness category 
Expectations going forward
The company is set to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 results on Feb  19  Guidance for the next year will be announced  but don t be surprised if it s on the conservative side  and management increases it throughout the year  This conservative approach is also reflected on the balance sheet 
A 2 3  dividend yield is well covered by free cash flow  and as of Sept  28  2019  the company had  2 5 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet  which gives the company the flexibility to pursue additional acquisitions 
Investors looking for a committed dividend payer with solid prospects for ongoing growth would be wise to look at Garmin as it evolves its non automotive segments for the burgeoning outdoor lifestyle market ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnywc,2069552

111573,333088,GRMN,3 Investing Facts About Required Minimum Distributions You Need To Know   January 29  2020,opinion,"Neglecting to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from an IRA by the due date brings about a painful tax code penalty  50   Yes  you read that right  If you are supposed to withdraw at least  4 000 and  uh oh   did not do as such  you have to write the IRS a check for  2 000  Keep in mind that on January 1  2020  the RMD rules were modified 
Like many investors  you re likely aiming to build a comfortable nest egg to ensure a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is called the  accumulation phase   In this phase  your goal is to invest wisely by choosing stocks with long term potential for your retirement portfolio  such as Garmin  GRMN   a current top ranked dividend stock 
But that s just half of retirement planning  The second part  the  distribution phase   sometimes gets overlooked even though it can be more fun to think about  That s because the distribution phase is where you determine how to spend your hard earned assets 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
Why does the IRS require you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 72  If you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you retire 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What happens if don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or if the distribution is not large enough  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD
