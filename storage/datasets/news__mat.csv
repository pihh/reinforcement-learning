159529,381045,MAT,Why Mattel Stock Was Slumping Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  were falling today after the toy maker reacted poorly to news from Target  NYSE TGT  that toy sales were sluggish during the holiday season  The holiday season is crucial for toy makers  especially Mattel  which is in the midst of a multiyear restructuring process  Shares of the Barbie maker were down 5 9  as of 11 47 a m  EST on the news 
So what
Target said that its own comparable sales in toys were flat  though it still gained market share according to the NPD Group   In other words  toy sales seem to have fallen during the holidays  likely due to the shortened shopping season 

A number of related stocks  including Best Buy  Walmart  and Hasbro  also fell  but no one took the news harder than Mattel  which finds itself in the most precarious position of the bunch 
The company  which also owns brands like Hot Wheels and Fisher Price  has been struggling for years as kids have begun favoring screens over classic toys  and it s faced challenges from tariffs and new competition  Last year  the company also found accounting errors that led to the exit of its CFO  one example of how Mattel has at times created its own problems 
In its fourth quarter guidance  the company said sales would be down slightly due to a shorter holiday season  among other issues  
Now what
We ll learn more when Mattel reports fourth quarter earnings  which is expected at the beginning of February  Analysts are predicting that revenue will have declined 1 8  to  1 5 billion and that earnings per share will be  0 01  down from  0 04 the year before  
Mattel shares have long been volatile due to the company s struggles and its heavy debt burden  though its intellectual property seems to have put a floor on the stock  Given questions about the holiday quarter in the toy industry  that volatility will likely continue over coming weeks ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pighl,2060311

159532,381048,MAT,Better Buy  Disney vs  Mattel,news,"Disney  NYSE DIS  and Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  are both storied household names in America  but their stock prices have gone in opposite directions over the past five years  Disney s stock rallied roughly 50  as the growth of its movie and theme parks businesses offset the slowdown in its cable network business 
Mattel s stock plummeted nearly 46  as poor sales of American Girl  Fisher Price  and Thomas   Friends brand toys overwhelmed its stronger brands  The bankruptcy of Toys R Us also cast a dark cloud over the toy market  Today  we ll take a fresh look at both stocks to see if Disney will continue outperforming Mattel throughout 2020 

Disney  Rising revenues  rising expenses
Disney splits its business into four main units  media networks  36  of its 2019 revenues   parks  experiences  and products  38    studio entertainment  16    and direct to consumer  DTC  and international products  13    The total percentage exceeds 100  due to inter company eliminations 
Disney s total revenue rose 17  annually to  69 6 billion last year  Its media revenues grew 13   its parks and products revenue rose 6   its studio revenues climbed 11   and its DTC and international revenues more than doubled  However  those results were significantly boosted by Fox s media revenues in the second half of the year 
Yet Disney s net income from continuing operations fell 17  to  10 4 billion in 2019  as the costs of integrating Fox s assets and expanding its streaming ecosystem weighed down its margins  Its adjusted EPS declined by 19  
Mattel  Sluggish revenue growth and narrower losses
Mattel splits its business into three main operating segments  North America  50  of its revenues in first nine months of 2019   international  46    and American Girl  4    Its North American and international sales rose slightly during that period  but sales of American Girl dolls declined 
Mattel also reports its revenue in four product categories  dolls  32  of its revenues in the first nine months   infant  toddler  and preschool products  26    vehicles  22    and action figures  building sets  and games  20    Sales of all its product lines    except infant  toddler  and preschool products    rose annually during that period 
Mattel s strengths    which include Barbie  Hot Wheels  and licensed Toy Story products    slightly offset its weaknesses and boosted its net sales by 1  annually to  3 billion in the first nine months of 2019  It also narrowed its net loss from  543 million to  214 million  For the full year  analysts expect Mattel s revenue to stay flat and its loss to narrow 
The main headwinds
2020 will be an unpredictable year for both companies  Disney will only release two Marvel movies this year  marking the first year since 2016 the studio released fewer than three movies  It also won t release any new Star Wars films in 2020 
Instead  it will pivot both franchises toward Disney  with streaming series like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and The Mandalorian  Disney  gained over 10 million subscribers on its launch day last November  but much of that growth likely came from free trials  It s unclear if Disney  can maintain that momentum  and it will likely keep operating the platform at a loss for the foreseeable future 

Meanwhile  integration costs for Fox s assets should rise as its cable networks continue to lose viewers to streaming platforms  The ongoing spread of the Wuhan coronavirus  which already prompted the closures of its Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks  will also throttle its theme park business 
Mattel will focus on nurturing the growth of top brands like Barbie  Hot Wheels  Toy Story  and Polly Pocket  It will expand Fisher Price overseas to offset its weaker domestic growth  and streamline Thomas   Friends for an aggressive turnaround effort 
The toymaker will also focus on boosting its margins with its  structural simplification savings  plan    which includes eliminating redundancies  scaling back weaker product lines  tightening its marketing budget  and building its brand awareness through digital platforms and other media channels instead of traditional ads 
Those plans sound encouraging  but Target s weak holiday sales report    which it partly blamed on flat growth in toys    is sparking doubts about Mattel s quest to end five straight years of revenue declines 
The valuations and verdict
Analysts expect Disney s revenue to rise 17  this year  and for its earnings to dip 6  on rising expenses  That s a tepid growth rate for a stock that trades at 23 times forward earnings  but its valuation prices in its future growth from Disney   Fox s assets  and new theme park attractions like Galaxy s Edge  It also pays a forward dividend yield of 1 3  
Analysts expect Mattel s revenue to rise 2  in 2020 as it squeezes out a slim profit  Mattel s stock trades at about 120 times that earnings estimate  but also trades at less than one times next year s revenue    which makes it a fairly cheap stock  Mattel suspended its dividend in 2017 and hasn t announced any plans to reinstate it 
Disney and Mattel are both solid companies  but the House of Mouse easily tops the toymaker  It has a better diversified business  more irons in the fire  and it pays a decent dividend  Its stock might be a bit frothy now  but it could easily rally higher over the long term as its new growth engines kick in ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poyum,2071767

159557,381073,MAT,Democrats say consumer product safety commission too close to companies,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC   whose job is to assure products Americans buy are safe  is inappropriately deferential to companies it investigates  according to a report done for Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee released on Thursday 
Settlements reached by the Trump CPSC  are at odds with traditional recall agreements negotiated by the CPSC   the report said 
 Rather than providing consumers with a specific remedy that repairs all impacted products or a refund to remove the dangerous products from homes  these recalls perversely serve as marketing tools to allow the recalling company to sell additional products   the report found 
One product discussed in the report is the Fisher Price Rock n Play Sleeper  which Consumer Reports found earlier this year was responsible for the deaths of at least 32 infants since 2009 
The CPSC said in April 2019 that the product was being recalled and customers given refunds  but the Commerce Committee staff found that refunds were only given to people who purchased it on or after Oct  12  2018 and only if the consumer had the original receipt  Others got a coupon for a Fisher Price product 
 Industry and the Consumer Product Safety Commission need to take action to ensure that consumers aren t buying dangerous or defective products and that those who do receive a real remedy   said Senator Maria Cantwell  the top Democrat on the committee 
The report also focused on the BOB jogging stroller  made by Britax  which faced recalls in 2014 for finger injuries and in 2017 because babies fell from the stroller 
The CPSC later learned that children were being injured by a new problem   the front wheel would detach   and approved a plan in 2018 allowing Britax to put up a video on how to fix the problem and to distribute repair parts 
As of April 2019  about 20  of the strollers were fixed  the report said 
The CPSC and Britax had no immediate comment on the findings  Fisher Price owner Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  did not respond to a request for comment 
The report also looked at residential elevators in resorts and big houses  Many have a gap between the outer and inner doors large enough in some cases for small children to become trapped or fall underneath  the report said 
The CPSC  to date  has only issued a safety alert urging that the elevators be inspected  The report said CPSC had failed to identify the companies that make the problem elevators or to require action to remedy the problem 
It urged the commission to be quicker to issue imminent health and safety warnings  to fine companies that fail to report hazards  and to use refunds or easy repairs to make consumers whole after they purchase a dangerous product ",2019-12-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/democrats-say-consumer-product-safety-commission-too-close-to-companies-2045264,2045264

The rally in Mattel comes less than a week after Mattel reported a narrower than expected loss in the first quarter and revenue that beat estimates from analysts polled by Investing com

159818,381334,MAT,Mattel  MAT  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This toy maker is expected to post break even quarterly earnings per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  100  
Revenues are expected to be  1 49 billion  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mattel 
For Mattel  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  850  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Mattel will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Mattel would post earnings of  0 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 26  delivering a surprise of  225  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Mattel appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mattel-mat-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200505384,200505384

159905,381421,MAT,Will Mattel  MAT  Report Negative Earnings Next Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This toy maker is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 56 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 7  
Revenues are expected to be  636 73 million  down 10 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 41  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mattel 
For Mattel  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mattel will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Mattel would post a loss of  0 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 04  delivering a surprise of  136 36  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Mattel doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-mattel-mat-report-negative-earnings-next-week-what-you-should-know-200408336,200408336

159982,381498,MAT,Mattel  MAT  May Report Negative Earnings  Know The Trend Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This toy maker is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  84 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 42 billion  down 12  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 72  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mattel 
For Mattel  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  67 65  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mattel will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Mattel would post earnings of  0 16 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 18  delivering a surprise of  12 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Mattel doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mattel-mat-may-report-negative-earnings-know-the-trend-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200381937,200381937

What s Next for Mattel 
While Mattel has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Mattel was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

160135,381651,MAT,Mattel Inc Shares Down Big On Poor Earnings And Outlook,opinion,"Mattel  Inc   NASDAQ  NASDAQ MAT 



One of the most famous American companies that manufactures toys for children  established in 1945 in El Segundo  California  reported their fiscal quarterly earnings on Thursday October 26th  2017 after the market closed for trading 

The name is so highly recognized that even children perceivably as young as three or four probably know that Mattel makes at least one of their toys  However  things are not looking great at the company as a result of a few variables 

One of these variables is that Toys R Us filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection which will be a challenging feat for Mattel to deal with  Obviously Mattel cells the mother load of their products through that multinational corporation 

Another was that worldwide sales were reportedly down about 13  this quarter  That is an astronomical decent in sales for the company  And thirdly  the company had to suspend their quarterly dividend which was  0 60 per share which equated to 3 88  per year 

Shares closed the regular trading session at  15 37 which was only down  0 08 on the day  However  in the aftermarket session shares closed down  2 99 which is 19 45  closing at  12 38 

Earning Numbers

The company reported Losing   603 million dollars  Earnings were just  0 09 per share  the average earnings estimate was   56 cents per share this takes into account adjustments for one time expenses and non recurring costs   Revenues were  1 56 billion  falling short of the  1 84 billion analysts were anticipating 

Company Comments

Margo Georgiadis  CEO of Mattel to investors 


 Our Q3 performance was clearly disappointing  led by compression in North America driven by Toys  R  Us filing for bankruptcy  tighter retailer inventory management and challenges with certain underperforming brands  despite these challenges  we are making strong progress against our transformation plan  which we believe will deliver step change revenue growth and profitability  To accelerate progress toward these goals  with our new leadership team in place  we are taking bold steps to simplify our business and right size our cost structure in alignment with our strategy  This will enable us to move faster to realize our most attractive opportunities as well as to unlock significant resources to invest in our transformation  We are optimistic about the future of Mattel and our ability to reposition the company to drive enhanced returns for shareholders

Why 

Those of you who have been paying attention to my daily updates surely know    
Politicians  investors  and even major financial institutions no longer control the  free market  
These days  the markets are controlled by the central banks  The Bank of England signaled last Thursday that they are likely to raise their interest rates within the next few months and the pound sterling has been flying ever since 
Tomorrow  we ll hear from the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States  the single biggest player in the financial markets of this decade and possibly the biggest player in any financial market in the history of the world 
The US dollar has lost more than 10  of its value against other major currencies since the beginning of the year and has lost 400  of its value against Bitcoin in the same timeframe 
On the one hand  the weak US dollar is part of Donald Trump s strategy to make America great again  On the other hand  the value has fallen so much lately that it threatens to undermine the stability of the global economy 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen is going to need to walk a very fine line tomorrow if she wants to be renominated in February  However  some unique players know when to sacrifice their role for the good of the team  Is Yellen one of them

160190,381706,MAT,INTERVIEW European toy industry seen bucking economic downturn,news,"  Toy industry chief sees 1 2 percent sales growth in 2008
   Positive Christmas sales despite fears of recession
   Increased costs in China boost manufacturing in Europe
   No repeat of 2007 safety recalls before Christmas
 
 By Darren Ennis
 BRUSSELS  Nov 4  Reuters    Europe s toymakers are likely to
buck the economic downturn in 2008 and the spread of the credit
crunch into the real economy should not hit sales over the
lucrative Christmas period  a top industry official said 
  Toys are relatively recession proof     I would be very
disappointed if we did not see 1 or 2 percent growth despite the
recession   said Bryan Ellis  chairman of Toy Industries Europe 
referring to expectations for sales in 2008 
 Investors and analysts feared the impact of the worst
financial crisis in 80 years on shoppers during the key holiday
season may hit pivotal fourth quarter sales for the world s
biggest toymakers  which can account for up to 40 percent of
annual revenue for retailers 
  Typically if you look at history  the toy industry has
weathered the recessions and financial pressures very well in
the past   Ellis  who represents firms such as Mattel Inc 
Hasbro and Hornby  told Reuters in an interview 
 Mattel  home to Barbie and Elmo  and Hasbro  maker of the
Monopoly game  both posted disappointing third quarter results
and Mattel s chief executive  Bob Eckert  has said his company
is facing the worst economic crisis of his generation 
 
 LACK OF LIQUIDITY
 But Ellis backed Hasbro chief executive Brian Goldner s view
that  Christmas will come for consumers and retailers this
year  
  They  toys  are a less expensive present solution 
particularly if you look at children s Christmas lists with
computers and fashion clothing etc  which tend to be very
expensive  You can get a lot of toys for 100 euros   Ellis said 
  So  as long as we get the credit situation sorted out and
the industry gets paid  consumers will go on buying toys at the
same quantities as previous years and the industry will do
well   
 Ellis acknowledged a lack of liquidity was putting pressure
on toymakers  notably small and medium size  SME  producers that
were finding it difficult to obtain credit from banks bruised by
the fallout of the financial crisis 
  Credit is tough for SMEs  People are having cashflow
problems  worrying about retail customers  having problems
getting credit insurance and banks are being very tough on
overdrafts   Ellis said  
  The EU s 4 billion euro   5 1 billion  SME fund is the sort
of money that is very important to us and it needs to get into
the hands of our industry quickly at a key time when we maximise
production  make deliveries  but haven t been paid yet  
 
 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
 But Ellis said the impact of cost increases and problems
stemming from the financial crisis had boosted Europe s toy
manufacturing industry  which has suffered severely from a
deluge of cheap imports from Asia 
  It has had a very difficult time  especially with
competition from Asia  but we are actually bringing products
back to be made in Europe  such as Lego s new big factory in the
Czech Republic   Ellis said 
  The last thing you need in the current climate is eight 
and 10 week lead times out of China  You want manufacturing as
close to market as possible  I know for example in Hasbro they
try one to three weeks from southern Ireland  
 Ellis expects consumer confidence to be bolstered this
Christmas by a drop in safety recalls compared with 2007  when
over 20 million Chinese made toys were recalled worldwide over
excessive levels of lead paint and other unsafe components 
  Very cheap  unsafe and inadequately made toys are unlikely
to be shipped to Europe in the future  The fact you see 700
companies closed in China shows how tough the authorities have
got since last year   Ellis said

160195,381711,MAT,UPDATE 1 US judge to modify stay on MGA Bratz sales MGA CEO,news,"By Gina Keating
 LOS ANGELES  Dec 30  Reuters    MGA Entertainment Inc was
given an eleventh hour reprieve on Tuesday when a U S  judge
ruled it can continue selling its Bratz doll line through the
end of 2009  the company s CEO and attorney said 
 At a hearing on Tuesday  U S  District Judge Stephen Larson
 indicated he will be modifying his Dec  3 stay     to allow
purchases and sales  of Bratz items   beyond a previously set
deadline of Feb  11  MGA attorney Tom Nolan said 
 MGA had asked Larson to postpone his order barring the
company from selling products that infringe on Mattel Inc s
 copyrights for Bratz until MGA can appeal the ruling to
the Ninth U S  Circuit Court of Appeals 
 A Mattel representative had no immediate comment 
 MGA Chief Executive Isaac Larian described the ruling as  a
good day for MGA  its employees and Bratz  
 In an email  Larian said the company  will continue to
pursue our appeal rights and we are confident that at the end of
this bitter litigation  the rights to Bratz will stay with
MGA  
 MGA had claimed in court documents that it faced imminent
insolvency if the injunction was enforced in February  as
retailers canceled spring orders for Bratz merchandise 
 Larson s sweeping order requires MGA not only to stop making
and selling thousands of Bratz products and to destroy the
patterns for the items  but to recall unsold merchandise from
retailers 
 Nolan said Tuesday s ruling helped the company  avoid the
catastrophic effects of laying off 1 500 employees  as a result
of those potential cancellations 
 The judge denied as premature a request by MGA to delay
enforcing the injunction until the federal appeals court has
ruled 
 Larson indicated on Tuesday that he will work with the
parties to include language in the new order to allay retailers 
fears about the ongoing availability of Bratz products  Nolan
said 
 Larson also set a Jan  5 hearing to rule on whether he
should appoint a receiver to monitor MGA s financial dealings at
the request of Mattel 
 In a motion filed late on Monday  Mattel accused MGA of
failing to make timely financial disclosures  of funneling
 millions  of dollars to Larian s family members and of selling
Bratz merchandise through a company controlled by Larian 
  At minimum  the receiver should be authorized to
investigate and monitor any and all financial and business
matters involving Bratz and to report them to the court and to
Mattel   Mattel said in court documents 
 Larian called the accusations  baseless  and  mud throwing 
and said he was prepared to answer them at Monday s hearing

160196,381712,MAT,U S  judge keeps  100 mln Bratz ruling for Mattel,news,"CHICAGO  April 28  Reuters    A federal judge has refused
to reduce the  100 million award a jury granted to Mattel Inc
in the toymaker s lawsuit against MGA Entertainment over the
popular Bratz dolls 
 U S  District Judge Stephen Larson also barred MGA from
making or selling the dolls by lifting a stay on his previous
order  He also appointed a temporary receiver to oversee the
Bratz business in an order issued on Monday 
 Mattel  the world s largest toymaker  known for its iconic
Barbie doll  won the rights to the  1 billion plus Bratz
franchise last year in a lawsuit against MGA and former Mattel
Barbie designer Carter Bryant 
 Bryant invented the Bratz concept while under contract to
Mattel  A jury ruled that Bryant had secretly sold the concept
to MGA 
 MGA had argued that the jury s monetary award of  100
million to Mattel actually was comprised of duplicate awards
that should not be combined 
 Larson dismissed that theory of the jury s intentions as
 purely speculative  
  The jury s verdict of  100 million is well within the
range of possible awards based on the evidence of record  and
therefore the Court must leave it undisturbed   Larson wrote in
the ruling 
 Larson also ordered MGA to file a full accounting of all
profits that have resulted from all sales of Bratz products
covered by the lawsuit occurring after Aug  26  2008 
 Last week  MGA CEO Isaac Larian said his company had
proposed that Mattel pay MGA  way below  500 million  to settle
the legal battle and let Mattel have the whole Bratz line 
 That followed a comment by Mattel CEO Robert Eckert that he
had not seen anything that led him to believe that MGA wanted
to resolve the issue

160198,381714,MAT,UPDATE 2 MGA files emergency appeal in Bratz case,news,"  Asks court to stop asset transfer  overturn verdict
   MGA argues  08 jury verdict tainted by racial prejudice
  Adds details from petition  background  byline 
 By Gina Keating
 LOS ANGELES  May 26  Reuters    MGA Entertainment Inc asked
a U S  appeals court on Tuesday to stop the transfer of its
Bratz franchise to rival toymaker Mattel Inc and to overturn a
2008 jury verdict MGA contends was tainted by racial
discrimination against its Iranian born chief executive 
 In an emergency appeal filed late on Tuesday  MGA asks the
Ninth U S  Circuit Court of Appeals to nullify a wide ranging
injunction by U S  District Judge Stephen Larson that orders it
to stop selling its top selling brand at the end of the year 
 Larson also has ordered MGA to transfer to Mattel the Bratz
trademark as well as all related products  designs  customer
information and  know how  for a planned 2010 Bratz line 
MGA said the imminent transfer of its assets and trade
secrets to its rival will have  devastating and irreversible 
consequences if the appeals court does not intervene 
 The petition contends that Larson went beyond the jury s
intent in granting Mattel s last minute demand that Bratz be
removed from store shelves  and in the scope of that recall 
  The court also ordered perhaps the largest toy recall in
U S  history   the petition said   Come New Year s  MGA must
impound and or destroy all MGA Bratz products that remain on
retailers  shelves  
 The petition contends that Larson made  multiple stark
errors of law   including an overbroad interpretation of a jury
award of  10 million in damages related to the copyright
infringement despite Mattel s demand for  1 4 billion 
 The verdicts also were  tainted  by a juror who said during
deliberations that her attorney husband had told her Iranians
clients were  stubborn  rude     and have stolen other person s
 sic  ideas   the petition said 
 The juror was removed but Larson rejected MGA s petition
for a mistrial  and  mistakenly held that the constitution
protects only criminal  and not civil  defendants from racially
and ethnically biased jurors   the petition said 
 Jurors were told during the jury selection process that MGA
CEO Isaac Larian immigrated to the United States at 17 from
Iran and asked whether they would be able to be fair to someone
of Middle Eastern descent 
 MGA effectively lost rights to the Bratz franchise last
summer when the federal jury in Riverside  California ruled
that Barbie designer Carter Bryant was still under contract to
Mattel when he sold MGA some of the drawings upon which the
immensely popular multi ethnic doll line was based 
 The jurors found  however  that the infringement was not
willful

160229,381745,MAT,Mattel Inc  Stock Shares Fall On Poor Earnings Numbers,opinion,"Mattel  Inc   NASDAQ MAT 
Mattel  Inc  a global toy company yesterday reported their full year and fourth quarter 2016 financial results  Mattel reported net income of  173 8 million or  0 50 per share which was down from  215 2 million or  0 63 per share from the same period last year  Mattel reported adjusted earnings of  0 52 per share which fell short of analyst estimates of  0 71 per share  Mattel reported sales of  1 83 billion which fell short of analyst estimates of  1 96 billion 
Mattel  Inc  CEO s Comments
Chairman and CEO of Mattel  Christopher Sinclair said 

Our results were negatively impacted by a number of industry wide challenges  including a significant U S  toy category slowdown in the holiday period  and increased forex headwinds  
And while our sales at retail remained strong  the slowdown triggered elevated retail promotional activity and decreased shipping  all of which had a significant impact on our gross margin  Even against this difficult backdrop  our core brands continued to show solid growth  and our performance in key emerging markets like China was equally strong  
And  importantly  we offset a substantial revenue gap from the loss of the Disney Princess license  Looking forward  we remain broadly optimistic about Mattel s performance in 2017 and beyond  Our core brands are strong and growing  we have a solid lineup of entertainment properties in the pipeline  and we are forging valuable relationships with key retail partners throughout the world  


MAT Technical Analysis


MAT opened trading yesterday at  31 23 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  31 19  Shares closed trading yesterday at  31 56 and crashed down after market to  28 33  equivalent to a 10  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time MAT traded below these levels we have to go back to December 30th  2016 when it traded at  27 55 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart  we can see that before the spike down  MAT had been rebounding off of the lows reached at the end of December  MAT has a float of 341 13 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Wednesday  For trading purposes  I would like to see MAT open trading on Thursday below  29 40 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 25 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

160314,381830,MAT,4 Stocks To Watch  MAT  NK  PACB  SCTY,opinion,"It was a very interesting day on Monday  with a downside follow through  and then it curled up and ran up the rest of the session  and closed not far from the session highs  It was a good day price wise  but not a good day technically  The technicals could not keep pace  and that could be bearish  We ll just have to wait to see what happens and whether there is any up side follow through on Tuesday  Let s take a look at some of the stocks that acted well today 
Mattel  Inc   O MAT  popped out across multiple tops late on Friday  and then on Monday it followed through  up 82 cents to 27 07  or 3   on 14 million shares  It didn t close great  but that could have been from the lateral resistance from the June high  The swing we put on it has been working  If it gets through 27 07  the targets are 28 95  30 50  and then 32 00 
NantKwest  Inc   O NK   which has a swing trade on it that is taking a little longer  hasn t broken down  but if it still holds at 14  that s still good  On Monday  it popped out of a mini wedge  and jumped 1 16 to 16 22  or 7 7   on 650 000 shares traded  With 6 4 days to cover it could very well get a run to 18 19  and maybe eventually up towards 23 and 25 
Pacific Biosciences of California  Inc   O PACB  looks like it can go again  but it s going to take a little longer  The flag that formed has a beautiful set up  The OBV is moving up nicely  MoneyStream  Balance of Power is holding up well  It s four waves up  and looks like a fifth wave is coming  which could last a week or two weeks more  It was up 32 cents to 10 00  or 3 3   on 856 107 shares traded on Monday  Targets are 12  13  maybe even higher eventually 
SolarCity Corporation  O SCTY  had another good move on Monday  up 4 55 to 41 59  or 12 3   on 3 6 million shares  After coming out of the little wedge it formed  it could follow through and run up to 50 00 short term  Secondary target is 55  It has 5 7 days to cover

Fabrinet  N FN  took off on Tuesday  exploding 2 93 to 28 02  or 12   on 2 9 million shares  I almost put a swing on this stock  It broke out on Friday to 24 3 4  and reached up to 29 1 2 on Tuesday with a breakaway gap and beautiful top  It didn t close at the high for the day  but that was the biggest volume this stock has ever had  This kind of move often leads to high levels  Look for a target around 33 1 2  It has 2 66 days to cover 
Michael Kors Holdings Limited  N KORS  had another good day today  up 2 93 to 28 02  or 12   on 2 3 million shares  This stock was on the Boxer Short List for a long time  going from the 100s down to the mid 30s  As of late  it has been acting like it formed at the base  and then it broke down  It snapped back and had a nice breakaway gap  That breakaway gap  and that kind of surge  should lead to higher levels  The near term target is 53  and see if it gets an extension in the next day or two 
Mattel  Inc   O MAT   one of our swing trades  had a wonderful day on Tuesday on earnings and exploded 3 70 to 28 36  or 13 8   on 28 6 million shares  It did get to my swing pick trade  The next target is at 30  With the surge and that kind of volume  this stock could get to 31 2  If it does it could be ready for a pullback  If it thrust further it could get up to the mid 30s  It has 10 64 days to cover

160386,381902,MAT,This Well Known Mid Cap Stock Raises Dividends Like Clockwork,opinion, Safe  and  mid cap  probably aren t words investors use together very often  since mid cap stocks are generally riskier than the stock market as a whole  For instance  if you invested in iShares S P MidCap 400 Index  NYSE  IJH   an exchange traded fund  ETF  that tracks the S P 400 index of medium size U S  companies  then you could expect the fund to be about 20  more volatile than the stock market as a whole    You d be doing yourself a disservice  though  if you simply wrote off all mid cap stocks as being more risky  because not all of them are  One of my favorites  a well known toy company that was founded in 1945 and is most famous for making Barbie fashion dolls  is actually 14  LESS volatile than the market    I m referring to the world s largest toy manufacturer  Mattel Inc   Nasdaq  MAT   which also sells toys under successful brands like Fisher Price  Hot Wheels  Tyco and Match Box  The company had overall revenue of  6 3 billion in 2011  and analysts see it rising by a solid 5  in 2012 to more than  6 6 billion    Since a healthy dividend is one of the main things that can dampen a stock s volatility  consider Mattel s payout  The stock has a world class dividend of  1 24 a share  which is good for a yield of about 4  based on the current share prices  So if you held  10 000 worth of Mattel  or around 300 shares  your annual payout would be  372    not a bad reward at all for simply holding a stock    What s more  Mattel s payout has a history of steady growth  rising by 11 5  a year for the past five years and by 8 5  a year for the past decade  The latest increase occurred on Jan  31 of this year  when the company declared a quarterly dividend of  0 31 per share  a 35  gain from the  0 23 a share paid in each of the prior four quarters  Going forward  analysts project annual dividend growth will match the average rate of 8 5  during the past 10 years  meaning shareholders could see their payouts rise to around  1 85 a share by 2016  A couple factors make this feasible  one being ample free cash flow  At the end of 2011  this figure stood at  474 million  a 21  gain from  391 million during the prior year  In the first quarter of 2012  Mattel reported  174 million of free cash flow  suggesting it could finish the year with almost  700 million   174 million X 4 quarters  for a potential gain of 47  from 2011  And this estimate could be conservative because the first quarter is typically the slowest for Mattel  as it can be for many retailers the first few months after the holidays    The other reason I think Mattel can keep raising dividends  It s a strong bet to keep growing profits  The company has been doing a very solid job of this  increasing the bottom line by 7  annually for the past decade  I think it s likely to maintain that growth rate because of its willingness to pursue new opportunities in emerging markets  where middle class populations with disposable income are on the rise  Otherwise  the company would be in a losing battle to wring all it can out of the United States and western European markets  which are poised for slower economic expansion in the long term    Currently  about half of Mattel s revenue comes from overseas  Of this portion  there s about a 50 50 split between Europe and emerging markets  mainly Latin America and the Asia Pacific region   In the long term  analysts project sales will only rise by about 2  a year in the United States and Europe  but by double digits in emerging markets  especially Latin America and the Asia Pacific region  where the annual growth rate is about 13     Globally  sales should be enhanced by the October 24  2011 purchase of HIT Entertainment for  680 million  The acquisition  which adds the popular brands Thomas   Friends  Barney and Bob the Builder to Mattel s lineup  is expected to increase annual sales by  180 million  It should also become profitable very quickly  probably by 2013  according to analysts    Risks to Consider  Although Mattel s overseas operations help to hedge against fluctuations in the domestic economy  they also expose the company to foreign currency risk  If exchange rates become unfavorable in a key region  then it could hurt the company s bottom line   This risk will increase as the proportion of overseas revenue progressively increases    Be aware that not all mid cap stocks are riskier than the market  even though as a group they re typically more volatile  Indeed  plenty of mid caps behave more like safe  reliable blue chips  and Mattel is one of them  If you re a more conservative income oriented investor  consider investing in Mattel for the top notch dividend and lower share price volatility  Although shares are up 17  year to date  they re still about 7  below the one year high  so now is a fine time to buy    by Tim

forecasting graph below  the stock appears in value  it s inside of the value corridor of the five orange lines   based on future growth  Mattel  Inc   Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal P E Since 2001Performance Table Mattel  Inc The associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 7 8  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of Mattel  Inc   assuming an initial investment of  1 000  would have received an additional  486 82 in dividends  blue highlighting  that increased their total return from 7 8  to 9 4  per annum versus 1 8  in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historical P E ratio  the dark blue line  in conjunction with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2001 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current P S ratio relative to its historical P S ratio  The current P S ratio for Mattel  Inc  is 1 90 which is historically high  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate

of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Mattel  Inc  to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Mattel  Inc  s expected earnings would be 6 3  purple circle  times that of the 10 year T bond interest

160388,381904,MAT,Mattel  Newest Dividend Yield Passive Income Portfolio Holding,opinion,Last Friday I put Mattel  MAT  shares into the dividend yield passive income portfolio  DYPI   I bought 40 shares of the toymaker who generates 67 72 percent of net sales in Americans countries Mattel has a market capitalization of 12 50 billion and is the dominating and leading company within the toys and games industry  Mattel designs  manufactures  and markets various toy products  Its products comprise fashion dolls and accessories  vehicles and play sets  and games and puzzles The current P E ratio of the company is 15 12 and the expected price to earnings ratio amounts to 13 11  The dividend yield has a value of 3 4   This met my criteria of yield and fair price  The company is also growing  Earnings are expected to grow by 17 42  this year  9 88  next year and finally 9 05  for the next five years Mattel is the little bit higher valuated than rival Hasbro but Mattel has lower debt ratios than the second biggest industry player Hasbro  So I think both valuations are not far away The 40 shares will give us an additional dividend income of 50 bucks per year  The full stake costs  1 458 which represents now around 1 5 percent of the full DYPI Portfolio The current portfolio yield is 3 52 percent  As of now I invested  20 440 into stocks within the recent four month or so  The average yield of the portfolio is at 3 59  Since I funded the portfolio virtually with 100 000  the whole net worth is up 1 83  since October 2012  This is an underperformance against the broad market but as I told earlier  it could happen because I buy slowly stocks and if the market goes sharply up I will loose performance I don t care about current market sentiments  In situations of highly valuated markets my strategy could fail in the short run  Not enough  I make stock picking in order to avoid expensive stock buys I try to put every Friday one company into the DYPI Portfolio  As of now I have around  80 300 of free cash for additional stock acquisitions  I plan to close the DYPI Portfolio by the end of the year 2013 with around 50 70 stock holdings  The estimated dividend income should be around  3 000    4 000  This should be realistic in my opinion The strategy is not to make fast money or to get quick rich  If you like to make fast money by stock trading you should read other blogs  maybe something about options  derivatives or penny stocks Trading of dividend stocks will not make you soon rich   I have not even reached  But I found out that it is possible to realize a double digit return over a long period of time  Over the recent 10 years I have achieved this performance for my own real trading accounts  Read more in my  A 8  return would double your net worth in around 10 years  3  or more could be generated by dividends alone  That s called the dividend yield ratio  My real accounts have a current yield of around 3   That s not high but I have real problems to find high quality stocks that are fairly priced  If you know some  please let me know  I ever look for great investment opportunities and share my ideas with all my readers on the internet Not Enough  I have yields on cost of 5  7   When I bought the stocks they paid only 3  in dividends but my target investments increased the dividends payments very soon over the upcoming years and now I have a yearly return which is twice as high the amount when I bought the stock Do you own Mattel shares  What do you think about the company  Would you buy them now  Please let me know and leave a comment in the box below ,2013-01-07,Dividend Yield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mattel:-newest-dividend-yield-passive-income-portfolio-holding-149824,149824
