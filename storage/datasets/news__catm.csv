9909,231424,CATM,U S  activist investors post strong gains as needling companies pays off,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Activist investors who are shaking up Corporate America with calls for operational fixes  refreshed boards and even sales of a company are delivering their best returns in six years with double digit gains for 2019 after big losses in 2018 
The surge in returns is energizing experienced corporate agitators as well as newcomers and may force more companies into costly battles with shareholders over their corporate future next year  managers  lawyers and bankers said 
Through the end of November  activist managers on average returned 13 09   according to data from Hedge Fund Research  which tracks various investment strategies  returns  Fueled by high double digit returns at funds run by William Ackman  Barry Rosenstein and Glenn Welling among others  activists are handily outperforming all other types of hedge funds where the average fund returned 8 5  this year  HFR data shows 
The gains illustrate a sharp recovery from 2018 when the average activist lost 10 4   in part because a late year stock market tumble erased gains at many funds 
Hedge funds run by activist investors are traditionally reserved for institutional investors and wealthy private clients 
To be sure  activists are benefiting from this year s strong stock market gains where the Standard   Poor s 500 index  SPX  has climbed 28 5  so far  But many added spice with demands for changes or by watching earlier prodding pay off 
 Many of the initiatives that were advocated for by our managers resulted in improved performance   said Gregg Hymowitz  chief executive officer of EnTrust Global  a large investor with activist managers 
Through the middle of December  Ackman s Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Holdings portfolio gained 57   lifted by investments including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc   N CMG   where Ackman helped install a new chief executive officer last year 
Douglas Braunstein s Hudson Executive Capital gained 52  through the end of November  fueled by gains at  Cardtronics  Plc  O CATM  which gave Braunstein a board seat last year 
Some investors returned with fresh demands directed at companies they had previously targeted  Glenn Welling s Engaged Capital  which is up 30  through November  came back to nutrition and weight loss company Medifast Inc  N MED  while Jana Partners took a second run at restaurant chain Bloomin  Brands Inc  O BLMN   which may consider selling itself  Corvex Management is up nearly 20  through the end of November  months after its founder  Keith Meister  joined the board of MGM Resorts International  N MGM  
Representatives of the funds declined to comment 
In the United States alone  activists targeted 464 companies this year through mid December  roughly the same number as last year  data from Activist Insight shows 
Next year  activists may perform even better  investors and managers said  noting there are plenty of inefficiencies to repair at smaller companies 
While fresh money many not chase this year s strong returns as investors worry that a recession will hit at some point  investors said they are willing to fund specific campaigns in so called special purpose vehicles 
 Activists are value investors  which are starting to become more in favor   said Ken Squire  who runs 13D Monitor and the 13D Activist Fund   Over the past 15 years  activists went from being frowned upon to being accepted and now respected  ",2019-12-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-activist-investors-post-strong-gains-as-needling-companies-pays-off-2047682,2047682

analytics decision by using advanced technologies to collect and interpret different types of data sets is impressive  The company mainly uses advanced technologies such as latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies along with cloud computing to serve customers in areas of rating  underwriting  claims  catastrophe and weather risk  natural resources intelligence and economic forecasting  Its efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying client demands and its technical prowess in analytics and Big Data provide Verisk an edge over its competitors Higher organic revenue growth through a combination of increase in new customers for existing solutions  cross sale of its existing solutions to existing customers and the sale of new solutions will help Verisk create long term value  In the first nine months of 2019  total revenues grew 7 1  on an organic constant currency basis  In 2018  total revenues grew 6 5  organically and 6 1  on an organic constant currency basis  This marks an improvement from 2017 when total revenues grew 4 5  organically and 5 3  on an organic constant currency basis  Notably  Verisk has recorded an average organic revenue growth of about 8  in the past 10 years Moreover  Verisk continues to earn the major portion of its revenues from subscriptions and long term agreements  In the first nine months of 2019  Verisk s three reportable segments  namely  Insurance  Energy and Specialized Markets  and Financial Services generated a respective 82   78  and 72  of revenues from subscriptions and long term agreements for its solutions Acquisitions have also been one of the key growth catalysts for Verisk  The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its business and geographic footprint  So far in 2019  Verisk has announced three acquisitions  In March  the company inked a deal with an enterprise application software provider to acquire the latter s Content as a Service business  This would strengthen the company s environmental health and safety services  and expand its global customer footprint and European operations  In August  Verisk inked a deal to buy out Genscape to expand its Wood Mackenzie business line s existing intelligence in energy data and analytics  and strengthen its research and consultancy across the natural resources sector  In October  the company signed a deal to acquire property condition and history data provider BuildFax to boost its Insurance segment  Apart from the aforementioned announcements  the company also acquired two companies in 2019   Keystone Aerial Surveys  Inc  in July to expand its aerial survey services  and Property Pres Wizard  LLC  in August RisksIn spite of significant growth prospects  Verisk is not free from headwinds  The company has a debt laden balance sheet  As of Sep 30  2019  long term debt was  2 67 billion while cash and cash equivalents were  311 8 million  High debt may limit the company s future expansion and worsen its risk profile  Also  escalating investments for software development to expand growth in organic businesses and recent acquisitions resulted in higher capital expenditures Since Verisk s business model centers on huge amount of data  it remains susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches at its facilities  computer networks  and databases  resulting in loss of its credibility and or customers  Dependence on external sources for data supply can lead to contractual and pricing issues with data suppliers  some of them are also its rivals  Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderCurrently  Verisk carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   Some better ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Global Payments   NYSE GPN

NYSE SEAS   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  This  Jinxed  Month  These Are Your 5 Best Stock BuysDespite the scares  September has somehow been positive for Wall Street  Despite the stock market having to bear with the protracted trade war and impeachment fears  the broader S P 500 eked out a gain of 1 7  But  October may be a different story  Needless to say  it has been a historically weak period for equities  what has been described as the  jinx month  for stocks  per the Stock Trader s Almanac  After all  some of the worst market crashes took place in the month  There were mega  crashes in 1929 and 1987  In fact  the great crash that occurred on Oct 19  1987  saw the Dow plunge 22 6  in a single day  which is arguably the worst one day decline  The other black days  of course  were  the 554 point drop on October 27  1997  back to back massacres in 1978 and 1979  Friday the 13th in 1989  and the meltdown in 2008   per the Almanac What s more  the Cboe Volatility Index or VIX tends to soar this month and had climbed more than 21 points on average over the past three decades  per Macro Risk Advisors However  the  October Effect  phenomenon does seem overrated  September has seen more declines than October  And from a historical perspective  October has seen the end of more bear markets than any other month  Thus  October is a month suitable for contrarian buying  At the same time  October has been relatively stronger during midterm election years  with 2018 being one such year According to Almanac  the Dow normally rises an average 0 6  in October and 3 1  in midterm election years  Similarly  the broader S P 500 usually climbs 3 3  in midterm Octobers  way more than its typical rise of 0 9  over the month To top it  even though October has typically  oscillated  between intra day gains and losses from 1938 to 2018  it had a tendency to finish the month on a promising note  data from Bespoke Investment Group showed Paul Hickey  founder of Bespoke  said that  while there has tended to be some weakness in the opening days of the month  from that point on  the S P 500 has seen steady gains finishing with an average gain of 1 89   And this time around  it should certainly not be any different  After all  things are looking up on the trade front  Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley recently said that the Trump administration isn t thinking of blocking Chinese companies from  listing shares on U S  stock exchanges at this time  A Bloomberg report had earlier stated that the White House was contemplating ways to curb U S  portfolio into China  a move that could affects billions worth of investments and aggravate the trade war  But  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro confirmed that the article was highly inaccurate  Such a confirmation is encouraging as otherwise the consequences for the stock market would have been far reaching given that Chinese stocks are currently worth more than  1 trillion 5 of the Best

10093,231608,CATM,5 Top Stocks To Buy On A Strong U S  Services Sector,opinion,On Sep 5  U S  markets rose sharply on fresh hopes that the country would return to the negotiating table with China  The two countries are involved in a long running trade dispute which has roiled China s economy and dealt severe damage to the U S  farming and manufacturing sectors So what s keeping the domestic economy afloat even as a trade deal remains elusive  While the U S  consumer remains confident  fresh economic data indicates that the service sector is prospering while the rest of the economy is grappling with the trade war  This is why it makes sense to invest in service sector stocks at this time ISM Services Index Surges in August In August  the Institute of Supply Management s services gauge rebounded from a three year low of 53 7  in July to hit 56 4  in August  Of the 17 industries that the ISM tracks  16 experienced expansion during the month  An executive being interviewed for the survey went so far as to say that the  summer doldrums appear to be over  Incidentally  any level above 50 is a good economic sign  And a reading above 55 is believed to be nothing short of exceptional  Both production and new orders notched up strong gains over the month  exceeding the 60  mark  This is a clear indication that demand remains resilient given the hope that sales will improve in the months to come Other Indicators Reflect Services  StrengthSeveral other major economic gauges also indicate that services are keeping the economy afloat even as the American industry grapples with the fallout of the trade war  The Fed s latest Beige Book survey reveals that as of August  non financial services were improving or staying steady through the United States Even as manufacturing and agriculture remain major worries for the economy  most business owners  remain optimistic about the near term outlook   And this sentiment prevails despite the fact that uncertainty over U S  China trade relations continues to roil investor sentiment almost on a daily basis Meanwhile  the latest ADP  NASDAQ ADP  report showed that private sector firms added the highest number of jobs in four months in August  Payrolls advanced by 195 000 following a downwardly revised increase of 142 000 in July  Service providers led job gains  adding 18400 positions in August Our ChoicesDespite long running trade war concerns  the U S  economy remains in a relatively good shape  This is largely attributable to the services sector  since manufacturing and agriculture are bearing the brunt of trade tensions This is why investing in service sector stocks remains a prudent choice  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has

10094,231609,CATM,Ignore Dismal Jobs Numbers With These 5 Great Services Picks,opinion,On Sep 6  investors received the most disappointing economic report released recently  Private sector job additions for the month of August came in well below expectations  leading to new questions about the sustainability of the ongoing economic expansion  Most job gains were attributable to a temporary jump caused by the hiring of census workers Job gains for the previous months were also revised lower  further accelerating the concerns surrounding the economy  And these fears persist  despite the fact that the growth rate lingers at nearly 2  despite hitting 3  only a year ago  Happily  the services sector remains untouched by recessionary fears  This is why it makes sense to invest in service sector stocks Jobs Report Disappoints  Unemployment SteadyIn August  the U S  economy added 130 000 jobs  well below the consensus estimate of 163 000  Even this level of job gains was largely attributable to the temporary recruitment of Census workers  as per data from the Department of Labor  But unemployment remained flat at 3 7   in line with expectations However  the U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and those only sporadically looking for jobs  increased marginally  from 7  in July to 7 2   This was primarily due to an increase of 397 000 in the number of individuals working part time due to economic reasons Business Services Leads Jobs GainsDespite the disappointingly low number of job additions  wage growth remained steady  providing some respite to beleaguered investors  Average hourly earnings increased 0 4  during August  The metric also notched up a year over year gain of 3 2   Moreover  both these figures exceeded expectations Additionally  labor force participation increased to 63 2   matching the highest level recorded since August 2013  The separately conducted household survey revealed that the total number of employed Americans increased by 590 000 to touch the unprecedented level of 157 9 million Once again  professional and business services led the pack with job gains of 37 000  The federal government came in second  after adding 28 000 workers to the 2020 population census  The healthcare sector added 24 000 jobs while financial services contributed 15 000 additional positions  However  retail trade experienced a loss of more than 11 000 positions Our ChoicesAugust s jobs numbers have added to the worries about the ongoing economic expansion  However  the report is also a reminder of the resilience of the services sector  which is powering economic growth at a time when the manufacturing and farming sectors are fighting a bruising trade war This is why investing in service sector stocks remains a prudent choice  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted

10146,231661,CATM,Why Should You Retain Euronet  EEFT  In Your Portfolio Now  ,opinion,Euronet Worldwide  Inc    NASDAQ EEFT   is well poised for growth on the back of solid segmental performances  strategic initiatives and a sturdy balance sheet Over the past 30 days  it has witnessed its 2019 and 2020 earnings estimates move north 0 9  and 1   respectively  This  in turn  reflects analysts  optimism on the stock The company boasts an encouraging earnings surprise history  having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters  the average being 0 27   This trend

4  year over year on the back of double digit contributions from all the segments  The company s revenues also shot up 4 9  from the prior year quarter Its top line improvement is consistently impressive to investors  evident from its 2013 2018 CAGR of 12 4   The upside can be attributable to solid segmental results and the company s diversity across products and geographies  In the first quarter of 2019  the stock s rally continued with the metric rising 4 9  year over year  attributable to strong contributions from EFT Processing Segment and Money Transfer segment  We expect the company s revenues to grow steadily because of its constant efforts to introduce products and services as well as penetrate new geographic locations Both its EFT and Money Transfer segments have been producing robust results over the past many quarters  The EFT segment has been contributing double digit growth to the company s portfolio on the back of its steady focus on deploying more devices

However  it has been witnessing rising operating expenses over the years  inducing margin contraction  This has also caused erosion of earnings per share  Its expenses might persistently escalate going ahead as the company consistently invests in technology and other expansion initiatives Its long term earnings growth rate is expected at 13 3   above the  s average of 9 4   which is a positive for the company The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings is pegged at  6 94  indicating an increase of 25 5  from the prior year reported number on 12 1  higher revenues of  2 84 billion

10154,231669,CATM,Should Value Investors Pick Cardtronics Plc  CATM  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cardtronics plc   NASDAQ CATM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cardtronics plc has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 0  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 16 6  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Cardtronics plc s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 14 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 25 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cardtronics plc has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 9 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cardtronics plc currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CATM a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cardtronics plc is just 1 1  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 3  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2 4  which is considerably better than the industry average of 14 1  Clearly  CATM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cardtronics plc might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F  This gives CATM a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimate has been encouraging  The full year 2019 has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the full year 2019 consensus estimate has inched up 0 9  in the past two months  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cardtronics PLC Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCardtronics plc is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a strong industry rank  top 38  out of more than 250 industries  and a top Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its

Investment Research Bet on 5 Stocks with Strong Earnings Beat PotentialTapping stocks that come up with solid earnings is a common practice  But instead of picking them post earnings  investing in those that are like to beat market expectations may increase your gains manifolds Why Is Positive Earnings Surprise So Important Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or just meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though it looks good apparently  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend  If that is the case  the company s fundamentals are in question There is also the factor of seasonal fluctuation  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are ambiguous while judging the company s true health Meanwhile  Wall Street analysts study companies  financials and initiatives to forecast earnings  They in fact club their insights and the company s guidance to arrive at an earnings estimate  So  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception  And if the company manages to surpass earnings by a wide margin  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release How to Find Those Gems Since it is hard to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check its earnings surprise history  A notable track record generally acts as a tailwind  It revs up chances of beating estimates in the next release too as investors expect the company to use the same old trick to surpass expectations  or is smart enough to pull off a beat in the next release And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas

Notably  Fidelity delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 5 7  
In the last reported quarter  the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 11 3   Results benefited from lower expenses and expansion of net interest margin  However  decline in revenues was a headwind 
Fidelity National Information Services  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Influence Q1 Results
Fidelity s revenue growth story for the first quarter is not expected to be impressive due to the stiff competition in the industry  Per the consensus estimate  revenues from Integrated Financial Solutions are expected to decline 5 6  to  1 07 billion along with fall in revenues from Global Financial Solutions of 13 3  to  883 million  Also  the overall revenues of  2 04 billion are projected to decline 9 6  from the prior year quarter 
The Florida based financial service provider s bottom line might benefit slightly from the lower tax rates and rising interest rate environment 
The company s focus on introducing new and innovative products in order to meet the growing demand of customers will likely increase expenses  as witnessed in the past

Manufacturing Clocks 99th Straight Month of Growth  4 Solid PicksEconomic activity in the non manufacturing sector expanded in April as the NMI measured by The Institute of Supply Management  ISM  touched 56 81   This was the 99th straight month of expansion with all 18 non manufacturing industries reporting growth  Any reading above 50 indicates that the said sector is expanding April NMI was lower than the consensus estimates of 58 1  and the March figure of 58 8   The slowdown was mainly due to trade war worries that made suppliers across the globe nervous  Trump s decision to postpone the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs has somewhat eased such concerns Business Activity  New Orders   Employment RiseThe ISM Business Activity Index registered growth of 59 1  in April  growing for the 105th consecutive month  All the 15 industries reported an increase in business activity for April driven by strength in overall business activity The index for New Orders jumped to 60  in the month  marking the 87th straight month of increase and that too at an accelerated rate compared with March  The surge was driven by large clients onboarding or existing clients adding new work Employment Index surged to 53 6   expanding for the 50th month on the trot  While the economy continued to create new jobs  a tight labor market compelled companies to pay higher to attract and retain employees The Service Sector Stands to GainThe long streak of expansion indicates that the broader economy is on track for steady growth this year  The non manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 90  of the economy  The business services sector is gaining strength because it is firmly tied to non manufacturing activities and the broader economy  Healthy economic growth leads to higher corporate

10251,231766,CATM,Is Cardtronics A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cardtronics Plc   NASDAQ CATM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cardtronics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 22  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 19  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Cardtronics s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having trended downwards over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Financial Transaction Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 45  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cardtronics has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 98  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cardtronics has a P S ratio of about 1 19  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cardtronics currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cardtronics a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Cardtronics might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives CATM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has two up in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 14 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 4 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cardtronics PLC Price and Consensus
     This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCardtronics is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a strong industry rank  among Top 41  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence on the stock In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run  value  and stocks under  10 portfolios  plus more ",2017-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-cardtronics-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200191966,200191966

PCM  Inc   NASDAQ PCMI  has a bear wedge  for sure  There doesn t look like much energy in this stock at this point  On Monday  it was down 10 cents to 20 15  on 73 857 shares traded  and it may take it down to 14 15  which is the target going forward

10254,231769,CATM,Implied Volatility Surging For Cardtronics  CATM  Stock Options ,opinion,Investors in Cardtronics plc   NASDAQ CATM   need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately  That is because the June 16th  2017  50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today What is Implied Volatility Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future  Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other  It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off  However  implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy What do the Analysts Think Clearly  options traders are pricing in a big move for Cardtronics shares  but what is the fundamental picture for the company  Currently  Cardtronics is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  in the Financial Transaction Services industry that ranks in the Top 8  of our Zacks Industry Rank  Over the last 60 days  no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter  while four analysts have revised their estimates downward  The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 76 cents per share to 65 cents in that period Given the way analysts feel about Cardtronics right now  this huge implied volatility could mean there s a trade developing  Often times  options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium  This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay  At expiration  the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected Looking to Trade Options  Each week  our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades  Check out his recent live analysis and options trade for the TSLA earnings report completely free  See it here   or check out the embedded video below for more details ,2017-06-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/implied-volatility-surging-for-cardtronics-(catm)-stock-options-200194868,200194868
10255,231770,CATM,4 Stocks To Watch  CORT  HIIQ  GKOS  XEC,opinion,"Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated  NASDAQ CORT  has a chart I like overall  and finally  after waiting for a while  it popped on Wednesday  and followed through on Thursday  jumping 82 cents  or 6   to 14 20  on 1 9 million shares traded  I think it s headed toward 16 and 18 
Health Insurance Innovations  Inc   NASDAQ HIIQ   a swing trade of ours  is doing great  The key for me was when it popped up  consolidated  and broke out again  The volume was high both times  Again  on Thursday  it popped out of a wedge and was up 2 60  or 10   to 29 60  with volume to nearly a million shares traded  I really think this is a 48 50 dollar stock short term 
Stocks on the Short Side     
Glaukos Corporation  NYSE GKOS  cracked and rolled over for a few days  and on Thursday  it really got slammed for 2 97  or 7 1 2   to 36 76  on 3 1 million shares traded  It didn t quite get to my target at 33 33 1 2  but pretty close  At this point  the bottom of the channel is at 32  and if it does get down there  that s a cover point 
Cimarex Energy Co   NYSE XEC   on our short list  after rolling over and forming a big bear flag  came down hard from 120 00 to near 90 00  formed a bear wedge  and on Thursday  it got slapped for 5 28  or 5   to 92 89  on 1 6 million shares traded  It looks like it might be headed to 82  and then eventually  maybe all the way down to 75

10256,231771,CATM,Is Cardtronics PLC  CATM  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cardtronics PLC   NASDAQ CATM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cardtronics has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 04  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 72  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cardtronics s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 93  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cardtronics has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 69  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cardtronics has a P S ratio of about 0 85  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 11 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CATM is at the lowest point of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cardtronics currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cardtronics a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cardtronics is just 0 75  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 71  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  CATM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cardtronics might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C  and a Momentum score of A  This gives CATM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward and one downward movement in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 2 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 35   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cardtronics PLC Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCardtronics is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover a strong industry rank  Top 26  out of more than 250 industries  bolsters its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than

10369,231884,CATM,4 Payment Stocks To Gain From Increasing Retail Sales,opinion,Payments  companies witnessed an increase in card processing via their network given the strong retails sales numbers reported recently The increase in retail sales holds potential for payments  companies as transactions are increasingly being made online  through mobiles and via cards  debit as well as credit   All these imply increased use of payment networks and cards  which complete the entire payment loop Strong Retail Sales and Consumer Confidence IndexOn Jun 14  the Department of Commerce reported that retail sales increased 0 5  in May  Although the metric lagged the consensus estimate of an increase of 0 7   it still indicates a fare number  Moreover  retail sales in April were revised to a gain of 0 3  from a loss of 0 2   marking an improvement of 0 5   Retail sales remained positive for the third straight month Also  consumer confidence index skyrocketed in May to 134 1  its highest level since November 2018  More importantly  the Expectations Index  which is a measure of the consumers  short term  for next six months  outlook for income  business and labor market conditions  surged to 106 6 from 102 7 in April  Strong consumer confidence data indicates that consumer spending is likely to witness robust growth in the coming months Increased Use of Cards and Other Payment ModesPer Statista  in 2018  online sales of physical goods amounted to  504 6 billion and are projected to surpass  735 billion in 2023  Apparel and accessories retail e commerce in the United States is projected to reach more than  138 7 billion in revenues by 2022 This increase in online and ecommerce sales should drive modes of payments other than cash  Nevertheless  new age payment methods are not confined to online and ecommerce sales  Owing to the ease and flexibility that these modern payments offer  shoppers are also using them to make payments while shopping in brick and mortar stores Among these payment modes  credit cards hold the prime position  Per Statista survey  in 2018  nearly 62  of online transactions were made by credit and other cards of which credit card was more favored  One of the factors favoring credit cards  is earning rewards upon its usage  However  the speed  ease and flexibility offered by electronic payment modes cannot be overlooked  Also  a mobile payment trend is being witnessed among the younger generation Payments Industry Set to ThriveThis clearly points to the fact that a shift to the electronic mode of payments will continue to catch up with demographic changes  Companies in this space have already sensed this and are continuously investing billions of dollars in their systems  procedures and networks The payments space is dynamic and requires the use of cutting edge technology  involving huge expenditure  by companies to provide superior  cost effective  secured service to customers  Opportunities for growth are aplenty in the industry  as cash is still a dominant mode of payment in many markets and geographies  These underpenetrated markets hold growth potential for established players with their robust payment networks

10379,231894,CATM,This  Jinx ed Month  These Are Your 5 Best Bets,opinion,Despite the scares  September has somehow been positive for Wall Street  Despite the stock market having to bear with the protracted trade war and impeachment fears  the broader S P 500 eked out a gain of 1 7  But  October may be a different story  Needless to say  it has been a historically weak period for equities  what has been described as the  jinx month  for stocks  per the Stock Trader s Almanac  After all  some of the worst market crashes took place in the month  There were mega  crashes in 1929 and 1987  In fact  the great crash that occurred on Oct 19  1987  saw the Dow plunge 22 6  in a single day  which is arguably the worst one day decline  The other black days  of course  were  the 554 point drop on October 27  1997  back to back massacres in 1978 and 1979  Friday the 13th in 1989  and the meltdown in 2008   per the Almanac What s more  the Cboe Volatility Index or VIX tends to soar this month and had climbed more than 21 points on average over the past three decades  per Macro Risk Advisors   Source  Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Finance However  the  October Effect  phenomenon does seem overrated  September has seen more declines than October  And from a historical perspective  October has seen the end of more bear markets than any other month  Thus  October is a month suitable for contrarian buying  At the same time  October has been relatively stronger during midterm election years  with 2018 being one such year According to Almanac  the Dow normally rises an average 0 6  in October and 3 1  in midterm election years  Similarly  the broader S P 500 usually climbs 3 3  in midterm Octobers  way more than its typical rise of 0 9  over the month To top it  even though October has typically  oscillated  between intra day gains and losses from 1938 to 2018  it had a tendency to finish the month on a promising note  data from Bespoke Investment Group showed Paul Hickey  founder of Bespoke  said that  while there has tended to be some weakness in the opening days of the month  from that point on  the S P 500 has seen steady gains finishing with an average gain of 1 89   And this time around  it should certainly not be any different  After all  things are looking up on the trade front  Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley recently said that the Trump administration isn t thinking of blocking Chinese companies from  listing shares on U S  stock exchanges at this time  A Bloomberg report had earlier stated that the White House was contemplating ways to curb U S  portfolio into China  a move that could affects billions worth of investments and aggravate the trade war  But  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro confirmed that the article was highly inaccurate  Such a confirmation is encouraging as otherwise the consequences for the stock market would have been far reaching given that Chinese stocks are currently worth more than  1 trillion 5 of the Best

10412,231927,CATM,Deal Or No Deal  The Case For Investing In US Stocks Looks Good,opinion,Volatility has crept back into the markets this December  thanks to the turbulent trade front  After President Trump said on Dec 3 that a trade deal with China is unlikely before the 2020 U S  elections  the broader market took a serious beating Trump said that he had  no deadline  when it comes to settling the lingering trade issues with China  Major bourses had earlier hit several record highs on hopes of a trade deal  at least by Dec 15  But  Trump s comments squashed all hopes But  a report that a phase one trade deal between is still in the works helped U S  stocks close higher on Dec 4  Bloomberg news  citing familiar sources  confirmed that a partial trade deal would be complete before the imposition of the 15  tariff on consumer goods from China on Dec 15 So  one thing is for sure that the U S  stock market movement is predominantly based on trade related news and rumors  But  the overall outperformance of the U S  stocks for quite some time has been no fluke  Lest we forget  the broader S P 500 has gained more than 20  so far this year and it s solely because of the fundamental strength of the U S  economy and the prospects of top U S  firms that outpace their global counterparts The pace of U S  economic expansion picked up in the third quarter  Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  the economy grew at an annualized rate of 2 1  in the three months ended Sep 30  more than the initial estimate of 1 9  and the 2  pace in the second quarter Some skeptics may argue that growth hasn t crossed the coveted 3  mark but is strong enough to drive the unemployment level down to an almost 50 year low  The housing market  in the meantime  has recovered well and at least half of U S  home values are above where they were before the sub prime crisis  What s more  U S  banks now have more capital base and are under tighter regulations that will prevent them from repeating the mistakes made during the crisis In contrast  if we look at other developed countries like Japan  despite several measures by the Bank of Japan  its economy has failed to return to their 1980s glory  In the Eurozone  big banks are pretty much struggling and Germany is facing layoffs in the auto industry  Several countries in Europe and even in Japan had issued bonds with negative interest rates  indicating how pessimistic investors in such countries are about their financial prospects And when it comes to emerging economies  it s certainly a hyped space  Most of the emerging economies are dependent on China  which itself has a non transparent market  Last but not the least  there are very few countries that can match the growth of the US technology and biotech sectors Thus  investors should ideally work their way around stock market gyrations triggered by trade issues   Investing in sound U S  companies that have solid growth narratives  banking on the fundamental economic strength  is one such way 5 Top US Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioWe have selected five U S  stocks that should make meaningful additions to your portfolio  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank
