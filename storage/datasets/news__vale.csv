14081,235596,VALE,StockBeat   Bayer s Remorse Deepens After Second Roundup Verdict,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    German chemicals group  Bayer AG   DE BAYGN  has more cause to regret its  63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto   NYSE MON  this morning  after a U S  jury found that its weedkiller Roundup was responsible for causing the cancer of plaintiff Edwin Hardeman  It s the second verdict against the company and worse is to come  as the current trial in California will now move on to assessing corporate liability 
Bayer is still arguing that the verdict is scientifically unfounded  but its arguments are falling on deaf ears as the market has wiped another 11  off the stock s value this morning  That move alone is around  7 billion  which is more than the  6 billion in direct costs that analysts see as likely from the Roundup cases  so there s an open question as to whether analysts have been too cautious or the market is overreacting 
Back in 2015  when management was streamlining the sprawling conglomerate  its shares were worth over twice as much  But the Monsanto acquisition  intended to make it the global leader in agrichemicals  has not only brought a whole bunch of legacy legal liabilities  it has also created a lack of focus that has hit operations at the rest of the group  Those problems will remain even if the direct costs of Roundup can be reasonably contained 
Aside from Bayer  markets are flat to lower  content to await the result of today s Federal Reserve meeting and tomorrow s EU summit before making any more major moves  Germany s Dax is down 0 8   while the FTSE 100 is unchanged and the benchmark Stoxx 600 is down 0 3  at 383 24

Investing com    Europe s stock markets were mostly lower by mid morning on Wednesday as fresh business surveys suggested the contraction in manufacturing deepened in July  a trend also borne out by more gloomy outlooks and disappointing earnings figures 
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0 3  at 390 52 by 4 55 AM ET  0855 GMT   while the U K  FTSE was down 0 9  and the German DAX was up 0 1   
The  flash  reading for IHS Markit s purchasing manager index for the Eurozone manufacturing sector fell to its lowest in six years  with the German index dropping to its lowest since 2009  dashing hopes for some stabilization  Evidence that the problem is a global one had come earlier  with declines in the comparable indexes for both Australia and Japan  The Richmond Federal Reserve s manufacturing survey on Tuesday  meanwhile  had also shown business conditions at their weakest in six years

14748,236263,VALE,Trump Revives Brazil  Argentina Steel Tariffs  Swipes at Fed,news," Bloomberg     Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars   Sign up here  
President Donald Trump is reinstating tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil  nations he criticized for cheapening their currencies to the detriment of U S  farmers  and again called on the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy 
Linking his trade agenda with his Fed criticism in an early morning tweet  he said the two South American countries  have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies  which is not good for our farmers  Therefore  effective immediately  I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel   Aluminum that is shipped into the U S  from those countries  
In a second Twitter post  he signaled that he wants the U S  central bank to do something about suppressed currencies  too 
 The Federal Reserve should likewise act so that countries  of which there are many  no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies  This makes it very hard for our manufactures   farmers to fairly export their goods  Lower Rates   Loosen   Fed  
Trump has long grumbled about the dollar s strength and urged the Fed to abandon decades of precedent and act to weaken the greenback    the U S  government s policy for which has traditionally been directed by the Treasury Department  That has prompted fears that the U S  could lead the world into an era of weaponized monetary policy 
While such a currency war hasn t happened yet  Monday s move marks the first time Trump has linked the imposition of tariffs explicitly to currency movements  As such  it signifies a potential new phase in his trade wars in which foreign exchange markets are the battleground 
Stocks Move
AK Steel Holding Corp   NYSE AKS  gained 5 1  at 6 45 a m  in New York  although volume remained light coming off the Thanksgiving holiday weekend  U S  Steel Corp   SA USSX34  rose 2 1   and   Steel Dynamics   Inc  NASDAQ STLD  was also indicated higher

In March 2018  Trump authorized a 25  tariff on steel imports and a 10  duty on aluminum    import barriers that heralded the start of his administration s hawkish push on trade    after a government report found that foreign shipments of the metals imperil national security interests 
He then directed U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to negotiate with countries seeking to turn their temporary tariff exemptions into permanent ones 
In August last year  he gave South Korea  Brazil and Argentina targeted relief from quotas imposed on inbound steel shipments to protect U S  producers  The move allowed buyers to request exemptions for imports from key suppliers

15748,237263,VALE,What to Watch for in Commodities in 2020,news," Bloomberg     It s time for some 2020 foresight in raw materials  After commodities posted a 10  advance last year  how will crude to coffee fare in the months to come  The first What to Watch of the new year presents an overview of what to expect and it s a mixed  complex picture that emerges  The list covers oil  gold  copper  iron ore  pork and more 
The year s first full week of trading will be dominated by the Mideast crisis after the American assassination of one of the Iran s most powerful generals  Crude and gold surged on Monday after President Donald Trump said he was prepared to strike Iran  in a disproportionate manner  if it hits any U S  target  RBC Capital Markets has warned of  a retaliatory spiral  
Challenging Times
The complex number crunching and informed guesswork used to generate year to come predictions in the global oil market have been thrown into disarray by the sharp escalation of tensions between Washington and Tehran  Prior to the U S  killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani  investors were focused on whether continued efforts by OPEC and its allies to curb production would be sufficient to counter a global glut supported by rising U S  shale supply and new output from outside the cartel  including fields in Guyana 
With that in mind  analysts had been forecasting WTI at just below  59 a barrel  but on Monday the benchmark rallied above  70 as the two sides traded ever harsher rhetoric  Further gains will depend on developments this week  including potential risks to crude shipped via the Strait of Hormuz  Tensions between the U S and Iran disrupted oil markets last year but the episodes were short lived  the current standoff is of far greater magnitude 
Brighter Prospects
Copper struggled to sustain a rally in 2019 as the trade war spurred destocking of inventories by manufacturers  Now  the outlook is turning brighter with the preliminary truce between Washington and Beijing easing demand concerns for the metal used in everything from automobiles to electronics  Potential output cuts by Chinese smelters also point to tighter supply at a time when stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange are at the lowest in nine months 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS     Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   and  Standard Chartered   LON STAN  Plc are all bullish on copper as they predict a rebound in global consumption  Citigroup forecasts China s demand will expand 2 6  this year  underpinned by gains in grid investment  While prices fell on Friday as the Mideast tensions hurt appetite for risk  they remain above  6 000 a ton 
Golden Promise
Gold just delivered a stellar year for bulls as the Federal Reserve cut rates  trade tensions hurt growth  central banks beefed up reserves and ETF holdings swelled  The haven s upward march may not be quite done  Goldman Sachs Group Inc  Citigroup Inc and UBS Group AG have all said they re looking for  1 600 an ounce  and RBC Capital Markets is positive too  And those calls were made before the Iranian crisis sent bullion tearing higher 
On top of the Mideast tensions  additional underlying positivity toward bullion comes as the Fed signals that rates will almost certainly be on hold right throughout this year  at least until central bank officials have seen a  material reassessment  in their outlook  Among other precious metals  palladium also demands attention as a persistent global deficit looks set to fuel gains far beyond  2 000 an ounce 
A Strong Brew
Bulls in arabica coffee  coming off its best year in five  will be watching developments in Brazil  the top producer and exporter  After 2019 s harvest was marred by irregular weather and poor quality  the country s green bean stockpiles are set to drop to the lowest in more than five decades  and any signs of more production issues may exacerbate the tight supply scenario 
In addition to a forecast world deficit in 2019 2020 technical indicators are strong  with the beans favored by   Starbucks Corp     NASDAQ SBUX  moving above 50  100  and 200 day moving averages  While traders will be looking for signs of increased output  many growers are still under financial distress  and that may limit resumption of farm investments  Meantime  a further depreciation in the Brazilian real could raise prospects for increased supplies in the years to come 
Headed South
After a tumultuous year  iron ore is expected to slide in 2020  The steelmaking material capped the biggest annual gain in three years in 2019 on a shortage triggered by a dam disaster at Brazil s Vale SA  NYSE VALE   Prices  which hit as much as  120 a ton in July  ended the year near  90  while shares of miners such as BHP Group  LON BHPB  rose    Fortescue Metals   Group Ltd s  ASX FMG  stock more than doubled 
As seaborne supply expands this year from Brazil and Australia the deficit is seen closing  and there s a chorus of forecasts for prices to weaken  Top producer Australia sees iron ore averaging  63 a ton  and the material is Morgan Stanley s least favored commodity  In China  steel demand is expected to fall as economic growth slows  hurting iron ore consumption 
Running a Fever
Unprecedented outbreaks of African swine fever upended the pork trade in 2019  and whether the spread continues will be a key driver for meat markets going forward  The fallout lifted global meat prices to a five year high and sent pork exports from Europe and elsewhere surging  China s hog population    the world s largest    has collapsed  and traders will be eyeing whether a recovery in herds comes as quickly as some government officials have pledged 
Outside of Asia  the market will focus on whether the disease strikes any major pork shippers  risking further trade disruption  The virus has moved nearer to Poland s border with Germany  a key European producer  and officials are stockpiling fences and training boar sniffing dogs in a bid to ward off the threat  It also remains to be seen by how much China will boost purchases of U S  pork after the nations reached an initial trade agreement 
All Change 
Climate change and how governments  companies and funds respond will shape investment decisions in 2020 as never before  This year  the amount of new wind and solar power generation capacity will cross the 200 gigawatt threshold  boosting the total to about 1 450 gigawatts  BloombergNEF says  To put that in perspective  that s just shy of 20  of global installed capacity 
That shift will see renewables close the gap with natural gas as the biggest potential source of electricity behind coal  though their intermittent nature will leave them lagging behind in terms of actual output  The variability will also increase challenges for grids and traditional utilities to keep all the lights on  while pressuring wholesale power prices on gusty or bright days 
Palm Reading
Palm oil was one of the big winners among commodities in the second half of 2019  and there are signals prices will remain well supported  The most used vegetable oil ended the year with a 44  gain  the best showing in a decade  lifted by concerns dry weather and haze will curb supplies from top growers Indonesia and Malaysia  as well as prospects for strong biofuel demand 
The latest Bloomberg survey showed prices may average 2 400 ringgit   587  a ton this quarter  compared with 2 248 ringgit over all of 2019  Participants flagged Indonesia as a key factor  with Southeast Asia s top economy boosting palm s share in its biofuel blend to 30  from 20   Still  questions remain on export markets  especially the European Union s limit on palm oil use 
Bulls   Bears

Brucutu mine   its second largest iron ore operation in Brazil leading to recovery of 30 Metric tons per year  Mtpy  of production capacity  Further  with the partial resumption of dry processing at the Vargem Grande complex added about 12Mtpy  These initiatives have helped Vale in making substantial progress toward the 93 Mtpy of iron ore production capacity stopped in the first quarter  The company expects to recover 50 Mt of lost production by 2021 Revenues in fiscal 2019 will be lower owing to suspended operations  Vale anticipates incurring significant expenses as a result of assistance and remediation actions following the dam failure  Vale disbursed  608 million in the nine month period ended Sep 30  2018 and the current provisions totaled  4 769 billion  as of Sept 30  2019 Headwinds in Coal BusinessVale s coal operations remain challenged with lower productivity at the processing plants  thanks to a decrease in equipment availability  Consequently  the company reassessed its business strategy and implemented a new mining plan and maintenance program for plant recovery  The maintenance program could result in some short term pressure on volumes and consequently unit costs as major interventions in the processing plants will take place in the first half of 2020 Vale s  Value over Volume  Approach to Drive MarginsThe company is focusing on maintaining its   value over volume  approach for the iron ore business  Vale remains committed to delivering the highest possible margins by managing extensive supply chain and flexible product

operations  out of which  77 million are related to replacement projects  The company also continues to take several measures to increase safety standards in dams  management Long Term Outlook for Metals Remain StrongVale continues to benefit from high price premiums for high grade iron ore fines  The company remains committed to the goal of introducing more high quality ore in the market  The long term demand remains strong for higher grade ore from newer and bigger blast furnaces in China  and other emerging economies such as India and South East Asia The company is also focused on transforming its base metals business into a significant cash generator  Vale is focusing on nickel business through supply chain integration  operational excellence and digital transformation The long term outlook for nickel continues to be positive  Nickel in electric vehicle batteries will become an increasingly important source of demand growth  The company also has plans to develop a multi year copper expansion plan  with Salobo III being the first approved project in the pipeline  The long term outlook for copper is positive as demand is expected to grow  partly driven by electric vehicles and renewable energy and infrastructure investments  Meanwhile  future supply growth remains challenged given declining ore grades and the need for greenfield investment  which is likely to drive demand further Share Price PerformanceOver the past year  Vale s shares have gained 26 6  compared with the  s growth of 26 7  Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderVale currently carries a Zacks Rank

remains optimistic that the country s steel demand will climb a further 2  to reach 890 million metric tons in 2020 The Chinese steel industry seems to have held its ground last year despite the world s second largest economy coming under pressure from slowing domestic growth and the trade war  The Chinese economy advanced 6 1  in 2019   the slowest pace in 29 years but came within the government s target of 6 6 5   The International Monetary Fund predicts China s economy to grow by 6  in 2020  up from its previous projection of 5 8   following the tariff reductions included in the phase one trade deal with the United States The construction sector continued to support domestic demand for steel  Moreover  restrictions on production to curb pollution were not as tough as previously anticipated on the steel industry Steel demand from the construction and home appliance industries is expected to remain strong in 2020  However  automobile  ship building  container manufacturing and machinery sectors are anticipated to see negative growth in 2020 China  which makes about half of the world s steel  imports more than 70  of the world s seaborne iron ore  Data from the General Administration of Customs shows that China has imported 1 069 billion tons of iron ore in 2019  close to the 2017 record of 1 075 billion tons  In December  the country imported 101 3 million tons of the steel making ingredient   the highest monthly import level in 27 months These upbeat numbers provided a lift to iron ore prices  The price of the steel making commodity is currently trending at  96 5 per ton  clocking a gain of 4 89  so far this year and 29  in a year s time Iron ore prices had peaked to five year highs to  125 77 in July 2019  triggered by fears of supply disruptions  following the fatal disaster at Vale S A s   NYSE VALE   Brumadinho dam rupture at C rrego do Feij o mine in Brazil  However  it had since faded amid signs of recovery in Brazilian supply and concerns regarding the U S  China trade war  Iron ore prices are likely to remain above  90 a ton on fears of cyclone related disruptions in Western Australia and demand from China  In the long run  growth in world steel production spurred by urbanization will fuel the demand for iron ore and help sustain prices The Zacks  industry has gained 17 7  over the past three months  outperforming the S P 500 s

15794,237309,VALE,Should Value Investors Consider Vale  VALE  Stock Now  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Vale S A    NYSE VALE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Vale has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 51  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 09  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Vale s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 7 24 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 16  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Vale has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 18  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Vale has a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 19x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Vale currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Vale a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 52  which is far better than the industry average of 6 95  Clearly  VALE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Vale might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives VALE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen none up and four down in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 11 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined by 45 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below VALE S A  Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat dismal trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineVale is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 42  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Mining Iron industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2019-09-05,Zacks Investment

15796,237311,VALE,Vale s Q2 Iron Ore Production Drops 34  Due To Dam Disaster,opinion,Vale S A  s   NYSE VALE   second quarter 2019 iron ore production declined 33 8  on a year over year basis to 64 1 Mt while quarterly sales dropped 15 5  to 61 9 Mt  This can primarily be attributedto suspension of operations in the aftermath of the Brumadinho dam rupture and unusual weather related conditions in the Northern System in April and early May  However  the company noted that with resumption of full operations at Brucutu and recent pickup in shipments in the Northern System  it is well poised for the second half of the year  Vale maintained 2019 iron ore and pellets sales guidance at 307 332 Mt  Management also stated that its expected sales volume will move toward the midpoint of the range Following the Brumadinho dam rupture on Jan 25  2019  Vale suspended various operations  either voluntarily or as a result of revocation of licenses or court orders  The company anticipates the Brumadinho dam rupture to have impacted its iron ore annualized production by about 93 Mt  Earlier in June  Vale had announced that it will resume wet processing operations at Brucutu mine as the Superior Court of Justice overruled a previous court ruling  Notably  the previous ruling ordered the suspension of processing at the mine  Brucutu mine  which is Vale s second largest iron ore operation in Brazil  had been producing iron ore at one third of its total production capacity Vale has made substantial progress concerning the 93 Metric tons per year  Mtpy  of iron ore production capacity stopped in the first quarter  with the resumption of Brucutu operations thus recovering 30 Mtpy of production capacity  Regarding the remaining 60 Mt of lost production  Vale expects 30 Mtpy of dry processing production to be gradually resumed starting by the end of this year and the remaining 30 Mt  which includes wet processing  is estimated to return in about two to three years 2019 Guidance for Pellet Production   Nickel LoweredDuring second quarter 2019  Vale s pellet production totaled 9 1 Mt  which came in 29 3  lower than last year owing to the full stoppage of the Southern  NYSE SO  System pellet plants during the second quarter of 2019  abnormal rain in the Northern and Southeastern Systems  and maintenance carried out at the Tubarao plants  Due to these stoppages  Vale lowered pellets productions guidance for 2019 to 45 Mt  from the prior expectation of 60 Mt Iron ore and pellets sales amounted to 70 8 Mt in the reported quarter  down 18 2  on a year over year basis  The share of premium products on total sales was 86  in the second quarter Finished nickel production totaled 45 000 tons in the second quarter  down 32  year over year and nickel sales volumes were down 6 7  to 57 500 tons  Efforts were made to optimize supply chain opportunities and draw down regional inventories in line with demand  Owing to the lower production volumes in the second quarter of 2019 and On a Puma s stoppage  Vale revised 2019 nickel production guidance to 210 000 220 000 tons Copper production inched up 0 4  year over year to 98 300 tons in the quarter under review  Sales volumes of copper reached 95 000 tons in the second quarter  0 4  higher year over year  This improvement reflects higher production volumes and commercial initiatives to reduce inventories Cobalt production reached 1 032 tons in the April June period  20 7  lower than the prior year quarter weighed down by lower production from Voisey s Bay and VNC source ore In the second quarter  manganese ore production totaled 318 000 tons  24 5  lower than the prior year quarter owing to a lower production rate at the Urucum mine in order to carry out improvements and safety maintenance  Manganese ore sales volumes were 92 000 tons  61 5  lower year over year  primarily due to lower production and abnormal rains at the Ponta da Madeira port which in turn affected shipments In second quarter 2019  coal production totaled 2 4 Mt and coal sales came in at 2 1 Mt  down 17 5  and 16 6   respectively  from the year ago quarter  Due to current challenges at the processing plants and production in the first half  Vale revises 2019 coal production guidance to about 10 Mt  Vale will reassess its mining plan in the near future  which will probably impact its reserves  Coming to the price

15799,237314,VALE,Opening Bell  U S  Futures Fall As Europe s Growth Warnings Darken Trade Hopes,opinion,"Europe s corporate warnings and low German consumer sentiment send U S  futures lower
Growing prospects of no deal Brexit push pound towards 1985 levels
Oil climbs on lower rates  weaker dollar outlook


Key Events
Futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 were dragged down by a earnings led selloff in Europe this morning  as the market held its breath for a new round of U S  China trade talks kicking off in Shanghai today 

SPX contracts finally caved to the broader downward trend  after initially enduring in positive territory  Technically  they are headed to a top on the hourly chart  after Dow futures already topped out 
The STOXX 600 dropped  erasing two days of gains  after a pessimistic outlook from German heavyweight Bayer  DE BAYGN  mainly due to trade disputes  pushing its stock 4 4  down  and Lufthansa  DE LHAG  fell over 6  to the lowest in two and a half years  as rising fuel costs and price competition with lower cost companies on short flights painted a bleak future for the airline 
Weak earnings from these German bellwethers corroborated a weak Gfk survey  revealing that consumer sentiment in the Western European country fell for the third straight month  reminding investors trade headwinds are still threatening the world s economies with a looming slowdown 

The euro held onto gains after rebounding from the lowest level since May 2017 after a continuation H S pattern  below the 200 DMA  added pressure to the single currency 

The pound also pared losses that had thrown it to the lowest level since January 2016  post Brexit vote bottom  which in turn had set it only a few inches away from the lowest price since 1985  The British currency now hovers at the lowest level since March 2017 as newly elected Prime Minister Boris Johnson strengthened his no deal Brexit rhetoric  A weaker Sterling made shares on the FTSE 100 more affordable  prompting a higher open that bucked the European trend 
Global Financial Affairs
In the earlier Asian session  stocks flashed green across the board  South Korea s KOSPI   0 45   outperformed as traders spurred a rebound from oversold condition after the index lagged yesterday  Japan s Nikkei 225   0 43   followed right behind  Australia s S P ASX 200   0 28   hit an all time high  At the bottom of the ranking  Hong Kong s Hang Seng  only  climbed 0 14  amid continued civil protests 
Meanwhile  the dollar advanced for the eighth straight session even as it approaches a widely expected Fed rate cut and possibly more easing down the line while the yield on 10 year U S  Treasurys dropped 

In commodities  oil jumped  advancing for a fourth consecutive day on speculation that lower borrowing costs and a weaker greenback following the next FOMC meeting would boost demand  Technically  the price is still trapped within a continuation consolidation  and a powerful death cross of the moving averages is still in effect  though the price jumped back above the 200 DMA

tailing dam failure remain a headwind  Nevertheless  the company will gain from focus on delivering improved margins in iron ore operations  ongoing investment in projects  efforts to ramp up coal business and transform base metals business Brumadinho Dam Disaster Remains an OverhangVale reported a loss of  133 million or 3 cents per share in second quarter 2019  marking its consecutive quarterly loss  This can primarily be attributed to the Brumadinho dam rupture  Excluding the Brumadinho dam impact  earnings per share came in at 22 cents in the second quarter  which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 58 cents The company s second quarter 2019 iron ore production plunged 33 8  on a year over year basis to 64 1 Mt while quarterly sales dipped 15 5  to 61 9 Mt   This was primarily owing to the suspension of operations in the aftermath of the Brumadinho dam rupture and unusual weather related conditions in the Northern System in April and early May Vale anticipates incurring significant expenses as a result of assistance and remediation actions following the dam failure  The company will write off assets of the C rrego do Feij o mine and those related to the upstream dams in Brazil  which will result in a loss of  124 million in 2019  Additional impairments  write off or write down of assets are likely to be recognized in 2019  The company also has to make provisions for costs of decommissioning  and remediation and legal proceedings  Revenues in fiscal 2019 will be lower owing to suspended operations On Track to Recover Lost

end of this year  The remaining 30 Mt  which includes wet processing  is estimated to return in about two to three years Vale had earlier provided iron ore and pellets sales guidance at 307 332 Mt for fiscal 2019  The company now anticipates current sales volume to be at the mid point of the range  It had earlier predicted sales volume between the bottom and the middle of the range Value over

the ramp up of the Moatize operations and the Nacala Logistics Corridor  NLC  in Mozambique and Malawi  where it has entered into a strategic partnership with Mitsui  As it completes the ramp up in Moatize and the NLC  the company anticipates reduction in costs  which will boost margins  Other key initiatives  such as knowledge transfer from its iron ore operations  opening of new mine sections and preparation of selected mining pits for future disposals are expected to lead to higher capacity utilization  mine productivity and yields for the coal business The company is also focused on transforming its base metals business into a significant cash generator  Vale is concentrating on nickel business through supply chain integration  operational excellence and digital transformation

Chinese officials drew a distinction between violent protests and peace demonstrations in Hong Kong yesterday  Although they supported the latter and condemned the former  they have not been above a wide variety of intimidation measures  Still  it is being left to HK officials to address the situation  and the Emergency Law left on the books from the UK  which seems like martial law  has been threatened  However  today  it was a small olive branch  Chief Executive Lam announced the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill that had sparked the initial protest  Previously  the bill had been suspended  While there was a favorable reaction by investors  it may not prove sufficient for the emboldened protesters  whose demands have grown to include universal suffrage  At the same time  concessions by Lam could split the demonstrations and draw away the more moderate wing 
China s Caixin services PMI rose to 52 1 from 51 6  and the composite rose to 51 6 from 50 9  gaining for the second consecutive month  The PBOC set the dollar s reference level slightly above yesterday s at CNY7 0878  though models were still anticipating something above CNY7 10  In the spot market  the dollar is near CNY7 1530  which is about 0 35  lower than yesterday and slightly below where it finished last week

The Baltic Dry Index  a real time average of the cost of shipping industrial commodities has risen to nine year highs  Given the importance of Chinese demand  some are hoping that the increased cost of shipping is an early indication that the world s second largest economy is on the mend  However  even if the Chinese economy is recovering  for which there seems to be little evidence  and the full impact of the trade disruption caused by the tariff conflict with the U S  has not been fully absorbed  it does not explain the magnitude of the surge  The Baltic Dry Index bottomed in February as the bursting of the dam in Brazil that led to the reduction in Vale s  NYSE VALE  iron ore exports led to the culling of fleet capacity  The demand has returned  and the recent drop in prices is spurring more shipments  From the middle of July through the end of August  iron ore prices fell by 30   The marginal increase in demand is finding fewer ships are available  It is not just the reduction of capacity earlier this year  More importantly  reports suggest that thousands of ships are being drydocked to be retro fitted with emission scrubbers that will make the ships compliant with the new regulations regarding sulfur oxide emissions starting January 1  The new scrubbers will allow the ships to continue to burn cheap fuel

The Johnson government was a dealt a significant blow as 21 Tory MPs joined the opposition in a 328 to 301 vote to take the first step in forcing a request for a third extension of the exit from the EU until the end of January  Johnson seeks a snap election to be held prior to the EU summit on October 17  October 14 seems preferred  the Tories do not have the power by itself to force the third national election in four years  The Tories lost its majority yesterday with a defection to the Liberal Democrats  Labour has been calling for elections for some time  but it is not clear how deep the feeling runs  Polls show Labour under Corbyn s leadership continuing to trail behind the Conservatives  Those 21 Tory defectors lost the whip  as it is known  which means that they will not be able to run as Tory candidates in the election  If confirmed tomorrow  it would foster a deeper split in the party  Separately  Johnson s suspension of Parliament was affirmed by a Scottish court today  The disappointing PMI readings  composite 50 2 from 50 7  add insult to injury but is overshadowed by political developments today 
After several years of trading insults and barbs  the Democrat Party and the Five Star Movement have put aside their differences to block a common enemy in the nationalist League  The head of neither party will be Deputy Prime Minister unlike in the previous government  The markets have been recognizing the threat of a political and economic crisis were receding  The generic 10 year yield was near 1 50  in early August  and it is now below 55 bp  The generic two year yield was near 34 bp at its peak early last month and now is nearly minus 30 bp  The five year credit default  the cost of insurance against default has fallen from around 220 bp to 160 bp  and in the honeymoon phase of the new government  it can fall below 100 bp 
Ironically  Italy s composite August PMI disappointed in what otherwise was upbeat news today  Weighed down by a poor service PMI  50 6 vs  51 7   Italy s composite fell to 50 3 from 51 0  However  German and French reports saw upward revisions from the flash  French services and composite stand at their best levels since last November  The EMU aggregate services PMI rose to 53 5 from 53 2 in July  and the composite rose to 51 9 from 51 5  Both were slightly above the flash estimates  We have suggested that the worst of the soft patch may be behind Europe  though Brexit uncertainty and unresolved trade tensions remain potent threats 
The euro recovered smartly yesterday after recording new two year lows and left a hammer candlestick in its wake  Follow through buying has lifted the single currency back above  1 10  where a 1 2 bln euro option struck that will expire today  Tomorrow  a 1 4 bln euro option at  1 1050 will be cut  Initial resistance is seen near  1 1020 and  1 1045  Sterling is also extending yesterday s recovery  It is approaching Monday s high near  1 2175  which is also a  61 8   retracement of the leg down since the August 26 high    1 2310   It pushed above  1 2150 in the European morning  where a roughly GBP215 mln option has been struck that expires today 
America
With the dismal manufacturing ISM PMI reports and given the curve inversion  some economists have repeatedly called for a 50 bp rate cut  Yesterday   Bullard  the dissenting vote in favor of a cut in June  called for a 50 bp cut this month  while Rosengren  one of the two dissents last month  is still not convinced of the need for easier monetary policy   The Bloomberg model shows about a one in three chance  32 5   of a 50 bp move  The CME s model says almost 12   11 9    chance is discounted  Grant the two assumptions  First  the weighted average of fed funds is 2 13  until the Fed meets and delivers a cut on September 17  Second that it averages 1 88  for the remainder of the month  Then the average for the entire month is 2 02   The September fed funds futures settled yesterday implying an average effective rate of 2 0075  this month  Next month s meeting is on October 30  The market appears to be discounting almost a 25  chance of a 50 move  with a bias toward then rather than this month 
The U S  reports its July trade balance  where a preliminary report steals much of the thunder  and a slight reduction in the deficit is expected  The U S  also reports August auto sales  This private sector report offers timely insight into consumer durable goods purchases  The Fed s Beige Book in preparation for the September 17 18 FOMC meeting will be released late in the North American session 
The Bank of Canada meeting is much anticipated  The current policy setting is neutral  but some softer data  global trade disruptions  and risks emanating from the U S  have fanned expectations for an October rate cut  If the Bank of Canada leans against market expectations  Canadian interest rates will likely rise  and the Canadian dollar would likely rise  Yesterday  the Canadian dollar reached its lowest level since June 19 culminating a sell off than began on July 19  U S  dollar support is seen in the CAD1 3280 CAD1 3300 area  A close below CAD1 3250 would fan ideas a greenback high may be in place 
The U S  dollar recorded an outside down day against the Mexican peso yesterday and settled below MXN20 00 for the first time in a week  Follow through selling today pushed the greenback briefly below MXN19 76  This area corresponds to a  38 2   retracement of the dollar s rally that began on July 31  which was the last time it closed below MXN19 00  The peso is a proxy for emerging market currencies broadly  but also its high real and nominal rates attract carry strategies 
Chile cut its overnight rate target by 50 bp to 2 0  following June  The earlier move caught the market by surprise  This one less so  but it is still seen as an aggressive move  Falling copper prices  around a two year low   the slowing of the world economy and trade tensions  is exerting disinflationary pressures  The cut is not likely the last  but with the rate falling below inflation  August CPI  due out on Friday and is expected to be 2 3  after 2 2  in July   The dollar has risen about 6 25  against the Chilean peso over the past two months ",2019-09-04,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hk-concession-better-emu-pmi-overshadows-trade-and-brexit-woes-200461265,200461265

tailing dam failure remains a headwinds  Nevertheless  the company will gain from focus on delivering improved margins in iron ore operations and higher iron ore prices  Investment in projects  efforts to ramp up its coal business and transform base metals business will also act as catalysts Manifold Impact of the Brumadinho Dam DisasterOn Jan 25  2019  a tailings dam failed at Vale s C rrego do Feij o mine  in the city of Brumadinho  state of Minas Gerais  leading to 300 casualties and extensive property and environmental damage  Various Brazilian courts have ordered freezes  attachments  deposits and similar measures affecting an aggregate of R 17 6 billion   4 5 billion  of Vale s financial assets to secure the payment of damages  The company suspended dividend and stopped all share buybacks  It also eliminated executive bonuses Following this  Vale suspended various operations  either voluntarily or as a result of revocation of licenses or court orders  This impacted the company s iron ore annualized production by about 92 8 Mt  The company is taking legal and technical measures to restart these operations but timing is uncertain  The financial impact of the disaster has not been quantified yet  Vale reported a loss of  1 6 billion or 32 cents per share in first quarter 2019   its first quarterly loss since the third quarter of 2015  This can primarily be attributed to the impact of the Brumadinho dam rupture Revenues in fiscal 2019 will be lower owing to suspended operations  Further  as a result of the suspended operations  Vale may have to purchase iron ore and iron ore pellets in the market to meet its obligations under existing commercial contracts  which may lead to higher costs  The company may have to make investments or adjustments in the operations not impacted by the dam failure to increase production  mitigate the impact of suspended operations or comply with additional safety requirements  It may also have to utilize alternative disposal methods to continue operating certain of its mines and plants  particularly those that rely on tailings dams  These alternative methods may be more expensive or require significant capital investments in mines and plants  As a result  costs are expected to increase  which may have a material adverse effect on margins The company will write off assets of the C rrego do Feij o mine and those related to the upstream dams in Brazil that will result in a loss of  124 million in 2019  Additional impairments  write off or write down of assets may be recognized in 2019  The company also has to make provisions for costs of decommissioning  and further remediation and legal proceedings Vale s  Value over Volume  Approach to Mitigate ImpactThe company is focusing on maintaining its   value over volume  approach for the iron ore business  Despite the production constraints  Vale remains committed to delivering the highest possible margins  by managing extensive supply chain and flexible product portfolio  The company strives for better price realization  based on adjustments to product portfolio according to market demand and supply chain optimization  The company is also focusing on improving quality and productivity  controlling costs  strengthening logistics infrastructure The Brumadinho dam breach and the consequent capacity closures  and Cyclone Veronica in Australia negatively impacted iron ore supply  This led to fears of a supply crunch  which in turn aided the surge in iron ore prices  Although Vale s production has gone down owing to the disaster  it will eventually benefit from rising iron ore prices Focus on Investment to Spur GrowthThe investment budget for 2019 approved by Vale s Board of Directors is  703 million for project execution  and  3 731 billion for sustaining existing operations and replacement projects  Major portion  96   of the capital expenditures budget for project execution will be invested in Brazil  The company is developing a focused organic growth portfolio with fewer projects but with higher expected rates of return  Its main initiative  S11D  accounts for 44 2  of the  703 million budgeted for project execution in 2019 Ramping up Coal Business  Efforts to Transform Base Metals BusinessVale is focused on increasing coal production  primarily through the ramp up of the Moatize operations and the Nacala Logistics Corridor  NLC  in Mozambique and Malawi  where it has entered into a strategic partnership with Mitsui  As it completes the ramp up in Moatize and the NLC  the company expects reduced costs which will boost margins  Other key initiatives  such as knowledge transfer from its iron ore operations  opening of new mine sections and preparation of selected mining pits for future disposals are expected to lead to higher capacity utilization  mine productivity and yields for the coal business The company is also focused on transforming its base metals business into a significant cash generator  Vale is focusing on nickel business through supply chain integration  operational excellence and digital transformation  It is also being aided by consistent review asset

15873,237388,VALE,Iron Ore Prices Continue to Rise Amid Supply Concerns and Growing Steal Demand,opinion,"Global supply shocks have pushed the iron ore price up 70  so far this year  hitting a five year high of  126 per tonne earlier this month  At the same time  China s iron ore futures hit the highest level since 2013  thanks to the nation s growing demand for the steelmaking material 
An increase in steel production in China paired with the slumping supply from Australia and Brazil is creating a buzz among analysts  who suspect that the iron ore price isn t done rallying  While this isn t great news for steelmakers in China who have voiced their concerns about the rising price  it s very encouraging for investors interested in the iron ore space 
The lack of supply coming from iron mining giants BHP Group  NYSE BBL   Vale SA ADR  NYSE VALE   and Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  offers junior iron ore miners an opportunity to gain a share of this bull market 
Iron Ore Price Supported by Tight Supply
The iron ore price increase is mainly due to continuous issues faced by the world s largest iron miners since the beginning of the year  The first was the deadly dam disaster at Vale s Brumadinho dam in Brazil  which killed over 200 people and caused billions of dollars in environmental damage  The mine produces roughly 93 million tonnes per year  causing a huge loss in supply 
On Monday  Vale announced that it will be paying  106 5 million to workers that were affected by the tailings dam rupture 
Then severe weather created by Cyclone Veronica caused BHP Billiton  LON BHPB  and Rio Tinto to cut their production forecasts  Rio faced operational issues at its Cape Lambert iron ore export terminal as well after a fire broke out in January  Rio has since seen an increase in iron ore shipments  however  they are still down 3  from this time last year 
What s more  domestic iron ore mines in China have been shutting down due to strict air pollution standards set by the nation 
Junior Iron Ore Miners Looking to Meet Market Demand
The rising iron ore price is attracting the attention of investors  providing junior miners the much needed funding to bring their projects to production 
One company that gained some capital recently is Macarther Minerals Limited  TSXV MMS   OTCQB MMSDF   which raised  6 million USD in gross proceeds from a previously announced private placement offering 
Macarthur will be using the funds to complete a bankable feasibility study at its Lake Giles Iron Ore project in Western Australia  The project incorporates the mineral resources from the Ularring Hematite Project  which has indicated resources of 54 46 million tonnes at 47 2  iron and inferred resources of 25 99 million tonnes at 45 4  iron  and the Moonshine Magnetite project  which contains inferred resources of 710 million tonnes at 30 2  iron 
Meanwhile  Strike Resources  ASX SRK  announced a maiden resource for its Western Australia based Paulsens East iron ore project  which revealed 9 1 million tonnes at 63 4  iron  Based on the results  the company plans to fast track the development of the project within the next nine months 
Overseas in Ukraine  Black Iron Inc   BKI  gained government support for its Shymanivske Iron Ore project  which contains measured and indicated resources of 646 million tonnes 
In Canada  Delrey Metals  CSE DLRY  continues to advance its Four Corners vanadium iron titanium project in Newfoundland  In May  the company reported assays from Four Corners that revealed iron results ranging from 19 16  Fe203  iron oxide  to 48 61  Fe203  with an average grade of 35 07  Fe203 
On Tuesday  Delrey Metals announced the plans for its 2019 drill program at the project  which will cover a total of 500 meters from 20 drill pads at its flagship Keating Hill East Zone 
Investors interested in the iron ore market will want to keep an eye on China s demand for the steelmaking metal  as it will signal further price increases to come ",2019-07-16,Kristen Moran,https://www.investing.com/analysis/iron-ore-prices-continue-to-rise-amid-supply-concerns-and-growing-steal-demand-200440438,200440438

15902,237417,VALE,Chart of the Day  Iron Ore   Downward Correction Ahead Of Next Leg Up ,opinion,"Iron ore was up more than 4  today  though it ultimately settled 2 63  higher  This brings the current rally to its third straight day and an accumulated gain of 7 46  
We expect the rally to resume  despite the current fundamental drivers  a tropical storm that rammed the cost of Western Australia  forcing local producers BHP  NYSE BHP  and Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  to cut output forecasts  As well  there s another headwind still in affect  as recently as two weeks ago  the outlook was already gloomy after a court ruling permitted the Brazilian miner Vale  NYSE VALE   the world s largest producer  to reopen one of its biggest mines  which had been closed due to a collapse that killed hundreds of people  The expectation of oversupply on slowing global growth depressed prices 
However  we provided a buy signal at that time  based on the balance of supply and demand via technical analysis  In fact  that was our second  back to back buying recommendation within a month  despite weakening fundamentals  The price has risen since as much as 12 percent  Based on current technicals  we now expect another rally 
The latest three day rally extends an upside breakout of a symmetrical triangle  the trading range of which included two consecutive falling flags  marked in the black  then red  dotted lines  Their dynamics are described in the links above 
The symmetrical triangle demonstrates that while the pause was driven by an equal commitment from bulls and bears  buyers were more persistent  as they sought further supply above the converging trade range since early February  This over eagerness establishes two dynamics  one of sentiment and one of market mechanics 
In terms of sentiment  the breakout creates an overall psychological framework  in which traders see that prices are rising more than they recently have been  and they re afraid to lose out on what they may consider a repeat of the sharp uptrend that preceded the pause 
From a practical perspective  traders have been building positions according to the boundaries of the trading range  When the breakout occurred  bearish traders were forced to cover shorts  which increased demand pressure as they rushed to buy contracts before they could go up even higher  in order to be able to return them to their brokers 
Bullish traders set up buy orders above the upper boundary of the price congestion for just this upside breakout scenario  known as a short squeeze  and the undecideds then realize that a second rally is probably kicking off  so they throw their hats into the game  In this structure  most market participants are expected to add their weight to the demand side of the scale 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait on a long position for the likely return move after a breakout  to retest the pattern s integrity  with at least a single long  green candle engulfing a red or small candle of either color 
Moderate traders would wait for the pullback before entering a long position  but not necessarily for testing the trend  rather for simply an entry closer to its presumed support  thereby limiting exposure 
Aggressive traders may enter a contrarian short  counting on a downward correction much like that which followed both the upside breakout as well as the three day rally  Also  the price was forced back down below the Feb  12 peak  demonstrating oversupply at these levels  increasing the likelihood of a downward correction

VALE S A  Price and EPS Surprise   
Factors to ConsiderOn Jan 25  the Corrego do Feijao iron ore mine in Brazil operated by Vale collapsed and killed around 300 people in Brazil s deadliest mining disaster ever  The company has already had  3 billion in assets blocked by the courts to ensure that there is enough money set aside to cover the financial impact  Vale suspended the dividend and stopped all share buybacks  It also eliminated executive bonuses  This is the second major tailings dam disaster for the company  In November 2015  a dam collapse at the Samarco iron ore mine in Brazil killed 19 people  This is likely to impact to the upcoming quarterly results Vale anticipates that the Brumadinho dam rupture has impacted its iron ore annualized production by about 92 8 Mt  Of this  loss of 40 Mt resulted owing to its intention to advance the decommissioning process of all upstream dams  The balance 52 8 Mt was due to mines that have been suspended on account of judicial decisions or Vale s technical analysis of the dams  The company is taking legal and technical measures to restart these operations but timing of any restart is uncertain and the risk of extended disruptions remains high  The priority management is to help communities affected by the Brumadinho tailings dam tragedy and ensure that other operations do not pose any further threats to the environment or surrounding communitiesVale has written off the assets of the C rrego do Feij o mine and the assets related to upstream dams in Brazil  resulting in an accounting loss that would impact the company s results in the first quarter of 2019 Nevertheless  supply tightness due to the Brumadinho dam breach and the consequent capacity closures have led to expectations of shortage of iron ore in the market  which is working in favor of iron ore prices  Cyclone Veronica in Australia also negatively impacted iron ore supply from the country  Supply disruptions from the world s two largest iron ore exporters  Brazil and Australia  led to fears of a supply crunch  which in turn aided a surge in iron ore prices  Even though Vale s production has gone down towing to the disaster  it will benefit from higher iron ore prices Vale has been steadily lowering debt of late through increased free cash flow generation  At the end of 2018  its net debt stood at  9 65 billion  significant drop from  18 1 billion at 2017 end  The company s current net debt level is even lower than the target of  10 billion  Lower interest expense owing to debt repayment will support earnings in the to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  9 6 billion for the to be reported quarter indicates an improvement of 11 7  from the year ago quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vale s earnings for first quarter 2019 is currently pegged at 53 cents  suggesting growth of 43 2  from the year ago reported figure  Price PerformanceVale s shares have dropped 8 9  in the past year compared with the  s decline of 6 8   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Vale is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below  Zacks ESP  Vale has an Earnings ESP of  7 11   This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate is at 49 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 53 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks Rank  Vale currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  The favorable rank  when combined with a negative ESP  makes earnings surprise unlikely this season  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  Schnitzer Steel Industries  Inc    NASDAQ SCHN   has an Earnings ESP of  1 70  and a Zacks Rank  2    You can see  Commercial Metals Company   NYSE CMC   has an Earnings ESP of  1 40  and a Zacks Rank  3  Celanese Corporation   NYSE CE   has an Earnings ESP of  0 18  and a Zacks Rank  3  Radical New Technology Creates  12 3 Trillion OpportunityImagine buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  stock in the early days of personal computers  or Motorola  NYSE MSI  after it released the world s first cell phone  These technologies changed our lives and created massive profits for investors Today  we re on the brink of the next quantum leap in technology  7 innovative companies are leading this  4th Industrial Revolution    and early investors stand to earn the biggest profits ",2019-05-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whats-in-the-offing-for-vale-vale-this-earnings-season-200417899,200417899
15921,237436,VALE,Chart of the Day  Iron Ore Price To Rise Despite Vale Mine Restart,opinion,"Iron ore slipped today after the world s largest producer of the base metal  Brazilian miner Vale  NYSE VALE   said a court ruling has given it a green light to restart production at one of its biggest mines  alleviating concerns over tightening global supply  The Brucutu mine was ordered closed in February after the Brumadinho dam collapse in January that killed more than 300 people 
However  operations have yet to resume pending additional regulatory approval from local authorities  Meanwhile  the price of iron ore  which initially dropped in the wake of the disaster  rebounded solidly as concerns of global supply constraints caused by the closure boosted the price 
Re opening the mine is expected to dampen price pressures as these fears retreat  but we don t think they will  Based on the supply demand balance  we believe the price of iron ore will continue to rise 

The price is currently the highest since Feb  12 and showing the upside breakout of a well defined bearish flag  bullish following the over 23  surge of the metal in only seven sessions  Already yesterday  the price closed above the initial break out penetrative rally  allowing traders to increase their comfort level with the pattern s integrity 
On March 11  the rate reached a low of 594 50  where it touched the flag top  It has been climbing since  demonstrating its support 
The flag pattern developed within a long term  massive ascending channel since the Dec  2015 bottom  projecting the supply demand dynamics as prices tried to overcome the previous peak at the 640 level  during February and March 2017 
The pattern s target implication is seen by measuring the sharp move before the congestion  We have noted the bottom of the move to be absent of any congestion which may suggest an exchange between buyers and sellers  Therefore  we measured from Jan  8 to the highest point of the flag pole  and the beginning of the pattern s development  on Feb  11  a move of more than 20  in seven sessions  However targets measure the price  CNY118  or over  17  from the breakout point of 616 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders will wait for a new peak to be formed  higher than the Feb  12  657 50  to determine if the uptrend remains intact  Then they would wait for a correction that would stay above the 642 level 
Moderate traders might be content with a new peak and wait for the pullback for a better entry  not necessarily for proof of trend 
Aggressive traders may risk a long position now  providing they understand the risks and trade accordingly

Both Nucor Corporation    NYSE NUE    and Steel Dynamics Inc    NASDAQ STLD    indicated that  benefited the companies  The benefits actually more than made up for the uptick in some raw material prices  Both companies are shelling out billions to construct new steel processing facilities 
Upbeat Earnings 
Nucor Corporation saw its profits jump in fourth quarter 2018 on the back of higher year over year steel prices and shipments  The steel giant logged net earnings of  646 8 million or  2 07 per share  up roughly 68  from  383 9 million or  1 20 registered a year ago  Earnings per share also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 93  Nucor raked in net sales of  6 295 9 million for the reported quarter  up roughly 24  year over year  The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 289 3 million

15941,237456,VALE,Priciest Base Metal Nickel Has Its Fortunes Tied To Electric Vehicles,opinion,"A global supply squeeze and laser sharp focus on electric vehicle batteries has transformed nickel into one of this year s super commodity performers  with analysts seeing little fade in the fortunes of the shiny alloy grade once best known for coin minting and for providing stainless steel s coating 

After a 16 percent loss in 2018 that saw it perform no better than most base metals  nickel is up 23 percent this year  That puts it at the second spot among commodities  just after lumber s 28 percent gain  to see relative returns on all commodities  click here and go to performance  
Benchmark three month nickel futures on the London Metal Exchange are hovering at five month highs after Monday s intraday peak of  13 255 00 a ton  Both technicals and fundamentals analysis point to greater chart action and industry potential 
A  Fully Justified  Rally
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the rebound in nickel prices  from December s 14 month lows of  10 632 50  was  fully justified   In a post issued last week  they added 

 Fundamentals have held up  with LME stocks for instance declining every single month in the past year  similarly  physical premia suggest that nickel quotations at  12 500 oz   5 67 lb  are fair value  
 In contrast to the macro  structural risks to oil demand from electric vehicle proliferation appear skewed to the upside  EV batteries require a lot of metals  including nickel  lithium and cobalt  
 In our view  the recent disconnect between prices and fundamentals was driven by a confluence of factors  But we see only upside risk to oil demand on battery supply 

A  Buy  That Could Gain Another 4 
Investing com has a  Buy  call on nickel on its daily technical outlook  with Level 3 Fibonacci resistance pegged at  13 702 50  At Monday s settlement of 13 222 50  that would leave nickel room for another  480 gain or near 4 percent 
BAML has a  15 695 ton forecast for nickel next year  But in order for that to happen  the Wall Street bank says demand from electric vehicles has to pick up and Indonesian output of the metal has to be controlled 
Participants in nickel have been apprehensive lately about Chinese steel giant Tsingshan Holding Group s move to produce 50 000 tons per year of battery grade nickel and cobalt in Indonesia 
Tsingshan  which includes lithium battery heavyweights Contemporary Amperex Technology and GEM  is already a major miner and processor of nickel ore  converting it to nickel pig iron  NPI  to feed its new stainless steel mill in the Morowali industrial park on the island of Sulawesi 
For the Indonesian initiative though  Tsingshan is using a different processing route  supplying the nickel and operating the first stage processing to nickel hydroxide intermediates that can then be converted into nickel sulphate the nickel form of choice for lithium ion battery makers 
Indonesian Output Trouble Provides Another Wind
The so called high pressure acid leaching  HPAL  technology has a troubled history of operational problems and slow ramp ups  Brazil s Vale  NYSE VALE  is still struggling with its Goro plant after six years of operation 
Speculation that the Tsingshan facility will not result in a major surge of battery grade nickel supplies has been one reason for the metal s rally 
Says BAML of the Tsingshan facility 

 While a memorandum of understanding has been signed for feedstock  recent dynamics suggest that the site is unlikely to deliver its first nickel units to the market in 2019 20  The facility could start up in 2019 and at a capex intensity of only  14 000 t  both a fraction of peer projects  

While the Tsingshan plant remains under a cloud  demand for battery grade nickel  especially from electric vehicle manufacturers  will continue although the metal s uptake for stainless steel was patchy last year  BAML said  It added 

 Putting it all together  supply growth is too weak to flip the nickel market into surplus  At the same time continued uncertainty over Tsingshan could cap prices at  15 000 t   6 80 lb   ",2019-02-05,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/priciest-base-metal-nickel-has-its-fortunes-tied-to-electric-vehicles-200383504,200383504

Treasury yields drop  USD keeps climbing
AUD sells off on RBA shift to neutral policy
Brazilian glitch sends iron ore towards  90 level


Key Events
European shares slid lower alongside futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 this morning  spoiling chances for a six day rally after markedly downbeat German factory orders reinforced the outlook of a European slowdown and mixed earnings results failed to reassure investors that momentum is not abating 
U S  President Donald Trump s State of the Union address on Tuesday  lacking signals of any progress on trade talks with China  also fell short of shoring up market sentiment 
The STOXX Europe 600 opened lower  unable to overcome a resistance line since mid October  BNP Paribas  PA BNPP  dragged bank stocks lower after the French lender cut its 2020 target though still beating full year profits estimates adding to the weight of broader corporate soft guidance which has been clouding the market since the end of last year  The pan European benchmark later managed to crawl above neutral levels 
The earlier Asian session once again saw thin trading amid Lunar New Year holidays  However  Trump s comment on a two day summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un at the end of the month boosted Japan s Nikkei by 0 14 percent  even amid a yen rally  A stronger currency typically weighs on stocks  making a country s exports less competitive in a global market that is already hyper sensitive to trade jitters 
Global Financial Affairs
In Tuesday s U S  session  equities climbed for the fifth straight day  as gains in the technology sector outweighed a retreat in financial shares  triggered by falling Treasury yields  Trading volumes  though  remained low 

The S P 500 edged 0 47 percent higher  with nine out of eleven sectors closing in the green  Communication Services   1 1 percent  provided the best returns  while Financials   0 27 percent  slipped lower 
Earnings and economic data were mixed  giving investors little to trade on ahead of Trump s address to the nation  Trading volumes were 15 percent below the 30 day average  raising questions as to how representative of the broader market recent price moves are  Meanwhile  the SPX tested the 200 DMA  only to retreat 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0 68 percent  extending an upside breakout of its 100 and 200 DMAs for a third day 
The NASDAQ Composite snapped a 0 74 percent gain  outperforming its peers  The tech heavy index extended a climb above its 100 DMA for a second day  but remained below its 200 DMA  Marquee tech stocks have been advancing nicely since the beginning of the year  but some software shares are the hiddent gems of the sector 
The Russell 2000 gained 0 22 percent  crawling above the 100 DMA  while the 200 DMA remains almost 4 5 percent away 
Overall  global equities are nearing levels not seen since November  in part spurred by the Federal Reserve s tilt toward a neutral policy stance  Further clues on what 2019 holds for the stock market may come on Wednesday from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell s first public comments following the January meeting and interest rate decision 
Also looming in the background are next week s talks in Beijing between U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese counterparts 

The yield on 10 year Treasurys dropped for a second day  in line with upbeat risk assets  which helped the dollar extended the rally to a fifth day though the USD found resistance by the 100 DMA and a downtrend line since December 13  giving up some gains 

The Australian dollar tumbled after Reserve Bank of Australia s chair Philip Lowe signaled a shift to a neutral stance on policy  Technically  the Aussie found support by an uptrend line since the beginning of the year  as it seems to be forming an H S Continuation pattern  bearish in a downtrend 
In commodities news  Iron ore rallied toward  90 a metric ton after Brazilian multinational mining company Vale  NYSE VALE  declared force majeure on a number of futures contracts after being ordered to suspend operations in one of its key mines in Minas Gerais state thereby raising the prospect of a supply deficit this year 

Copper climbed to its highest level year to date  crossing over the 200 DMA and approaching levels that would signal a bottom 
WTI crude continued to slip below  54 a barrel on rising U S  crude inventories  Technically  the price fell back below the neckline of an H S bottom  Meanwhile  reported efforts by Saudi Arabia to lure Russia into a formal joint cartel group to control oil exports and prices may be set for failure

15943,237458,VALE,Supply Worries Drive Iron Ore Prices To New Heights,opinion,"Two major dam disasters in three years are enough to put the frighteners on investors and get the media abuzz with talk of supply side shortages 
According to Reuters   NYSE Vale s  Corrego do Feijao mine shutdown will result in only a 1 5  production loss to the Brazilian miner  hardly enough in itself to create a surge in the Iron ore price to a four and a half year high of over  100 per ton last week 
Yet as small as Vale s production loss is  the fact remains the market is relatively tight  and supply is becoming an issue again after many years of plenty 
The fear appears to be more about what comes next 
At least 166 people died in the disaster  according to The Times  and almost 200 are still missing  Coming as this does in the wake of the Samarco dam collapse in 2015  questions are being asked about the regulatory landscape in Brazil and whether this will herald a major shakeup 
It s not that Vale appears to have obviously cut any corners  the mine had been independently audited by TUV and given a clean bill of health 
But the ramifications are worrying investors 
Brazilian authorities have seized Vale assets and there could be ripple effects elsewhere 
There are some 18 000 tailings dams around the world  one would expect  and hope  that authorities are taking another look at those in their own backyard following repeated failings in Brazil 
For now  tightness in the iron ore market  to the extent to which it exists  appears confined to the high purity  62  product  Driven by China s concerns about air pollution  steelmakers are favoring higher purity ore that creates less particulate pollution for every ton of finished steel produced 
Supply of these higher grades is largely in the hands of the big three   Rio Tinto  LON RIO   BHP  NYSE BHP  and Vale  Spare capacity for such material is limited  even if it weren t  none of the three have the incentive to further open the supply tap when prices are rising strongly 
Iron ore has jumped some 25  since the Corrego do Feijao disaster and could rise further now that the Chinese New Year is coming to an end  Reuters speculates 
What This Means for Buyers
Our only caution would be that this is a historically quiet production period  Summer construction is still months away and flat Coking Coal  and Coke  prices suggest actual steelmaking demand is muted 
Chinese steel rebar prices have been softening  according to MetalMiner IndX data  despite rising iron ore prices  suggesting demand is lackluster 
If Beijing decides enough GDP slowdown is enough and decides to reflate  then housing  or infrastructure fueled steel demand may again become a demand dynamic 
But  for now  investor enthusiasm for iron ore may be getting ahead of itself

aren t pretty But Bulls  Do not panic  And Bears  Do not celebrate  It has already come to pass  The Money Gods introduced some crafty stage theatrics  The Deus Ex Machina already proceeded to shower the global growth stage with more juice Deus Ex Machina translates to  God from the Machine  Machine   in this case  refers to the crane that held a god over the stage in ancient Greek and Roman drama The literary device of Deus Ex Machina means to solve a seemingly intractable problem in a plot    by adding in an unexpected character  object  or situation Deus Ex Machina twists often have the sense of being quite contrived  It seems like the author resorted to something he or she did not set up properly plot wise That is clearly the case with 2019  No one wanted weak fundamental data

His statement should be the FOMC doesn t think it is done hiking  But it is nearing  the neutral rate  and remains  patient  towards timing its next move Greater intrigue surrounds what the Fed does

raging open ocean  That is my idiom for the deus ex machina Next  I list Reuters  five big world market themes  These are the ones most likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the Global Week Ahead I re ordered them  to show the relative importance for equity markets  1  FOMC Meeting Ends WednesdayU S  unemployment is plumbing its lowest level in half a century  wages are ticking up but the Federal Reserve  meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday  is not poised to snatch away the proverbial punch bowl On Wall Street at least  the Fed s dovish 2019 conversion is paying off  The S P 500 is up about 6 percent since the Fed s Jan 30 meeting signaled it was putting in abeyance a tightening policy that began in 2015 Labor shortages notwithstanding  the slowing economy is keeping prices in check  giving the central bank leeway to stand pat on interest rates after hiking four times in 2018  Compared to the Fed s 2 percent inflation target  producer inflation was up 1 9 percent in the year to February  while consumer inflation rose just 1 5 percent to its smallest annual gain in 2 1 2 years The next reading of the Fed s preferred inflation measure  the core personal consumption expenditures price index  is due on March 29  But that gauge rose 1 9 percent year year in December Already  money markets are building in some easing in 2020  By then  the Fed should have completed a review of how it manages its policy mandate of keeping prices stable and employment high  2  Is Europe s Economy Bottoming It s been a rough old time for Europe s economy  with momentum steadily waning last year even as the United States powered ahead  Growth warnings issued by the OECD and the European Central Bank have rattled investors further this year  as they try to assess what kind of toll the Eurozone has suffered from trade wars  Brexit and Italian debt concerns But finally  There are some signs the nasty surprises are fading  Citi s well known economic surprise index   a gauge showing how much economists have been over  or underestimating economic performance compared to what indicators actually deliver   now shows a cross over between the Eurozone and the United States That means negative surprises from economic indicators in the world s top economy have worsened dramatically in recent weeks  Eurozone data misses  meanwhile  have been less bad than previously recorded Whether this run continues or not will become evident in coming days  First up on Tuesday  comes Germany s ZEW economic index  Purchasing manager indexes  a crucial forward looking gauge  will be released on Friday from the United States  the Eurozone and Japan  3  Where Does Japan s Economy Go from Here To many economists  the Bank of Japan s forecasts have long seemed to be on the optimistic side  The key difference in views was the global outlook  Well  the world economy is slowing down and even if Japanese companies are awash with cash and no major central bank runs a looser policy than the BOJ  the No  3 economy is still feeling the pinch What s worse  inflation encounters less resistance on the downside than it does on the upside  So the BOJ is well and truly in a corner  There was little it could do at its March meeting save keeping policy unchanged and tempering its economic outlook predictions  But might the BOJ be forced to resort to further policy easing  That question is being asked of the ECB too  while central banks elsewhere   from Australia to the United States   may also have to cut rates Upcoming data on Japan s trade and price growth will help investors determine what happens next  Policymakers will also be hoping for a resolution soon to the U S  China trade dispute  The data could intensify the debate on whether the BOJ s dogged adherence to a 2 percent inflation target means anything   finance minister Taro Aso predicted  things could go wrong  if the BOJ hung on to that goal  4  A Third Try at BrexitIf at first you don t succeed  try and try again  And again and again  The UK Parliament has voted to extend the March 29 exit date but Prime Minister Theresa May is still hoping to railroad lawmakers into approving the EU divorce deal she s negotiated  The unpopular agreement has already been heavily rejected twice but prospects of a long delay or even another referendum that may reverse Brexit could well swing eurosceptic Tories over to her side  So a third  meaningful  vote  dubbed MV3  is planned for the coming week  If that fails  well  MV4 is already being touted There is  of course  no guarantee an exasperated EU will play ball   all 27 remaining members have to agree the extension  And there are doubts a three month delay will break the deadlock  If MV3 fails  the EU s March 21 summit will be key  first to see if it agrees an extension and second  whether it presses Britain for a delay of one year or more With the parliamentary votes  meaningful or otherwise  grabbing the limelight  there s probably not much the Bank of England can add at its meeting on March 21  It s already said no deal Brexit is a bad idea  any clarity on its policy intentions is likely only after the manner and timing of Brexit becomes evident  5  The Boeing  NYSE BA  CrisisPresident Trump has told Boeing to  figure it out fast   That s probably good advice for the company  a long standing stock market darling that s lost almost  28 billion  or 13 percent of its value  since the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines  crash The disaster has prompted country after country into grounding Boeing s fleet of 737 MAX aircraft   the model involved in the Ethiopian crash and another recent one in Indonesia  Possible links between the accidents have rocked the aviation industry  scared passengers worldwide  and left the company scrambling to prove the safety of its best selling model that was intended to be the standard for decades Before the crash  Boeing was the seventh most valued stock on the Dow Jones  but it s fallen to 14th  Its shares hit record highs just a week before the crash  having risen a stunning 52 percent since the end of December  They are still up almost 20 percent year to date So what s next  Moody s reckons Boeing will overcome the near term challenges  The question for investors is whether the share price slide takes into account the damage to the bottom line and potential legal exposure  Analysts will be assessing the possible fallout  chances are  some earnings downgrades will start coming through Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks  1  Vale  Yes  it is actually on our  1 list  But

Asian  U S  indices take a hit from contrasting trade talks reports
Iron ore falls ahead on prospect of new Brazilian mine projects
Key Events
Global stocks halted their rally this morning as trade uncertainty retuned to markets after reports of a lack of co operation by Chinese negotiators  Futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 wavered around neutral levels as investors took a cautious stance ahead of today s Fed monetary policy announcement  amid mounting hopes that the central bank s dot plot projections would strengthen the case for a slower path to tightening 
The STOXX Europe 600 opened 0 16  lower and resumed the slide  with miners and oil firms contributing to losses  The stock of German chemical producer Bayer  DE BAYGN  plunged over 12   nearly wiping out all of this year s profits and heading for the biggest drop in 15 years  after the multinational firm suffered a setback in a trial over claims its Roundup weed killer causes cancer 
In the earlier Asian session  equities opened lower after reports that China has been pushing back U S  demands including stricter intellectual property rules in trade negotiations  Stocks fluctuated as investors weighed between trade uncertainties and expectations for an accommodative stance by the Fed  Remarks by U S  President Donald Trump that  talks with China are going very well  may have eased some concerns 
China s Shanghai Composite   0 01   closed flat  rebounding from a 1 2  drop  after the 50 DMA crossed over the 200 DMA  triggering a golden cross  Hong Kong s Hang Seng fell 0 49   The yuan remained relatively steady  weathering the reported U S  dissatisfaction with China  South Korea s KOSPI   0 02   also came in at neutral levels  and Australia s S P ASX 200 slid 0 32  
Japan s Nikkei 225 managed to eke out a 0 2  gain  even after Sony  T 6758  and Nintendo  T 7974  shares tumbled over 3  after Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  unveiled its new video game streaming platform Stadia  The index s heavyweight Fast Retailing  T 9983  climbed  offsetting losses in gaming shares 
Global Financial Affairs

The S P 500 ticked 0 1  lower  giving up a 0 28  higher open and a 0 7  intraday high  Losses in Utilities   1 14   and Financials   0 78   offset gains in Healthcare   0 79   and Consumer Discretionary   0 5    Technically  the pushback came within 1  above the October November peaks  as the 50 DMA approaches the 200 DMA 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0 1   Technically  the price found resistance by the February peak  as the 50 DMA attempts to scale above the 200 DMA 
The Russell 2000 dropped 0 65   outperforming the other majors  Here we have another example of the trade proxy breakdown  Non export reliant small caps should have outperformed  given the latest trade uncertainty  We have been studying and reporting this pattern breakdown in the last couple of months  finding in the correlation between inflation  the dollar and companies  capitalization size a possible alternative driver  Yesterday  the USD fell to the lowest level of the month on speculation of a dovish fed a tailwind for multinationals  which would attract more demand at the expense of domestic firms 

Meanwhile  yields on 10 year Treasurys fell today after a three day advance  supporting the outlook for lower rates on the horizon  which would make current bonds more attractive  Technically  yields are developing a pennant continuation pattern something to be expected they completed a symmetrical triangle  which itself followed the violation of the long term uptrend line since July 2016 

Technically  however  we have been pointing out for some time that the 1 3  drop since March 7 should be viewed in the prism of a correction within an uptrend  with the 200 DMA drawing an organic uptrend line  as well as ascending channel bottom  The RSI confirms that momentum supports the price movement  also suggesting that the dollar will continue to climb  If not from the outlook for higher rates  the greenback is likely benefiting to its safe haven status 
Sterling dropped  perhaps signaling pessimism over Prime Minister Theresa May s quest for an extension on the Brexit deadline that could enable her to strike a final deal with parliament 
The euro held steady even after German produce inflation disappointed on inflation 

Gold futures fell today  ending a three day straight advance and wiping out yesterday s gain  Technically  the precious metal fell below the 50 DMA  as it forms the right shoulder of a H S top

Environmental initiatives in China  which will limit the operating hours of steel smelters in a bid to ease smog in major cities  are seen hurting Chinese demand for iron ore in Q4 and possibly leading to backlogs at ports and further price falls 
 We think that local governments are likely to carry out the environmental cuts forcefully   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  analysts say   The market has not fully priced the negative environmental restrictions on iron ore demand  Therefore  we expect iron ore prices to fall further going into Q4  
But the news out of China is not all bad for the world s top suppliers to the seaborne iron ore market  as the government this week said it would cancel about a third of iron ore mining licenses   more than 1K   as part of efforts to improve air quality

Price chart for South32 Limited on London Stock Exchange is possibly forming an 8 month long symmetrical triangle with the upper boundary acting as resistance at 216 levels  Similar to the Australia Stock Exchange listing  this price chart is pending confirmation 

Cross listing concept is distinctly different than examples such as  American Depositary Receipt  ADR   European Depositary Receipt  EDR   global depository receipt  GDR   also referred to as international depository receipt   and Global Registered Shares  GRS   ADRs  GDRs and the like are a mechanism to repackage a security primarily listed on an Exchange  such as Frankfurt  to enable it to be purchased by an investor outside of that market  such as within the US on the NYSE   This is a distinct instrument  as not all the rights may come with the ADR  GDR  EDR  IDR  etc    and the ADR is subject to the fluctuations of the underlying currency  The original issue  on Frankfurt  would be priced in EUR  while the ADR is priced in USD  In most cases  the ADR is convertible back into the original instrument  but needs to go through a process of conversion   The ADR  GDR IDR EDR  etc   also receives a different ISIN number  recognizing that it is not the same fungible instrument as the underlying stock 
Below charts were featured in previous issues of Global Equity Markets report Breakout Alerts section  VALE SA  NYSE VALE  listed on Brasil s Sao Paulo stock exchange is available to investors via Depository Receipts in New York Stock Exchange  Both charts completed a similar cup   handle continuation chart pattern  However  price appreciation due to currency effect helped the price chart on Sao Paulo exhange reach its chart pattern price objective earlier than the Depository Receipt on the New York Stock Exchange

Vale  s American depositary receipts  ADR  fell by almost 8  on Jan 25 and around 18  on Jan 28 lowest close since December 2017  The incident has affected the market valuation of Brazil s biggest iron ore miner  resulting in 71 34 billion reais  US 18 96 billion  worth of decline in its market value  The pure play steel ETF  VanEck Vectors Steel ETF   AX SLX   plunged 3  during trading hours on Jan 28

Prosecutors  politician and victim families have asked for severe punishment as the death toll is expected to reach hundreds   Per    the reaction coming from government and other public agencies is stronger than the Samarco incident  The reaction has raised a lot of uncertainty with regard to financial punishment 
However  Vale s output levels are not going to be affected massively as the concerned mine accounted for about 7  of the total output  So  analysts have highlighted risks such as remediation charges  lawsuits  additional inspections and the potential closing of other mines

like Harley Davidson motorcycles  food products and popular shoes and clothing Other big equipment manufacturers  like Boeing  NYSE BA  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   could also get hit if their input costs rise If you re feeling nervous  is there anywhere to hide that might be smoother waters Stocks that Might Give Investors the Edge1        John likes some of the big materials plays as a contrarian investment like Vale   NYSE VALE    a big Brazilian iron ore manufacturer  which ships iron ore to China  It s cheap  with a forward P E of just 11 and no one is paying any attention to it right now  It s a contrarian pick 2        Sina   NASDAQ SINA   owns Weibo  the Twitter of China  It s used domestically in China  How will it be impacted by a trade war  It definitely won t be as severe as someone making a consumer product like an automobile 3        Tencent   OTC TCEHY   owns WeChat  which is China s equivalent to Facebook  It has nearly a billion users  Much like Sina  it shouldn t see huge impacts from a trade war on its business 4        Facebook   NASDAQ FB   also doesn t make a product that could see a tariff unless the EU decides to tax Instagram in some way  But that s unlikely 5        Similarly  Twitter   NYSE TWTR   operates on the Internet as well  It should be able to ride out a trade war Tracey also likes the small community banks  which mostly provide services to local customers and businesses through commercial loans and mortgages What other industries and stocks do Tracey and John like  and dislike  if a trade war breaks out Tune into this week s

16010,237525,VALE,Is Vale S A   VALE  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Vale S A    NYSE VALE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Vale S A  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Vale S A  s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint  which is 6 7  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Vale S A  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Vale S A  s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Vale S A  has a P S ratio of about 1 9  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Vale S A  currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes VALE a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Vale S A  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D  This gives VALE a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has skyrocketed nearly 141 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased nearly 23 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below VALE S A  Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Vale S A  is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineVale S A  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 46  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick Breaking News  Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than Visa The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed  700 billion   more than a 3 800  increase in the previous 12 months  They re now bigger than Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and even Visa  The new

16012,237527,VALE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  BHP  Golden Minerals  Glencore And VALE,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 24  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited   NYSE BHP    Golden Minerals Company   NYSE AUMN    Glencore  LON GLEN  Plc   OTC GLNCY   and VALE S A    NYSE VALE   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  4 Mining Stocks in Focus on Unpredictable Iron Ore PricesLast week  iron ore prices logged the largest gain of 2018  climbing nearly 7  till Apr 19  However  the spot markets of this major steel making product went hard into reverse in Friday s closing session Per the Metal Bulletin   the spot price for benchmark 62  fines surged 3 9  to  68 45 a ton  leaving it at the    on Apr 19  People s Bank of China s decision to trim the reserve ratio requirement  RRR  and soaring crude oil prices were primarily the two major catalysts to the rally However  Friday s trading session marked a parabolic like move  with benchmark 62  fines falling 2  to  68 45 a ton  rescinding much of the improvements secured in the prior session Some analysts believe that speculative trading activity in the market backed the price upswing as several rebar traders are now investing in raw materials Nevertheless  iron ore prices might soon spring back due to the enactment of Beijing s monetary easing policy from this Wednesday  apprehension regarding supply shortage  rise in China s construction demand and the continued upswing in oil prices Prices to Gain on Demand OutlookLong repressed iron ore prices will steadily gain momentum due to speculation that demand for steel will shortly improve in the chief user market    China   Iron ore prices stood at  65 05 a ton on Friday  gaining nearly 1 8  over the whole week  Beijing s steel futures touched a five week high on Monday  prompted by declining stockpiles that indicated an improvement in construction demand  Steel demand in China is typically the sturdiest in April and May  when its construction activity is at its busiest phase The strength in Beijing s steel market will likely spread to its raw materials like coking coal and iron ore Iron ore prices on the Dalian Commodity Exchange  climbed 2 7  to 479 50 yuan a ton  this Saturday  Prices are now in a comeback trail  with spot markets being active and trading volumes escalating  especially in the Tangshan and Shandong ports  Additionally  the most active rebar futures are recording gains in the Shanghai trading  thereby boosting iron ore prices northward Furthermore  the new policy to be implemented by China s central bank will likely bolster demand for steel and its inputs going forward On Apr 17  the People s Bank of China surprisingly revealed its intensions to slash the reserve ratio requirement  RRR  by 100 basis points from this Wednesday  Subsequent to this  prices of steel and its raw constituents have been rallying  in anticipation that the monetary loosing will boost economic activity and support Beijing s real estate projects Per a Shanghai based iron ore merchant   What our central bank did will give some support to real estate projects  so there should be   In sync with this  the market foresee that Chinese steel mills will be restocking demand for raw materials  after gaining impetus to boost productivity for wider margins What Else Pulled Prices Up  Amended iron ore production outlook from the world s third largest supplier  BHP Billiton Limited  has spread anxiety among traders since last week The mining behemoth has lately lowered its iron ore production guidance range by 2  for fiscal 2018 to 272 274 million tons  citing its ongoing car dumper reliability problems  The reduction in BHP s output forecast was    per the Shanghai trader  Though the impact on worldwide supplies is restricted  the statement has spread fears of scarcity across the mining belt  aiding the long depressed prices to spring back Moreover  the unexpected bout of enthusiasm in iron ore prices is driven by an upswing in crude oil prices   a major mining sector input cost The  nudged up 0 4  to end at  67 07 per barrel on Apr 12   the highest since December 2014  The surge in benchmark crude stems from escalating Middle Eastern tensions and fears of interruption in supplies  Crude is also riding high on the shoulders of other catalysts like strong global demand and continued production curbs from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies Stocks in FocusDespite the softening in Friday trading  we perceive enough space for iron ore prices to move north in the near term   Over the last month  the Zacks Steel industry has advanced 8 8   outperforming the 0 6  gain recorded by the benchmark S P 500 index Additionally  the industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 4 8  lower than the S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 11 3  The industry s lower than market positioning indicates room for some upside moving ahead Escalating steel demand and northward movement in iron ore prices will likely benefit the stocks grouped under the steel industry  However  contradictory perceptions regarding ongoing speculative moves remain causes for concern We have zeroed in on four mining stocks that investors might include in their portfolio to benefit from a possible upsurge Besides a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

16013,237528,VALE,Stock Exchange  3 Anomalies That Beat The Market ,opinion,"The Stock Exchange is all about trading  Each week we do the following 
Discuss an important issue for traders 
highlight several technical trading methods  including current ideas 
feature advice from top traders and writers  and 
provide a few  minority  reactions from fundamental analysts 
We also have some fun  We welcome comments  links  and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders  If you have some ideas  please join in 
Review  Dangerous Vomiting Camel Formation
Our previous Stock Exchange asked readers if they were reacting to the  that is forming in the market 

And of course  this was meant as a joke  in order to poke fun at traders over fitting the data when developing their trading programs  A glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant 
This Week  3 Anomalies That Beat The Market
An  anomaly  is something that deviates from what is standard  normal  or expected  And in trading and or investing  a market anomaly  or market inefficiency  is a price and or rate of return distortion that seems to contradict the efficient market hypothesis   Beating the market  is something many traders try to do  but few actually succeed  Throughout history  many market anomalies have been touted  Here are three such anomalies that beat the market 
1  Momentum  Eugene Fama
Momentum is the market anomaly whereby rising stock prices tend to rise further  and falling stock prices tend to keep falling  And Eugene Fama is the Nobel Prize winner who came up with the Efficient Market Hypothesis  i e  the theory that says stock prices fully reflect all available information  thereby making it impossible for anyone to consistently beat the market   Fama is not well known or liked in popular media  but he is absolute royalty is the world of academia 
In an interview last week  Fama had some interesting things to say about the momentum anomaly in this interview 

Specifically  he said momentum is the one example of a market anomaly where the data is actually robust enough to make it difficult to deny momentum is a valid anomaly  We use momentum in our trading models  and we ll give some specific examples later in this report 
2  Sell in May  or is it Buy    and then Go Away 
Another longstanding trading mantra anomaly is the idea that traders should  sell in May and go away  in order to avoid seasonal declines  However  popular author and founder of StockTwits  Howard Lindzon  has a different take on this well known adage in his timely article 
 
3  Niche Strategies
One of the few advantages small traders and investors have over  the big guys  is the ability to participate in niche markets  For instance  this can include low volume options markets and thinly trade bond markets  For example  Blue Harbinger s favorite hedge fund is often able to move in and out of thinly traded bond issuances at attractive prices because of the fund s relatively small size  This is an attractive niche space that a  10 billion PIMCO fund is simply too big to participate in with any significant degree of success 
Further still  even when data  proves  that anomalies exist  exploiting them in real life is often more challenging than meets the eye 
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our trading models 

We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And for these reasons  I am changing the  Trade with Jeff  offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50 50 split between Holmes and Athena  Current participants have already agreed to this  Since our costs on Athena are lower  we have also lowered the fees for the combination

This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas  
Holmes  I sold Vipshop  VIPS  on May 1st for around  15 30 per share  Are you familiar with this stock  Blue Harbinger 
Blue Harbinger  Yes  we discussed VIPS when  these shares for around  8 35 back in October  VIPS is a Chinese company  and it trades as an ADR  It s basically an online discount retailer for brand names  They have flash sales where they have a limited amount of brand name products to sell  Did you sell because it s May  and you believe in the mantra  sell in May  and go away  that was covered earlier 
Holmes  No  that s not the reason  As you know  I am a  dip buyer   And as you can see in the chart below  the shares have recovered nicely since they dipped back in October 

BH  Not a bad trade  Holmes  Looks like you made some money  Was there something in the fundamentals you saw that caused you to sell  Here is the Fast Graph 

Holmes  Thanks for asking and sharing  but you know I am a model  and all of my trades are generated systematically and based on the technicals 
BH  True  And again  nice trade  How about you Road Runner any trades this week 
Road Runner  Yes  This week I purchased Brazilian company  VALE  VALE   The company engages in the production and exportation of Iron ore  pellets  manganese  and iron alloys  which are raw materials needed for steelmaking 
BH  Interesting  I know you like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel  And based on the following chart  I can see why you purchased VALE 

Road Runner  That s exactly right  And you also know that my typical holding period is only around 4 weeks  right 
BH  Yes  I did know that too  VALE announced earnings near the end of April  and results were slightly below expectations  which caused the dip  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Road Runner  Thanks for that background  it s always interesting to hear you make up a story to fit the chart 
BH  It s not a made up story that s what happened   was  0 31   0 05 below expectations  and revenue was  8 6B   0 9  Y Y    150M below expectations  Anyway  how about you  Athena any trades 
Athena  Yes  Like Holmes  this week I sold my shares of Vipshop  VIPS   However  unlike Holmes  I bought my shares in early January 

BH  Looks like you didn t do as well as Holmes on your trade  Why d you sell  Athena 
Athena  I sold according to my trading program  It was a combination of time  I usually hold about 17 weeks   price  and some additional propriety factors  I didn t make money on this trade  but I didn t lose much either  Losing less on your losers than you make on your winners is better than the other way around 
BH  True  And thank you  How about you Felix any trades 
Felix  No trades to share this week  but I do have a ranking for you  Specifically  I ran the NASDAQ 100 through my model  and I ve listed the top 20 below 

BH  Interesting ranking  What is the criteria 
Felix  I am a momentum trader  However  my typical holding period is around 66 weeks  on average much longer than the other traders 
BH  I like your top 3 picks this week  They ve certainly had momentum over the last year  and they ve also got the fundamentals to keep running  in my view  How about you  Oscar anything to share this week 
Oscar  Yes  this week I ranked our  diverse and comprehensive ETF universe   Here are the top 20 

BH  I see Oil  USO  ranked at the top  This makes sense considering you are a momentum trend follower trader  and oil prices continue to rally  even though they re still far below where they were in early 2014 
Oscar  Yes  Our version of momentum is more complicated than simply securities that have been rallying  but you have the general idea right 
Conclusion 
Many market anomalies are discussed by traders  but only some of them are supported by data  and they re often challenging to implement in real life  However  as shown in our earlier performance table  we ve been having success with our trades  Further  our various trading programs have the ability to operate in certain niche market spaces  thereby giving us more opportunities to beat the market in terms or risk versus reward  and because our strategies can often add highly valuable diversification benefits because of their lower correlations with the overall market 
Background On The Stock Exchange 
Each week  Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends  Since they are all traders  they love to discuss their best current ideas before the game starts  They like to call this their  Stock Exchange    Check out  for more background   Their methods are excellent  as you know if you have been following the series  Since the time frames and risk profiles differ  so do the stock ideas  You get to be a fly on the wall from my report  I am usually the only human present and the only one using any fundamental analysis 
The result  Several expert ideas each week from traders  and a brief comment on the fundamentals from the human investor  The models are named to make it easy to remember their trading personalities

16018,237533,VALE,Statoil  Signet  Vale  Nintendo And Arcelor Mittal As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate Release         Chicago  IL   March 6  2018    highlights Statoil  OL STL  ASA   NYSE STO   as the Bull of the Day and Signet Jewelers   NYSE SIG   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Vale   NYSE VALE    Nintendo   OTC NTDOY   and Arcelor Mittal   NYSE MT   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Commodity prices have been on the move in recent weeks  Part of that move can be attributed to a weakening US dollar but another big chunk of that is chalked up to increased global demand  With the world economy humming along on all cylinders  demand for energy is on the move  Not only has crude oil been on the move  but other energy prices have been increasing as well  The cold start to winter has natural gas on the move and that s good news for producers like today s Bull of the Day Statoil ASA is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in an industry which ranks in the Top 8  of our Zacks Industry Rank  Statoil ASA  an energy company  explores for  produces  transports  refines  and markets petroleum and petroleum derived products  and other forms of energy in Norway and internationally  The company operates through Development and Production Norway  Development and Production International  Marketing  Midstream and Processing  and Other segments  The company also transports  processes  manufactures  markets  and trades oil and gas commodities  such as crude  condensate  gas liquids  products  natural gas  and liquefied natural gas  LNG   markets and trades electricity and emission rights  and operates refineries  gas processing plants  LNG plant  methanol plant  and crude oil terminals  In addition  the company develops offshore wind  and carbon capture and storage projects  as well as offers other renewable energy and low carbon energy solutions  A series of bullish earnings estimate revisions is the reason for the favorable rank  Over the last sixty days  3 analysts have increased their estimates for the current year  while one has also done so for next year  The moves have had a very bullish effect on the Zacks Consensus Estimates for those periods  The current year consensus number has jumped up from  1 10 to  1 52 while next year s number has gone from  1 07 all the way to  1 44 The bullish moves have helped underpin a move in the stock  After ripping to a new 52 week high over  24 the stock sold off to find support after over shooting the 50 day moving average  A recent spate of buying along the 50 day now has the stock up at  22 79  Another run at the highs could be in the cards as the weather warms and demand for crude heats up  Today s Bear of the Day is unique as it is a retail name but because it s in the jewelry business it faces different risks  I m talking about Signet Jewelers  Signet Jewelers Limited engages in the retail sale of diamond jewelry  watches  and other products in the United States  Canada  Puerto Rico  the United Kingdom  the Republic of Ireland  and the Channel Islands  Its Sterling Jewelers division operates stores in malls and off mall locations primarily under the Kay Jewelers  Kay Jewelers Outlet  Jared The Galleria of Jewelry  Jared Vault  and various mall based regional brands  The bearish attitude in this stock isn t centered on this upcoming quarter or even this year  It s all about next year s estimates  Our Zacks Consensus Estimate has come down from  6 52 to  6 18 for next year despite this year s number looking strong  Estimates for this year have gone from  6 26 to  6 49  So while this upcoming earnings report may be solid  it s the contraction next year down to  6 18 that should have investors worried The bearish news has put the stock under pressure  It s traded south of its 50 day moving average since diving below it after the November earnings report  After making new lows under  48 in early February the stock has poked its head above  50  The 50 day is still providing upside resistance overhead at  53 36  A decent earnings report could break this stock out of its funk  but only if next year s numbers start to improve Additional content King of the Hill  Global Week AheadThis Global Week Ahead opens with a new worry to climb over Markets everywhere must address fallout from President Trump s sudden  but not unexpected  decision  Steel and aluminum tariffs shall be set at 25  and 10   respectively  sometime soon Note to traders  We do not  yet  have tariff specifics Mr  Trump stated those gritty details could be provided sometime this week  Given his past track record of backtracks and broken promises   and a failure to inform his staff of his plans   there is a very meaningful chance this takes longer  There is also a chance  albeit small  these tariffs never materialize However  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has guided us  They will be broadly applied Dr  Peter Navarro   the President s outspoken advisor on these trade matters  participated in the weekend U S  political talk shows  We got tighter confirmation from him  No country exemptions will be provided  But there could be specific industry exceptions Assuming traders get tariff specifics this week  how could equities respond I identified two channels to watch for specific economic and political signals The U S  response How steel and aluminum tariff duties resonate across the country matters a great deal On Tuesday  Texans go to the polls in that state s primary  This vote will be a fresh test on building momentum for the opposition Democratic Party Memories of the Bush steel tariffs of 2002 linger  One study estimated 200K Americans lost their jobs due to those steel tariffs  A quarter of those lost jobs were in the metal manufacturing  machinery and transportation sectors like pipelines that heavily use one of these two metals More Americans lost jobs that year   due to the Bush tariffs   than the total number of employees in the U S  steel industry  2015 census data showed roughly 140K Americans were employed in steel mills  contributing  36 billion to the economy The Global response The dominant school of thought here centers on  Tit for Tat  counter measures The U S  imports 30  of its steel  The biggest steel exporters to the U S A  are Canada  Brazil  South Korea  Mexico and Russia Our top military allies  Canada  South Korea  Japan  and Europe  are among the biggest hit by this  despite this matter being taken up as a  U S  national security issue   This could lead to a new source of internal and external divisiveness These steel export sovereigns likely react with a set of rising tariffs themselves  and not necessarily tariffs on steel or aluminum  Think Wisconsin Harleys  Paul Ryan  and Kentucky Bourbon  Mitch McConnell  and California Blue Jeans  Kevin McCarthy   That was what the Europeans already announced Then  there are the frictions this applies to ongoing NAFTA talks  underway in Mexico this week There are already 160 U S  protections on Chinese steel  So the Chinese are not likely to be the leaders of the counter response movement This means stocks must broadly reckon with retaliatory tariffs  coming from any number of countries simultaneously  but not China In sum   Trade War  worries are likely to be heaped onto equities  fromA variety of metal using manufacturers Voters and politicians in the U S   and Exporters from abroadDoes that sound good This whole steel and aluminum tariff episode recalls the sitcom  King of the Hill  Set in Texas  this is an animated series that follows the life of propane salesman Hank Hill  who lives with his substitute teacher wife Peggy  wannabe comedian son Bobby and deadbeat niece Luanne  Hank has strikingly stereotypical views about God and country  but is unpretentious and sees the world simply It s simple  Yeah  Maybe  it s too simple The deep simple answer  if you are looking for it  is to close the yawning U S  Federal budget deficit  That WOULD shrink the huge U S  trade deficit Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks Watch the trading activity closely on any number of momentum stocks out there  which benefit from  Synchronized Global Growth   Do they take a hit from this news  We shall see Here are three that look very attractive  from a Zacks Rank perspective Vale  This is the

16019,237534,VALE,Where To Invest To Ride Out The Stock Market Volatility,opinion," 1     Trump s Tariffs and Impact On The Market 5     2002 Tariffs  Will Steel Price Surge Again  9     NAFTA and Inflation Pressure Concerns 15     Where To Invest and What To Stay Away From 22     Are The Large Cap Companies Overheating  26     Episode Roundup  TCEHY  SINA  TWTR  FB  QABA  UCBI  VALE  MT Welcome to Episode  122 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast 
Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
In this episode  Zacks Chief Equity Strategist  and PhD economist  John Blank  joins the discussion on where  if anywhere  investors can hide out during market volatility 
Trade Wars  What s That 
Suddenly  there are a lot of unknowns  especially on trade  Not only has President Trump announced that he is going to put new tariffs on steel and aluminum  but the EU has already readied a list of retaliation tariffs if the US goes through with the move 
At the same time  there s also discussion about NAFTA renegotiations  trade talk with the UK  now that they re leaving the EU their trade deals have to be renegotiated  and there are other surprise events like White House Economic Advisor Gary Cohn resigning 
This has caused volatility to return to the stock market 
Who Could Get Hurt
Retaliation from the EU and Asia could come in the form of tariffs on prized US consumer goods like Harley Davidson motorcycles  food products and popular shoes and clothing 
Other big equipment manufacturers  like Boeing  NYSE BA  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   could also get hit if their input costs rise 
If you re feeling nervous  is there anywhere to hide that might be smoother waters 
Stock and ETFs that Might Give Investors the Edge 
1        John likes some of the big materials plays as a contrarian investment like Vale   NYSE VALE    a big Brazilian iron ore manufacturer  which ships iron ore to China  It s cheap  with a forward P E of just 11 and no one is paying any attention to it right now  It s a contrarian pick 
2        Sina   NASDAQ SINA   owns Weibo  the Twitter of China  It s used domestically in China  How will it be impacted by a trade war  It definitely won t be as severe as someone making a consumer product like an automobile 
3        Tencent   OTC TCEHY   owns WeChat  which is China s equivalent to Facebook  It has nearly a billion users  Much like Sina  it shouldn t see huge impacts from a trade war on its business 
4        Facebook   NASDAQ FB   also doesn t make a product that could see a tariff unless the EU decides to tax Instagram in some way  But that s unlikely 
5        Similarly  Twitter   NYSE TWTR   operates on the Internet as well  It should be able to ride out a trade war 
Tracey also likes the small community banks  which mostly provide services to local customers and businesses through commercial loans and mortgages 
You can buy an ETF with a basket of the community banks in the First Trust NASDAQ Community Bank ETF  QABA  
What other industries and stocks do Tracey and John like  and dislike  if a trade war breaks out 
Tune into this week s podcast to find out 
 In full disclosure  the author of this article owns shares of TCEHY and FB in her personal portfolio

16044,237559,VALE,Foreign Stock Roundup  TOT  STO   GSK Earnings Impress  BP   SNY Disappoint,opinion,Global stocks were weighed down by massive losses and heightened volatility on Wall Street last week  A spike in yearly wage increases triggered inflationary concerns and boosted bond yields  leading to U S  stocks entering correction territory  These events had a widespread impact with stocks across global bourses incurring losses Inflationary Concerns Drag STOXX LowerMarkets across Europe finished in the red last Monday  Investors were weighed down by concerns that inflation would increase at a faster than expected pace  The STOXX 600 lost 1 5  with nearly all major sectors and exchanges closing with losses  A 2 9  annual increase in U S  wages was the likely trigger for worldwide losses  Financial services  stocks were the worst losers for the day and the sector declined 2  The STOXX 600 declined 2 3  last Tuesday  with nearly all major exchanges and sectors

VALE    Fibria Celulose S A    NYSE FBR    TechTarget  Inc    NASDAQ TTGT   and CBIZ  Inc    NYSE CBZ   4 Affordable Breakout Stocks for Stupendous ReturnsSelecting breakout stocks is probably one of the most favored techniques among active investors  The idea behind this kind of stock selection is to determine which stocks are trading within a narrow channel  These stocks are to be bought as soon as they move above this band and sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum However  market watchers warn against incorrectly timing such a move  This is because of the significant risk of identifying stock movements as breakouts  which in reality are not so  At the same time  when this strategy is utilized judiciously  it yields substantive gains  which is the reason why it remains popular Spotting a Breakout StockThe first step to selecting the right breakout stock is to calculate its support and resistance level  A support level is the lower bound for stock movement while a resistance level refers to the maximum price which it trades within over a considerable period In other words  demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level  which means most traders are willing to sell it  At the resistance level  most traders are willing to go long on the stock  which means that they would like to add them to their portfolios  The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or those that have just broken above the resistance level Identifying Whether It s for RealStocks which have breached their resistance level should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price

16046,237561,VALE,Iron Ore Stalls On Record Chinese Imports  Inventories,opinion,"Iron ore may have reached a new inflection point with a price rally coming to a halt in January and some related stocks consolidating near multi year highs  When I last made an iron ore trade in September  2017  I was responding to a surprise projection from the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  that suggested a top in iron ore  From that post I concluded the following 

If the RBA is correct  iron ore is at risk of revisiting the lows from June  Also  at best  a fresh rally should only carry iron ore back to the high from August  Translating these bounds into short term stock moves  the upside risk is around 5  and the downside opportunity is about 20   The long side of the pairs trade is mainly a hedge in case the RBA s expectations prove incorrect  I am more willing to bias to the downside given the iron ore inventories that have piled up  High inventories have been a story all year but did not prevent the relief rally over the summer  Current inventory levels were last seen over 5 years ago 

I bought call options on BHP Billiton  LON BLT   BHP  and put options on Rio Tinto  LON RIO  as part of a pairs trade  While iron ore prices continued to drift down to an October low  both RIO and BHP went into a multi month consolidation  the pairs trade slowly wilted on the vine  A major breakout in December saved the long side of the trade and allowed me to salvage some value 
BHP Billiton broke out in December from a multi month consolidation period  The resulting rally was nearly relentless for a month before coming to a screeching halt at a 2 1 2 year high 

Source  FreeStockCharts com
Rio Tinto followed the same breakout and rally pattern as BHP 
As the chart below shows  August has indeed held as a top for iron ore  However  the price decline from that top did not quite reach the June low  In early January  2018  the price of iron ore completed a 2 month rally by peaking at the high made last August  If the upward momentum does not return soon  2017 s peak in February will loom large from a seasonal standpoint 

The price of iron ore may have hit a peak as the latest rally hit a wall at August s high
For my latest trade on iron ore  I took a lesson from the last round and decided to try a one way bet first  The apparent end of the U S  dollar s collapse motivated me to make a bet against a new breakout for iron ore and purchase put options on BHP  If a fresh breakout does unfold  I will rush to play that move with a fistful of call options on RIO 
The U S  dollar index is at a 3 year low 
Price projections for iron ore are currently all over the place  as usual   so it makes sense to prepare for a breakout even though my base case is a pullback  Here is a sample of projections from different sources 
Reuters 

The SGX futures curve isn t currently suggesting a rapid retreat in prices  with the April contract at  72 20 a tonne and December s at  68 43 This is in stark contrast to the forecast from the Australian government  which expects the iron ore price to drop 20 percent in 2018 from 2017 to an average  51 50 a tonne 

Reuters 

Benchmark 62 percent grade iron ore for delivery to top market China will average  62 a ton in 2018  down from around  71 last year  according to the median estimate in a Reuters poll of 18 analysts 

Business Insider 

We  Citibank  are bullish on iron ore for  the March quarter of 2018  and expect prices to rise to over  80 a tonne in the next 1 2 months An acceleration of steel mills  restocking activity around the Chinese New Year should support physical demand for iron ore   Over the medium term  Citi sees the benchmark falling back to  65 a tonne in Q2 before sliding to  60 a tonne in Q3 

Bloomberg  Zhao Chaoyue  an analyst at China Merchants Futures 

 The restocking cycle   where mills build up their raw materials inventory in preparation for output restarts   has also come to an end   Benchmark iron prices will decline to average  50 between April and June  according to Barclays s Dane Davis  while ING has said they ll sink below  70 this quarter and are seen at  55 in the second to fourth quarters 

I think the bearish case is more compelling as Chinese inventories are at a record high  According to Bloomberg   stockpiles stand at 154 4 million tons  enough to cover more than 50 days  of imports   The RBA s call for a top in the price of iron ore still makes sense 
Record imports have contributed to this pile up in iron ore  According to Reuters  China imported a record 1 07 billion tonnes of iron ore in 2017  The monthly chart below shows a steady creep higher in imports to close out 2017 with an estimated surge in imports for January 
China s import of iron ore crept to a record to close out 2017  This year is expected to start with fireworks 
I am fully on board with the synchronized global growth story  but it sure looks like the market for iron ore has already fully anticipated China s contribution to that story  It is hard to imagine prices for iron ore pushing higher against the stockpile 
There are two other iron ore plays that I am putting aside for now  VALE SA  NYSE VALE  and Cleveland Cliffs  NYSE CLF  
VALE s consolidation period last year occurred at a lower level than RIO and BHP  The subsequent breakout took VALE to a 3  year high and a near V like recovery from a precipitous slide from September  2014 to February  2016  CLF is struggling  In February  2017  CLF tested resistance from the 2009  then  historic low  The stock sold off from there and did not stop until it had lost half its value  CLF is now in the middle of a fresh sell off triggered by last week s earnings 
Vale topped out early in January but a Bollinger  Band  BB  squeeze may be in the works  The resolution of this squeeze should be quite powerful  up or down 

Cleveland Cliffs is suddenly struggling again  Post earnings sellers pushed the stock below 50 and 200DMA support 
Be careful out there

But stockpiles have moved in a sawtooth pattern in the past year and the latest figures continue the pattern  meaning investors should avoid viewing them as firm evidence that a supply glut is over  says  Standard Chartered   LON STAN  metals analyst Nicholas Snowdon 
Investors seeking signs that the market is tightening should watch inventories stored in Shanghai and imports into China  Snowdon says  but both indicators also sent positive signals this week  refined copper imports into China rose for a third straight month following April s 18 month low 
A falling dollar  surging investor interest and stronger economies are supporting metals prices  but Snowdon believes it will take time for the refiner copper market to tighten following flat H1 demand growth

16087,237602,VALE,How Global Growth And Infrastructure Are Driving Commodities,opinion,"As a general rule  the most successful man in life is the man who has the best information
The global economy is booming again after years in the doldrums  commodities are back in a big way  and metals prices are for the most part  way up 
In our last article showing how commodities are the place to be in 2018  we looked at five drivers  inflation  the low dollar  economic growth  the relative undervalue of commodities versus other sectors  and tightness of supply  This article expands on the economic growth argument  and explains how commodity prices are being moved by a bevy of infrastructure projects around the world   all demanding  yuge   as Donald Trump would say  amounts of metals 
But we ll also talk about how insecurity of supply has created a climate of uncertainty around commodities  fuelled by increasing trade tensions that could lead to tariffs and quotas  driving up the prices of some imported metals  further exacerbating supply demand imbalances  The US is finally starting to get that it must reduce its reliance on foreign metal suppliers  which is great for domestic exploration and mining  But first  let s talk about global growth and what it means for commodities 
Three quarters of the world is growing
A year ago the global economy was stagnant following the recession of 2007 09  an overhang from the debt crisis in Europe  and slowing Chinese growth which had seen double digit GDP numbers throughout the 2000s  According to the International Monetary Fund  75  of the world is now enjoying a full recovery  The IMF predicts global growth to hit 3 7  this year  the fastest rate since 2010 
The World Bank says it s the first year since the financial crisis that the global economy will operate at or near capacity  Emerging markets will see the lion s share of growth  4 5   while advanced economies including the US  Japan and the EU will grow at 2 2   China is expected to grow between 6 and 7   India  Ghana  Ethiopia and the Philippines will grow more than China  and eight of the 10 fastest growing countries this year are likely to be in Africa   
Goldman Sachs was quoted saying that  rising commodity prices will create a virtuous circle  improving the balance sheets of producers and lenders  and expanding credit in emerging markets that will  in turn  reinforce global economic growth  
At the end of 2017 the Bloomberg Commodity Index  which measures returns on 22 raw materials  had the longest rally on record dating back 27 years to 1991 

The index was propelled by major yearly gains in copper  which had its best month in 30 years in December  oil  which moved above  60 a barrel for the first time in over two years  and gold  up for the second year in a row  by 12 5  in 2017  The roll continued into the New Year  with the index hitting a three year high on Jan  5 due to what the Financial Times described as the global economy s best period of growth  measured in manufacturing activity  since the 2008 financial crisis 
At this year s World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  the tone was vastly different from the past two years when everyone was talking about the bear market for commodities and the oil price crash 
 In panel discussions  interviews  and conversations on the evening cocktail circuit at the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvedere  it was hard to find a bearish voice    
Key infrastructure metals all rising 
Building large  capital intensive public and private infrastructure projects all requires mined metals  in particular steel for bridges and buildings  aluminum  copper for wiring  and inputs used for making steel  coking coal  iron ore  manganese and vanadium  Nickel is also used in large quantities for stainless steel 
The outlook in 2018 for these commodities is for the most part bullish  A  states that a correction in iron ore prices   due primarily to a supply glut   will be offset by jumps in other base metals including lead  nickel and zinc 

A week ago mining stocks outperformed overall gains in US stock markets following the Feb  5 correction  with investors piling into mining heavyweights like BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd ADR  NYSE BHP   VALE SA  NYSE VALE   and Anglo American  LON AAL   The optimism was spurred by global demand for raw materials ahead of the annual Chinese New Year holiday  Copper rose above  3 24 a pound  nickel was at 14 100 a tonne  the highest since May 2015  and zinc hit a near decade high of  3 567 a tonne  Even the iron ore price which many expect to pull back  rose to a five week best of  78 25 a tonne 
Speaking recently with Robert Friedland of Ivanhoe Mines  US Global Investors CEO Frank Holmes laid out the bullish case for copper  noting the ever increasing demand for the red metal not only in industry  but electrical vehicles which consume three to four times as much copper as gas powered cars and trucks 
Friedland pointed to aluminum  cobalt  nickel  platinum and scandium as among the biggest beneficiaries in the shift to EVs and clean energy  Holmes mentioned a few other key trends that are driving commodities higher  including the global purchasing managers index  PMI  being near a seven year high  construction confidence in the Euro Zone  and construction spending in the US which hit a record  1 257 trillion in November 
As usual a crucial factor is China  the world s largest consumer and producer of metals  On Feb  8 China s copper concentrate imports increased 25  from the same period last year  continuing the trend from 2017 when copper imports hit a new high due partly due to Beijing banning of scrap metal and other recyclables 

The Chinese have also been importing record amounts of iron ore   102 8 million tonnes in September 2017  China wants higher grade ore because it boosts steel making productivity and reduces emissions 
China s iron ore imports rose in January even as steel mills are idled as part of a government drive against pollution and stockpiles at ports reached new peaks above 150 million tonnes  The country consumes two thirds of the world s iron ore shipments and produces as much steel as the rest of the world combined 
And for all the talk of the coal industry being on its knees  prices of the fossil fuel are up and so are US coal exports  Platts reported that in 2017  US coal exports rose by 60  between 2016 and 2017  to 88 million tonnes  Thermal coal prices in 2017 were the highest in Northern Europe since 2012    84 77 a tonnes  while met coal prices used in steelmaking averaged  173 95 tonne  up 39  from 2016 
New commodities super cycle  
Many investors are wondering whether we ve begun a new commodities super cycle 
 Purchasing Managers  Index   PMI   surveys have been developed in many countries to provide purchasing professionals  business decision makers and economic analysts with an accurate and timely set of data to help better understand industry conditions  PMI data are based on monthly surveys of carefully selected companies  These provide an advance indication of what is really happening in the private sector economy by tracking variables such as output  new orders  stock levels  employment and prices across the manufacturing  construction  retail and service sectors  The PMI surveys are based on fact  latest PMI s from Markit Economics   not opinion  and are among the first indicators of economic conditions published each month  The data are collected using identical methods in all countries so that international comparisons may be made  Markit Economics 

Here is a link to more global PMI charts from Yardini Research 
 Super cycles are extended periods of historically high global growth  lasting a generation or more  driven by increasing trade  high rates of investment  urbanisation and technological innovation  characterised by the emergence of large  new economies  first seen in high catch up growth rates across the emerging world   Helmut Reisen shiftingwealthblogspot com
As mentioned  Goldman Sachs  the influential investment bank  thinks that rising commodities prices will expand credit in emerging markets  thus creating more economic growth  Back in 2011 I wrote about how developing economies will boost the commodities supercycle  with the drivers in these countries being population growth  urbanization and the growth of the middle class  all of which spur consumption   of cars  fridges  smart phones  etc  These minerals have to come from somewhere 
In Daily Reckoning Australia  Callum Newman observes that there is some serious money right now sloshing around waiting to find a home  Examples include Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince wanting to spend US 500 billion to build a new city  and Australia s  130 billion Future Fund  Callum presages a new mining boom in Australia by pointing out that between 2010 and 2025 infrastructure spending in Asia will hit US 5 3 trillion  with China s total spend increasing 250  and for the Philippines  300   All of this bodes well for Australia  a major exporter of iron ore and coal  used to make steel needed for bridges  roads and airports  plus gold and other minerals 
Maxwell Gold  director of investment strategy and research at ETF Securities  agrees that we are on the cusp of a new commodities super cycle  which he points out usually last 10 to 15 years  
Gold says we are currently at the last phase of the current business cycle  lasting 5 to 7 years  where commodities tend to outperform stocks  
 The Fed and other central banks want to increase interest rates to slow down and control economic growth to prevent the economy from overheating too much  That typically goes hand in hand with a period where there s increased demand for inputs  raw materials and resources   primarily commodities  It s very typical to see commodity prices increase when we re in a rate hiking cycle and interest rates are rising  
Infrastructure engine revving up 
Most of us have heard of Donald Trump s  1 trillion infrastructure plan to fix American s crumbling cities  touted during his 2016 election campaign  A year into his mandate  that spending has been elevated to  1 7 trillion over the next decade  When or whether it comes to fruition is still fuzzy   the plan being presented to Congress involves  200 billion in federal funds  an amount being disputed by Democrats  and could involve a gas tax to pay for it   what is interesting is what happened to commodities after Trump was elected  A month after the election was decided on November 8  2016  oil and most base metals received a  Trump bump   as shown in the graph below by MINING com   proving that the promise of infrastructure spending has a direct impact on commodity prices   albeit in the short term 

The effect of the US infrastructure plan on metals prices in 2018 is difficult to say  but one thing is for sure  the need is desperate  A 2017 report from the American Society of Civil Engineers gave America s infrastructure a D  and found that the US is facing  4 6 trillion in infrastructure investment needs over the next 10 years  The report looked at 16 categories including bridges  schools  railways and ports 
 Deteriorating infrastructure is impeding our ability to compete in the thriving global economy  and improvements are necessary to ensure our country is built for the future   according to the ASCE  Consulting firm PwC estimated in a comprehensive infrastructure report that the US is looking at a total funding gap between 2016 and 2025 of  1 4 trillion  with the vast majority of funds needed for surface transportation   1 1 trillion funding gap  
North of the 49th  Canada also plans to roll out a major infrastructure spend  though far less ambitious than the one planned in the US  The federal government s  5 4 billion infrastructure package in transit and water systems for provinces and cities was recently extended from two to five years  Ottawa and the Yukon Territory are partners in a promise to spend  360 million for road access to mineralized areas in the Yukon  including 650 kilometers of new roads and road upgrades 
The Quebec government has called for the province to invest about  1 3 billion in infrastructure over the next five years to attract  22 billion in private sector investment  The scaled down  Plan Nord  aims to access untapped deposits of iron ore  copper  nickel  zinc and other minerals in Quebec s far north  Next door in Ontario  the provincial government is moving forward on an all season road to the Ring of Fire  allowing roads in to a wealth of minerals in the remote region including chromite  nickel  copper  vanadium  zinc  platinum and gold 
Looking globally  Futurism put together a graphic of the world s largest megaprojects currently under construction  They are 
the International Space Station   150 billion
Al Maktoum International Airport  Dubai   82 billion
South to North Water Transfer Project  China   78 billion
California High Speed Rail   70 billion
Dubailand   64 billion
London Crossrail Project   23 billion
Beijing Daxing International Airport   13 billion
Jubail II  Saudi Arabia   11 billion
Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge   10 6 billion
In terms of commodities demand  though  the most impactful country is  without a doubt  China 
 More than 2 000 years ago  China s imperial envoy Zhang Qian helped to establish the Silk Road  a network of trade routes that linked China to Central Asia and the Arab world  The name came from one of China s most important exports   silk  And the road itself influenced the development of the entire region for hundreds of years 
In 2013  China s president  Xi Jinping  proposed establishing a modern equivalent  creating a network of railways  roads  pipelines  and utility grids that would link China and Central Asia  West Asia  and parts of South Asia   McKinsey   Company 
China s One Belt  One Road is a  900 billion initiative meant to open channels between China and its neighbors  mostly through infrastructure investments  China long ago put a lock on much of Africa s vast resources  The rationale is to increase trade in order to bolster poorer countries to China s south  and foster new markets that will keep China s economy going strong  According to the World Economic Forum   Beijing says it will ultimately lend as much as  8 trillion for infrastructure in 68 countries   which represents a third of global GDP 

And there s more  Last April President Xi Jinping announced a grand scheme to transform a backwater called Xiongan  south of Beijing  into a city triple the size of New York  Consulting firm Wood Mackenzie estimates that building the city will use 20 million tonnes of steel  400 000 tonnes of aluminum  and 250 000 tonnes of copper during the first 10 years of construction 
Are two Belt and Roads better than one  Australia  the US  India and Japan are planning a joint regional infrastructure scheme as an alternative to China s multibillion dollar Belt and Road Initiative 
Supply insecurity
Completing all of these infrastructure projects will require millions  maybe billions of tonnes of iron ore  coal  steel  copper  vanadium  cement and asphalt  But what is often lost in the discussion about commodities is where these materials will come from and whether the countries requiring them will be able to get their hands on the metals in time and in the quantities needed  I ve written before on the metallurgical Achilles heel of the United States  which has allowed the depletion of four critical metals  chromium  cobalt  manganese and platinum  Added to this list should be vanadium  which is becoming increasingly important as an ingredient  vanadium pentoxide  in vanadium flow batteries used in renewable energy storage 
The U S  is dependent on South Africa  the politically unstable Democratic Republic of Congo  DRC  and an increasingly unreliable and aggressive China for over half of its supply of what it considers strategic or critical minerals 
 As resource constraints tighten globally  countries that depend heavily on ecological services from other nations may find that their resource supply becomes insecure and unreliable  This has economic implications   in particular for countries that depend upon large amounts of ecological assets to power their key industries or to support their consumption patterns and lifestyles   Dr  Mathis Wackernagel  President of the Global Footprint Network
The United States has no producing manganese or vanadium mines  Stillwater Mining is the only American miner of platinum group metals  and there is just one company in Michigan that produced cobalt in 2017 as a by product of nickel and copper 
Cobalt is an interesting metal to look at because it demonstrates the stark and growing disparity between supply and demand  reflected in a massive recent price spike  Over the past year cobalt prices have nearly doubled from US 47 500 a tonne to  80 000 tonne 
As a key ingredient in lithium ion batteries that power electric vehicles  cobalt is used in both nickel cobalt aluminum  NCA  based battery cells used by Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  and nickel manganese cobalt  NMC  batteries employed by other EV manufacturers   cobalt is in high demand by battery makers 
Tesla says it wants to make half a million EVs a year  and has repeatedly stated that it plans to source the cobalt for its Gigafactory exclusively from North America  But the numbers don t add up  According to the US Geological Survey Canada and the US together produce only 4  of the world s cobalt supply   around the amount Tesla would need for just one of its models  In 2017 the US and Canada produced 4 950 tonnes of cobalt against the world total of 110 000 tonnes  How about metal in the ground  North American reserves stand at 273 000 tonnes versus 3 5Mt in the Congo and 1 2Mt in Australia 
But there s another problem with cobalt supply  Around 97  of it is mined as a by product of copper and nickel  so in order for cobalt mining to be economic  the prices of nickel and copper need to be high enough to make mining the deposits economic  60  of the world s cobalt reserves and resources are in the DRC  which uses child labour and is highly unstable  One of the largest African copper cobalt mines is Tenke Fungurume  in the DRC  US copper miner Freeport MacMoran used to hold 56  of the mine  with Lundin Mining and Congolese state owner miner Gecamines owning the rest  but in 2016 China Molybdenum acquired Freeport s portion for  2 65 billion   the largest ever investment in the country ",2018-02-25,Richard Mills,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-global-growth-and-infrastructure-are-driving-commodities-200293917,200293917

16143,237658,VALE,Analysts Predict 4 Rate Hikes In 2018,opinion,"Given the time of year and the prospect that a number of big US money managers have taken an extended break this week and with S P 500 implied volatility  i e  the  VIX  now back below 10   currently 9 86    7 5    one can say that the leads we have today for Asia are about as upbeat for risk appetite as the bulls could hope for 
Financial conditions have become even more accommodative  and of course this just compounds the notion that the Federal Reserve are not only looking to hike rates in December  now a 97  implied probability   but the pricing in the fed funds future through to end 2018 and 2019 also looks too pessimistic and throws weight to calls from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs that the Fed will hike four times in 2018  So  we look around the markets and see the USD index lower by 0 2   we can see high yield and investment grade credit spreads tightening by 4 and 1 basis points respectively and as mentioned implied volatility in the S P 500 has dropped below 10   with the S P 500 gaining 0 6  and momentarily breaking 2600  It must be said that volumes  predictably  have been on the light side and some 11  below the 30 day average  We can also see the Dow Transport index and Russell 2000 index gaining 0 9  and 0 8  respectively 
Perhaps two aspects that dampen the mood somewhat have been the 3bp rise in  real   or inflation adjusted  US 5 year Treasury yields and at 31bp is now at the highest level since January 2016   clearly this move higher in real rates is not yet seen as an equity negative   The eyes of the fixed income world  however  is on the yield curve and the pick up in social media interest around this rampant flattening of the 2 s vs 5 s or 5 s vs 30 s Treasury curve has many divided on what the market is truly saying about future growth and inflation trends in the US economy 
The fact we have seen such aggressive selling in the front end of the Treasury curve is obviously the driver here and we do question how much more upside there is  specifically in 2 year Treasury s  which at 1 77  are the highest levels since 2008 and coincidentally now higher than Australia s 2 year government bond yields   the first time since December 2000  Taking the 2  v 10 s Treasury curve in isolation  more rational thinkers have seen this as a sign of strong growth in the US and global economy  but of course the bigger concern is whether there is a breaking point for broader risk sentiment and what level this occurs at  as an inverted curve  i e  the 2 year Treasury commands a higher yield than that of 10 year Treasury s  has prophesied each recession in the US economy over the past 50 years  source  BoA ML   The 2 10 s spread is 3bp lower on the day at 58bp 
Emerging markets are flying and this is where traders are really generating outperformance  Asia  in particular  is looking super strong  with the Hang Seng  H shares and CSI 300 all on fire yesterday and on sizeable volumes too  The Hang Seng is up 35 5  year to date  40 7  on a total return basis  and remains the poster child of trend and momentum  which will naturally happen when Tencent  with its 12 5  weighting on the index has rallied 126  year to date  There is a genuine chase for performance from active money managers here and looking at the ASHR ETF  CSI 300 ETF  and EEM ETF  Emerging market ETF   which are trading up 2 9  and 1 4  respectively on the NYSE and one can sense that it should be another upbeat open for Asia and any pullbacks through this week will be supported 
We can throw in constructive moves in Europe too  with the DAX gaining 0 8  and where a close in my opinion through 13 186 indicates increasing  or initiating  long positions in this index  Aussie SPI futures did trade to 6006 overnight  and are not far off these highs now and sit up 19 points  taking our ASX 200 opening call to 5992  Whether the bulls have got the ability and the impetus to push the local index through to close above 6000 is yet to be seen  but there are certainly enough in the leads for this to materialise  A strong session in Japan  Hong Kong  and China would help here and lift S P 500 futures 
We can see that in the commodity complex that it is really only spot iron  closing  1 5   that has shown weakness  Elsewhere  we have seen iron ore futures close up 1   while steel and coking coal futures have both rallied strongly  closing up 2  and 4  respectively  Copper is up 1   while US crude has closed up 0 8   so with these leads in commodities we see the S P 500 energy sector up 0 3   most of the buying in US equities were in tech   while BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd ADR  NYSE BHP  looks set to open 0 8  higher and we see VALE SA  NYSE VALE  s US listing up nearly 4   So a good day for small caps locally ",2017-11-22,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200267408,200267408

16147,237662,VALE,BHP Billiton To Grow On Solid Productivity Amid Macro Woes,opinion,"On Dec 19  Zacks Investment Research upgraded BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd    NYSE BHP   to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  from a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Going by the Zacks model  companies with a Zacks Rank  3 are likely to perform in line with the broader market over the next two to three months 
On a quarter to date basis  BHP Billiton s shares have yielded a return of 6 8   marginally outperforming 6 1  growth recorded by the  

You can see  
Inside Story
BHP Billiton has been steadily reducing its operating costs on the back of improved mining productivity  and lower capital and exploration expenses 
In first quarter fiscal 2018  ended September 2017   the company s aggregate copper output reached record high  Gross copper volume improved 14  year over year  driven by sturdy yield from the company s Escondida  Olympic Dam and Antamina copper mines 
Also  BHP Billiton has reaffirmed its iron core productivity in the range of 239 243 Mt  estimating year over year upside of 3 5   for fiscal 2018  ending June 2018   Moreover  we notice that the company s exploration and capital expenses in fiscal 2017 plunged 32  year over year to  5 2 billion 
BHP Billiton also finances numerous growth projects backed by its solid free cash flow generation  The company has been steadily boosting its liquidity on the back of more efficient operations and increasing productivity gains  In the past five years  BHP Billiton has accumulated productivity gains worth  12 billion  Notably  another  2 billion gain is estimated to be realized by the end of fiscal 2019 
BHP Billiton also intends to provide increased returns to shareholders in the near future  The company s aggregate dividend payout in fiscal 2017 was  4 4 billion and its board of directors  in August 2017  hiked the quarterly dividend by 10 cents to 43 cents per share  BHP Billiton s minimum dividend payout rate is currently 50   These moves highlight the company s balance sheet strength and capability to generate adequate amount of free cash flow 
However  declining iron ore prices might continue to mar revenues and profitability of mining giants like BHP Billiton  Over the last three months  price of this major steel making component dipped nearly 2 2  to  70 84 per ton  as of Dec 19  2017   This downside has primarily stemmed from bearish market segments 
China is currently cutting back steel production for shutting down more polluting steel plants as well as reducing illegal production  Nevertheless  we notice that lower steel demand in the country is making investors believe that iron ore prices might drop further  Also  excess supply of iron ore in the global market and adequate steel inventories in China increase the scope of price slump in the quarters ahead 
Additionally  environmental issues such as natural disasters  abnormal rainfall  shortage of skilled workers and destabilizing industrial infrastructure continue to threaten the company s performance  For instance  high rainfall due to Cyclone Debbie  April 2017  largely hampered power  logistics  access and services of the company s coal mines located in Queensland s Bowen Basin 
The mining industry is highly competitive and dominated by few major mining companies like BHP Billiton  Vale S A    NYSE VALE    Rio Tinto  LON RIO  plc   NYSE RIO   and Glencore  LON GLEN  Plc   OTC GLNCY    The number of new entrants is almost limited due to huge start up costs involved  In order to maintain competency in the industry  BHP Billiton makes costly investments to maximize the output and minimize productivity expenses  However  these investments increase the company s overall debt burden 5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now

16240,237755,VALE,ASX 200 Gains 4 2  In October,opinion,"We close out the page on what has been an eventful October for Aussie investors  especially those who have successfully positioned portfolios in healthcare  up 6 2  on the month   energy   6   and consumer discretionary   5 8   names  Although  to be fair  all sectors have found good buying through October 

The ASX 200 has seen a gain of 4 2  on the month  which when we price other global markets in AUD terms has actually seen the local market perform favorably relative to US and European equity markets  Chinese and Japanese equities are where one has really generated really strong performance through October  although there are signs these markets could see consolidation and even modest headwinds in the short term  We can also go into the micro side of things and see some outrageous gains in individual names  with Blackmores Ltd  AX BKL   Galaxy Resources Ltd  AX GXY  and A2 Milk Company Ltd  AX A2M  the three standouts  with a 33 9   33 1  and 32  return respectively 
Let s see if we can see a similar return in November  although seasonally November is not a brilliant month for the ASX 200 and while we saw the index return  2 3  last November  if we go back further we have seen the Aussie index fall in November for the prior six consecutive years  by an average of  2 2   Tactically  any pullbacks remain a buying opportunity though  and that view is negated of course if the news flow radically changes  as we know December tends to be a strong time for global equity appreciation and we can see the ASX 200 closing up in December for the past five years 

We find ourselves staring at a fairly damp and uninspiring lead for the session ahead  The S P 500 has closed 0 3  lower  with breadth painting quite a negative state of affairs  with 69  of stocks closing lower on the day  Tech  energy and REITS have outperformed and this makes sense given we have seen good buying in the back end of the US Treasury curve  with the 10 year Treasury lower by four basis points at 2 36   which has also weighed on the USD  with the US dollar index lower by 0 5  
There have been a number of factors worthy of note  but it seems traders have focused on comments from US Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin that the Treasury Department  doesn t see a lot of demand on ultra long bonds   A Bloomberg article reported that  the House is said to be discussing a phase in of corporate tax cuts   and this enforced a growing feeling on trading desks that when  if  passed  corporate tax cuts are likely to be incremental and gradual over a potential five year timeframe  In the latter stages of the session though  Steven Mnuchin  again reported in Bloomberg  pushed back on this view detailing the  objective is not to have corporate tax phase in  and  we will see  
Also weighing on sentiment to an extent  has been headlines around Paul Manafort s indictment and even more so Trump s former advisor  George Papadopoulos  who has actually pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his involvement with Russian officials  Also  further speculation in a New York Times article that Jerome Powell will get the Fed chair role when disclosed this week  and this has added to the flatter Treasury curve  In economic data we have been handed fairly uninspiring inflation reports from Germany and the US  with the US reporting core PCE at 1 3   which was in line with expectations  but has seen a few question whether the 82  probability of a December hike  from the Federal Reserve  should perhaps be closer to 70  to 75  
One interesting factor is we have seen both US and European inflation expectations moving a touch lower and this won t help the  reflation  trade  which has been so influential in markets of late  Perhaps ironically  the drop in inflation expectations comes amid another move higher in Brent   0 7   and US crude   0 5    which are clearly benefiting from rhetoric from OPEC  Russia and the Saudi s  surrounding extending the production quota agreement well into 2018  When do we start to think energy will start to play into higher inflationary reads at a headline level given on a 12 month basis Brent is up 10 4   US crude 4  and gasoline  27  
More closer to home  amid some portfolio tweaks given it is month end and where we see the broader ASX 200 opening at 5915   4 points   one should keep an eye on the ASX 200 energy sector this morning as the sector is trading at the highest levels since August 2015 and could get a further boost from moves in the barrel  It perhaps isn t such a positive backdrop for the materials space with spot iron ore closing at  58 75   2 2   and there would be some eyeing a further move for a test of the year s low of  53 36  Dalian iron ore  steel and coking coal futures closed  0 8    1 3  and  1 1  respectively and as a guide we have seen VALE SA  NYSE VALE  s US listing glower by close to 3   BHP Billiton Ltd  AX BHP  looks set to open on a slightly lower footing  with the Adherium Ltd  AX ADR  lower by 9c ",2017-10-31,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200257191,200257191

16247,237762,VALE,Iron Ore Pairs Trade Lags Commodity s Plunge,opinion,"The market must be expecting an imminent rebound in the price of iron ore 
Almost two weeks ago  I proposed a pairs trade going short Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  versus long BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP  as a way to play the top in the price of iron ore predicted by the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA   Since then  iron ore has fallen from around  68 to  63 for a 7  loss  Yet  RIO is only down 3   BHP is down more meaningfully with a 4  loss 
RIO is clinging to support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  while BHP broke down below its 50DMA support   For comparison  Vale SA  NYSE VALE  is down 7  and Cliffs Natural Resources  NYSE CLF  is down 25 over this time   Perhaps the  reluctance  of the decline comes from an expectation of an imminent bottom in the price of iron ore  The chart of iron ore shows that the current price hovers above a brief trough from July and a multi year low is not too much further away 

The price of iron ore continued a plunge that began with August s topping process 

Rio Tinto  RIO  has managed to remain somewhat resilient  Its 50DMA still holds as support 

BHP Billiton looks weaker than RIO  a clean 50DMA breakdown that affirms the September top 
The distinct differential in performance suggests that I should have flipped around the configuration of my pairs trade  However  RIO made a strong move in its favor shortly after I wrote about the trade  On September 21st   a massive  2 1B boost to its share buyback  That money adds yet more cushion to an already large buyback and a healthy dividend payout 
While my options positions do not expire until January  2018  I am now wondering whether they will die on the vine with both RIO and BHP soon settling into a trading range 
Speculators in the Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   are also not concerned with the plunge in the price of iron ore  They continue to accumulate net long positions which now sit at a 4 1 2 year high 

Speculators have not been this bullish on the Australian dollar  FXA  in over 4 years 
This continued accumulation comes as the Australian dollar is finally weakening against major currencies  AUD USD in particular is cracking its low from August in a move that is confirming the earlier 50MDA breakdown which in turn seals the deal on a top for now 

The Australian dollar is breaking down against the U S  dollar  AUD USD looks like it is topping 
The mix of signals motivated me to back down from taking sides in the bear bull battle on the currency  I now trade even more opportunistically than usual 
Be careful out there

16251,237766,VALE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  BHP Billiton Limited  Freeport McMoRan  Vale And Rio Tinto,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  August 04  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Industrial Metals  Part 1  including BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited s  NYSE   NYSE BHP        Freeport McMoRan Inc  s  NYSE   NYSE FCX        Vale S A   NYSE   NYSE VALE       and Rio Tinto  LON RIO  plc s  NYSE   NYSE RIO       Industry  Industrial Metals  Part 1Link  Industrial metals such as iron  aluminum  copper are essential for most of the technology and infrastructure used in our daily lives  Thus  President Trump s promise to invest heavily in infrastructure provided a boost to industrial metals prices  Growth in the U S  GDP and continued improvement in end use sectors like automotive  aerospace  construction and packaging will sustain increased demand for metals Further  industrial metals have been benefiting from China s drive to halt some of the metal s production to fight air pollution  Let s take a closer look at the price movement of a few important metals so far this year and what lies ahead IronIron ore prices have been on a roller coaster ride so far this year  After marching toward a high of  95 per ton in Feb 2017  prices slumped to  57 per ton in June  Of late  prices have again picked up to the  70 per ton level in July China has been the primary catalyst for the recent surge in iron prices  Release of strong second quarter GDP figures renewed optimism  The official sub index for activity growth in construction sector hit 62 5 in July  the highest in almost four years  Also  tougher and more frequent environmental inspections on steel plants guilty of polluting have dented steel production and have impacted iron ore prices significantly Chinese traders are worried about a supply crunch and low stockpiles  consequently  imports have picked up  In the first six months  imports rose 9 3  to 539 million tons AluminumAluminum industry fundamentals have improved considerably since 2016 and aluminum markets recorded supply deficit in 2016  the first in a decade  During the first six months of 2017  the average LME aluminum price touched USD 1 880 56 per ton  a 22  increase from the prior year average Aluminum prices have been gaining this year owing to an improved supply demand dynamics  the Trump win and higher coal prices  China s directive towards capacity cut and Trump s insistence on trade reforms have inflicted positivity in the market lifting aluminum prices CopperAfter vastly underperforming compared with other metals in 2016  copper experienced a sudden spike at the end of 2016  Pick up in global manufacturing activity and hopes about Trump s  500 billion infrastructure drove the red metal s recovery  Copper has gained 13  so far this year and is trading 28  higher than last year  Renewed optimism about economic strength in top consumer China and indications of tighter global mine supply aided prices Supply disruptions at some of the key copper mines including BHP Billiton Limited s  NYSE      Escondida mine in Chile earlier this year and strike action at Freeport McMoRan Inc  s  NYSE      Grasberg operations in Indonesia led to the decline in mined copper production and provide a boost to the price Industry Positioning   Mixed BagThe Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks  The way to look at the complete list of industries is that  we put our X industries  all 265 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  In the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1   To learn more visit   Within the Zacks Industry classification  the  and  industries  aluminum  copper  etc   are grouped under the  sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors   The non ferrous mining industry  with a Zacks Industry Rank  123  remains in the top half   However  the iron mining industry occupies a space in the bottom 6  of the Zacks classified industries with a Rank of  241 Improved Performance In the past year  the Mining Iron and Mining Non Ferrous industries have recorded respective rise of 76 5  and 22 5   The industries have outperformed both the Basic Material sector s increase of 14 6  as well as the S P 500 s corresponding advance of 13 5  Attractive on the Valuation FrontValuation looks attractive for both the industries going by the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  multiple  a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like iron and non ferrous industries  The mining iron industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 4 85 and the mining ferrous industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 8 65 Both of these compare favorably with the broader Basic Materials Sector s EV EBITDA multiple of 11 49 and S P 500 EV EBITDA multiple of 10 81  Both of the industry s lower than market positioning calls for more upside ahead Q2 Earnings Scorecard  ProjectionsSo far  60  of the S P 500 members in the basic materials sector have reported second quarter results and logged a 9 7  increase in earnings  Taking into account the rest of the companies that have yet to disclose numbers  earnings will rise 6 2  for the quarter   Read more   What s in Store Iron  Global steel production rose 4 5  year on year during the first six months of 2017 to 695 million tons  Despite contracting in June by 1 7  US steel output still grew 1 3  in the first half after two years of contraction as higher prices encourage the revival of idled plants  Strong steel demand growth in developing countries will offset stabilizing demand in developed economies  This will boost demand for iron ore The supply surge resulting from Vale S A   NYSE      S11D  Rio Tinto plc s  NYSE      Pilbara projects  and BHP Billiton s projects will create a surplus in the already well supplied iron ore market  However  China is planning to cut steel capacity to reduce pollution in the country and by 2020  the government aims to trim 100 150 million tons of steel capacity  Sustained capacity rationalization could lead to higher steel prices  which in turn should support iron ore prices Aluminum  Global aluminum markets are expected to be in a deficit in 2017  Chinese demand  which accounts for about half of the total demand  is likely to be sustained by the building and construction sector as well as the automotive and railway sectors  With the country deciding to cut capacity  supply will also be in check Moreover  in North America  demand should remain robust  mainly due to building and construction  automotive  packaging and airline industries  India appears promising given its current low levels of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth Copper  As per the International Copper Study Group  ICSG   copper is headed for a deficit of about 150 000 metric tons in 2017 and about 170 000 tons in 2018  Copper prices are likely to be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets  as well as economic activity in the U S  and other industrialized countries The timing of the development of new supplies of copper  along with production levels of mines and copper smelters are also anticipated to influence price  The long term fundamentals of the metal remain positive  supported by its significant role in the global economy and a challenging long term supply environment Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification  health insurers are broadly grouped in the Medical

Inside the Headlines
BHP Billiton has extensively inspected the SGO project and made remarkable improvements to project design and cost  The company claimed that the anticipated internal rate of return of the SGO project is 16  and payback tenure would be 4 5 years  from the first production 
In the initial 10 years of operation  the incremental production from SGO project would be nearly 4 kilo tons per annum  ktpa  of payable molybdenum and 185 ktpa of copper in concentrated form  Notably  the initial production of SGO project would likely be accrued in BHP Billiton s 2021 financial year 
While the existing copper cathode stream of the mine would continue operations until the 2025 financial year  The entire SGO project would translate 1 3 billion tons of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources to hypogene sulphide ore reserves 
BHP Billiton also proclaimed that the SGO project would create 5 000 additional jobs during its entire construction phase  The entire project includes engineering  construction and design of a conventional massive scale sulphide concentrator  for both molybdenum and copper extraction  The nominal ore throughput capacity of the concentrator would be 95 kilo tons per day 
Moreover  the project even calls for the construction of a 154 kilometers water pipeline from the Spence mine site to the plant as well as a new 1 000 liter per second desalination plant  in the Mejillones Bay  However  these two construction activities would be conducted by a third party contractor  under a separately awarded Build  Own  Operate and Transfer deal 
Our Take
Gradual recovery of iron ore prices is likely to benefit major mining companies like BHP Billiton  Rio Tinto  LON RIO  plc   NYSE RIO    Vale S A    NYSE VALE   and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc    NYSE CLF    In the last three months  prices of this major steel making component were up nearly 20 1  to  75 2 per ton as of Aug 18  2017  The upside stemmed from the release of Chinese manufacturing data  which revealed expansion of the country s steel industry

16306,237821,VALE,Global Markets Push Higher  Led By SPX,opinion,"Global markets continue to push higher  with the MSCI World index trading to a new all time high on Friday  really led by the S P 500  although the DAX  FTSE 100 and Nikkei 225  among others  look attractive too 
Of course  the big news on Friday was the poor non farm payrolls  which saw 138 000 jobs created in May  with a two month revision lower of 66 000 jobs to the prior two payrolls reports  Reading between the lines from last week s Beige Book  the narrative detailed that across the country there are worker  shortages across a broadening range of occupations and regions   therefore we can loosely make an assumption that the poor jobs report was a function of supply  and an inability to hire the right candidates  We can also see the US unemployment rate sits at 4 3   although this was driven by a lower participation rate at 62 7   Average hourly earnings grew at 2 5  and below the 2 6  estimate the market was discounting 
The wash up is that the numbers themselves were not enough to derail the equity bull market and implied volatility  or the  VIX  index  closed at a meagre 9 75   With equities finding buyers  driven predominantly by tech  we can see that the fed funds future  July contract  has priced in a near certainty of a hike on the 14th June  but the fed funds curve  the yield on contracts in the periods ahead  continues to flatten in earnest 
If you trade interest rates  being short the Eurodollar December 2017 and long the Eurodollar December 2018 contract has been a great trade and I would stay long here as future rate hikes are potentially priced out of the curve  although this is a very mature trade  Perhaps the bigger talking point has been the strong outperformance of the ten year US Treasury  If we look at the Treasury curve  the difference between two and ten year US Treasuries  we can see this sits at 86 basis points  bp  and is the flattest since September 2016 and a marked move since the start of the year from 136 bp  This was never meant to happen under Trump 

With the ten year Treasury trading through strong support of 2 16   this was never going to be taken well by the USD and we have seen a strong move lower against a range of currency pairs  It is also not so great for US financials  who borrow at short term rates and lend at longer term rates  think lower net interest margins   It is good for tech though  through the use of a lower risk free rate in the discounting process to calculate net present value  and it s interesting to see the NASDAQ closed up 1 1   Being long the NASDAQ has been one big momentum trade 
One questions if this is the week to derail the upbeat sentiment and perhaps shake some life into implied volatility  watch the US volatility index   and while there should be little to upset a June hike  from the Federal Reserve   we do get important narrative from the ECB  an election in the UK and former FBI Director James Comey testifying to the Senate Intelligence Committee  all on the same day  In Australia  the RBA will release its own statement tomorrow on the how it sees the world  although Q1 GDP seems a more prevalent issue  especially when you have a couple of research houses calling for a contraction in growth in the quarter  Oil is also on the radar  as US crude has a shocker last week  with price closing 1 5  lower on Friday taking the weekly loss to 4 5  and weighing heavily on the S P 500 energy sector 
In FX land  watching and trading the AUD will be interesting this week given growth is front and centre  AUD NZD shorts have worked well  take a look at the trend on the daily or weekly chart   but I would be cutting back on exposures here  or at least really tightening up on the stop loss given the event risk in Australia  EUR AUD is similar  where the pair has rallied nicely  but I would specifically be looking at longs here now  only on a closing break of a 1 5227  given the risk the ECB don t meet the somewhat hawkish view of the market and could easily disappoint  GBP USD will be closely watched as well  although I feel the market is pricing in a Tory win of 50 80 seats and still the greater probability that Theresa May can gain a majority  We are seeing a slightly softer start to cable this morning  but any moves into  1 3050 to  1 3100 will likely be sold into I suspect 
In Asia  the Nikkei has been attracting good buyers of late  although I like what I see in the China H Share index too  We see some headwinds to Japanese equities this morning given USD JPY collapsed after the US payrolls report  The ASX 200 is shaping up for a fairly flat open  with SPI futures closing Friday s night session up ten points  although our ASX 200 call sits at 5791  Keep an eye on SPI futures through the day and a break of the recent high of the 5808 to 5815 range would be very positive in my opinion 
BHP s American Depository Receipt closed down 1   while VALE SA  NYSE VALE  s US listing up 0 2   so it seems likely that energy will struggle  but some better buying will be seen in select materials given spot iron ore closed up 3 3   while Dalian futures closed up 2 9   The lead for banks is also uninspiring  It s all about the FX and Aussie interest rate markets today though  with Q1 inventories and company profits   5  yoy  providing key insights into Wednesdays GDP print when released at 11 30 aest  Inventories are expected to increase 0 5   although the economist s estimates range from  1 4  to  0 1   so we could see the AUD fairly sensitive to this print ",2017-06-05,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200193112,200193112
16307,237822,VALE,What Impact Will The Fed s Glass Half Full Approach Have ,opinion,"It s been an interesting session and the traders and investors are still trying to price markets accordingly  The event risk started with US CPI  ex food  coming in at a below par 1 7  and this really started the ball rolling  with a keen focus on inflationary trends in the FOMC statement and through Janet Yellen s press conference 
Ultimately we have seen the Federal Reserve revise down both its 2017 headline and core inflation forecasts by a touch  However  Janet Yellen has faith that the last three soft inflation reads were attributed to  off off reductions in certain categories  and that these factors would bring down inflation just through the  matter of arithmetic  
Certainly  the core of the Fed have a glass half full approach to inflation  but there is no doubt that if the future inflation reads don t turn around  like they expect  then the market is going to pile into US treasuries and continue offeringUSD s  notably against emerging market currencies like the MXN and BRL 
There has been a predictably sizeable focus on the Fed s  4 46 billion balance sheet  where the statement around the balance sheet did change enough to provide strategists with a belief normalisation is set to start from the September or October meeting  We understand that once it starts the balance sheet will be reduced by  10 billion per month   6 billion in treasuries   4 billion in mortgage backed securities   with the cap on these reductions rising every three months 
The size  scope and timings doesn t feel like it should shock too greatly  but with inflation trends the way they are it doesn t seem thematic of a central bank needing to aggressively hike rates  concurrently with the balance sheet being reduced  which in itself has would act as a tightening of monetary policy through reduced liquidity 
In terms of the projections around future interest rate moves  we have seen the so called  dots  being left largely unchanged  although the 2019 estimate was revised down by 0 125   These projections on the future fed funds rate may have largely been left unchanged  but there has been a pretty strong reaction in the rates and fixed income market 
The financial markets reaction suggests a dovish shift from the Fed  but I disagree and think at the margin the statement and Yellen s vision were hawkish  certainly relative to pricing  But we have seen strong selling in the fed funds future January 2019 and 2020 contract  so traders pricing out the prospect of tightening through the next couple of years  To put some perceptive here  interest rate markets are pricing in just one hike in 2018 and a 70  chance of another in 2019  The Fed still see three hikes each year 
The US treasury curve  the difference between two and ten year treasuries  has flattened five basis points  bp  and at 79bp is eyeing the levels we saw in July 2016  We have also seen inflation expectations fall  with  breakevens  falling  but less than nominal yields and this has seen a decent pop in real yields 
One suspects this is why gold has found sellers on the session  The USD was initially sold aggressively  with the strong buying in fixed income  with USD JPY trading from  110 31 to  108 83  but buying has emerged and I would not be surprised to see this back about  110 00 soon 
Interestingly  despite this move higher in  real  yields we have seen equities hold in well  with only modest selling seen at an index level on the S P 500  Dow Jones and NASDAQ 100  Equities will have found some confidence that the Fed seem to believe all will be ok in the months to come  while credit spreads didn t rally move in any great capacity 
The wash up is we are expecting a weaker open with our ASX 200 call sitting at 5810  with SPI futures lower by 30 points  Energy stocks will have a tough day at the office  with oil getting smashed 3 5  on higher gasoline inventory  stockpiles  2 09 million  and we see US crude trading into the May lows now  Will OPEC jawboning ramp up from here  It s certainly it s a risk if short the barrel 
Iron ore futures has seen a better session  with spot closing up 2   while stability has been seen in Dalian futures  VALE  NYSE VALE  s US listing closed  0 6   but BHP  NYSE BHP  looks set to be impacted far greater by its exposure to crude  with its American Depository Receipt closing down 2 5  
Aussie banks will drive the outright performance of the market and we may see some modest weakness in this space on open  but it will be interesting to see if the buyers step in given the recent momentum  Health care is the trade du jour  with the S P ASX 200 Health Care Index breaking out to new all time high yesterday  Any weakness here should be short lived 
All eyes on theAUD today though  with May employment data due at 11 30 aest and markets expecting 10 000 net jobs to be created and the unemployment rate to remain at 5 7   AUD USD has traded to  0 7636 on the initial Fed induced move but has fallen back below the 76c level 
The daily chart looks bullish  but of course  the unemployment is highly unpredictable so the AUD USD could be at  0 7650 or  0 7525 by the end of the Asia trade ",2017-06-15,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200195351,200195351
16308,237823,VALE,The Outperforming USD And Lack Of Real Wage Change,opinion,"I posed the question on Friday on whether we were in for a period of USD outperformance and I continue to feel this could be the case  although the USD Index really needs to break above 97 54  the 30 May high  to find increased momentum  Even if this does materialise the moves won t be felt on a broad basis and we continue to see the like of the CAD  AUDand NZD looking quite attractive on the daily or weekly timeframes 
The key thematic at the heart of so many debates is around such subdued inflation and falling inflation expectations in many major economies  that in turn is pushing up  real  yields and flattening the yield curve  It s this dynamic that is causing traders to ask why on earth the Federal Reserve raise three times in 2018 and 2019 when they are also allowing the balance sheet to run off and it s of course why the markets are only pricing in two hikes all the way through to the end of 2019 
Additionally  even though the unemployment rate is at such low levels  and in some areas of the US we are hearing of labour shortages  revert to the recent Beige Book   we are simply not seeing wage pressures  Either way  inflation is at the heart of so many conversations  especially when it comes at a time when the Fed  Bank of Canada and Bank of England have shifted to a more hawkish tilt  and certainly relative to market pricing 
As we know  the Fed see better times ahead  but the market is not so sure and this is driving fixed income and FX gyrations 
On Friday we saw US five year inflation expectations fall a further two basis points  or 0 02   to 1 81  and the lowest since October and market based inflation reads take centre stage here  Five year inflation expectations in Europe have dropped to 1 53  and the lowest since November  while in Australia we can also see falling longer term inflation expectations and this driving up the five year and ten year  real   or inflation adjusted  Aussie government bond to 39bp and 68bp respectively and the highest levels since mid May 
It s no surprise  therefore  to see AUD USD actually looking quite bullish and while there is not a huge amount to drive this week there will be traders lining up to short the pair should we see a move into  0 7700 to  0 7720 and trend resistance drawn from the 2016 high 

Aside from the CAD  specifically CAD JPY   AUD was the star performer last week in G10 FX  but we are coming back into what has been such an exceptional sell zone for AUD USD really since April 2016 
In equity land  it s steady as she goes for today s Asia open  The S P 500 closed largely unchanged  but the sectoral moves should catch the Aussie market somewhat on the wrong foot on open  If we look at the performance of the ASX 200 last week we saw solid gains in REITS  healthcare  financials and even consumer discretionary  while we saw moves lower on the week in energy and materials  On Friday  in the US  it was energy that really outperformed  with the S P 500 Energy sub sector closing up 1 7   while materials gained 40 bp 
The S P ASX 200 itself should open where it left off  and SPI futures are not giving us too much to work with either closing up nine points  One could make a positive that last week s low held the prior week s close of 5677 and we can also see on the weekly chart  see below  buyers happy to step in and defend what is key horizontal support around 5675  Still  it is tough going trading the ASX 200 as price action is scatty and there is just no trend 
Just look at the 20   50   or 100 day moving averages and we can see these moving perfectly sideways  Traders are happy  therefore  to trade a range in the ASX 200 and SPI futures 
Commodity markets are generally constructive for today s equity market open  with US crude gaining 0 60  on Friday s session  Spot iron ore closed up 0 9  on Friday taking the gains on the week to 2 5  and marking the first three day consecutive rally since April  On the Dalian futures exchange  we saw iron ore close up 0 2   while steel closed unchanged  BHP s American Depository Receipt  ADR  closed unchanged on Friday and Vale s  NYSE VALE  US listing closed up 0 6  
In terms of event risk for the day s trade we get RBA governor Philip Lowe speaking as part of a panel at 09 30 aest  while at 11 30 aest we get Aussie new motor vehicle sales and China property prices ",2017-06-19,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200195933,200195933
16309,237824,VALE,The Long And The Short Of It  Oil s Future Is Taking Center Stage,opinion,"Oil is at the centre of the market moves and our flows in brent and US crude have certainly picked up  The question of when and to what degree OPEC step up their oil stabilising rhetoric from here has been discussed and one would imagine central banks would be looking at the moves quite closely given the impact of falling oil on headline inflation 
That being said  despite US crude  currently  2 4  on the session  trading into  42 75  and eyeing a move into the November lows of  42 20  we haven t seen too much of a move in the market s pricing of inflation expectations 
Therefore with modest buying across the fixed income curve  US 10 year treasury yields are down three basis points at 2 15   and a renewed focus on headlines US tax reform  we have seen  real   or inflation adjusted  yields pull back a touch  It s interesting we haven t seen better buying in gold as a result  especially given how unloved the yellow metal is at the moment and I would have expected more short covering 
We have seen a reaction in equity though  with the S P 500 energy sub sector closing 1 3  lower and taking the year to date losses to 13 5   Consumer discretionary has also been sold 1 3   with tech taking out a few points as well and we can see the S P 500 closing  0 7  and providing a poor lead for Asia 
Naturally  we would expect the   171 S P ASX 200 energy space   to find good selling activity today  however its worth remembering the Aussie energy space  while having fallen 10 5  from 25 May  is still only down 3 5  year to date  Is it time to be greedy when others are fearful 
Staying in the commodity space and spot iron ore rallied for a fifth day  although the gain of 0 27  is hardly convincing and I would focus the Dalian futures complex  Here we can see iron ore  steel and coking coal futures falling 2   2 5  and 0 5  respectively  By way of a guide  we can see BHP s American Depository Receipt  ADR  closing  3 1   with Vale s US listing  also falling more than 3   so it s in not shaping up for a good day to be long materials or energy 
SPI futures are lower by 27 points and  0 6  from 16 10 aest  with our call for the ASX 200 sitting at 5725  The index continues to oscillate in the 5850 to 5650 range  but if the selling gains momentum during the cash session today then traders will start to question whether the index can close the week below 5675  which if you look at the index on a weekly chart we can see such strong support from the bulls since February  A weekly close through 5675 seems important 

The question then is when aggregating all the overnight moves  why would you buy equity on the open  Of course  there many reasons  but I would expect the bid to be fairly thin and stocks have a higher probability of falling from 10 15 onwards 
The market which will be worth watching though is clearly the Chinese equity markets given 222 China A shares will be included in the MSCI Emerging Markets  We have already seen a slight pop of 0 6  in the China A50 futures  traded in Singapore  and small buying in CNH  offshore yuan   This seems like a fair reaction given it represents a 0 7  weighting  proforma basis  in the MSCI EM index  so in effect  the level of passive funds which will buy into these names is fairly low and won t actually materialise until May 2018 The question then of semantics is perhaps the bigger driver of Chinese stocks here  so will Chinese retail traders buy into this move  I wouldn t rule it out  but if the CSI 300  A50 futures or Shanghai Composite rally today it will clearly be confined to China and seems a very long stretch to expect it to lift the ASX 200 or S P 500 futures 
In FX land  AUD USD has found sellers on the session and tracked S P futures lower through US trade  Buyers have stepped in at last Thursday lows of  0 7563  but tactically we may have seen a short term top here 
It is my view that there is a strong possibility US data improves here  although many would disagree with me and I stand by the view that we are in for a period of USD outperformance  Of course  the big USD flows have been against the GBP  where miraculously BoE chief Mark Carney  who didn t vote for rate hikes in the recent MPC meeting stuck to a dovish script and it seems some rather bizarrely were expecting more hawkish rhetoric  It s all politics though over the coming 24 hours  with the delayed Queens speech on focus and a focus on poor negotiations between Theresa May and the DUP party  although sources still expect a deal on Thursday  thus avoiding an another election  Cable looks highly vulnerable to further downside  but being short with conviction with this event risk ahead of us is tough ",2017-06-21,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200196425,200196425

This 2200 S P 500 Value Looks OK Only on an Optimistic Forward Look
Bottoms up strategists have valued S P 500 earnings at  118 in 2016  Tie on a 16 forward P E to do that  fair value  math  Hence  1904 on the S P 500 looked to be a decent  fair value  lower bound 
Above 2 200 on the S P 500  early DEC shows us the latest EPS  fair value  calculation has support solely on a forward look 
Consult earnings yield  fair value  math too  The risk free 10 year U S  Treasuries offered a 1 80  rate on Nov  1st  This rose to 2 4  in early DEC  Historically  a stock earnings yield is  3  higher than this 10 year U S  Treasury rate  Meaning U S  stocks should offer a 5 4  return 
So  turn the S P 500 P E ratio on its head to attain a stock index s earnings yield  Divide  118 in projected earnings for 2016 by an S P 500 trading at 2200   That begets a 5 36  earnings yield  After a  32  rally in 2013  and  12  returns in 2014  evidence is getting sketchy on ongoing S P 500 index undervaluation  unless you look ahead very bullishly 
The latest 12 month EPS  Look Ahead  on the S P 500 has  131 59  Multiply by 16  You get an S P 500  fair value  calculation at 2105 
The Russell 2000 May Correct
The  risk on  rally took the Russell 2000  RUT  from 1000 in Feb to near 1350 in late NOV  The RUT trades at 1352 as I write on Dec  7th   Risk on  rallies usually show small cap and international stock indexes move together 
My DEC call  Hold off a bit buying the RUT  but not international  on excess optimism  A big RUT run has taken place  The way forward is not as attractive for a few weeks months on the RUT  A RUT pullback should happen 
Rates and Currencies Tell Independent Story on Their Own
Outside the U S   the euro is 1 08 again  A 1 08 euro USD rate came into play late last year  The rate was 1 13 last fall  Euro parity may now happen  as earlier consensus projected  European share indexes have recovered weakly after Brexit 
Does a Fed Taper tantrum aka 2013 hit in 2017  That s unlikely  We are clearly climbing the wall of worry outside the U S  The U S  is solidly at full employment

16367,237882,VALE,Reports Of The Death Of The Iron Ore Price Are Greatly Exaggerated,opinion,"As one might misquote Mark Twain  we have been here before 
In 2016  analysts were queued up to predict the iron ore price was going to collapse only for it continue its relentless rise  The recent pull back from  90 per metric ton has brought a fresh crop of dire predictions  Yet maybe  just maybe  there is more validity this time around for caution as to future price direction  There are a number of factors  each of which individually does not signal a price reversal but collectively suggests iron ore prices later this year could be lower than they have been in the first quarter 
Why Iron Ore Prices Might Really Fall
An  in the Australian Financial Review quotes analysts saying  the strength of recent pricing is encouraging Chinese domestic production to increase  In the first half in 2016 it was averaging a 220 million mt per year run rate  but rose to 280 mmt per year in the second half of the year  At the same time  global supply continues to rise with not just increased shipments from Australia but also number three miner VALE SA  NYSE VALE  expanding supply from its  14 billion S11D mine 
The first shipment from S11D arrived in China early this month  Iron ore holdings at Chinese ports increased 8 2  in February  the biggest gain in three years and now stand at a record 130 mmt according to a Bloomberg   Purchases of iron ore increased 13  to 83 5 mmt in February  an all time high for that month  with year to date shipments up 13  to 175 mmt  the paper said 
Where s All the Iron Ore Going 
On the plus side  increased shipments have not just been used to bloat existing port stocks  but also fueled robust steel production  Capacity closures have left the Chinese steel industry still bloated  but at least a lot leaner than it was a few years ago  Reuters  Read this to mean that it will run faster when given the right pricing incentive to do so  That incentive has been an ongoing stimulus program aimed at infrastructure and construction 
China s spending on infrastructure   including roads  airports  ports and railways   rose 17  last year helping support the country s 6 7  expansion in GDP  Growth in infrastructure spending is forecast to continue  but will inevitably slow as a percentage a GDP over time 
Investors Have Seen This Before 
Nor have recent gains attracted the interest of speculators  as they did in the first half of last year  Net long positions and trading volumes on the Dalian exchange are muted compared to the speculative feeding frenzy in the first half of 2016  Chinese domestic investors are closely attuned to the activities and intentions of government policy  so their lack of appetite suggests they feel the bull run may have run its course 

Most telling maybe is that even producers are suggesting the price is going to fall back  Chief Financial Officer at BHP Billiton  LON BLT   Peter Beaven  is quoted by Reuters is saying   We re seeing a moderation of the impacts of the stimulus which China was putting into its economy in 2016  We have got to be very cognizant that those fundamentals point to a softening  and our business and all the settings that surround it  have to be ready for a much lower iron ore price  

JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM  in Australia were more blunt about price prospects  being quoted by Bloomberg as saying  Iron ore is going to finish closer to  60 a  mt  by the end of this year  
All this doesn t necessarily signal the end of the current upward trend in iron ore prices  but it does suggest caution may be appropriate in assuming more of the same in the next quarter ",2017-03-14,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reports-of-the-death-of-the-iron-ore-price-are-greatly-exaggerated-200178835,200178835
16368,237883,VALE,Iron Ore Reverses A Major Breakout While Bulls Stick By AUD,opinion,"The list of asset prices that have completely reversed their post election gains continues to expand  Last week  iron ore officially joined that list and the sell off continues apace  On Tuesday night  April 18th   

 According to Metal Bulletin  the spot price for benchmark 62  fines fell 4 6  to  63 20 a dry tonne  extending its losses from the multi year high of  94 86 a tonne struck on February 21 to 33 4  
It now sits at the lowest level since October 27 last year  

It was exactly in late October when iron ore broke out to a fresh multi month high that led to a  very choppy  rally that did not end until February s multi year peak  The drop in April alone has been dramatic 

The on going plunge in iron ore is about as steep as it can get 
Last week Nev Powers  CEO of Fortescue Metals Group  predicted that  between  60 and  65 as higher prices were  unsustainable   Goldman Sachs also reiterated a  60 price target last week  The chart above shows that prices were in a hurry to drop toward these bearish predictions  The main question now of course is whether price will stop here  Typically sell offs in commodities significantly overshoot presumed levels of support 
The usual suspects have lined up for blame for the price collapse  there is a huge supply issue exacerbated by weakening demand dynamics   

 Global oversupply has been blamed for the latest move in prices  while a slowdown in the Chinese car sector has hit steel prices in the country  This has resulted in steel mills opting to buy cheaper iron ore that is stockpiled in ports  rather than the higher grade  seaborne metal supplied by the likes of BHP and Rio  

Clyde Russell from Reuters pointed to the massive supply of inventory in March   ironically a month that also saw record Chinese steel output 

 Much of the focus on why the price gains were unsustainable has been on the rapid build up of iron ore inventories at Chinese ports  with industry consultants SteelHome saying stockpiles at 46 ports reached a record 132 5 million tonnes in the week to March 31 
This is some 65 percent higher than the 80 5 million tonnes recorded in October 2015  just prior to the start of the strong rally in prices 
While an overhang of inventories was always likely to eventually cause prices to stumble  it also means that imports may be subdued in the coming months as traders and steel mills work through some of the stockpiles  

Russell was also on top of the iron ore dynamics in January of this year as he declared iron ore was back in bubble territory 

 The strong rally in iron ore is perhaps harder to justify  given the market remains well supplied  and if anything will see more cargoes available in 2017 
China s iron ore imports reached a record above 1 billion tonnes in 2016  jumping 7 5 percent from the prior year  according to customs data 
This was because of the stronger than expected steel production as well as lower domestic iron ore output  which was down 3 6 percent in the year to November  according to official data  

The Financial Review also pointed out a vicious cycle 

 Sellers are keen to sell and buyers  anticipating further price drops  are reluctant to buy  contributing in part to the volatility  Steel mills in China are still in the midst of tapping their substantial iron ore stockpiles  which means they are unlikely to rush to buy any seaborne cargoes  market sources told Metal Bulletin  

Demand dynamics have soured 

  While April is usually the peak period for consumption  steel demand is far weaker than expected   Maike analysts Ren Jiaojiao and Dang Man wrote in a note on Tuesday   In the ferrous markets  iron ore probably faces the weakest outlook in the second half  
China s crude steel output reached a record 72 million tonnes in March as mills ramped up output in anticipation of a pickup in demand that has remained slow  government data released on Monday showed  

Strong Chinese output of steel is not getting a bullish interpretation  Instead  analysts are fearing future monetary tightening from China and the potential for a big air pocket in production once steel finally cools off 
The current sell off will likely not be as troublesome or traumatic for iron ore miners as the extended swoon from 2011 to 2015  Toward the end of this period  the supply chain quickly rationalized with miners shutting down high priced supply  drove greater production efficiencies  and slashed debt levels  Marginal costs dropped ever lower  Now miners are lean and mean and will likely weather the current storm very well  Indeed while iron ore miners are locked into downtrends off their 2017 peaks  they are well above the 2016 trough and in some cases still locked into strong uptrends  from that trough

VALE SA  NYSE VALE  is down 25 6  from its February peak  VALE is much more dependent on iron ore than either BHP or RIO  The extremely strong rally off the 2016 trough means VALE still trades well above its 200DMA uptrend line 

Vale  VALE  has descended a 2 month downtrend from its recent high but is still up a whopping 271  from the 2016 trough 
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  NYSE CLF  is faring the worst of the bunch  Not only is CLF down 43 0  from its February high  but also its 200DMA breakdown has led to a near complete reversal of its post election gains 
Cliffs Natural Resources  CLF  made a very bearish 200DMA breakdown  Yet  the stock is still up an incredible 444  from the 2016 trough 
Whenever iron ore finally stabilizes  the rebounds in these stocks could be substantial  A good way to play the potential for a rebound is through a pairs trade  Exactly one year ago  I described a pairs trade between  long  RIO and  short  BHP  Shifting that to VALE and CLF makes a lot of sense   short VALE since it technically has more downside potential and long CLF since it technically has more upside potential 
Strangely through iron ore s woes  speculators in the Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  have stayed bullish  Net long contracts have grew substantially into the February peak for iron ore  Yet  these contracts are still at lofty levels despite the steep sell off in iron ore 

Speculators have ignored weakening iron ore prices as they have accumulated net long contracts in the Australian dollar 
I argued earlier that the economic backdrop alongside plunging iron prices suggests that the Australian dollar has topped out  An unwind of speculative positions could exacerbate the current sell off in the Australian dollar 

AUD USD is oh so slowly topping out  I think a retest of the December  2016 low will come in due time 

AUD JPY confirmed a very bearish 200DMA breakdown with follow through selling 
On balance  I still prefer to fade rallies in the Australian dollar 
The fast moving dynamics in the iron ore market mean that related trades will be an on going source of substantial price moves  I plan to report more frequently on these events alongside trade ideas 
Be careful out there

16389,237904,VALE,The Long And The Short Of It,opinion,"There are a number of interesting talking points on the floors this morning  but perhaps the most prominent have centred on the moves in the AUD  which has been taken to the cleaners overnight  falling 1 4   Perhaps my description is dramatic  but there really isn t one smoking gun behind the falls and there are seemingly a number of factors at play 
Firstly  we can see price really selling off from 10 00 aest yesterday  which makes me believe  without any proof  that this could be equity related  with an international money manager perhaps unwinding a sizeable position in an Aussie bank   one just has to look at the correlation between AUD USD and SPI futures to sense check this view  We can also see iron ore  steel and coking coal futures were sold 6 6   2 7  and 3 2  respectively overnight and there is certainly a more aggressive view that China has seen peak growth  with producer price inflation to head lower from here too 

We must also take into consideration that by and large we have seen a move into the USD more broadly  We have seen yields across the US fixed income curve moving higher by around four to five basis points  with the curve  two and ten year Treasuries  ultimately remaining unchanged at 101 basis points  The  real   or inflation adjusted  ten year Treasury yield has moved higher by five basis points overnight and it s no surprise then that gold has been sold off fairly heavily   1 3    It s interesting that US listed gold stocks have held in quite well despite the strong move in gold 

US data flow has been more upbeat  with the ADP private payrolls printing 177 000 jobs and giving us believe that Friday s non farm payrolls will be close to the current consensus of 190 000  The services ISM index showed growth in the service space growing at a faster clip at 57 5  with solid increases in new orders and export orders  The employment sub component of the services index printed 51 4 and again supports the notion that we should see a strong rebound in jobs after the worrying 98 000 jobs print last month 
The FOMC meeting provided few surprises and that s how the Federal Reserve like things  They are part of the reasoning why the world has a love affair with selling volatility  One could even say the statement was somewhat hawkish at the margin as they clearly believe the weakness in Q1 data has been  transitory  and most economists would see that as the correct view  with Q2 GDP likely to print above 3   at this stage 
Perhaps a greater attention to any future reduction of their  4 5 trillion balance sheet was expected  but this is something we will want to explore at the June meeting  when Janet Yellen can talk this through in her press conference  In terms of the June meeting  the market has raised its implied probability closer to 70   with the fed fund future pricing in 17 basis points of tightening through June  At this stage  70  seems too low on the news we know  especially with financial conditions still so accommodative 
There hasn t really been any reaction either to the live debate between Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron  There has been little conviction behind the flows in our out of hours CAC 40 index either and if the French index were to open now it would be pushing 5300  EUR USD has largely been influenced by the US data  although we have seen EUR USD one week implied volatility fall and at 10  is just simply not expressing a view that we are going to see Le Pen take the presidency on Monday  which of course would promote a near armageddon scenario 
Pricing would suggest that while the debate was an absolute slugfest  but it probably lacked the depth and persuasion to move the undecided vote  One suspects if you were voting for Macron before the debate you heard little in the rhetoric to change that  The view from one  French speaking  trader was that both candidates had their strengths and clear weakness s and assessed the battle as a fairly even split and no clear winner 
Turning to the Asian market open and we see fairly benign conditions  with our call from the ASX 200 sitting at 5893  Yesterday s 1  fall was ugly  especially given the value of the sell off totalled  7 381 billion  which is some 23  above the 12 month average  The bulls will take the fact that breadth wasn t terrible  with only 57  of stocks falling on the day 
With that in mind today s open will tell us a lot about sentiment and specifically one question whether we see traders look to buy into the market after the unwind  It may have been that we saw a fund moving out of a sizeable position in the banks and again I have no proof and the local investment banks would need to detail this as they would have seen the flow 
So the banks will be key in whether the ASX 200 finds buyers on open or gravitate lower again and that could be dictated by the National Australia Bank s  MU NAB  1H 17 numbers which are released shortly 
The materials sector will probably attract increased trading capital and while spot iron ore closed largely unchanged  as mentioned bulk commodity futures have been sold aggressive and if we look at Vale s VALE SA  NYSE VALE   as a proxy  it closed  5 2   BHP s  NYSE BHP  American Depository Receipt suggest BHP opens  0 8   helped to a degree by little move in U S  Crude ",2017-05-04,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200186978,200186978

16446,237961,VALE,Iron Ore Prices Defy Gravity  But For How Long ,opinion,"Iron ore prices have done an amazing job of defying gravity  The price has risen 41 7  this year after three straight years of losses  according to Australia s  
Prices for 62  fines hit  61 75 per dry ton this week and have averaged  53 64 per dry metric ton this year 

The raw material has variously been called the darling of the commodities market and by Citicorp as 2016 s hot commodity  but many are now beginning to ask if enough is enough and just how much support there is for current price levels  let alone further rises 
Price strength has been a product of two interdependent drivers  On the one hand  iron ore prices largely followed a rally of Chinese steel prices 
Prices rose as a result of strong property  new  starts and stimulus inspired infrastructure investment  and robust growth in sectors such as auto production caught the market when inventories were low  As finished steel prices increased  mills went into overdrive  churning out steel like it was the turn of the last decade 
Chinese Stimulus
On the back of a credit surge   itself a product of the stimulus measures   speculative trading in iron ore  steel and coal reached fever pitch  driving up futures prices  In the face of rising steel prices  steel mills and regional governments have staunchly resisted attempts to curtail production  saying if there was excess capacity  prices would be falling  not rising 
Unfortunately  good times don t last forever and  for iron ore producers  their good times may be coming to an end  Low cost iron ore supply remains plentiful  with Vale SA  NYSE VALE  s new S11D project due to come onstream by the end of this year and Roy Hill s ramp up hitting the market at around the same time 
Construction Slowing
Simultaneously  China s stimulus is fading  After the first sugar rush  construction is said to be slowing  and with key international gatherings imminent   like the G20 summit   when steel mills are asked to close to reduce pollution in China  it is likely thought that steel demand will ease in Q4 as the current building season comes to an end 
Iron ore inventories at seaports are up  With plenty of raw material around many are expecting a softening in both iron ore and steel prices in Q4  To the extent this translates into increased exports of unwanted metal  this could then become more of a problem for the rest of the world than for China 
Steel exports have been a major source of international tension for the last two years  if exports rise on the back of slowing domestic demand  this particular flashpoint is going to get worse rather than better in 2017 ",2016-08-25,MetalMiner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/iron-ore-prices-defy-gravity,-but-for-how-long-200149996",200149996

16460,237975,VALE,Will Iron Ore Keep Falling ,opinion,"There appears to be an almost universal expectation that iron ore prices will soon start to retreat  after surging some 62  through April  They have since eased back but are still up 28  on the year 
Without doubt  much of iron ore s gains in 2016 have been driven by strong demand from China  with imports up 9 3  to 669 65 million metric tons in the first eight months of the year from a year ago  But prices in Qingdao lost 5 8  in the seven sessions through Wednesday 
That was the longest run of daily declines since March and while steel output remains robust  questions are again being asked as to how much longer prices can remain north of  55 per mt as yet more supply comes on stream  According to the MetalMiner index  finished steel prices have eased this month 
Iron Ore Output
You would expect the miners to refute this and  sure enough  in a Bloomberg report  VALE SA  NYSE VALE  and Cliffs Natural Resources  NYSE CLF  said that the impact of the new output won t be as severe as expected and will see the  50 per mt level holding  Yet banking analysts are not so sure with Westpac Banking Corporation  NYSE WBK  saying last month that rising supply will drive prices below last year s lowest point of  38 30  while Citigroup  NYSE C  expects an average of  45 mt next year 
Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  is among those foreseeing weakness  saying last month that prices may tumble back to  40 per mt this half as the approach of winter in China typically blunts steel demand and output  Even top three miner BHP Billiton  LON BLT  says prices will probably drop as the under performance of supply this year is reversed over the next 12 to 18 months 
For sure  the loss of Samarco production  BHP s two year rail maintenance program  and Rio Tinto s  LON RIO  delays due to its autonomous train program have all contributed to limit excess supply to the market this year 
China s stimulus and a surprisingly robust steel market have managed to lift prices this year to unexpectedly strong levels but most of these trends are expected to reverse in 2017 and it would appear investors may already be positioning themselves ahead of that new direction  SGX AsiaClear futures in Singapore have dropped for the past five weeks in the longest run since 2014  and the forward curve shows prices back below  50 per mt in December 
Miners See the Positive
Not all parties  of course  are pessimistic about prices  The Australian Financial Review said the market was surprised by both the increase in Chinese demand this year and the lack of urgency shown by miners toward getting new supply into the market 
Miners were optimistic that prices would hold steady  the article states  but few outside of top iron ore exporter Australia would agree  What would the impact of falling prices be next year  Lower input costs would feed through into better mill margins if demand remained robust but  generally  demand is not strong and the probability is that lower input costs for aggressive Chinese mills would encourage them to drop export prices and fight for demand in overseas markets  weakening the position for western mills to raise prices in their home markets

indicators  That controversial direct democracy vote determines the U K s status as a European Union country this Thursday  and likely much else down the road  Don t underestimate the consequences While the actual Brexit referendum vote dominates this Global Week Ahead  polls and bookies will actively and fiercely trade the result beforehand  That makes any share buying this week a tricky    but not unworthy    task  Expect most long term Europe and U K  hands to sit on their hands I found it interesting to note the damage control going on around the Brexit event   Mario Draghi speaks to the European Parliament on Tuesday   Janet Yellen speaks to a Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday too   The ECB governing council will meet in Frankfurt on Thursday There are  equally obviously  plenty of centrally organized plans to handle any fallout inside the U K  These will be discussed openly during the week  I haven t seen any listing of the Bank of England s schedule  That groups  vigilance is a foregone conclusion   The BoE will surely act in some way if the Brexit vote is for  leave  and swift consequences are seen in the U K  financial markets  particularly trading on the U K  pound  They will breath a sigh of relief for a  stay  status quo  So too will David Cameron and George Osborne   One can t help but wonder if the remaining Brexit theatre is a tragic comedy  a drawn out drama  or more like a short term action movie  with lots of explosions and no deaths The 3 month U K  pound low is  1 40  News about a turn up in Brexit  stay  polling sent it back above  1 46 on Monday  June 20th  That s the top of the recent U K  pound trading range  It s anyone s guess where it heads if  leave  wins the actual vote on Thursday  June 23rd  U K  pound bears bandy about a FX rate of  1 25  That sounds too low  Most fast money is already parked outside the pound  A  stay  vote likely gets it above  1 50 This latest Brexit  risk off  pullback means the moment is timely for non U S  share shopping    away from Europe and the U K 3 non U S  Materials and Energy sector stocks look good to me  Each pick offers great share valuations and a nice dividend  Strengthening

16493,238008,VALE,5 Best Top Ranked Stocks Of June,opinion,"Markets traversed a turbulent month  marked by concerns over a Brexit and the Fed s reluctance to hike rates  Ultimately a Brexit did occur  resulting in short term losses for stocks  Additionally  the Fed s reluctance to hike rates and indications that a low interest rate regime was likely to continue led to concerns about the economy  The Fed s decision was largely an outcome of a weaker labor market  though Brexit concerns also played their part 
June s Performance
For the month  the Dow increased 0 8   while the S P 500 ended marginally lower and Nasdaq declined 2 1   Utilities sector was the biggest gainer for the month  while financial services were the biggest laggards 
Investors remained cautious for most of the month over a possible exit of the U K  from the European Union  Ultimately  the surprise result of the referendum resulted in a sluggish month for key indexes 
Moreover  Fed s reluctance to hike rates also raised doubts about the strength of the domestic economy  May s discouraging jobs report  a low level of business investment and lower than expected inflation did little to help the Fed take a rate hike call 
Other economic data was mostly encouraging in nature  Further  global crude production disruptions  slump in U S  crude output and decline in the U S  commercial crude oil inventories had a positive impact on oil prices 
Brexit Dominates Market Proceedings
By the end of the second week of the month  concerns regarding  Brexit  raised global growth worries which in turn dampened investor sentiment  Such concerns dragged down government bond yields significantly which had a negative impact on financial stocks  Polls released at that point indicated that voters may cast their votes in favor for Britain s exit from the EU 
Investors were increasingly edgy over the referendum during the third week  Possibility of a Brexit intensified after fresh polls  which raised concerns about bouts of volatility and U K  sinking into recession  However  Member of Parliament Jo Cox s death led both the  leave  and  remain  camps suspend their campaigns temporarily 
During the fourth week  most of poll results were tilted towards a  Bremain  verdict  However  the United Kingdom ultimately voted in favor of leaving the European Union  The surprising referendum results pulled the global financial sector downward  which in turn negatively impacted the domestic financial domain 
However  benchmarks bounced backed after two trading days of losses  Investors grew optimistic and sought out assets mostly from beaten down sectors  Meanwhile  the dollar fell against the pound 
Disruptions Fuel Oil Price Rebound
During the first week  decline in oil prices had a negative impact on key U S  indexes  Oil prices fell after UAE Oil Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al Mazroui s comments reduced possibilities of production freeze and OPEC members failed to come to any agreement regarding crude production freeze in a meeting last week 
Over the second week  disruptions in crude production in Nigeria  slump in the U S  crude output and decline in the U S  commercial crude oil inventories had a positive impact on oil prices  Also  weakening of the U S  dollar following uncertainty over rate hike boosted oil prices 
Recent strikes of oil workers in Norway have also negatively impacted crude output  Also  refiners and oil producers in Venezuela struggled to maintain production following equipment shortages and power interruptions  Ultimately  global crude production disruptions  slump in U S  crude output and decline in the U S  commercial crude oil inventories had a positive impact on oil prices 
Q1 GDP Revised Upward 
The  third  estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 1 1   higher than the consensus estimate of a 1  increase  Further  first quarter GDP data was revised upward from the previously estimated 0 8  rise 
However  first quarter GDP growth was much lower than the rate of 1 4  recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015  Business spending declined for the second consecutive quarter  Also  consumer expenditure growth was revised downward from 1 9  to 1 5   This was primarily due to low spending levels on services  primarily recreation and transportation 
Ultimately  there were two major reasons for the upward revision in the estimate for first quarter GDP  Firstly  exports increased by 0 3   contrary to the earlier estimate of a decline of 2   Most importantly  business expenditure on software  research and development increased by 4 4  versus the earlier estimate of a 0 1  decline   read   
Positive Domestic Data
Data released through the month was mostly encouraging in nature  Encouraging data on private sector jobs  manufacturing and consumer spending increased chances of a rate hike  These reports raised speculations that economic growth had strengthened and had a positive impact on investor sentiment 
An increase in consumer credit boosted investor confidence  Retail sales increased 0 5  in and 2 5  year on year  Industrial production and capacity utilization declined while PPI increased  Durable orders decreased 2 2  in May to  230 7 billion  compared to a rise of 3 3  in April  It was also wider than the consensus estimate of 0 4  fall 
Housing Sector Still Upbeat
The only negative piece of housing data for the month was the decline in new home sales  Sales of new single family homes declined 6  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 51 000 units in May from a downwardly revised April rate of 5 86 000  The number  however  represents an 8 7  increase year over year 
Other housing indicators were largely positive  The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  reported that the home builder sentiment index  HMI  rose 2 points to 60 in June  after holding steady for the past four months 
Moreover  existing home sales rose 1 8  in May   its highest pace in almost a decade  per data released by the National Association of Realtors on Jun 20  Construction spending touched a five year high in April  per data released earlier this month  However  U S  housing starts fell 0 3  from a revised April number to an annual rate of 1 164 000 in May due to a decline in multi family production   read   
Job Additions Slump  Unemployment Rate Falls
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   the U S  economy created a total of only 38 000 jobs in May  significantly lower than the consensus estimate of 203 000  Nonfarm payrolls registered its lowest increase since Sep 2010  The tally was also considerably lower than March s downwardly revised job number of 166 000  The Labor Department also revised jobs additions downward in April by 37 000 
Meanwhile  the unemployment rate was 4 7  in May  reaching its lowest level since Nov 2007 and was lower than the consensus estimate of 4 9  and April s rate of 5   Labor force participation rate fell 62 6   as 458 000 individuals quit jobs or gave up jobs searches  which is the primary reason behind the decline in unemployment rate 
Further  the average hourly earnings gained 0 2  or 5 cents in May from previous month s figure to  25 59 per hour  in line with the consensus estimate  But  it was lower than April s 0 4  increase while year ago gains remained unchanged at 2 5  
FOMC Policy Statement
The Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  decided to keep federal funds rate unchanged between 0 25  and 0 5  following concerns regarding weak jobs data  The FOMC stated   The pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up  Although the unemployment rate has declined  job gains have diminished   Also  Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen said  Brexit  is likely to have  consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets  
Meanwhile  the Fed s decision to stick with its 2016 rate path also appears to be on shaky ground with just six of the 17 policymakers forecasting one rate hike this year  compared to only one Fed official take a similar view in March  Yellen said   I m not comfortable to say it s in the next meeting or two  but it could be  It s not impossible that by July  for example  we would see data that led us to believe that we are in a perfectly fine course  
Moreover  the central bank expects the key inflation rate to remain  low in the near term   Also  the fed funds rate is now expected to be 3  in the long run  compared to earlier projection of 3 3   Moreover  the Fed forecasted the economy would grow at 2  this year  declining from March s anticipation of 2 2  rise  The expected GDP growth rate for next year was also revised down from 2 1  to 2

quarter  the New York based aluminum giant saw its profits slump on a reported basis as lower metals prices and charges related restructuring dragged down its bottom line  However  its adjusted earnings topped expectations  a positive surprise of 250     Lower aluminum prices weighed on the company s sales that fell by double digits and came below expectations  Headwinds from lower metal prices more than offset gains from productivity actions in the quarter Alcoa  in April  reduced its global aluminum demand growth forecast to 5  from 6  expected earlier  The company also cut its 2016 global aerospace sales growth forecast to 6  8  from 8  9  expected earlier  Alcoa mentioned that careful ramp up of new program  inventory management at aerospace OEMs and declines in legacy program deliveries will affect this major end use market  Moreover  Alcoa expects a global aluminum deficit of 1 1 million metric tons for 2016  Global demand for aluminum is expected to grow faster than supply this year Alcoa s results are closely watched by investors as they shed light on demand trends for aluminum  a major industrial metal  across a large swath of industries  Investors will look particularly for management s commentary on demand trends and outlook for key industries  especially aerospace  and the company s planned split into two independent companies Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Watch ForAlcoa s aggressive cost cutting and productivity improvement actions are expected to continue to lend support to its earnings in the second quarter  While aluminum pricing environment has somewhat improved of late  due to a decline in aluminum inventories   prices of the metal are still under pressure as overcapacity remains a problem Moreover  production is expected to fall 50 000 metric tons in the company s Primary Metals unit in the second quarter due to the closure of Warrick Operations smelter in Indiana in March  This may put pressure on the segment s revenues Alcoa is actively pursuing its aerospace expansion strategy  The company recently landed a multi year supply contract with Brazil based leading commercial jets maker  Embraer  worth  470 million  The deal makes Alcoa the sole supplier for proprietary wing skins and fuselage sheet to Embraer The company  earlier this year  also cut a long term agreement with Boeing   NYSE BA   to supply multi material aerospace parts  Alcoa  last October  also inked a  1 billion deal with Airbus to supply the latter titanium  steel and nickel based superalloy aerospace fastening systems  The deal marked Alcoa s biggest fastener contract ever with Airbus Demand from the automotive market also remains healthy  While pricing remains a concern  strong shipments of automotive sheet products is expected to favorably impact the company s global rolled products business in the June quarter Alcoa is also trimming uncompetitive aluminum smelting and alumina refining capacity to move down the cost curve and maintain competitiveness in a challenging operating backdrop  The completion of all announced curtailments and closures are expected to remove roughly 25  operating smelting capacity and around 20  of operating refining capacity by the middle of next year However  Alcoa is exposed to currency headwinds and weakness across certain end use markets  Weakness in non residential building and construction market is expected to persist in Europe  The company also expects a double digit decline in the heavy duty truck and trailer market in North America in 2016  The North American packaging market also remains weak Alcoa remains on track to complete the separation of its smelting and refining business from those that cater to aerospace and automotive markets in second half 2016  The separation will result in the creation of two standalone entities    The Upstream Company  and  The Value Add Company   The future Value Add Company will be named  Arconic Inc   while the Upstream Company will be renamed  Alcoa Corporation  prior to the separationAlcoa recently filed an initial registration statement on Form 10 with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission   SEC   for the planned separation  The filing   an key milestone for the business split   includes preliminary detailed information about Alcoa Corporation as a standalone company The separation will provide shareholders with value creating investment opportunities  It will also mark the completion of Alcoa s multi year transformation ALCOA INC Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers Our proven

16543,238058,VALE,Steel Prices Offer No Foundation For Any Rise In First Half Of 2016,opinion,"On the face of it  China s record iron ore imports last month suggest the uptick in prices during the month wasn t an aberration 
But even though December s strong import figure of 96 27 million metric tons will boost 2015 iron ore imports to 953 36 mmt  nearly one billion  it masks an edifice that is crumbling before our very eyes 


Source  Business Insider Australia
China s iron ore imports are so high in part because domestic miners have finally begun to respond to the current low price situation and shutter production  Port stocks have risen in line with imports  Inventories have been rising for six of the last seven weeks  according to Bloomberg to 93 mmt 
Chinese Steel Production
China is churning out steel in spite of a slowdown in domestic demand with its surplus powering rising exports  China s steel exports rose by almost 20  in 2015 to a record 112 4 mmt  To put that in perspective that is enough to meet demand in Germany and Japan for a year and still leave almost 9 mmt to spare 
Such a level of exports is untenable in the medium term  Global demand is flat and trade tensions are rising  Exports will have to be reduced this year either voluntarily or by being shut out of mature markets by anti dumping actions 
Beijing knows this and has been trying to encourage steel producers to close excess capacity via a range of means but largely under the umbrella of environmental considerations  Steel production is a major source of pollution in China and with the country producing more than it needs   both steel and pollution   there is a strong case for a more forceful approach in the months ahead 


Source  Business Insider Australia 
The iron ore price though has continued its downward trend line  It isn t about demand  it s about supply and supply has grown relentlessly in tandem with the major producers  ability to drive down their costs to remain profitable 
Race to the Bottom
Much like Saudi Arabia s attempts to drive higher cost oil producers to the wall  Rio Tinto  L RIO  Group  BHP Billiton  L BLT  and Vale SA  N VALE  are driving smaller iron ore producers out of business  Just last week Bloomberg reported Anshan Iron and Steel Group are considering pulling funding out of their  2 billion joint venture in its Karara iron ore mine in Western Australia 
Meanwhile  Bloomberg reports BC Iron Ltd   AX BCI  is completing the suspension of its Nullagine joint venture with Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  OTC FSUGY   Australia s third biggest producer  as a result of lower prices  Last month China s Baosteel Group Corp  and partners mothballed a project in Western Australia citing uncertainty about future supply and demand for iron ore 
Iron Ore Prices in 2016
ANZ  AX ANZ    the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group   is reported to have said iron ore will test recent lows and more in the coming weeks while Capital Economics Ltd  is reported by Bloomberg to be predicting a wild ride for iron ore this year as it sees prices dropping into the  20s per mt before rallying to end the year higher 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc  N GS   has said the raw material will probably remain under  40 per mt for the next three years  as the slowdown in China becomes part of a long term structural change  Beijing seems to agree  saying China s steel production and demand are expected to continue to decline in 2016 according to the industry body the China Iron and Steel Association 
The big three  possibly the big four counting Fortescue  OTC FSUGY   iron ore producers probably reckon they have another 12 18 months to squeeze the competition out of business before they will consider reducing output to more closely balance demand and  hence  raise prices 
With coking coal in much the same position  steel input costs  therefore  should remain low in 2016  Even lower than in the 2015  and hence there remains no case globally for higher steel prices during 2016 in an oversupplied market 
The US market may be the only exception as scrap costs have firmed up of late  putting pressure on producers but the extent to which domestic producers can fend off the impact of imports by anti dumping legislation may determine price direction in the US  Buyers should consider buying hand to mouth as further weakness from a strong dollar and plentiful import supply should cap prices in the first half of this year ",2016-01-15,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/steel-prices-offer-no-foundation-for-any-rise-in-first-half-of-2016-380137,380137

16546,238061,VALE,Japan s Mitsui may miss metals profit target on iron ore slump,news,"By James Topham and Yuka Obayashi TOKYO  Reuters    Japanese trading house Mitsui   Co  T 8031  may miss the current year s profit target of  1 1 billion for its metals business due to the slump in iron ore  warned a senior executive  who said prices may fall to as low as  80 a tonne before rebounding 
Mitsui expects prices to rebound to  100 as early as the end of the year and the trading house s iron ore business will remain profitable even if prices fall as much as 30 percent  Hiroyuki Kato  Mitsui s executive in charge of energy and metals  told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday 
But his comments show that miners and investors in iron ore projects are feeling the pressure as demand drops in China  which takes in two thirds of the world s shipment of the steelmaking ingredient 
 There is a risk that the mineral and metal resources unit will miss our forecast   Kato said   It depends on how much impact from the slumping iron ore prices can be offset by cost cuts and production expansions  
Mitsui is forecasting profit of 380 billion yen   3 56 billion  for the year through March  of which the mineral and metal resources segment is expected to contribute 118 billion yen   1 10 billion  
Kato did not say by how much it may miss the target 
Spot iron ore prices have slumped 39 percent this year as growth in supply from low cost leading miners outstripped the increase in demand from China 
The big three iron ore miners   Rio Tinto  L RIO   AX RIO   BHP Billiton  AX BHP   L BLT   and Vale  SA VALE5   in whose holding company Mitsui has a 15 percent stake   are betting they can force out smaller competitors by ramping up production 
Iron ore for immediate delivery to China   IO62 CNI SI  dropped to  82 20 a tonne on Wednesday  the lowest since September 2009  according to data provider Steel Index 
 Iron ore prices may fall to as low as around  80  but that will put more suppliers in distress and force them to cut production capacities   Kato said 
 We think that the recent fall in iron ore prices is a temporary phenomenon and prices are likely to come back to around  100 soon     by the end of this year or the end of this business year   through March  the Mitsui executive said 
World No 2 iron ore miner Rio Tinto expects other miners worldwide to cut 125 million tonnes of iron ore capacity in 2014  roughly equal to the amount of new supply expected to come on stream from Australia and Brazil 
Mitsui had an annual iron ore output of 51 million tonnes in the last business year to March 31 through its equity holdings in mines 
Kato said Mitsui is sticking to a plan to boost output to 69 million tonnes by 2020 
LONG TERM LNG BUYERS
Japanese trading companies have wide ranging business portfolios often seen as similar to investment banks 
Mitsui  Japan s second biggest trading house after Mitsubishi Corp  T 8058   has spent over  18 6 billion on acquisitions since the start of the current decade  with 43 percent of that in the energy sector  Thomson Reuters data showed 
Kato said the trading house and its partners have secured buyers for about 70 percent of output from their liquefied natural gas  LNG  project off the coast of Mozambique 
It has a 20 percent stake in U S  based Anadarko Petroleum Corp s  N APC  gas project off the coast of Mozambique  which is working to become the first East African nation to export LNG  aiming to ship 10 million tonnes per annum of the superchilled gas  The first shipments are expected in 2018 or 2019  Kato said 
Anadarko and Mitsui are aiming to secure long term buyers for between 85 and 90 percent of the offtake of the huge gas field  Kato said 
For Cameron LNG project in the U S  state of Louisiana  which is owned 50 2 percent by U S  based Sempra  N SRE  and 16 6 percent by Mitsui  the production of its stake  or 4 million tonnes per annum  is  almost sold out   Kato said 
Mitsui will focus on three major projects  Mozambique  Cameron and Browse  in which Australia s Woodside Petroleum  AX WPL  holds the biggest stake and Mitsui owns a minority stake  Kato said 
The Japanese trading house is also keeping an eye out for other opportunities 
U S  oil and gas company Apache Corp  N APA  said in July it plans to sell interests in Australia s Wheatstone and Canada s Kitimat LNG projects 
 We can t say we are not interested  But we are focusing on the three main projects for now   Kato said  when asked whether Mitsui is interested in the Wheatstone project

There are a few main areas of concern for the investors 
1  Volatility  It is becoming very clear that investors are leaving certain names and asset types in droves  Junk bonds have been decimated  so have been the stocks of energy and commodities companies  Biotech  most tech stocks  financials  you name it  have all suffered  When this happens in smaller stocks that do not have enough liquidity in the market  the prices can reach ridiculous levels  Heck  superb buying opportunities are opening up even in preferred stock which tend to be less risky than common  Important to have cash on hand to take advantage of these 
2  China  They think China is slowing down  It is NOT slowing down  So the growth is no longer going to be 7 5  but rather 6   But it is still growth  The China problem is mostly an inventory problem  China overbought a lot of raw material and commodities based on their earlier growth estimates  Now that the growth is slowing  things have piled up  So China doesn t need to buy a lot of the stuff they need until the excess inventory of what they already have is used up  Eventually supply and demand balance  this has always been true and will always be true  unless there are irrational actors on the stage  which there can t be in the long run  
3  Commodities  See China above for the demand side of the equation  On the supply side  you might have noticed the big 3 VALE  N VALE   Rio Tinto  L RIO  and BHP Billiton  L BLT  raise production in the face of declining prices and a supply glut  There is a very good strategic reason for this  This kills off less cost efficient competitors faster and will make the recovery in the commodities cycle come faster than it normally would if left unattended  The big 3 will then be even bigger 3 as they would have grown their market share  But yeah  investors look at the short term impact on these companies and punish their stock  Long term investors should welcome the widespread short termism in the market as that is what makes these once in a lifetime valuations possible 
4  Global Trade  This is a big elephant in the room  The Baltic Dry Index is at 30  year low and as a leading indicator of the health of the global trade  and therefore the global economy   it will make anyone nervous  Already esteemed publications such as Zero Hedge are raising alarms that there is no ship moving in the waters and international commerce has come to a standstill  which is completely false   they should redact that story for lack of research   But it is true that things are not very good 
A similar scenario is playing out in Shipping as in the Commodities  Financially stronger companies that can afford to keep ordering new vessels amidst an industrywide multi year glut of ships that has pressured the charter rates downwards to record lows  Ultimately the weak will be removed and the strong will become stronger  We just find who the strong ones are and wait patiently  perhaps add to our positions when the rest of the market panics  which they do often  
5  Interest Rates  The Street has forgotten what an interest rate hike looks like and how to handle it  It has been so long since the previous series of rate hikes that most of the bankers today on the street were probably still working on their MBAs the last time rates were hiked 
6  Possibility of a Recession  There might be a stock market crash or there might not be one  This has been raised quite frequently recently  Partly due to the distress in the bond market  which can dry up business funding and available credit  There was too much money in the system and that is now being taken away  I think the markets might take some time to adjust  but they will eventually adjust  As a value investor  I would rather focus on individual businesses rather then the entire market 

This chart shows the long term performance of the Value Stock Guide Premium portfolio and compares it to investing in S P 500 or a Russell 2000 index over the same period of time 
Essentially  if you had put 100K each in VSG  S P 500 and Russell 2000 on July 23  2009  you would end up with  280K with Value Stock Guide Portfolio   222K with S P 500 index fund and  188K with Russell 2000 index fund 
Good thing about index funds are that you save a lot of money  Good thing about a great active manager is that you end up with a lot more money over a period of time  It is not always a straight line as you can see from the chart  From the annual performance table below  you will also see that the VSG Premium portfolio  though is correlated to some degree with these market indices  they do not exactly match up  That is common and shows that the portfolio has a different style than just buying everything in sight 
So far this year  we have kept ahead of both S P 500 and Russell 2000  Strangely  even though the proper benchmark for VSG portfolio is Russell 2000  due to small cap focus   our performance compared to Russell 2000 is quite impressive 

Last year we spent time building up cash in the portfolio to the current 30  or so  This year I expect this cash will be put to very good uses as the prices become very attractive in the smaller companies  We have invested in several cyclical industries  always looking for the strongest businesses that will outlast its competition  and are go0d values   They will all pay off as the markets in these industries recover 
This is probably the opportunity of a lifetime for a value investor  specially if you have cash and can deploy it when rest of the market is fleeing great equities  Staying out of the market in times like this is comfort  Investing at the lows is smart 
Update on the Premium Plan and The Upcoming Fund s 
So far the plans are on track and there is significant interest from my members  In short 

The VSG Premium will be the primary way for someone to participate in the fund unless I know you personally
VSG Premium will substantially have same holdings as the Funds  It will be a stepping stone for investors with enough capital to participate in the fund directly  For others  VSG Premium will continue to function as is ",2016-02-04,Shailesh Kumar,https://www.investing.com/analysis/january-2016-vsg-portfolio-and-market-update-383169,383169
16556,238071,VALE,ASX Reclaims 5000 Level As Iron Ore Becomes Flash Point,opinion,"The ASX renaissance
The ASX 200  like many other equity markets  has undergone a renaissance of fortune  reclaiming the 5000 level after trading down to 4706 on 10 February 
Despite a 6 3  rally  the index is neither overbought technically  the 14 day RSI is only at 54  or reached an extreme if we look at market internals  A simple look at the percentage of companies trading above their 20 day moving average shows this level to be 68   which is certainly healthy and a nice move from 24  of 10 February   but again  not at extremes  It really shows good participation in the rally  We have also seen the percentage of stocks trading at a four week low fall to 3   while those at a four week high have increase to 16   This is still a low number and we shouldn t think about contrarian positions  purely using internals as a guide  until we see 50  of stocks at a four week high 
The short term traders have had a field day in the resource names and we can see 11  of ASX 200 companies now 50  from a 52 week low  More short term  there are 11 stocks on the market which have rallied 40  or more from their 30 day low which shows just how aggressive the recent turnaround has been  Names like AX BSL  AX MIN  AX OZL  AX NST  AX FMG  AX BPT and AX AWE actively traded here 

The bulls will be gunning for a break of the 1 February high of 5074  which could suggest a more protracted move into the 5300 region  although this still seems like a big ask  Certainly  the market internals suggest we are not at extremes and this could feasibly happen  Our opening call sits at 5026   another strong open helped by some solid US and European leads driven by further stellar gains in the materials and energy space 
Iron fire
Iron ore has become a flash point for the changing risk story in the ASX 
It has added 34 5  since the December 2015 low  and is up 18 2  year to date 
The spot price since China s return from Lunar New Year has seen Qingdao delivery adding 18  since February 15 
Iron ore is bucking forecasted supply demand expectations  partly due to Vale  N VALE  and BHP  N BHP  being impacted by the Samarco disaster which skewed forecasted supply  it has taken approximately 22 million tonnes per annum of forecasted output off the table   However  stockpiling into China is clearly driving demand which is also positively impacting price to the current price of US 51 52 a tonne 
The impact on listed firms has been clear  BHP is up 30  from its low  N RIO has added 9  since its results that saw 50  decline in statutory net profit  AX FMG is up over 20   while some junior miners have added between 15  to 36  
The second positive from the iron ore price is that it is now US 8 ahead of treasury expectations once C1 cost are included  This is an unexpected delight for the budget and an unexpected concern for the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  
The AUD perfect storm
The AUD is now well off the lows and has a perfect storm scenario facing it 
It was the best performing currency overnight and had some of its biggest moves again the EUR  GBP and JPY in over 18 months to seven years 
The Brexit can partly explain the 3  move against the GBP  however  the EUR and JPY moves are a bigger issue for the RBA 
The perfect storm trade 
Carry trade   AAA sovereign rating  a budget in relatively good shape compared to global peers  and bond yields over 200 basis points ahead of global peers 
Commodity bounces   iron ore is clearly a public and private firm positive  however the oil price bounce is also a risk on positive seeing risk currencies returning to the fore 
RBA rates   the cash rate is likely to be rooted to 2  despite calls to see it lowered  The fact that the RBA itself wants the AUD at around US 0 65 suggests this rate could be lowered  However  the heat that the rate cut could put into the domestic market is a risk too far for the RBA in these current conditions 
This will mean that the AUD is likely to freely move to the upside  We see no reason for the AUD not to move back to the mid 73 cent handle  and even higher if the carry trade ramps up on the back of the European Central Bank moving the deposit rate further into the red  It s an unwanted consequence of risk s return ",2016-02-23,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thoughts-from-collins-place-200119191,200119191

Commentary

This week was remarkable  but you may not realize it by simply reviewing the major indices 
The S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   closed up 2 7  for the week  dominated by a 2 4  rally to start the month of March  This move was a convincing confirmation of a 50DMA breakout that ushered in the first overbought period in 414 trading days 

The S P 500 has followed through on its breakout with gains every day of this overbought period 


The NASDAQ s follow through has been more muted than the S P 500 s

At 1999 99  the S P 500 is still below declining 200DMA resistance  As the chart above shows  even the NASDAQ experienced a very moderate follow through to its own 50DMA breakout  Traders have to turn to T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  and T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  to see the remarkable  relative  strength in the market 

T2108 has raced upward in a near straight line since going oversold for the last time  At 83 3   T2108 is at a level last seen in January  2013 


T2107 has also raced higher nearly non stop and has now finally returned to recent highs 

T2108 and T2107 provide evidence of a rapidly healing market  This healing is not readily evident from the major indices  T2108 was last this high in January  2013  T2108 is back to the highs seen after the recovery from the August angst  T2108 is so high that I am not expecting a lot further progress  I have only recorded THREE periods since 1986 where more than 90  of stocks traded above their respective 40DMAs  February to March  1991  May to June  2003  and April to May  2009  Stock market historians will notice that these were the sharp recovery months following major market sell offs  The last few stocks that have yet to recover above their 40DMAs are mainly the worst of the lot  I will give examples below of speculative stocks that have ripped higher for big gains  The stocks who could not gain on a week like this last one are simply not likely to gain much support later without a direct stock specific catalyst 
I now move from T2108 to T2107  As long as T2107 can continue its advance  I will assume the market is still getting stronger  I have downgraded my trading call from bullish to cautiously bullish to reflect the dependence on a new dynamic  Moreover  the S P 500 is now  close enough  to its 200DMA resistance to warrant even more caution than what I expressed when the index first began testing its 50DMA resistance  the index also finally showed more tentativeness by fading off Friday s intraday high 
Overall  the trading rules I introduced in the last T2108 Update remain  I will stay bullish until if the S P 500 closes below its 50DMA support AND follows through  Even a failure to break through 200DMA resistance will not cause me immediate alarm  especially if T2107 is advancing  Since there is little room between the 50 and 200DMAs  I do not feel an urgency to switch back to a bearish bias  The bearish alarms will go off if once T2108 tumbles out of overbought status  below 70   
The volatility index  the VIX  managed to print a marginal gain  but it remains in a definite downtrend  The VIX is on a path to return to the old 15 35 pivot 

The volatility index  the VIX  continues its breakdown 

The Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  is fully supporting the bullish market sentiment  However  against the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY   the Aussie is getting very stretched  It has closed above its upper Bollinger Band   BB  for four days straight and Friday s close was well above the region that defines two standard deviations from the 20DMA  Resistance also looms overhead from the 200DMA 

AUD JPY confirms bullish sentiment by breaking out of the recent consolidation above 3 1 2 year lows  Now I watch for a retest of 200DMA resistance 


AUD USD is particularly impressive at a 7  month high 
Currency speculators are further confirming a bullish change in sentiment with increasing net long positions on the Australian dollar 

Speculators have not been this bullish on the Australian dollar since September  2014
Source  
The signs of bullishness are actually everywhere and easy to find  I present a a stream of charts showing different flavors and aspects of the current bullishness  yet they are just a small sample  I also discuss the key trades I have made in the past three days 
First the trades with no charts 
I decided to finally sell all my shares of ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  and ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE SVXY   This closes out my T2108 oversold trades  From here  I will primarily focus on the trades of individual stocks  I will get interested in SSO and SVXY on the next big dip in the market  I sold my shares in Tableau  NYSE DATA  just in time  The stock is sliding along its 20DMA  A critical Bollinger Band squeeze is developing  I added a few hedges with shares in Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X ETF  NYSE ERY  and Direxion Daily Russia Bear 3X ETF  NYSE RUSS   I also sold the bulk of my shares in FXCM  NYSE FXCM  
What better way to start a chart fest than with Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  
CAT is following along with the run up in commodities  CAT has ripped off a 26  gain from the January lows  When it tested 200DMA resistance I purchased a new round of hedges with put options  CAT promptly faded from this resistance  Needless to say  my overall bullishness will be tainted if CAT turns south from here 

Caterpillar  CAT  faces its next critical test at 200DMA resistance 

Apple  AAPL  finally woke up this week  It not only broke out above 50DMA resistance  but also it broke through a region of consolidation  I am rubbing my eyes as I contemplate a LONG overdue AAPL bottom  I could not pull the trigger on AAPL calls this past week because the stock traded along the upper BB  Going long at such an out stretched point carries too much risk for a short term trade  Buyers are showing off by maintaining the upward pressure here 

Apple  AAPL  makes a strong case for a bottom 

Joy Global  NYSE JOY  ripped higher in post earnings trade  No doubt  this burst added a little more confidence to CAT buyers  I last talked about JOY on October 9  2015 as a  catch up  stock for buyers late to the bounce from oversold conditions  I have traded in and out of JOY since then with mixed results  The April call options I bought shortly after my post are now back to even with the stock returning to those October levels  With hindsight  I should have  backed up the truck  when JOY confirmed 50DMA support on February 24th 

Joy Global  JOY  has more than doubled since hitting an historic 12 year low in January

The commodity space has been absolutely fascinating  There is nothing like a run up in this space to scream bullishness  In the previous week  I decided to double down on iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  despite its big pullback  I assumed the 50DMA support would hold  and it did  I locked in my profits with SLV touching its upper BB  I did not open a fresh short term trade on SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  because it did not dip enough  it has proved out once again the power of my method of analyzing short term gold moves  I was very fortunate to let go of my raging bearishness on iron ore long enough to pair my standing put options on BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited  BHP  with a fistful of call options on Rio Tinto plc  LON RIO   The BHP put options are nearly worthless  but I almost paid for them with the profits I took on my RIO call options  Going forward  I will be trading this space a lot more actively   Stay tuned for my trading calls  

The iShares Silver Trust  SLV  survived what initially looked like another failure to hold a 200DMA breakout  It now needs to print a higher high 


SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  is still going strong with resolute buyers  Printing a fresh 13 month high was a signature moment 


Rio Tinto plc  RIO  has churned higher to levels last seen in December by surviving what looked like a devastating gap down below its 50DMA  THe earnings and dividend cut has turned into the latest bottoming event   The numbers in the chart approximate the sport price of iron ore  


BHP Billiton Limited  BHP  looks even stronger than RIO now 


Vale S A   NYSE VALE  has jumped from a 13 year low to print a double 

Steel stocks have ripped higher along with commodities  Nevermind that higher commodities are adding to costs  Hopefully  demand is ripping even higher 

Market Vectors Steel ETF  NYSE SLX  has risen an incredible 42  from the January lows  This is a major run up for an index and speaks to a broad bullishness across steel stocks  50DMA support was long ago confirmed  Now  200DMA resistance looms large 


U S  Steel  NYSE X  caught the bug late  The majority of its gains from the lows have happened in just the past week 

The Australian dollar has of course benefited from the sharp recovery in commodities  Emerging markets have as well  or have perhaps helped drive commodities higher   The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  soared 9 4  on the week with a confirmation of a 50DMA breakout  With EEM stretched well above its upper BB  I took this moment to re establish one of my favorite hedge trades  long out of the money call and put options 

iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  is streaking relentlessly 

The market is so bullish that even broken down GoPro  NASDAQ GPRO  is filing a petition for a breakout  Friday s big fade put that request in jeopardy 

GoPro  Inc   GPRO  is struggling to notch a 50DMA breakout 

Some of my biggest successes from this rally have come from the shares of home builders  I will cover some of my latest opinions in future posts  Here is iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  with a 17  gain from February lows with a near relentless march upward 

The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  is making a well deserved comeback 

Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc   NASDAQ RRGB  is making a steady surge higher  The rise is nearly in stealth mode as the stock makes very incremental gains in a curved form through the upper BB channel 

Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc  is turning the corner from what looks like a sustainable bottom 

Like AAPL  Shopify Inc   NYSE SHOP  is breaking out of a tight period of consolidation  Buyers have made a convincing comeback from February s false 50DMA breakout 

Shopify Inc   SHOP  is making a case for a bottom by breaking out of a consolidation period 

Tesla Motors  NASDAQ TSLA  followed through on my earlier claim that the stock would bounce back quickly from the Citron related selling  I locked in my profits on Thursday thinking that buyers would only be able to reverse the selling before resuming a press downward  Buyers did not stop there  They decided instead to continue the previous momentum with what is now a bullish 50DMA breakout  Notice the increase in volume and increasing on balance volume  OBV  

Tesla Motors  TSLA  has continued its run up after what now looks like a Citron speedbump 

Wal Mart Stores  NYSE WMT  has stalled with a 200DMA pivot  At these levels  the stock is neatly holding onto a reversal of October s big sell off  This is a critical juncture  Buy on the breakout  buy on the next big dip to 50DMA support 

Wal Mart Stores  WMT  is stuck in a 200DMA pivot  but it still enjoys 50DMA support 

Controversial Weight Watchers International  Inc   NYSE WTW  was walloped after earnings  but the 200DMA held true as support  Getting over the immediate pre earnings price could launch the next big run up  Otherwise  a lot more churn may be ahead 

Weight Watchers International  Inc   WTW  continues surviving tests of 200DMA support 

Finally  financials are also strong participants in the rally  The 50DMA breakout pretty much confirms February s abandoned baby bottom and 2 1 2 year closing low as a sustainable bottom 

Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  breaks out above its 50DMA and has very likely confirmed the 2 1 2 year low as a sustainable bottom

16558,238073,VALE,Is Iron Ore s Jump A Warning Sign ,opinion,"Iron ore surge   bullish signal or warning signal 
Huge moves in the commodities space overnight have not translated well into the equities markets striking a note of caution that this current rally may be running out of steam  The 19  jump in iron ore overnight   the biggest ever one day increase   looks far more like a warning signal than a bullish market turn  There was little within the National Party Congress announcements that warranted such a move  nor was it replicated in Chinese equities  More it raises concerns about the ability for  to make outsized gains  as we ve seen time and again in the copper market over the past year  Nonetheless  these moves are all fairly positive for the Aussie dollar  commodity related equities and the banks  and we are calling the ASX up 0 5  today  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  AX FMG  had a stormer yesterday and has today announced a joint venture with VALE SA  NYSE VALE  alongside the potential purchase of a minority stake  while BHP Billiton Ltd  AX BHP  s ADR is pointing to a 5 1  open today  which all points to more positivity in the materials space 
It is lucky that the market cap weighting of the banks and materials are so high in the ASX  because the rest of the market has not been faring very well at all  Utilities  telcos  industrials  consumer discretionary and healthcare  in order of worst performers  have all seen declines over the past week  A lot of these stocks by and large are impacted by the rise in the Aussie dollar 
The Aussie dollar is not far from the US 0 7500 level  but it seems unlikely to continue at these levels  Particularly  with the upcoming Fed meeting on 16 March  there is a high likelihood that the big improvement in US data warrants a far more hawkish statement from the Fed  putting rate hikes back on the table and seeing a corresponding strengthening of the US dollar  Such a scenario is likely to drive a pullback in commodity prices and the Aussie dollar 
China
China released their February FX reserves data overnight with reserves declining by USD 28 6 billion  far less than expected  Clearly  Chinese reserve valuations benefitted from the fall in the US dollar in February  and there seems to be little evidence that expectations for the CNY to devalue have eased 
Month to month variance in FX reserves is common  trend is still clearly for more declines 

In M2 ratio terms  FX reserves are now at 14 6    their lowest level since August 2003 

Money is still clearly leaving China  Capital flows through the trade account are plaintively obvious when one compares China s reported imports from Hong Kong with Hong Kong s reported exports to China 


CNY devaluation concerns may also be behind some of the massive moves in industrial metals  prices  It seems no coincidence that stock piling in iron ore and copper began to pick up pace around August 2015 when China first devalued the currency  Some the stock piling may well be related to CNY devaluation expectations as investors look to physical assets to store their wealth  This would seemingly make the case that the big rally we are seeing in industrial metals is based on shaky ground that has little to do with fundamental supply and demand dynamics 
Shanghai Futures Exchange copper stockpiles are at their highest levels on record  with numbers increasing dramatically from August 

August also sticks out as the pickup in iron ore inventories as well ",2016-03-08,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thoughts-from-collins-place-200120754,200120754

News that the world s bigger miner  BHP Billiton  LON BLT   anticipated a 4  decline in Australian mine output  due to weather and railroad maintenance  helped support prices  Yesterday Rio Tinto  LON RIO  made a similar announcement  Late today  VALE SA  NYSE VALE   the world s largest iron ore miner  will report earnings  it is expected to announce record quarterly output  The rise iron ore prices is helping blunt the impact of the pullback in oil prices 
News that the Kuwaiti labor dispute has been resolved  coupled with a larger than expected estimated build in the US by API  3 1 mln barrels vs  expectations for two mln barrels  spurred profit taking  sending oil prices down around 2   The official DOE estimate is expected to confirm the API estimate  Support basis the June light sweet crude futures contract is seen in the  40 50  41 00 band  
There have been two economic reports of interest today  Japan s trade balance and the UK labor report  Japan s March trade surplus was a little smaller than expected at JPY755 bln  which is still almost a six year high  Exports were fractionally stronger than expected  falling only 6 8  rather than median forecast of 7   In February  exports fell 4   Imports fell 14 9   The median forecast was for a 16 6  decline after a 14 2  decline in February 
There is a strong seasonal pattern in Japanese trade figures  For at least the past dozen years  Japan s January trade balance has always deteriorated from December  and the February balance has always improved  March has been a bit more mixed  but the balance has improved three of the past four years  In the second quarter  the balance typically deteriorates in April and May before improving in June  
The UK labor market report was mostly disappointing  though broadly consistent with other economic data that points some loss of momentum  The claimant count rose 6 7k rather than fall by 10k as had been anticipated  Those looking for work increased by 21k to 1 7 mln  the first increase of the year  Employment rose by 20k  the smallest increase since last June  
Earnings growth was slower   On a year over year basis  for the three months through February average weekly earnings rose 1 8  compared with 2 1  in January  The unexpected decline appears to reflect a sharp drop in bonuses in the financial sector  Excluding bonuses  average earnings growth was unchanged at 2 2   
The dollar rose to almost JPY109 50 yesterday but has been unable to extend the recovery off Monday s spike low to JPY107 70  As the North American session is about to begin  the dollar is straddling the JPY109 00 area  The low has held on three tests  A move above JPY109 50 JPY109 75 is needed to lift the tone  Otherwise  additional sideways choppy trading can be expected  
Yesterday  sterling rose to test the trendline drawn off the early February and mid March highs that comes in near  1 4430 today   The pullback is quite modest today  and the resilience of sterling in the face of the poor  disappointing labor report is notable  Three month implied volatility has pulled back a little  but the premium being paid for puts over calls remains near record levels  A few recent polls show those that want to remain in the EU are holding on to a small lead  Many observers are recognizing how vulnerable UK sentiment may be to geopolitical developments between now and the end of June when the referendum will be held 
The euro reached  1 1385 yesterday  a four day high  but euro has hardly backed off   It reached a low today near  1 1350  It has been confined to about a quarter cent range today  The market may be cautious ahead of tomorrow s ECB meeting  
Recall at the March meeting  the euro was falling as Draghi announced several measures meant to provide additional monetary support  However  the euro reversed course and rallied as Draghi suggested there was no more room to cut rates  Subsequently  he and other ECB members tried walking back from the claim  but will little avail  
The ECB s Mersch s recent comment noting that the ECB does not have a target for the euro was politically correct  but not particularly helpful in offsetting the tightening of financial conditions represented by the euro s appreciation  There is some risk that at the press conference tomorrow following the ECB meeting  Draghi may be more forceful in resisting premature tightening

Chicago  IL   May 04  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industrial Metals  part 3  including Rio Tinto  LON RIO  plc    NYSE RIO     BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Limited    NYSE BHP    and Vale S A     NYSE VALE    

Industry  Industrial Metals  part 3

Link  

For the industrial metals industry  demand will remain strong in the years to come given their varied uses  While industrial metals would gain from healthy momentum in Automotive and recovery in the Construction space  the industry remains saddled by a number of headwinds 

Below  we have discussed some of the key reasons and what investors in the industrial metals sector should be wary of in the coming months as well as over the long term The Perennial Problem of the Industry   Oversupply
	Iron  The threat of oversupply continues to plague the industry as major iron ore producers  Rio Tinto plc    NYSE RIO     BHP Billiton Limited    NYSE BHP     Vale S A     NYSE VALE    and Fortescue Metals Group Limited ramped up production in recent years  They intend to continue exploring for iron ore in Australia despite lower growth forecasts from China and weaker iron ore prices  betting on continued strength in iron ore demand over the long term  Hence  Australia  the world s top exporter of iron ore  will rev up its shipments 
	Recently  Rio Tinto announced that its 2017 iron ore shipments would be lower by about 15 million tons  BHP followed suit and stated its plans to cut annual production by 10 million tons to 229 million tons this year  Vale  too  revealed its expectations of full year iron ore production coming in at the lower end of the previous guidance of 340 350 million tons 

However  as well intended as the plans are  they may not be sufficient to balance the demand supply gap  Excess supply over demand  economic downturn in China and severe rivalry between mining giants will keep iron ore prices in check  Weakening market prices of iron ore continue to hurt miners  aggregate revenues and margins 
	Copper  The International Copper Study Group  ICSG  expects a deficit of around 130 000 metric ton in 2016 as demand growth outpaces the production ramp up  Earlier  at its Apr 2015 meeting  the ICSG had guided a surplus of 230 000 tons for this year 
	However  while some companies are announcing production cuts  Rio Tinto and BHP  separately and in joint ventures  plan to mine millions of additional tons of copper  They are amassing vast copper holdings to capture a greater chunk of the  140 billion global market in a bid to eventually squeeze out high cost producers just as they did in the global iron ore business Slowdown in China
	Demand in China that alone accounts for a major portion of the industrial metal demand has slowed down due to the country s tepid property market and weaker infrastructure investment growth  China s economic growth has cast a shadow on investors  view of commodities demand and  as a result  brought down demand for metals  leading to price weakness 
	The International Monetary Fund  IMF  raised its Chinese growth forecast from 0 2  to 6 5  for this year  and to 6 2  for 2017  citing resilient domestic demand and the recent stimulus measures introduced in Beijing  However  the predicted rate of growth remains well below 6 9  growth achieved in 2015  As per the IMF  a sharper slowdown in China could have a serious impact on trade  commodity prices and confidence  and lead to a more generalized slowdown in the global economy 
	Given that China is responsible for approximately half of the global metal demand  the slowdown in the world s second largest economy will likely hurt commodity prices  Metal prices are  therefore  projected to decline 14  in 2016 and 1  in 2017 Weakness in Emerging Economies
	Steel demand in some emerging economies continues to be weak  A deteriorating external environment  in the form of weak exports  low commodity prices  capital outflows and currency devaluation  adds to the woes of these economies  Moreover  geopolitical and internal tensions remain a major concern for these nations 
	Brazil and Russia have been struggling with their internal and structural issues  thereby leading to continually muted demand for steel  going forward  The Brazilian economy  with its political uncertainty  caused a 16 7  plunge in steel demand in 2015  which is expected to drop another 8 8  this year 

A Stronger U S  Dollar
	Base metals  as commodities  move in opposite directions to the dollar  Both markets remain closely linked to each other as every turn in the dollar is either followed by  or coincides with  a turn in the price of commodities  The strengthening of the dollar can lead to a drop in industrial metals  prices Falling Oil Prices
	The ongoing slump in oil prices  which has been plunging to five year lows  had a noticeable impact on industrial metal prices last year  A sharp and sustained drop in oil prices is generally associated with declining sales and prices of other commodities  The entire commodities sector may be impacted negatively in the wake of the current oil price carnage Bottom Line
	Global uncertainties and oversupply conditions of base metals are some of the sector s worst detractors  But what about investing in the space right now  are there opportunities for short term investors overriding the headwinds 
	Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now

Private sector employment gains slowed in April  According to Automatic Data Processing employers added 156 000 new jobs in April  it was the lowest level in 3 years  The ADP report is an early indicator of Friday s non farm payroll report from the Labor Department  The Friday jobs report is expected to show about 200 000 new jobs in April  but that s before the weak report from ADP 
The productivity of U S  businesses and workers fell by a 1  annual rate in the first quarter  marking the fourth decline in the past six quarters  Over the past year productivity has risen at a 0 6  pace  well below the historic 2 2  U S  average  In the first quarter  output of the goods and services businesses sell edged up 0 4   Yet the amount of time employees worked rose a much faster 1 5   As a result  unit labor costs climbed 4 1  in the first quarter  the biggest increase since the end of 2014  Still  unit labor costs have risen just 2 3  in the past year  little changed from the prior quarter  Higher productivity is the key to better pay and an improved standard of living 
The U S  trade deficit shrank in March by almost 14  to  40 4 billion   the lowest level in more than a year   but the plunge reflected a tough climate for American exporters and more caution on the part of consumers  U S  exports fell 0 9  to  176 6 billion in March  Imports fell an even steeper 3 6  to  217 1 billion and touched a five year low  The decline in imports offers more evidence that consumers are cautious and reluctant to spend 
The Institute for Supply Management said its non manufacturing index rose to 55 7  in April from 54 5   marking the highest level of 2016  The index surveys executives in industries such as retail  health care  hospitality  finance and technology that employ the vast majority of American workers  In April  the new orders index climbed 3 2 points to 59 9   The employment gauge rose 2 7 points to 53    the highest reading of the year  Readings over 50  signal more businesses are expanding instead of contracting 
is snowballing into one of the biggest avalanches in the history of corporate America  with 59 oil and gas companies now bankrupt following this week s Chapter 11 filings by Midstates Petroleum and Ultra Petroleum  According to Reuters data  the number of U S  energy bankruptcies is closing in on the 68 filings seen during the depths of the telecom bust of 2002 and 2003  A 60 percent slide in oil prices since mid 2014 erased as much as  1 trillion from the valuations of U S  energy companies  according to the Dow Jones Oil   Gas Index  which tracks about 80 stocks  This has already surpassed the  882 billion peak to trough loss in market capitalization from the Dow Jones Telecommunications Sector Index in the early 2000s 
Some oil producers appear to be holding on  hoping the price of crude stabilizes at a higher level  Until recently  banks had been willing to offer leeway to borrowers in the shale sector  but lately some lenders have tightened their purse strings  A widely predicted wave of mergers in the shale space has yet to materialize as oil price volatility makes valuations difficult  and buyers balk at taking on debt loads until target companies exit bankruptcy  In the debt market  there are signs that lots of money could be lost this time around  especially in high yield bonds  U S  oil and gas companies sold about  350 billion in debt between 2010 and 2014  the peak years of the oil and gas boom  with junk bonds making up more than 50 percent of all issuance 
 have declined sharply from the intense pace that pushed them to record levels in 2015  a sign that could reflect broader weakness in the American economy and vulnerability for U S  stocks  So far in 2016  the dollar value of completed deals is 22  below the same period last year  while the number of transactions is down 13   as expectations of higher interest rates and more government regulation is making mergers seem more expensive and risky 
Brazilian prosecutors have filed a civil claim against iron miner Samarco and its owners BHP Billiton  LON BLT  and VALE SA  SA VALE5   demanding damages over the deadly collapse of a dam last November  The  44 billion lawsuit is the result of a six month investigation into the catastrophe  which led to the pollution of a major river and killed 19 people

This is a busy week for earnings reports  For many traders  earnings reports don t mean a hill of beans but many investors like to pore over the numbers  Stocks can be affected by central bank policies  macro global events  and existential crises  But in spite of  and especially in the absence of those  big picture  market impactors  it s earnings that drive stock prices in the longer term 
And because there is so much riding on earnings  there is a concerted effort by companies and Wall Street analysts and the media to make the earnings look a lot better than they really are  Headline earnings numbers fed to us by companies  analysts  and the media are more often than not jacked up by means of creative accounting tricks 
The headline earnings reports investors take as gospel every quarter when the dog and pony shows start up  are non GAAP  pro forma   Street  earnings  not bona fide earnings based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  As you know  the difference between non GAAP and GAAP earnings can be huge and can trap investors 
Last year is just another example of the disparity between real and unreal earnings numbers  According to the Wall Street Journal  headline or pro forma earnings for companies in the S P 500 in 2015 were 25  higher than GAAP earnings  That s the biggest disparity since 2008  A CNBC com analysis found a similar gap in 2015 earnings 
In February 2016  regarding 2015 earnings  FactSet reported that  67 percent of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average reported non GAAP earnings per share and  on average  that the difference between the GAAP and non GAAP earnings per share for these companies was approximately 30 percent  representing a significant increase from approximately 12 percent in 2014 
The first quarter earnings season has crossed the midway point with more and more companies coming out with positive earnings surprises  According to Zack s Earnings Trend report  out of the 310 S P 500 members that have reported as of last Friday  71 9  of them have beaten earnings estimates with 57 1  beating on the revenue front 
However  total earnings for these companies are down 7 2  year over year on a 2 4  decline in sales  First quarter earnings for S P 500 companies are now expected to dip 7 3  year over year on 1 1  lower revenues with the Energy sector being a major drag 
That s really quite amazing  earnings are down but companies still beat estimates  not just a few but 71 9   That s a lot of beats  Analysts have been furiously ratcheting down their earnings estimates since January  while company accountants  with executives standing tall over them  have been making  adjustments  right and left in their earnings and expense columns 
The regulators have noticed because you would have to be blind not to notice  The SEC is worried about how investors are being misled  SEC chief accountant James Schnurr criticized the rampant use of non GAAP measures in a recent speech  saying   SEC staff has observed a significant and  in some respects  troubling increase  in the use of  and nature of adjustments within  non GAAP measures   So  the next question is   what will the regulators do about this non GAAP gimmickry  And we all know the answer is that the regulators will do nothing 
What can you do  Well  if earnings really matter to your analysis  then be sure to pay attention to the numbers they aren t talking about on the earnings calls  Compare Non GAAP and GAAP numbers side by side  Make sure there is a reasonable explanation for the adjustments represented by Non GAAP numbers  Look at all numbers sequentially 
For example  look at changes in top line revenue sequentially over the past four quarters to a year ago  because how a company is doing in sales and generating revenue is hard to mess with  If you look at earnings numbers sequentially  it s easier to spot anomalies that you might miss if you just compare this quarter s numbers to the same quarter a year ago 
Here s what you can learn from Non GAAP numbers  they can show you how often a business will resort to bending the rules in their reporting  they have a use when comparing extraordinary items  like gains or losses from sales of major production assets  they have a use if the types of events keep getting repeated  and the recurring use of Non GAAP might be valuable in letting you know the report is full of garbage  In other words  it makes it easier to identify the stinkers ",2016-05-05,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-gimmicks-200128056,200128056
16576,238091,VALE,After standoff  Vale and China s Cosco both claim shipping victory,news,"By Stephen Eisenhammer and Brenda Goh RIO DE JANEIRO SHANGHAI  Reuters    In the end  the answer to Brazilian miner Vale s Chinese shipping problem turned out to be in the problem itself 
For two years  Vale SA s  SA VALE5  Valemax mega ships   designed to cut the costs of transporting iron ore to China   have not been allowed to dock at Chinese ports  stalling the miner s  4 billion strategy 
Behind the safety concerns blamed for the ban  industry insiders said the Chinese shipping industry  led by Cosco  lobbied hard to keep out the Brazilian ships  although the state owned company denies it was ever involved 
But the argument is now moot because Vale on Friday announced a deal with Cosco  and analysts forecast the Valemax ships will soon be docking in China  If they are right  it will mark a long awaited breakthrough for Vale  allowing it to better compete with Australian rivals BHP Billiton Ltd  AX BLT  and Rio Tinto Ltd  L RIO  
Under the new deal  Vale agreed to sell and then lease back four of its mega ships from Cosco  as well as committing to leasing 10 more vessels to be built by the Chinese company  The financials of the deal have not been released and it remains to be seen which side gave the most ground  But it does mark the end of a long fight that had become important for the two companies to resolve  Both can now claim victory 
COMPETING WITH AUSTRALIA
With the price of iron ore now at five year lows  the deal comes at a vital time for Vale  Without lower freight costs  it risks losing more market share to its Australian rivals  who are not only closer to China  but have also managed to increase production at a staggering rate over the past few years 
The Valemax is the world s biggest dry bulk vessel  spanning the length of three soccer fields bow to stern and costing around  120 million apiece  If they were able to take cargoes directly to China  Vale would save about  7 a ton over current costs  closing the gap with the Australian iron ore producers  who have normally had a  10 per tonne advantage 
This will protect profits as Vale invests heavily to expand production by 90 million tonnes at its flagship iron ore mine  Carajas 
For Cosco  which offers services from shipbuilding to port operations through subsidiaries and its listed units  China COSCO  SS 601919   HK 1919  and COSCO Corp  SI COSC   the deal is a successful defense of the domestic shipping industry against what it saw as the threat of a potential foreign monopoly 
The state owned company controls over 800 vessels and one of the world s largest dry bulk fleets  Vale s mega ships were a threat to this business even as it was already suffering from falling freight costs  Since reaching their peak in 2008  shipping prices as measured by the main sea freight index at London s Baltic Exchange  BADI  have fallen 90 percent 
So industry insiders say Cosco lobbied hard  even though the Chinese economy stood to benefit from the Valemax ships as Chinese steel companies bought cheaper iron ore and shipbuilders built the vessels 
 Essentially   the deal  marks the end of Vale s strategy of moving into the shipping industry   said Bocom International analyst Geoffrey Cheng 
Vale argues it was never really trying to break into the shipping market  wanting only to lock in lower long term freight costs 
For Cosco  the deal also offers a vital stream of income  The group s flagship company  dry bulk carrier China Cosco  has been battling heavy losses over the last five years thanks to strong competition from ships delivered after the financial crisis that caused oversupply as global trade weakened 
Volumes in its dry bulk shipping business have been steadily decreasing over the last three years as the company also restructured its fleet  with iron ore shipments falling 32 percent to 87 5 million tons from 2010 to 2013 
The Valemax ships might reduce freight costs further  but at least under the new deal Cosco is the company that will benefit 

 This cooperation agreement is between a cargo and vessel operator  It s a win win situation that plays to their respective advantages   said Zhang Shouguo  executive vice president of the China Shipowners Association

16579,238094,VALE,Exclusive  Chanos takes profit on his top 2014 short sale   Brazil,news,"By Luciana Lopez and Sam Forgione NEW YORK  Reuters    Hedge fund manager Jim Chanos  the prominent short seller  said Tuesday he has lightened up on some of his bets against Brazil  saying most of the country s downside risk is priced in after the sharp selloff over the past two months 
 Yes  we are still short but we ve taken some profits   Chanos said  speaking at a Reuters summit   I think we d be crazy not to  
Brazilian stocks have been hammered over worries about the country s presidential election  which incumbent Dilma Rousseff narrowly won on Sunday 
Her victory sent shares plunging as investors fretted about the leftist president 
Brazil s benchmark Bovespa stock index  BVSP  has slid more than 18 percent from early September through its close on Monday  The index is heavily weighted toward miner Vale  SA VALE5  and state run oil company Petrobras  SA PETR4   
 I think a lot of it is priced in already now  in Latin America s biggest economy  he said to Reuters 
 I wouldn t be jumping wholeheartedly into the Brazil  short  trade here   he said  Nevertheless  he added that he remains short on  a lot of things in Brazil  
Chanos  who specializes in making money when stock prices decline and first cemented his reputation as a short seller with bets against Enron  is the founder of Kynikos Associates 
Chanos has previously spoken about shorting Petrobras and Vale 
Last week he said that Petrobras  exists to serve the state   an opinion he reiterated on Tuesday 
In the second quarter  the company saw profit slump 20 percent from a year earlier  reflecting in part a squeeze caused by the conflicting economic policy goals of its controlling shareholder  the Brazilian government 
For example  the government has reduced the amount of cash Petrobras has available to pay for new investments to tap offshore oil resources by forcing it to subsidize domestic gasoline and diesel fuel  The restrictions are aimed at helping the government control inflation 
 You might argue it s a stroke of genius   Chanos said on Tuesday  because foreign investors are thus helping fund Brazilian government efforts 
Both Vale and Petrobras fell sharply on Monday  the first trading day after Rousseff s victory 
Petrobras  which has also been hurt by a corruption scandal and falling global oil prices  dropped 12 percent on Monday  On Tuesday  those shares were last up 3 percent 
Vale  which exports heavily to China  saw its shares fall about 4 percent on Monday  On Tuesday  its shares were last down 0 1 percent 

The Bovespa stock index  BVSP  was last up 2 35 percent on Tuesday

16588,238103,VALE,EM Week Ahead Preview  Fed Tightening Risk Continues,opinion,"EM had another rocky week last week  but managed to end on a slightly firmer note Friday  Market repricing of Fed tightening risk was the big driver last week  and that could carry over into this week  There are several Fed speakers in the days ahead  capped off with Fed chief Yellen on Friday   
Several EM central banks meet this week  including Israel  Turkey  Hungary  and Colombia  There is some risk of a dovish surprise from Turkey  while Hungary is expected to continue easing  Colombia is an outlier  with high inflation seen leading to another 25 bp hike  
Singapore reports April CPI Monday  which is expected at  0 7  y y vs   1 0  in March  It then reports April IP Thursday  which is expected at  0 3  y y vs   0 5  in March  Deflation risks may be easing  but the economy continues to slow  If weakness persists over the summer  then another easing move at the October MAS policy meeting is possible 
Taiwan reports April industrial output Monday  which is expected at  1 8  y y vs   3 6  in March  Last week  Taiwan reported April export orders at  11 1  y y  which suggests little relief ahead for IP and exports  The growth outlook remains weak  and so the central bank is likely to continue cutting rates at its quarterly policy meeting in June 
The Israeli central bank meets Monday and is expected to keep rates steady at 0 10   Deflation worsened to  0 9  y y in April  while Q1 GDP growth was much weaker than expected at 0 8  annualized  As such  there is growing risk that the Bank of Israel will have to take further measures in H2 to boost the economy  For now  officials will be happy with recent shekel weakness  The central bank had been intervening to prevent strength in recent months  but the shekel has underperformed recently due to rising political risks 
The Turkish central bank meets Tuesday and is expected to cut the overnight lending rate 50 bp to 9 5   However  the benchmark rate is seen remaining steady at 7 5   Price pressures are easing and so there is a case for easing policy  However  the government should refrain from any sort of jawboning 
Hungary s central bank meets Tuesday and is expected to cut rates 15 bp to 0 90   While officials have been downplaying the likelihood of further easing  we think there will be one more 15 bp cut at the June 21 meeting to 0 75  before we see another pause  Q1 GDP growth came in much weaker than expected  at 0 9  y y 
Mexico reports mid May CPI Tuesday  which is expected to rise 2 7  y y vs  2 6  in mid April  It then reports April trade and Q1 current account data Wednesday  Banco de Mexico also releases its quarterly inflation report Wednesday  Last week  it cut its 2016 growth forecast range to 2 2 3 2  from 2 6 3 6  previously  We downplay risks of an imminent rate hike  as price pressures remain low despite the weak peso 
Brazil reports April current account data Tuesday  The ongoing recession has led to a collapse in imports that has more than offset the downturn in exports  FDI has held up well  so the portion of the current account gap that must be covered by hot money has fallen significantly  That said  Brazil s Vale  NYSE VALE  warned last week of a negative outlook for iron ore due to supply concerns 
Poland s central bank releases minutes on Friday  Despite concerns that the new MPC would be really dovish  the bank has keep rates steady all year  A new central bank chief  Glapinski  will be in place next month  and markets will be watching to see how dovish he leans  On Friday  he said borrowing costs are at the  right  level and that further easing would pose risks to financial stability 
The Colombian central bank meets Friday and is expected to hike rates 25 bp to 7 25   However  the market is split  Of the 19 analysts polled by Bloomberg  2 see a 50 bp hike  12 see a 25 bp hike  and 5 see no hike  CPI rose 7 9  y y in April  well above the 2 4  target range and justifying another rate hike  Finance Minister Cardenas shows little concern about a weaker peso  though it poses some upside risks to inflation

16624,238139,VALE,U S  Shale Oil Drillers Committing Seppuku,opinion,"Apparently Economics 101 is no longer a required course for someone to become the CEO of a major natural resources company  Rudimentary economics  and common sense  says that when the price of a commodity collapses because of oversupply  you cut back on production  This allows supply and demand to eventually rebalance  stabilizing prices 
But the big players in iron ore   Rio Tinto  LONDON RIO   VALE SA  NYSE VALE  and BHP Billiton  LONDON BLT    all raised output as iron ore prices plunged  For some reason  these companies  strategy is to produce as much as you can  then close your eyes  cross your fingers and hope for the best  And their shareholders have paid the price for this folly 
Now  it seems the CEOs of many U S  shale oil companies have also decided to commit seppuku   ritualistic suicide  Although  it s the shareholders who will suffer 
Living in Fairy Tale Land
The usual suspects like Pioneer Natural Resources  NYSE PXD   Devon Energy  NYSE DVN   Whiting Petroleum Corporation  NYSE WLL   and Continental Resources  NYSE CLR  are all raising their oil production based on oil price outlooks that surely must be made up 
Oil prices are down 55  from just a year ago and 20  in July alone  but some producers say they re making plans for oil s swift return to  90 per barrel 
Devon and Whiting pulled record amounts of oil out of the ground in the latest quarter  Even if oil stays low  these companies believe they can flourish merely on cost reductions and increased efficiencies 
Some of these are the same companies that hedge fund manager David Einhorn warned about in May  In fact  his number one target  Pioneer  is planning to ramp up activity to pre bust levels by early 2016  Pioneer s CEO believes it can  outrun  the global oil market share war  Meanwhile  in the second quarter  the company posted a net loss of  216 million 
These same companies  stocks have also outpaced the fall in the price of WTI crude  Since mid April  WTI has dropped about 20   In that same period  Pioneer s stock is down 30  and Continental s stock is down nearly 40  
Back in the Real Oil World
Most analysts are now saying at least 500 000 barrels per day of U S  production has to be cut  Many of the major oil service and giant oil companies  outlooks reflect this belief  Both parties realize that  oil prices will be lower for longer  than originally anticipated as BP  LONDON BP  CEO Bob Dudley said 
Makes sense to me 
Oil inventories are near record levels all over the globe  And OPEC is producing more than ever and soon Iran will add more production on top of that  OPEC s output spurt is being led by Saudi Arabia  which produced a record 10 6 million barrels in June 
This increased oil output led the International Energy Agency to say that global oil supply is growing at  breakneck speed  
Both the majors and the oil service companies have slashed tens of thousands of jobs because of the outlook for a prolonged downturn in the oil patch  The oil majors have literally slashed  200 billion worth of projects by either deferring or canceling them 
Futures Market Gloomy
Their outlooks are backed up by the activity in the futures market   oil contracts have taken their worst hit in years  Contracts for oil to be delivered in 2016 and 2017 are below their March lows  Even contracts in the 2022 to 2023 time frame are selling in the  63 range 

No doubt this gloominess in the futures market is being influenced by U S  shale oil producers  stubborn refusal to cut their output  You see  prices are so low on long dated oil contracts that it makes little sense to hedge their production  That means the companies mentioned above will be fully exposed to lower prices  which the lot had been largely shielded up until now by existing hedges 
If futures prices turn out to be correct  it s bad news for the top 10 U S  independent oil producers  The investment bank Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co  told The Wall Street Journal that these producers will outspend their cash flow by  11 4 billion in 2016 
As I ve asked before  the question then becomes  how long will the banks and Wall Street keep funding these companies  Especially with the companies so intent on harming themselves 
Just look at the difference a year makes  In Q2 of 2014  10 of the largest U S  shale companies reported profits of nearly  3 5 billion  In Q2 of 2015  these same firms reported losses of almost  15 billion

16625,238140,VALE,Peak Steel In China  Hard To Imagine Price Increase,opinion,"Debate is increasing about whether we have reached peak steel  What that means is have we reached peak Chinese steel production  Because with China producing over half the world s steel  minor rises elsewhere would be nothing compared to a significant drop in China 
Global steel production fell by 3  in August 2015  according to the Brussels based World Steel Association  WSA   its biggest fall this year led by a decline in China s steel production  World steel production went down to 132 million metric tons last month  as China registered a 3 5  drop in steel output to 66 9 mmt  The global decline came in spite of number 2 producer Japan  and both Germany and India  posting double digit gains 
Global Decline
Globally  though  steel production is struggling and  more importantly  so are steel producers  The WSA said the crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the 65 countries it coordinates data from  covering 98  of global steel production  in August 2015 was just 68   This was 3 6  lower than August last year and a decline on the month before 
Yet while China s steel production may have dropped  its exports have risen  In the first eight months of this year  product exports reached 71 87 mmt  up 26 5  compared to the same period of 2014 and CISA s vice chairman is quoted as saying this year the country will export more than 100 mmt of steel   that s equivalent to more than the entire production of North America or nearly as much  purely in exports  as the next largest producer  Japan  produces both for domestic and export combined 
Iron ore producer VALE SA  NYSE VALE  has said it sees China s dip as temporary and sees production picking up again next year  but that supposes the country s construction sector  largely its housing market  will return to growth  This is far from a given 
Don t Expect China s Housing Market to Save Steel
Housing prices and home sales have picked up this month but more as a reaction to the fall in the stock market as investors have turned to bricks and mortar rather than shares  In practice there is still a glut of unsold properties  particularly in tier 2 and tier 3 cities  so a widespread housing construction boom is highly unlikely  That really isn t the kind of asset bubble Beijing wants to reignite 
Nor  however  do states want to encourage large scale consolidation and closure in the steel sector  So  unless the authorities take more radical steps  possibly on environmental grounds to close steel plants over capacity  poor capacity utilization and massive export volumes are likely to continue to depress global steel prices next year

16626,238141,VALE,5 Dividend Stocks You Should Avoid,opinion,"I m a big believer in dividend stocks  In fact  it s rare that I buy a stock that doesn t pay a dividend  Nothing does a better job of keeping management honest than the responsibility of paying shareholders a regular dividend 
But that said  not all dividend stocks are created equal  The  perfect  dividend stocks are ones that pay a competitive current yield but also have a good track record of raising the dividend every year  A high yielding stock that doesn t raise its dividend on a regular basis is essentially a risky bond with a payout that can be cut at management s whim  Sure  you can fudge your numbers to make your earning per share number every quarter  But cold  hard cash doesn t lie  You either have it to pay out  or you don t 
You also need to see growing revenues and earnings  Without more money coming in  it s hard for a company to send more in dividends out to shareholders 
And finally  we should always be a little wary of dividend stocks with extremely high yields  Once in a while  you can find a real gem with a fat yield due to a temporary mispricing  But more often than not  when you see an exceptionally high yield  the market is essentially telling you that the dividend is likely to get cut 
So with that said  let s take a look at five dividend stocks you re better off avoiding  All might be alluring temptresses  but they will potentially lead you on the path of income destruction 
VALE SA 
Dividend Yield  9 2 
I ll start with Brazilian miner VALE SA  NYSE VALE   VALE today is one of the highest yielding stocks you can find with a dividend yield of 9 2   It s also a stock whose dividend is almost certain to be cut  Although the board of directors still has to approve it   
I have nothing against VALE  or against mining stocks in general  Under the right conditions  miners can be wildly profitable trades  But they are terrible dividend stocks 
Think about it  If you re buying dividend stocks  chances are good that you re doing so because you need current income  You certainly wouldn t complain if you had capital gains  But capital gains are a secondary priority 
And if it s income you need  stability is of the utmost importance  Your expenses rarely fall  so it s critical that your income not fall either 
Well  VALE s business is about as far from stable as you can get  Miners have absolutely no control over the prices they get for the metals they dig out of the ground  They are completely at the whim of the market  Yet they also have very high fixed costs and  often  a unionized workforce with an ax to grind 
VALE s stock price is down about 75  from its highs of two years ago and down about 90  from its pre 2008 crisis highs  Could VALE rally from here  Sure  particularly if Brazil s macro situation stabilizes 
But that makes it a potential trade   not a suitable dividend stock 
Reynolds American
Dividend Yield  3 1 
If you ve read my work for any time  you might be a little surprised to see Reynolds American  NYSE RAI  on a list of stocks to avoid  For years I was a major proponent of vice investing and particularly of tobacco stocks 
But my love affair with Big Tobacco was directly the result of it being perpetually underpriced  Because of the social stigma and regulatory risk  tobacco stocks were the eternal value stocks  high yielding dividend dynamos that offered market beating returns 
Well  things have changed  Investors have become so starved for income  they ve actually bid up the prices of tobacco stocks to a substantial premium over the broader market  Reynolds American currently trades for 19 times next year s expected earnings  The S P 500 trades for closer to 16 times next year s earnings 
Remember  tobacco is an industry in terminal decline  The number of Americans that smokes declinesevery single year  Teenagers today are more likely to have used illegal drugs in the past six months than to have smoked a cigarette  There is absolutely no justifiable reason for a Big Tobacco company to trade at a premium to the broader market 
Right now  Reynolds American sports a dividend yield of 3 1   Sure  that s higher than the market s dividend yield of about 2   But for crying out loud  shares of the resurgent Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  yield 3 3   and which would you rather own 
Hey  there is a price at which any stock gets interesting  If Reynolds yielded a good 6  7   I d be all over it  But a 3 1  yield is just not higher enough to justify buying Reynolds  This is a dividend stock best avoided 
IBM 
Dividend Yield  3 7 
It takes a certain amount of chutzpah to put IBM  NYSE IBM  on a  stocks to avoid  list  It is  after all  one of the favorite stocks of the Sage of Omaha himself  Warren Buffett  And if Buffett likes it  it must be fantastic  right 
Wrong 
I have absolute and total respect for Mr  Buffett  He s a better investor than I will ever be  and I am comfortable admitting that  But he is also human and very fallible  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  itself was a disastrous investment for Buffett  He admitted as much in an interview a few years ago in which he called Berkshire the single worst investment of his career  By Buffett s own estimation  he d be twice as rich as he is today had he never bought a single share of Berkshire Hathaway 
This brings us back to IBM  When Buffett first bought it  he was attracted to its long term service model and its penchant for returning cash to investors via share buybacks 
But there are some big problems here  To start  IBM s model is not as stable as it appeared a few years ago  Out of nowhere  Microsoft  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  have turned IBM s business upside down with cheaper and more flexible cloud options  And the billions spent on share repurchases may go down in history as one of the worst allocations of capital in history  IBM stock is down by a third from its 2013 highs  meaning that the roughly 169 million shares repurchased since 2012 were purchased at prices well above today s  That s total destruction of shareholder value 
Meanwhile  IBM s sales continue to fall  Revenues are down 17  since the end of 2012 
At current prices  IBM sports a dividend yield of 3 6  Don t fall for it  There are better opportunities out there 
Verizon
Dividend Yield  5 3 
I would also recommend you avoid Verizon  NYSE VZ   Yes  it has a fantastic current yield of 5 1   But dividend growth has been almost nonexistent for years  Over the past five years  Verizon has managed dividend growth of only 2 9  per year 
Yes  that s beating inflation  I ll give them that  But it s not beating it by much 
And I wouldn t expect much more in the way of dividend growth going forward  Verizon already pays out about 92  of its profits in dividends  So for dividend growth to improve  profit growth needs to step it up a notch 
But just how likely is that  Verizon s primary business lines   mobile telephony and paid TV   are both mature businesses with saturated markets  Not only does every American over the age of five already have a mobile phone  but most have already upgraded to smartphones with data plans  And cell service is quickly becoming commoditized as cheaper rivals like T Mobile  NYSE TMUS  undercut the larger players on price 
And cable TV appears to be in the early stages of long term decline or  at the very least  a major shakeup  Cable bills have outpaced inflation for years  prompting many Americans   and particularly young Americans   to  cut the cord  and eschew cable service for cheaper internet options 
Verizon isn t going out of business anytime soon  But it s a slow growth dinosaur with businesses under constant attack from competitors  Verizon is best avoided 
Wynn Resorts
Dividend Yield  3 4 
And finally we get to hotel and casino operator Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   It s hard to think of too many sectors less suitable for a stable dividend portfolio than gaming  While many vice industries are recession resistant  people don t stop drinking and smoking when the economy gets bad   gaming is highly dependent on tourism  And tourism  of course  is very economically sensitive  When the shekels are tight  you avoid taking that weekend trip to Las Vegas 
Wynn s problems are compounded by the fact that it has major exposure to China s gaming hub Macau  This would have been seen as a major strength just a few short years ago  But with the Chinese economy slowing and with the government cracking down on conspicuous consumption  exposure to Chinese gamblers is a major risk  No wonder casino stocks including WYNN jumped Friday when  
Not surprisingly  Wynn s stock price is down about 75  from its 2014 high  Wynn  perhaps not surprisingly  also had to cut its regular dividend recently

During the course of 2015  the price of iron ore slipped approximately 31   It bottomed out on 8 July at  44 59  but has since regained ground to trade over  50 per tonne  In looking to apportion blame for the commodity price rout  the usual suspects can be pointed to   China  Eurozone weakness  recessionary concerns in Japan  and a rampant US dollar  Combined  these factors have the effect of reducing the demand for iron ore  but not the supply of it  It s important to understand precisely why the supply of iron ore continues unabated  despite the fact that the demand for the commodity is substantially weaker  In much the same fashion as crude oil producers are prioritizing market share above profitability  iron ore producers are following suit 
Shoddy Performance of Mining Companies
The evidence corroborating a slowdown in China is pervasive  For starters  September import figures year on year for China declined by 20 4   while October figures declined by 18 8   Since a substantial component of Chinese imports is made up of mining and energy commodities  iron ore exports to China have taken a huge hit  The year to date performance figures for the leading mining companies are none too flattering  For example  the following declines have been reported of late 
  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  AX FMG  has a year to date return of  16 79    Rio Tinto  L RIO  plc has a year to date return of  25 20    BHP Billiton  L BLT  Ltd has a year to date return of  26 29    VALE SA  N VALE  has a year to date return of  51 47 
The general trend for mining companies across the board is the same  revenues and profitability are way down  and future prospects are bleak for the iron ore industry  We are seeing an interesting change taking place in the sense that smaller mining companies with higher costs of operations are being forced to close up shop  while the bigger companies are able to sustain their operations owing to economies of scale and significant clout in the industry 
What are Industry Analysts Saying 
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  N CLF    one of the biggest iron ore producers in the US   believes that mining companies who are happy about a price below  50 per tonne for iron ore are being unreasonable  The problem it seems is that revenues are declining faster than costs are for mining companies  Weakness is pervasive across companies in the mining sector  and this is evident in the negative figures we are seeing with the aforementioned mining companies  Losses are likely to continue moving forward  and China weakness is a big factor in determining the overall demand for iron ore and related commodities  It is emerging market countries which are suffering as a result of weak demand from China  The multinational conglomerates that operate in the Democratic Republic of Congo  Zambia  South Africa  Nigeria and other EM countries are posting some of their weakest performances on record  One only has to look at companies like Anglo American  L AAL  and Glencore  L GLEN  PLC as cases in point 
But there is hope for an uptick in the performance of mining stocks  China consumes 800 000 000 tonnes of steel every single year  This is substantial  and iron ore is an essential component of steel production  It s not so much that demand in China is causing the price to fluctuate  it is the policy decisions that the Chinese government is taking that are causing all of this uncertainty at this time  China still has as its goal the One Belt One Road initiative  This ambitious undertaking is geared towards connecting Asian countries with the Middle East and Europe  In so doing  China will be able to supply all of these countries that border it  This will bring about a resurgence in demand  but the Chinese economy is still in the process of pivoting away from an export driven market to a consumer centric market where the focus is on infrastructure growth and development and services delivery  For now  iron ore prices are going to remain at sub optimal levels and profitability will be adversely affected ",2015-11-16,InterTrader .com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/iron-ore-loses-strength-in-global-markets-271470,271470

16629,238144,VALE,Managements Leading Companies Off A Cliff,opinion,"The quickest and surest way for investors to lose money is to invest in companies where the management is  to put it politely  incompetent 
Numerous instances exist throughout history  But we re perhaps seeing the worst example ever  and it s from the global   The level of incompetence being displayed is simply astonishing 
Chinese Steel Collapse
China has the world s biggest steel industry  producing half of all steel  Crude steel output there soared more than 12 fold between 1990 and 2014 
But now  thanks to overcapacity  the Chinese steel industry has shifted into reverse in a big way  Prices have fallen by nearly 30   Steel rebar prices in China on the Shanghai Futures Exchange are at all time record lows  Rebar prices are down 30  this year alone 
As losses continue to mount for the industry  even Xu Lejiang  Chairman of giant steelmaker Shanghai Baosteel  said that the industry s output will collapse by a fifth in the not too distant future  Forecasts are for a drop in production of at least 23 million metric tons  mmt  over the next year 
The China Iron and Steel Association is in general agreement  It says that output probably permanently peaked in 2014 at 823 mmt  In effect  we ve seen peak steel 
Iron Ore Dreams
That s bad news for the major iron ore miners   VALE SA  N VALE   Rio Tinto  L RIO   and BHP Billiton  L BLT   China will cut back on its imports of iron ore  a key ingredient in steelmaking 
The evidence is already there  The Baltic Dry Index  which includes ships that carry ore  hit its all time low on November 20 at 498  Iron ore itself hit an all time low   spot pricing began in 2008   about a week ago at  43 40 per metric ton 
Logic would dictate the miners cut back production  So does Economics 101 
But the managements at the big three continue to live in a fairy tale  They continue clinging to their forecast   that Chinese steel output will rise 20  over the next decade   like drowning men to a life preserver  In fact  Rio Tinto still forecasts that annual Chinese steel production will hit a billion tons by the end of the decade 
So the three blind mice  iron ore miners  continue raising output  using a scorched earth policy to eliminate the competition  In fact  next year  Vale will open the world s largest iron ore mine  Serra Sul in Brazil  
And the iron ore sector isn t alone  Other mining segments   including copper  zinc  and nickel   continue to produce as if there s no tomorrow 
How to Spot the Bottom
Eventually  the long nightmare for shareholders in mining companies will end 
So how do you spot the signs that a bottom is coming and brighter days are ahead 
Output cuts will help  But if Company A cuts its production  the dreamers at one of the big three miners will simply raise their output even more 
A true signal will be the removal of one of these totally incompetent management teams  That should start the ball rolling toward real change 
I then expect the big miner that made the change to finally say  uncle   And I don t mean just deciding to finally cut back on output  I mean throwing in the towel completely  walking away from a segment like iron ore  and permanently shutting down production 
If a permanent shutdown doesn t occur  miners will be in the same boat as shale oil producers  As soon as the price blips up a few dollars  a flood of supply hits the market  A commodities version of Sisyphus  if you will 
That may happen sooner rather than later  In iron ore  for example  the price is quickly approaching the breakeven level for some of the big miners  This is despite falling freight  oil  and currencies helping to lower miners  costs 
Until the permanent shuttering of mines occurs  the sector will remain in its downward spiral

Values of major miners as the price of iron ore has fallen  Source  Bloomberg 
With iron ore hovering around  40 per metric ton  even the major producers are facing prices that are below their break even point 
The most expensive operations at the four largest miners are on the verge of making losses at rates below  40 a metric ton  John Kovacs  senior commodities economist at Capital Economics in London Kovacs estimates their break even levels at  28 to  39  taking into account freight and other costs 
 The big four  Vale  Rio Tinto  L RIO  Group  BHP Billiton Ltd  N BHP  and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  AX FMG   will find it hard to maintain output at below  40   Kovacs said in response to Bloomberg   If prices remain weak  output from the highest cost mines of the big four will be under pressure  
UBS Group AG estimates that of the four biggest producers  Fortescue has the highest break even cost of  40 and Vale s is  34 in terms of ore landed in China with 62  content including interest  BHP s break even level is  29 and Rio s  30  the bank s data show 
If prices continue to fall it s likely that more junior miners will fail and further cuts at the big four will ensue  The strategy of forcing out the smaller players over the last five years has eroded the cash reserves that BHP  Rio  Vale and Fortescue built up during the commodities super cycle  They may eventually reap what they ve sown by not cutting production for so long 
Copper s Rough Ride

16670,238185,VALE,The Iron Ore Limbo  How Low Can You Go ,opinion,"This is part two of guest contributor James May s analysis of the iron ore market in 2015  Check out part one  in case you missed it  James is a director of Steel Insight 

Year on year output of iron ore fell in November for the first time  Chinese output in January February is always significantly lower due to seasonal closures in northern China due to winter weather  but they may not come back if prices stay low  It is our view that Chinese iron ore output in 2015 will be lower by around 20  year on year   taking around 80 m tpy  of 62  Fe equivalent  out of the market 



Therefore  we believe that at current prices  the iron ore market will begin to rebalance in 2015  Now this will not be followed by an immediate increase in prices as inventories accumulated substantially in 2014  but analysts  projections of surpluses of 150 m tons are wide off the mark   very simply  where would it be stored given the already high Chinese inventories 

Why Won t It Go Below  60 Ton 

Well  we look at 2009   the last time that prices went this low  Of the majors   Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO  and VALE SA  NYSE VALE  both cut output  despite still being profitable   BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP  didn t cut  but we think that might be partially due to the fact that it was trying to takeover Rio Tinto at the time and prove to anti trust regulators that it wouldn t  manipulate  the market 

We think that at below  60 ton  this will hurt the big miners   even the low cost ones  Remember Fortescue  OTC FSUMF   for example  is selling at a discount of around 12  to the index price  while some sales from Rio Tinto are at a similar level  Robe River    making a netback to around  45 ton free on board Australia  Looking at Vale s iron ore division s EBITDA  we think that its actual costs are higher than its declared unit costs  that don t take into account royalties  etc   and maybe closer to  45 ton all in  although the recent devaluation may have lowered this  



At  60 ton  we think that the majors would cut output and this would be a sign that the market cannot sustain this price and therefore any price dip below this would be short term  Of course  markets overshoot   do we really think that oil will be below  40 barrel for an extended period    but unlike in oil  the Big 4 control 70  of the seaborne iron ore market and any cutbacks here would send a huge signal In many ways  the iron ore price at  65 75 ton is ideal for the big miners  It is low enough to force out high cost supply and discourage any new investment with the exception of their own low cost brownfield expansions  As we highlighted above  it will also rebalance the market  allowing prices to make small gains going forward  In the longer term  the ore is still in the ground and can be extracted at a later date if the price is right  That also means that we don t expect a major bounce  With the infrastructure in place  the mines can restart quite quickly and that will keep a lid on the iron ore price for an extended period

16671,238186,VALE,Iron Ore Is Under Pressure From Both Supply And Demand,opinion,"Apart from an uptick in European steel prices in January the downward trend globally has continued as weak iron ore prices have allowed steel mills to chase the market down  The Steel Index s  TSI  recent monthly Steel review illustrates the trend graphically


ArcelorMittal led the price increases in Europe with other mills following in their wake achieving a few Euros uplift in a slightly tighter market as distributors ran relatively lean in the face of softening demand  The hope in Europe is that a weakening Euro will boost exports  both for steel products and manufactured goods  but so far growth has success has been elusive amid considerable worry about a Greek exit from the Euro 
Meanwhile the rise in iron ore supply has been relentless  particularly from the Australian majors and Vale  NYSE VALE   while the fall in prices has been mitigated only by robust Chinese demand last year  China imported 86 89 million metric tons of iron ore in December  according to the TSI  narrowly making it the highest month on record  Australia s share has increased during the last year as this graph shows


But the rate of supply increase is slowing as even the iron ore majors recognize demand is slowing in the face of a weakening steel market and there is only so much competitive capacity they can price out of the market 
Incremental production by the majors should peak at 71 mmt this year then ease off  HSBC s estimates of global supply has been downgraded from 5 5  to 4 9  for last year and from 6 65  down to 5 5  for this year as investment has slowed and enhancement of brown field resources has been favored over more costly green field developments 
On the demand side global steel production is continuing to rise  in fact HSBC marginally upped its estimates for last year from 3 0  to 3 1  but 2015 iron ore demand is heavily dependent on a recovery in iron ore demand in China 


This graph from HSBC shows how global growth should  in their estimates  be more balanced in coming years with growth in North America and a recovery in Europe  The big unknown  however  is China 
In a recent TSI press release the firm said Chinese demand for steel continues to falter  reflected in an ongoing slump in finished prices  As a result mills continue to find themselves in the red  despite significant reductions in their costs from lower raw material prices  Unless  or until  there is some form of stimulus from Beijing it s difficult to see this situation turn around in the short term suggesting  even with a moderation in supply growth  the Asian iron ore market will at least remain in surplus and iron ore prices will remain under pressure 
As expected  a proportion of Chinese domestic production has been closed as a result of low prices  but not as much as the majors had probably hoped  We will look to cover steel and coking coal in follow up articles this week as the markets are closely interlinked by similar supply and demand fundamentals ",2015-02-16,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/iron-ore-is-under-pressure-from-both-supply-and-demand-242013,242013

The company has decided to close one of its three iron ore pits in Western Australia  BHP Billiton has also decided to slow the pace of its  2 billion expansion plan in the Pilbara  Though these factors led to a temporary spike in iron prices  they plunged soon thereafter Aluminum   Prices Down in 2015 Last year  the global aluminum industry went through a substantial change to rectify the supply demand imbalance that affected prices through 2013  Major aluminum producers like Rio Tinto and Rusal and Alcoa Inc  NYSE AA  effectively cut their aluminum production  This  along with a pickup in aluminum demand from key end users  helped aluminum inventories to descend from peak levels  This tightening of aluminum supply lifted aluminum prices from the four and a half year low of  1

16675,238190,VALE,Vibranium And The Fictitious MMI Report,opinion,"As always  the MMI reflects the global market  BLS indexes by default only include US data  but that may or may not be representative of underlying global price trends  and metal prices often depend upon the underlying demand for various industries  steel prices relate to construction industry activity  for instance  
Most of our readers are buyers of aluminum  copper  stainless steel  raw steels  rare earths  renewables and grain oriented electrical steel  but some go for the VERY minor metals 
For these special users  we provide the fictitious MMI  Serving all your needs for adamantium  Rearden Metal  kryptonite ore and vibranium  We recently had to move unobtainium off the list because it s information was just too hard to obtain to keep listing 
These highly rare metals are difficult to source and procure  Some of them haven t even had deposits discovered since the 1960s  Kryptonite ore isn t even native to Earth  Still  like all metals they are subject to market forces  so here s what s affecting each super rare metal s market 
Vibranium MMI
If you ve seen  Avengers  Age of Ultron   you know that vibranium is the metal Captain America s shield is made out of  It s a rare  naturally occurring metal that possesses the ability to absorb all vibrations in the vicinity as well as all kinetic energy directed at it 

The problem with the vibranium market is similar to the one we ve seen with its real world cousins  the rare earths  One nation controls almost all production of vibranium  the African nation of Wakanda  As most production of rare earths comes from China  export quotas  over underproduction and other measures have allowed China to distort the global market to cement its grip on the magnet and battery elements for some time now 
Wakanda is no different in the make believe Marvel universe  They likely have a version of  60 Minutes  running stories on how dangerous the Wakandan monopoly on rare earths truly is  Ones that call for more domestic vibranium mines and even exploration in pristine Antarctica 
Because vibranium is so rare and useful  it s ALWAYS in demand and the Vibranium MMI stayed where it s been ever since we began charting it  a rating of 100 with exceptionally strong demand for all grades  Defense contractors such as Stark Industries are particularly interested in it  these days  for its demand in building giant Hulkbusting armored suits 
Rearden Metal MMI
Useful in building stronger than steel bridges and just about anything  the amazing alloy known as Rearden Metal in Ayn Rand s classic novel  Atlas Shrugged  is touted as a wonder element that can make anything stronger while at the same time lighter and more durable 
 Sounds kind of like the new lightweight nano steel alloys regularly   The difference between those alloys and Dagny Taggart s favorite bridge material  though  is production  One of the key arguments of the novel is that steel magnate Hank Rearden patented and controls the entire supply chain of production for his metal  Even being forced to sell his ore mines to Orren Boyle couldn t stop Rearden from controlling all production as only Rearden knew the recipe to create the alloy 
This is a situation similar to last year s nickel price surge when traders  customers and stainless steel producers all rushed to buy and stockpile nickel ore when it was announced that Indonesia would institute a raw ore export ban and begin smelting its nickel ore at home  Those concerns turned out to be overblown when the Philippines replaced much of the ore that Chinese nickel pig iron producers lost from Indonesia  but not before they drove up the price of nickel 
The blip seen in our Rearden Metal MMI is when control of mining and production was lost  As Boyle soon went out of business due to poor management  Rearden quickly regained control of the entire supply chain and demand remained high for renewable powered Galt engines  railroad bridges and bracelets 
Adamantium MMI
Once again visiting the Marvel Universe  adamantium is a nigh indestructible alloy  Before molding  the components of the alloy are kept in separate batches  typically in blocks of resin 

Adamantium is prepared by melting the blocks together  mixing the components while the resin evaporates  The alloy must then be cast within eight minutes  Adamantium s extremely stable molecular structure prevents it from being further molded even when it s exposed to extreme temperatures 
The character Wolverine s claws and skeleton are the most famous examples of adamantium use in the films and comic books  Because adamantium is so rare  some of its components only occur naturally near volcanic activity  it is so expensive that even its obvious uses in defense are rarely attempted  The supply is so low that demand in our Adamantium MMI has fallen off so much that  except for that price spike last June when a strange new supply was discovered in Japan  other less rare metals are always substituted for it  just as other suitable metals were used in automotive exhaust systems when Platinum prices are high last spring and summer due to a mining strike in major producer nation  South Africa 
I wonder where that supply in Japan came from 
Extra Global Kryptonite Ore MMI

Our final ultra rare element isn t even naturally occurring on Earth  it s fragments of the planet Krypton  birthplace of Kal el  AKA Superman 
Kryptonite  brought to us by DC Comics  is a simple ore spread across the universe by the detonation and destruction of Krypton  There are whole asteroids of it and chunks of the stuff have even made their way to our planet 
It nullifies Superman s powers which are derived from the energy of Earth s yellow sun  If Krypton actually existed  Kryptonite would likely be as abundant as iron ore  the input dragging down our Raw Steels MMI as miners BHP Billiton  LONDON BLT   Rio Tinto  LONDON RIO  and VALE SA  NYSE VALE  are all driving down the price  even though BHP finally cut back on production last week  
Lex Luthor is the only one in the DCU driving any demand of Kryptonite  he s a subscriber to the Fictitious Metals MMI   Even a lowly ore can be valuable if there isn t enough supply of it  but don t expect its price to rise much with a healthy surplus 
Not only have metals fueled the standard of living today  but they ve also inspired some of the greatest fantasies our time  We hope you ve enjoyed this tour of the fictitious metals markets and learned a few things about the real ones as well

16698,238213,VALE,Iron Ore Looks Like a One Way Bet  Down,opinion,"Iron ore hit a 5 year low last week  lack of demand for physical cargo saw the spot price drop to  76 per metric ton  the lowest level since June 2009 according to the   There appears no obvious end in sight to the slide in prices either  Traders reported a 170 000 ton cargo of 62  Pilbara mining fines for December delivery  was offered at  76 80 but attracted no interest 
The closure of steel mills near Beijing ahead of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference this week has been blamed by many commentators as the reason for the lack of demand  but the slide has been relentless this year and the shutdowns in Hebei are only hastening the normal winter slow down  The tactics of the big 3 iron ore producers is well documented  The strategy appears to be achieve the greatest economy of scale by going for volume and mechanization 
As prices fall  competitors will go out of business and the field will be left to Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   Bhp Billiton  NYSE BBL  and VALE  NYSE VALE   Rio is accepted as the lowest cost producer but BHP intends to increase production at mines in Western Australia by 65m tons to 290m tons a year by 2017 in an effort to reduce costs so it can overtake Rio as the cheapest iron ore supplier  meanwhile Vale is looking to lift output to 453 million tons by 2018 from 306 million tons in 2013  according to the FT 

This strategy is having limited effect so far  Indian  Iranian  African and other sources have been priced out the market  some Chinese domestic production  likewise  has thrown in the towel  but much iron ore production is supported by local states or are captive mines of steel mills giving them an advantage in the fight for survival 
The excessive levels of production  though  will not be easily turned back off without leaving massive capital expenditure unproductive  The pressure to keep mines running at or near their new capacity limits will be considerable  This level of oversupply could  therefore  be with us for years to come 
HSBC is not alone in downgrading its further dated price forecasts  The bank is still showing  85 per metric ton for 2015  which on current indicators may already be out of date  but they do not see it rising in 2016 or 2017 and continuing to fall by another  5 per ton beyond 2017  Not great news for investors in mining companies who had been hoping for some dividend returns as wider capital expenditure budgets were slashed in recent years  but good news for steel consumers as both iron ore and coking coal prices look to remain weak through the second half of the decade reducing one area of pressure on mills to raise prices 

Global demand remains positive in spite of the slowdown in GDP growth in China and elsewhere  By HSBC s estimate  growth in steel production and  therefore  iron ore demand will be lower than had previously been thought 
The strengthening of the US dollar since the summer has only heightened miners enthusiasm for volume growth as they receive a better return in Australian dollars or Brazilian Reals for every ton they ship than had been the case  With predictions  the US dollar has some way to go in this trend once the Federal Reserve starts tightening interest rates  Next year miners will have even less to hold them back from continuing to try and push down the cost curve in 2015

16734,238249,VALE,Brent Cook s Tips For Finding Juniors That Can Survive The Dust Bowl,opinion,"As romantic as the idea of the gold explorer who strikes it rich in lightning fashion is  the far more common tale is one of hard work and persistence  For investors  that means doing due diligence to search out the likely success stories  In this interview with The Mining Report  Brent Cook of Exploration Insights shares the telltale signs of success he looks for in the junior gold  phosphate and uranium sectors and discusses the synergies that stand to benefit some recent mergers 
The Mining Report  Brent  you ve predicted that the summer of 2014 will be a great dust bowl for junior mining investors  Why so bleak 
Brent Cook  The junior mining sector has lots of issues to work through  The major mining companies have even bigger issues to work through  starting with the inability to show a profit over an extended period of time  Investors are disappointed by the performance of the majors and have left the sector in search of more reliable  more profitable sectors 
Until we see the major mining companies start making money  it will be tough for the juniors to raise money  That s the reason for my prediction 
TMR  You ve said that investors might start to return to the mining sector as soon as 2015 2016  Is that because you think the majors will be making money by then  BC  No  I think the opposite  The majors  on average  have all in production costs that are higher than the gold price right now  they are struggling  They re cutting costs by 1  curtailing development and exploration  2  laying off staff  including geologists  engineers and  hopefully  some human resources people  and 3  high grading their deposits  High grading is more profitable in the short term  but in the long run it degrades the future revenue from that deposit 
Although the majors will improve their earnings this year  in 2015 and 2016 their mines won t be making much money  At that point  they will have to replace what they re producing with new  profitable ore deposits  but the problem is there aren t that many out there  In the next couple of years  and we re starting to see it already  the majors will be acquiring the very few profitable deposits out there that are now held by juniors 
TMR  Do you foresee a lot more deals coming up BC  Not a lot more  and that s the problem  There aren t that many good deposits out there 
In H1 14  I went through more than 100 gold deposits with NI 43 101 compliant resources and found very few that I felt actually made good money  There are lots of resources being touted by too many companies  just not many that can make money  assuming the gold price and cost structure stays more or less where they are 
If we see a rapid rise in the gold price  maybe some of these assets will look more profitable  The last time the gold price rose  the majors dropped the grade they were mining  thereby lowering their per ton profitability  At the same time the input costs that go into mining labor  materials  consumables rose  We never saw the profit that was advertised and that we expected 
TMR  Let s talk about some of the deals that have been made  What were the synergies and the challenges 
BC  A couple of weeks ago  Rio Alto Mining Ltd   LM RIO  TSX V  RIO BVL  bought Sulliden Gold Corp   SUE TSX  SDDDF OTCQX  SUE BVL   That s a great deal for Rio Alto  which is currently mining an oxide gold deposit in Peru  By acquiring Sulliden  Rio Alto gets another Peruvian deposit that is very similar geologically and metallurgically  so it shouldn t be too big an issue to bring it into production  The timing works well because the Sulliden deposit should pick up just when Rio Alto s La Arena deposit starts to decline  Rio Alto knows how to work in Peru  and it seems to have the social issues under control  The synergies work really well when a company that knows what it is doing buys a deposit that fits right in with what it s up to 
Another one is B2Gold Corp  s  AMEX BTG  planned purchase of an Australian company called Papillon Resources Inc   ASX PIR    Papillon s deposit in Mali is more than 5 million ounces  5 Moz   in my opinion probably the best gold deposit not owned by a major  We bought it in my letter about a year ago because of its high quality asset  B2Gold is just finishing off building its deposit in Namibia  so the whole team now moves to the deposit in Mali and begins building that  Again  very synergistic for B2Gold 
TMR  Interestingly  looking at the stock prices it appears that Papillon shareholders saw it as a positive  but the B2Gold shareholders did not 
BC  It s an all share deal  so it s a lot of dilution  The Papillon shareholders end up with about 25  of B2Gold  B2Gold dropped quite a bit  but it has come back  But I guarantee you this will be a fantastic profitable deposit for B2Gold  it made a good move while the majors who should be buying it have their collective heads in the sand 
TMR  The bidding war over Osisko Mining Corp   TO OSK  was one of the deals that kicked off a lot of this activity  Now that some time has passed  is that deal positive for the shareholders  BC  It appears to be  I don t follow Osisko in much detail  The deal offers Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE AUY  a big tax advantage because it gives Yamana a Canadian operation  In addition  it gives Yamana some political security in that most of its other options are in less stable jurisdictions  This deal is a big plus for Yamana 
TMR  Do these deals add liquidity to junior mining investors who  after having had a positive experience  might now be willing to put some money into other junior mining stocks 
BC  Certainly  I think a lot of the funds and individuals are taking some money off the table and plowing it back into the sector  That s positive 
TMR  Your newsletter recently quoted a Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  study that 1 in 1 000 prospects turns into an economic deposit  and 1 in 10 000 becomes a 4 Moz or more resource  Why is it getting more difficult to find economic deposits  given all the cool new technology BC  That study is a few years old  and I need to emphasize that it s a statistical number  The real odds are better than that if you do a bit of due diligence 
It s getting harder because we ve scoured the earth fairly well  There are not many outcropping ore deposits left to find  We have to look under cover or through barren rocks  Explorers have to spend more to drill and use geophysics and such  The less expensive but still critical surface work now only gets you to a drill test that is often little more than an initial look at the rocks of interest 
Once you do find something  it has to be good because it s probably buried under 100 200 meters  100 200m  of rock  That depth adds to the cost of exploration  resource definition  stripping  engineering and often recovery  Therefore your grade and tons hurdle are higher for an economic deposit  A 2 Moz deposit grading a gram at surface may make money  but at 150m depth it probably doesn t 
There really haven t been that many advances in technology  Unlike the simpler geology of oil and gas  this is complex geology  Take a porphyry copper deposit  for example  or an epithermal gold deposit  They form on continental margins  subduction zones  fault zones  The deposits get chewed up  broken up  bent up and moved  I just posted an article on my website that goes into the complications of exploration and the discovery process 
TMR  Do investors understand the difficulty of finding and developing a successful project BC  Overall  no  That s a real problem with this industry  There is a lack of communication and understanding between the finance side and the technical side 
Most speculators in this sector have very short term time horizons  They expect to drill a few holes  make a discovery and turn a  0 10 share stock into a  1 stock  It doesn t happen that often  It occasionally does  and that s what keeps hope alive 
Exploration is a scientific endeavor  in which you conceptualize a target or a theory  and you test it using a drill and the data  You re analyze the data and adjust your model to fit  often more than once  That takes time and money 
A lot of companies are raising money on prospects that have been tested and retested in the past  The rationale is that speculators will give them a bit of money if they know some flash drill assays are coming from a re drill of a previous hole  thereby providing the speculators a chance to get off the stock with a small profit  In reality  however  the project was a dog  always has been a dog  and the problem was all the other holes that didn t carry any grade  not the one good hole that keeps getting re drilled  Schemes like this are a waste of precious capital and one of the reasons that odds of success are so low 
TMR  Nonetheless  you re still buying companies  What do you look for and how do you take that deep breath and make your estimates 
BC  I ve done this my whole life  I think you can get the odds down with a lot of due diligence and understanding what a company is looking for 
I look for the very few projects that offer a shot at a deposit  whose production costs and capital expense  capex  will be in the lower third of the projects out there  Those projects will make money  assuming some government doesn t steal it 
First off  you need to consider the economics behind mining something as early as possible  Most companies  and most investors  don t seem to do that  which is too bad  because it s really important  On my first visit to any early stage project I mentally build a mine that includes metallurgy  mining costs and capex and then judge results based on that rough model 
Second  you need to invest in a company with competent people who understand what they re looking for  the target type  the geology and what it will take to advance the project  Too many companies find something and  although their market cap may increase  the share price never increases because management needs to keep financing to continue exploring  Even if the company succeeds  we shareholders don t get much bang for the buck because we ve been diluted out as management kept on drilling  A company has to know how to financially engineer the exploration and development of the project 
TMR  What are some examples of companies that have competent management that knows how to both find and develop a deposit without diluting shareholders and raise enough money to get somewhere BC  It s a real short list  The exploration team at Pilot Gold Inc   TO PLG  came out of Fronteer Gold Inc   which  in conjunction with AuEx Ventures Inc   XAU TSX   found and proved up the Long Canyon deposit in Nevada  That deposit was bought by Newmont for  2 33 billion 
Pilot acquired new targets in eastern Nevada  where it s having some real success drilling for a similar style gold deposit on Kinsley Mountain  It doesn t have a defined resource yet  but the drilling is turning up some very positive numbers that point to the potential of another major gold deposit 
The company is doing something similar in Turkey on some gold and porphyry projects  Pilot has about  30 million   30M  in the bank  That s an exploration company worth watching  We own it in the letter  which also means I own it personally 
TMR  Pilot just released some drill results from Kinsley Mountain  Did they meet your expectations 
BC  Yes  they did  Pilot drilled a new target  where it intersected 41m of 3 grams per tonne  3 g t  from surface  That s a very good number  It put one hole under each of two other conceptual targets  and failed on both  That doesn t kill the project  but it makes it more complicated 
We want to see a company conceptualize ideas that  if they succeed  will be meaningful to a major  Results have been pretty positive so far at Kinsley Mountain 
TMR  Pilot s stock price is up quite a bit from the beginning of the year  Is there still upside there BC  Yes  if success continues  Pilot s copper gold resource in Turkey is kind of small  but it s valuable to somebody  perhaps a smaller Turkish mining company  Its other resource in Turkey is metallurgically complex  and it may be worth something to somebody  I like that Pilot continues to test new ideas and is successful  We don t find many companies doing that these days 
TMR  What s another company 
BC  Dalradian Resources Inc   TO DNA  is proving up an interesting deposit in Northern Ireland  It s a series of narrow  high grade vein structures that run under what is basically sheep pasture  In its preliminary economic assessment  PEA   Dalradian has proven up a Measured and Indicated 1 Moz grading 10 4 g t  plus an Inferred 2 5 Moz grading about 9 6 g t  It s located in an area of Northern Ireland that has high unemployment  From what I ve seen and heard  the local authorities are positively inclined toward development  I don t see any serious environmental hurdles 
It s a simple deposit  low capex  low operating costs in a very stable place  I think a midtier company should go in and buy it  Right now  the PEA  which is going to be updated  shows a value close to  500M on an after tax basis  and the company is selling for  100M  It has enough cash to move ahead to the feasibility stage  This summer and fall  Dalradian will be taking a bulk underground sample  I am headed there to get a closer look at the resource shortly 
TMR  How soon could that be a mine 
BC  Let s give it two years  Engineering  permitting and production all take time  If the old PEA is accurate and I think it s probably close this would produce gold for less than  600 ounce  There aren t many projects that can do that  The internal rate of return on Dalradian is about 42  
TMR  Who else do you like 
BC  One of the most geologically boring deposits in the world is a phosphate deposit being proven up by Focus Ventures Ltd   FCV TSX V  in Peru  It s dead simple geology  shallow seabeds that are continuous for tens of kilometers  The phosphate beds within them are being mined or developed on two adjacent deposits  one owned by Vale S A   NYSE VALE  and the other owned by Hochschild Mining Plc  LONDON HOCM   as well as some agricultural companies  They are making lots of money off the phosphate 
The deposit that Focus is drilling is essentially the same  It is proving up a resource right now  If it s successful  it should be worth multiples of what the company is trading at right now  which is about  0 26 share  I can see Focus going substantially higher  assuming it brings in a company that can take the project forward and mine it  I think there s a good chance of that happening 
TMR  Is phosphate a play on the thesis that developing countries need more food  BC  Yes  in a sense this is a play on a growing world population that needs more and higher quality food  Phosphate is a major fertilizer  China and India have trashed their environments  so they need to use more and more fertilizer 
TMR  If junior gold mining investment opportunities resemble a dust bowl  how do you describe uranium juniors  BC  They re even worse  Not too long ago  Rick Rule called uranium the most hated sector  When I first joined up with Rick in 1997  uranium was about as hated as it is now 
You have to step in and buy these things when they re really unloved  and that is where uranium is now  We ve made good money on Fission Uranium Corp   TO FCU  and continue to hold it in the newsletter because it is the best uranium discovery in a long  long time  That is partly because of the grade but  more important  the costs of mining this deposit will be substantially less than most other deposits in the Athabasca basin or the world  Its advantage is being near surface  open pittable and permittable  A lot of the issues faced by companies in the Athabasca are caused by having to go underground  Whoever develops this deposit won t have to face that challenge  The stock has come off quite a bit  It s probably worth accumulating right now 
TMR  Fission Uranium has been something of a darling since it spun out from Fission Energy Corp   FIS TSX V   Is there still upside there 
BC  Yes  I think so  It has yet to release a resource  but it had a big drilling program this year  The deposit is wide open in a number of directions along trend 
I don t mind paying up for the best because  ultimately  it s these high quality deposits that will make money  Somebody will buy this deposit 
TMR  We ve covered a lot of ground  How about some advice for investors looking to get through the great dust bowl intact 
BC  The rain will come  At my most recent presentation in Vancouver  I showed a slide of a couple of stocks that collapsed in 1997  One of them was First Quantum Minerals Ltd   TO FM   It got down to about  0 50 share  within five years  it was up to  17 and  ultimately  got up to be a  28 stock 

You have to ask yourself these questions  Will we keep consuming metals  Are we consuming metals at a higher rate than we used to  Will we be finding enough deposits to replace what s being produced  I think the answer to the first three questions is yes and the last is no  If that s the case  all we have to do is selectively and intelligently buy the companies that have the prospects or the people capable of finding the deposits that will be the leaders when the bull market comes back to the sector  as it will 
TMR  That s great advice  Brent  thank you for your time and your insights

16737,238252,VALE,Industrial Metals On The Mend  As Demand Increases,opinion,"A rise in the global population  growth in the Chinese economy  urbanization of other Asian countries and the increasing requirements of developed countries have created an unprecedented demand for industrial or base metals given their usage in a wide variety of applications in the construction and manufacturing businesses  However  of late  tepid global economic growth and a slowdown in the Chinese economy have emerged as major headwinds for the global metal industry    Let s have a look at how some of the base metals have fared so far and the road ahead    Iron Prices Going Downhill   Iron ore prices had a bullish run in 2013  in contrast to other base metals  thanks to heightened demand from steel end consumers  particularly in the Chinese construction sector  However  the scenario changed dramatically in 2014  In March  the industry was dealt a severe blow  with iron ore prices suffering the sharpest one day drop since the 2008 2009 financial crisis  tumbling 8 3  to close at around  105 per ton  This represented an 18 month low for iron ore prices    Since the first quarter  iron ore prices had somewhat recovered but again plunged to  89 per ton in June    the weakest performance since September 2012  In August  prices again slid below the  90 per ton threshold    So far this year  the commodity has lost 33  of its value  Overall  prices have been impacted by myriad reasons such as excessive inventory along with abundant supply of iron as mining companies increased their output  as well as tight credit and slow economic growth in China  Global steel production  as per the World Steel Association  rose by a meager 2 4  in the first seven months of 2014  mainly dragged down by a slowdown in China s output that affected demand for iron ore  its main ingredient      The lowering price trend has resulted in the closure of high cost iron ore miners and the reduction of exports from non traditional suppliers such as Indonesia  Mexico and Vietnam  Falling iron ore prices have impacted the second quarter results  Mining giant VALE SA  NYSE VALE  reported a 15  plunge in its second quarter profit due to the fall in prices of iron ore  its main product  However  its peers Bhp Billiton  LONDON BLT  and Rio Tinto  LONDON RIO  reported an increase in earnings mostly attributable to their cost reduction efforts which helped mitigate the effect of lower iron prices   Threat of Oversupply Looms for the Iron Industry   There is a threat of oversupply in 2014 as major iron ore producers  Rio Tinto  BHP Billiton  Vale and Fortescue Metals Group Limited  FMG AX  have ramped up production  They intend to continue exploring for iron ore in Australia despite lower growth forecasts for China and weaker iron ore prices  betting on continued strength in iron ore demand over the long term  Thus  Australia  the world s top exporter of iron ore  will rev up its shipments    Brazil  the second largest explorer  will follow suit  Vale  which alone contributes almost 85  of Brazil s iron ore  is expected to increase its iron shipments by 22  in the second half of fiscal 2014 compared with the first half  In case this excess supply is not matched by adequate demand  it will expose the market to a risk of further decline in prices 
Per the World Steel Association  global apparent steel use is expected to increase 3 1  in 2014  following the 3 6  growth in 2013  In China  apparent steel use had soared 6 1  in 2013 on support from government infrastructure investment  However  this year the government s efforts to rebalance the economy will lead to 3  growth in apparent steel usage in 2014    An impending slowdown in China s growth is bound to affect prices as China is currently the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore  accounting for around 60  of the global seaborne market  Thus the mismatch between the excess supply and demand for iron ore will keep iron ore prices subdued in the near term   Aluminum   Prices Regain in 2014 Following a Lull in 2013   In 2013  aluminum prices slid and particularly in the fourth quarter  London Metal Exchange  LME  aluminum prices fell to a four year low  given the oversupply of the metal in the market  evidenced by large aluminum inventories in LME warehouses   Supply outpacing demand led to the dismal performance  which was aggravated by rising inventories    After hitting a four and half year low of  1 675 per ton in February  the base metal has dramatically regained ground surging 24  to over  2 000 in August  The upward trajectory was driven by a 10  drop in LME inventories so far this year and tightening of aluminum supply due to production curtailments by aluminium producers  Furthermore  production cut down in Brazil  as electricity prices surged to records this year  led to the supply constraint    Aluminum companies are benefitting from the rising aluminum prices  The world s largest aluminum producer  Rusal  swung to profit for the first time in the last five quarters  U S  aluminum giant Alcoa Inc  NYSE AA  also reported better than expected results with adjusted earnings skyrocketing 157  from the year ago quarter   Future of Aluminum Industry Lies in Automotive and Aerospace Industries   After aluminum prices bore the brunt of chronic surplus  the global aluminum industry is going through a substantial change in the supply demand picture  In the first six months of 2014  Rusal has effectively cut aluminum production by 10 8   Likewise  Alcoa has taken up a number of restructuring measures  including closure of smelters  and is aggressively pursuing cost cutting actions    Alcoa  during the second quarter  completed the curtailment of 147 000 metric tons of smelting capacity in Brazil at Sao Luis  Alumar  and Pocos de Caldas  In August  Alcoa announced that it will permanently shut down its Portovesme primary aluminum smelter in Italy that will cut the company s smelting capacity by 150 000 metric tons to 3 6 million metric tons a year  Alcoa has set the goal of lowering its position on the world aluminum production cost curve to the 38th percentile by 2016  Once all announced curtailments and closures are executed  Alcoa will have its operating smelting capacity reduced by 1 2 million metric tons  or 28  since 2007    On the demand side  aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis spurred by the automotive and packaging industries    the key consumer markets  The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive  given the metal s recyclability and light weight properties  The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025    The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal  To capitalize on the lucrative aerospace market  Alcoa has agreed to buy U K  based leading jet engine components maker Firth Rixson  a significant milestone in its portfolio transformation strategy  It reinforces the company s aerospace business and strongly places it to capture additional growth in this developing market through a broad spectrum of high growth  value add jet engine components  Alcoa s recent  1 1 billion agreement to supply key parts  including forgings  for Pratt   Whitney s engines also underscores Alcoa s continued efforts to profitably grow its aerospace business    Following China  which accounts for over 40  of the global aluminum consumption  India appears promising given its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth  With demand remaining strong and the industry pulling the reins on supply  the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period which creates a supportive backdrop of high aluminum prices   Copper   Copper Price Makes a Comeback   For the most part of 2013  oversupply  lack of demand and growing bearish economic outlook for China  the world s largest consumer of copper  kept copper prices in check  During the first half of 2014  copper prices declined based on concerns about slowing growth rates in China and an outlook for higher near term supplies  During the mentioned period  copper prices have averaged  3 14 per pound  down 8 2  over the prior year comparable period    In August  copper prices made a comeback  rising 3 3  last week amid signs of a strengthening economic recovery in the U S which is expected to support strong copper demand  being the world s second biggest consumer of industrial metals  However  weakness in the Chinese economy will continue to be a drag considering that it accounts for about 40  of the world s annual demand   Copper Demand Will be Driven by Pickup in Economic Activity   Along with excess supply that has depressed copper prices  miners have been plagued with rising costs  Copper companies have reduced their budgeted future capital expenditures  exploration and other costs and are looking to rid themselves of some of their saleable assets    Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices  we have a long term bullish stance on copper  supported by its widespread use  limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects  In the near term  prices will be influenced economic activity in the U S  and other industrialized countries  Revival in demand from China will also act as a catalyst   Sector Q2 Earnings Scorecard   Growth Picks Up   Within the Zacks Industry classification  the metals ferrous and non ferrous industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector  one of

16738,238253,VALE,Iron Ore Prices Drag Down Miners,opinion,"A few years ago iron ore was the darling of the mining investment community  prices were within spitting distance of  200 per ton and miners were making money hand over fist  Move on a few years and it s all changed 
The major miners are still making heaps of money but not as much as they were and may struggle next year to make the kinds of cash returns to investors they had been promising following extensive cost cutting and project postponement to  paradoxically  improve those same returns  The theory  at least  among the big boys  Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   Bhp Billiton  NYSE BBL  and VALE  NYSE VALE  is to go for volume  drive down the break even point and try to squeeze the competition out of the market  The Asian spot price has collapsed as a result and is currently below  80 ton this week  off 58  from it s record  191 90 ton reached in February 2011 according to Reuters 
Producers in Iran  South Africa  Indonesia and even smaller miners in Australia have thrown in the towel but the closures announced so far at some 85 million tons will not go far in soaking up the 132 million coming onstream this year and the planned 393 million tons coming onto the market over the next few years  Prices that are expected to be below domestic Chinese miners  cost levels were expected to prompt the closure of some 135 million tons of capacity this year but  in reality  closures have been limited  Maybe  Reuters speculates  because many domestic Chinese iron ore miners are owned by Chinese state steel companies whose priority is as much employment as profits 
With average cash costs of  40 50 ton  BHP and Rio are able to weather the storm  Investors are still falling out of favor with the sector as it dawns on them that falling iron ore prices will deprive these companies of the cash needed to make sizeable share buybacks or dividend payments  which had been expected following investor pressure in 2012 to slow expansion and do a better job of rewarding backers  CISA  the Chinese steel industry trade body  has called a peak on Chinese steel production as investment in housing and infrastructure slows and the economy is steered towards consumption rather than manufacturing for export  If the death of competitors could be hastened  the Big Three could start to restrict output and engineer a price rise back to  90 100 ton  a level they have indicated they would be comfortable with for next year  That is looking more like wishful thinking  at least in the medium term  as demand drops and supply continues to rise 

It would seem the stock market is taking the same view as the miner heavy FTSE 100 marches downwards  BHP has been on a steady downward trend for the last month or more in lockstep with the iron ore price

The Markets

Stocks ended lower on Monday as the strength that followed Friday s employment report failed to carry through to the new week  The S P 500 Index attempted to overcome resistance at its 50 day moving average  currently around 1974  but early morning strength was met with selling pressures as investors sought to neutralize portfolios ahead of earnings season  A stronger US Dollar  weak European economy  and general headline risks threaten the forward guidance that many companies may provide this earnings season  the impact of which may lead to more stocks selling on news this season than rallying higher  The 50 day moving average for the S P 500 essentially a neutral level  therefore reaction over the days ahead could be critical for the equity market trend for the remainder of the month  a break above the 50 day moving average could trigger renewed buy signals  while continued declines below this significant average increases the odds that the long awaited correction of 10  or more will come to fruition  Support for the large cap benchmark remains around the 125 day moving average 



A drop in the US Dollar on Monday helped to fuel the early morning weakness in the equity market and it also helped to fuel a rebound in the commodity market  The price of gold  silver  platinum  copper  gasoline  and agricultural commodities all jumped by over 1   attempting to rebound from deeply oversold levels  Among the agricultural commodities that posted strong gains on the day was Soybeans  which is just entering its period of seasonal strength  The price of Soybeans seasonally gains an average of over 18  between now and July  rebounding from a low that coincides with harvest season  The commodity is coming off of a seasonally weak period that spans the third quarter  the performance of which far exceeded seasonal norms this year    A bumper crop significantly boosted the supply of grains  leading to a plunge in the price of soybeans by over 35  in just the past three months  Soybean prices are attempting to rebound from oversold levels as long term support at  9 00 a bushel is tested    A retracement back to the 50 day moving average  around  11 a bushel  is easily attainable  representing a gain of 15  from present levels 





The start of the harvest season also triggers the start of the period of seasonal strength for a number of agricultural stocks  such as AGCO  AGCO   Potash  POT   and Deere  DE   Agricultural related equities have been beaten up this summer  suffering from the impact of plunging grain prices and the rising US Dollar  The stocks recently became significantly oversold  however  momentum divergences over the past couple of months are providing evidence that the stocks are attempting to bottom around present levels  Shares of AGCO very recently started to outperform the market  while Deere has been outperforming the market for almost a month  Once the broad equity market weakness concludes  agricultural stocks may finally be ready to run  benefitting from the positive seasonal tendencies that persist through to the end of the year 









Beat up equally as bad as some of the agricultural stocks have been coal stocks  which plunged by over 13  just last month  according to the Market Vectors Coal ETF  ARCA KOL   KOL is now deeply oversold and testing long term support around  16 75   Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU  and Walter Energy  NYSE WLT   two notable coal producers  are entering their period of seasonal strength  which runs through the end of the year    Shares of BTU and WLT are substantially oversold and the long term trend remains firmly negative  however  a bounce from present levels during the period of seasonal strength ahead is becoming increasingly probable  Both coal stocks average a gain of around 15  between now and the end of the year

16758,238273,VALE,Golden Arrow Resources  New Silver Zinc Lead Deposit For The Times,opinion,With a market cap of less than  10 million  Golden Arrow Resources Corp   TSX V  GRG  just  a first ever NI43 101 compliant resource estimate on its  100 million silver ounces Chinchillas Silver Zinc Lead Deposit which is just 30 km away from the productive Pirquitas Silver Mine  reserves  84 million silver ounces  output  9 million silver ounces per year  run by Silver Standard Resources  TSX  SSO  with a market cap of  560 million  The nearby El Aguilar Zinc Lead Mine and the Palpala Smelter are both owned by mining giant Glencore Xstrata  In December 2012  Coeur d Alene Mines  TSX  CDE  with a market cap of  1 5 billion  paid  1 78 per ounce for Mirasol Resources  30 million ounces silver deposit which is also located in Argentina  At a cut off grade of 50 g t silver equivalent  the Pirquitas Mine operates with same cut off   the Chinchilla Deposit currently has an indicated resource of 7 2 million tons ore at surface  open pitable  averaging 119 g t silver  0 5  zinc and 0 6  lead which sums up to a total of 33 million ounces silver equivalent  The inferred resource currently stands at a total of 72 million ounces silver equivalent and is poised not only to be expanded greatly but also to be upgraded to the indicated category within the next months of aggressive drill programs  The Good News Doesn t Stop Here   More Sensations      98 7  recovery of silver  first bench scale metallurgy    The Chinchillas samples responded very well to flotation and were found not to be sensitive to grind size  Maximum rougher silver recoveries were 99 8  97 and 99 3  in the Basement  Socavon and Silver Mantos composites  respectively  The lead recoveries were also very high  at between 96 5 and 98 1  for all rougher tests  while zinc recoveries were generally lower  between 66  and 96 1        Such high recoveries indicate that 2 separate saleable concentrates can be produced  silver and lead zinc  especially when considering that conventional flotation methods with standard reagents were used successfully  Thus  mining costs can be low and predictable    The deposit is still open in all directions giving immense resource increment potential during the upcoming drilling campaigns    Golden Arrow can earn 100  of the Chinchillas Project by solely paying  1 8 million over 4 years and  1 2 million once commercial production commenced  There is no royalty attached to the property    With a current market cap of solely  12 million  the company is trading at cash levels  Thus  value appreciation of its well selected project portfolio   foremost its flagship Chinchillas   has just started and equity dilution at low price levels can be avoided as being well cashed up for the upcoming exploration and development programs  Besides Chinchillas  the company owns 5 other prospective exploration properties in Argentina    The company s Executive Chairman is Joseph Grosso  who became one of the early pioneers of the mining sector in Argentina in 1993 when the sector was opened to foreign investments  He was awarded Argentina s  Mining Man of The Year  in 2005  His intimate knowledge of Argentina and industry contacts was instrumental in attracting a world class team which led to the acquisition of key properties in Golden Arrow s portfolio  He has successfully formed strategic alliances and negotiated with mining industry majors such as Barrick  Teck  Newmont   Viceroy  now Yamana Gold  and Vale S A   as well as government officials at all levels  Mr  Grosso s expertise is financings  negotiations  corporate development and marketing strategy  He is the founder and president of Grosso Group Management Ltd   which company is one of the largest shareholders of Golden Arrow   thus  a hostile take over is unfeasible    The company s CEO   President is Carlos H  Fernandez Mazzi who was the CEO of Apex Silver in Bolivia exploring and developing the prolific San Cristobal Deposit successfully towards a world class open pit operation 4 000 m above sea level  Since 2009  the San Cristobal Mine is fully owned by Sumitomo Corp  from Japan and is now the world s 6th largest zinc mine and 3rd largest silver mine  according to Sumitomo   Interestingly  the geology of Chinchillas is similar to San Cristobal as the ore occurs within a similar diatreme volcanic complex and breccia environment  However  San Cristobal is home to relatively low grade silver mineralization when compared with 112 g t silver from Chinchillas  In mid 2011  San Cristobal had reserves of 285 million tons ore averaging 53 g t silver  1 4  zinc and 0 5  lead which sums up to a total of 484 million ounces silver  4 million tons zinc and 1 3 million tons lead  As the San Cristobal ore body is still open both at depth and laterally  further reserve expansion potential is being valued broadly as  extraordinary   Considering that Chinchillas is relatively high grade with more than twice as much silver as San Cristobal and geologic structures being similar  it is not unlikely that Golden Arrow Resources Corp  sits on one of the 3 largest silver mines in the world of the future    Insiders are buying the stock strongly  e g  Mr  Carlos H  Fernandez Mazzi recently bought 750 000 shares at  0 30   The Best Is Yet To Come    The above resources of  100 million silver ounces in the Chinchillas Deposit are solely based on maiden drilling phases focusing on near surface mineralization generally defined as the so called Silver Mantos Zone  disseminated silver in flat lying rock layers  aka mantos  in the western part of the basin that is hosted within volcanic tuffs and breccias  and the so called Socavon del Diablo Zone  silver zinc lead mineralization in the eastern part of the basin that is hosted within same volcanics     The above stated reserves of 84 million ounces silver in the Pirquitas Mine  57 million ounces silver in proven reserves grading 181 g t silver and 27 million ounces silver in probable reserves averaging 168 g t silver  are based on the so called Basement Schist Zone representing the bed rock through which a volcanic complex  diatreme  erupted and at the same time mineralizing it widely with silver  zinc and lead   Pirquitas style  mineralization   The Silver Mantos and the Socavon del Diable Zones are not existing anymore at the Pirquitas Deposit because they eroded away during the last millions of years   in contrast to the Chinchillas Deposit where both these zones still exist and thus can be mined easily and cost effective before mining goes deeper to produce from the higher graded zones in the basement schist and feeder systems thereunder    Hence  Golden Arrow may very well sit on a much larger deposit than Silver Standard s Pirquitas Deposit because the Basement Schist Zone was recently discovered being mineralized prospectively thus supplying immense exploration and resource estimation upside potential for the upcoming months    The meaning of  A Deposit For The Times  has become manifest  namely that with such a superb flotation recovery of the highly enriched ore occuring right at surface  the quick development of an open pit looks feasible with the state of the art infrastructure and mines near by   even in this depressed state of the mining sector  Golden Arrow is one of the very few mining stocks that can look forward unstressed in bringing a deposit into production even in this negative climate  We value Golden Arrow not only as a current short term outperformer for the time being but more importantly as an outperformer for the long run   no matter what the precious metals prices or general mining market do   The Company is thrilled to have completed its first NI 43 101 resource estimate of more than 100 million ounces of silver equivalent combined in indicated and inferred categories  Given that the deposit appears to be open in all directions  the Company is confident that the potential for the estimate to increase is high with the completion of the Phase 3 drill program planned for the third quarter of this year  The favorable geometry of the deposit for open pit mining  combined with our recently completed metallurgical test program  and good infrastructure should allow us to advance this to a preliminary economic evaluation quickly as we expand the resource estimate   Brian McEwen  VP Exploration   Development of Golden Arrow Resources Corp      Live Chart     Technically  Golden Arrow on the TSX Venture Exchange traded in tandem with the HUI mining index during the last months  the stock consolidated in a downward sloping  red  triangle since mid 2012    After 4 waves within the triangle going down from 40 to 18 cents  the price broke above the resistive  red  triangle leg at around 22 cents on May 8 initiating the so called thrust  final movement out of a triangle typically explosive either to the up  or downside     The goal of a thrust to the upside is to break above the resistive high of the triangle  40 cents  and to transform it into new support in order for a new and sustainable upward trend to commence thereafter    We are confident that Golden Arrow will continue to outperform the HUI mining index and appreciate further in value   no matter what the precious metal prices and HUI do  View over the Chinchillas Property with the near surface zones Silver Mantos and Socavon del Diablo which are the basis of the  100 million ounces silver equivalent resource estimate of

16766,238281,VALE,Keeping Stakes Small  Navigating The Gold M A Market,opinion,Bigger isn t always better  as recent acquisitions by Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   Coeur d Alene Mines Corp  and New Gold Inc  suggest  These companies are choosing to make multiple smaller deals as they keep the M A thesis alive  In this interview with The Gold Report  Keith Phillips  head of Cowen and Company s Metals   Mining Investment Banking Group  tells investors what they can learn from those deals  the biggest problems facing the gold equities market and how they can take advantage of what he calls the strongest debt financing markets in history  The Gold Report  Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   CDE  recently acquired Orko SilverCorp  for cash and shares  What should investors pay attention to in that deal  Keith Phillips  The deal involved La Preciosa  a silver asset controlled by Orko  in an attractive jurisdiction in Mexico  From an investment banking perspective  seeing two different  quality companies competing for a junior mining asset in an environment where people thought the merger and acquisition  M A  business was dead was encouraging  First Majestic Silver Corp   AG  made an initial bid for Orko  and Coeur d Alene was the successful bidder  TGR  Are high quality silver assets more likely to be targets than similarly valued gold assets in this market  KP  There are many targets in gold but very few buyers currently  Silver is a smaller business with fewer quality targets but a relatively large number of healthy buyers  Coeur d Alene is obviously healthy  having gone for Orko  Hecla Mining Co   HL  bought Aurizon Mines Ltd  to diversify into gold but also to stay in precious metals in North America  Pan American Silver Corp   PAAS   Fresnillo Plc  FRES LSE   Silver Standard Resources Inc   SSRI   First Majestic and many others are well positioned to be consolidators of silver assets  TGR  What are your thoughts on the strategy of Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM   which has been on a shopping spree this year  Agnico has taken significant positions in ATAC Resources Ltd   ATC TSX V   Sulliden Gold Corp   SUE TSX   Kootenay Silver Inc   KTN TSX V  and Probe Mines Limited  PRB TSX V  and also bought Urastar Gold Corp  and its Mexican assets for a total of CA 10 million  KP  Many of Agnico s friendly competitors are being cautious from an M A perspective  and I think Agnico sees an opportunity to be more aggressive and to position itself in desirable assets  I m impressed that it continues to be opportunistic  and I think Agnico will be rewarded for staying on track  TGR  What are some common themes in those deals  KP  Agnico is looking broadly  The company is focused on high quality assets it thinks it can build in regions where it is comfortable operating  The Urastar deal was a synergistic one  Urastar s core assets were near Agnico s La India project in Sonora  Mexico  so it was a natural for them  ATAC is the high grade gold play in the Yukon  TGR  The share prices for those juniors remain stagnant  but is that the measure of success for those deals  KP  You can measure success from the perspective of Agnico or from the perspective of the company that Agnico is investing in  We won t know the value of these positions for Agnico for some time  For the companies that received the capital  I would differentiate them from others that had to finance in a more conventional sense  in a very difficult equity market  These companies have been able to raise capital without negatively impacting the share price  TGR  Canada s National Bank Financial put out a note in late May that suggested that Agnico is the trendsetter of  bite sized deals  and that we could see more of the same from other players  including New Gold Inc   NGD   Yamana Gold Inc   AUY   Alamos Gold Inc   AGI TSX   Eldorado Gold Corp   EGO   Goldcorp Inc   GG  and B2Gold Corp   BTG   Do you think that thesis has legs  KP  I wouldn t rule it out  I ve spent time with many of the companies on that list and know that some are uncomfortable having a small minority stake in the company because of the financial statement implications  Agnico isn t unique  Coeur d Alene has done something similar  which is to take several small stakes  Agnico has been more aggressive this year  but I m not sure many others will follow its strategy  TGR  The National Bank Financial note added that it saw potential for assets in the Americas  notably Canada  the United States  Mexico  Chile  Brazil and Peru  and also in Australia  Which jurisdictions do you favor  KP  Each jurisdiction is unique  They are all evolving  but very few are moving in a favorable direction  The mining industry is an easy revenue target  and I can t think of many jurisdictions that are getting better for mining  We have seen permitting difficulties within Canada  in British Columbia  and there has been some pressure within Quebec on taxes and on the mining business  There s been pressure on taxes in Nevada  considered by many to be the best jurisdiction in the United States  and pressure on taxes in strong mining regions like Australia and Chile  The pressure tends to be from governments to either raise more money through taxes or to stop development all together for community reasons  TGR  Will analysts have to raise their discount rates in some of these once relatively stable jurisdictions  KP  I suspect analysts will be cautious in adjusting their models until the reality has changed  I wouldn t expect meaningful changes to discount rates in places like Nevada  Having said that  in a place like British Columbia  some projects will get built and some won t  and it will all be based on the merit of each project and its impact on the environment  That s the reality  Similarly  some projects in California are getting built against all odds  TGR  Are you following any specific companies there  KP  Golden Queen Mining Co   Ltd   GQM TSX  is advancing a project that is fully permitted  Pan American Silver is now drilling in California  The state is seeing modest activity  it is very much company and asset specific  but in industrialized parts of California mining is viewed as an industry to support  TGR  What would a discount rate be on  say  Ontario  Nevada  Sonora  Mexico  Ghana  and Peru  KP  I think everybody would use the same discount rate within Canada and Nevada and the better parts of Mexico  My guess is people would use a relatively low discount rate for Ghana  and  presumably  Peru would be higher  TGR  National Bank Financial also shortlisted what it calls  high quality acquisition candidates   which included Romarco Minerals Inc   R TSX   Balmoral Resources Ltd   BAR TSX V   Belo Sun Mining Corp   BSX TSX V   Minera IRL Ltd   IRL TSX   Newstrike Capital Inc   NES TSX V   Rainy River Resources Ltd   RR TSX V  and Torex Gold Resources Inc   TXG TSX   Would you agree with those names  KP  I don t disagree with that list  but I could write one that is literally 10 times longer in five minutes  and it would be considered attractive by some group of potential buyers  The list of companies that have attractive projects that are available is long  the problem is very  very few buyers exist currently  TGR  Do you see that changing in the gold space within the next 18 months to two years  KP  Inevitably  the bigger companies currently focused on internal operating challenges  like Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  or Kinross Gold Corp   KGC NYSE   will come back  Nobody has a portfolio that can keep it going indefinitely  every gold company needs to review new opportunities  TGR  So the M A thesis in the gold space isn t dead it s just a long thesis  KP  That s right  The most critical issue is this abundance of available assets and dearth of buyers  If you have a nice asset like Rainy River Resources in Ontario  the real list of buyers is somewhere between 5 and 20 names  And those names are looking at dozens and dozens on the same list of acquisition opportunities  and out of the 20  at least half are not interested in transacting right now   Editor s note  On 5 31 2013 New Gold Inc  announced a  310 million cash and stock deal to buy Rainy River   TGR  What about China  Are some of the big Chinese mining companies venturing into the small cap space  KP  The Chinese are always on the buy list  As a group they have not been aggressive in precious metals in North America  but we all continue to call them and try to get them interested  I know the Chinese bought Corriente Resources Inc  in Ecuador  It s a good time to be a buyer  whether you are a North American company or an international company  TGR  Are you noticing any other trends in this and the M A space  KP  The good news is the things that drive M A activity are CEO confidence and capital markets and financing  CEO confidence on the M A side is very low right now  But the financing market  especially debt financing and private equity markets  is open and ready for business  Debt financing markets are the strongest they ve been in the history of time literally  If you are an acquirer  you have an opportunity to use debt to finance a company operating companies  not project companies  Some folks are reluctant to use debt in the mining business  but I think you can use it prudently and attractively to deliver the real cost of capital  TGR  Thanks for your insights  Phillips was a speaker at the Society for Mining  Metallurgy and Exploration    conference  Keith

16851,238366,VALE,Andrea Rubakovic  Will Pitfalls Create A Global Potash Shortage ,opinion,Here s the story on potash according to Salman Partners Analyst Andrea Rubakovic  The major players are planning for long term demand by developing brownfield projects  but they re running into hurdles  Meanwhile  juniors are having trouble financing greenfield projects  Does this mean we re in for a global supply pinch  If so  who could be positioned to profit  Read what Rubakovic has to say in her interview with The Energy Report  The Energy Report  What s your outlook for the potash industry at this point  Andrea Rubakovic  We are expecting a cautious global potash market for the remainder of the year  Chinese and Indian potash demand is slowing  Demand from developing nations in general is softening due to economic concerns in the U S  and Europe  Nevertheless  we believe that the combination of existing producers  supply management and foreseen difficulties in bringing new supply onstream should keep global potash markets relatively balanced  So potash prices should be at steady levels in the short and medium terms  In the longer term though  we believe fundamental demand drivers for potash are intact and we are bullish on the industry s prospects  We expect to see demand rising in order to supply more and better quality food to a growing global population from a relatively finite area of arable land  TER  A number of potash projects are under development  Do you expect to see them reach production  AR  Current potash producers have announced significant brownfield expansions and a number of junior players around the world are developing greenfield potash projects  However  some brownfield projects under construction today may have high costs and could take as long to reach full operational capability as a greenfield mine would  On the greenfield front  we have seen negative development announcements from most major projects  which is a positive for the supply demand balance  Just this morning  K S Potash Canada  SDFG FSE   which is in the early stages of developing its Legacy project in Saskatchewan  announced capital expenditures  capex  escalation and delayed timelines  In addition  EuroChem  a privately held company that is advancing two projects in Russia  has encountered a number of delays  while Vale S A   VALE NYSE  recently announced suspension of work on its greenfield project in Argentina due to escalating costs  We have historically viewed BHP Billiton Ltd  s  BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK  Jansen project as the most serious risk to the potash supply demand balance  and while the company continues to perform development work at its site in Saskatchewan  it has yet to receive formal board approval  On the junior greenfield development front  a number of companies have significantly derisked their projects from a technical perspective  Some have completed feasibility studies and a few have secured the required environmental permits  The investment thesis a few years ago was that reaching these milestones could spark large investment by Indian  Chinese and Brazilians entities looking to secure fertilizer supplies  We have seen investments made in the sector since then  however  no overwhelming inflow of capital or straight takeovers by these parties has taken place  The main theme we are now seeing is that the junior potash companies are suffering the same fate as most junior miners  a challenging financing environment is hindering project progress  We believe that only a small portion of greenfield developers will ultimately finance and construct their projects  and those that do are likely to experience significant delays in production start times and overruns in costs  The present challenging financing environment will filter these projects  and only the highest quality projects or those with unique strategic appeal will develop further  TER  Many projects these days need to have offtake agreements in place in order to have any chance of getting into production  Is this the new norm  AR  Yes  Strategic partnerships and or offtake agreements help mitigate the financing risk  They make project debt and equity financing easier to obtain  We view offtake agreements with an equity stake in a particularly positive light  those agreements represent a higher level of commitment  TER  I see that you just initiated coverage on MBAC Fertilizer Corp   MBC TSX  MBCFFOTCQX  in January  What s the story there  AR  Brazil is one of the world s fastest growing potash and phosphate consumers and a leading importer  It is one of the few countries in the world with an underutilized land base and a favorable climate to facilitate continued expansion of cultivated land  The country currently imports 50  of its annual phosphate needs and is estimated to have the largest demand growth profile of any major phosphate consumer  Furthermore  MBAC has a very knowledgeable management team with over 150 years of combined experience in development and financing of fertilizer projects in Brazil  The company s CEO  Antenor Silva Jr   helped develop an innovative phosphate metallurgical process that led to highly profitable development and growth for phosphate fertilizer production in Brazil  MBAC intends to become a significant integrated producer of fertilizers in the Brazilian and Latin American markets  The company is developing a number of fertilizer projects in Brazil  and we believe it is positioned to greatly benefit from the country s large demand growth profile  stable political environment and a well developed infrastructure  The company s flagship Itafos phosphate project  located in central and northern Cerrado the center of Brazil s largest agricultural region and new agricultural frontier is expected to reach initial production later this year  The company addressed certain development issues at Itafos earlier this year  and we believe MBAC is on track to realize its potential upside if it successfully executes this project  On top of that  we believe that MBAC is a potential takeover target by a Brazilian entity that appears to have intentions to consolidate the Brazilian fertilizer sector and is already a large shareholder of the company  TER  You also cover Encanto Potash Corp   EPO TSX V   How does that situation look at this point  AR  Encanto is another interesting company that is developing a potash play in Saskatchewan through a joint venture with the Muskowekwan First Nations group  The Muskowekwan project is relatively earlier stage compared to other Saskatchewan companies in our coverage universe  but we believe it stands to benefit from working directly and exclusively with the First Nation group through a significantly faster permitting and development process compared to negotiating with multiple land owners  In February  Encanto announced it is in talks with India s Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd   a state owned fertilizer and chemical marketer that represents a consortium of Indian fertilizer companies  They have not yet struck an agreement for future potash sales  but it s certainly encouraging that Encanto is holding these discussions  Just keep in mind that an announcement of discussions certainly does not ensure signing and completion of an offtake agreement  Our long term view is that completion of a positive feasibility study and receipt of the Environmental Impact Assessment  EIA  approval are necessary hurdles to pass before an offtake agreement and financing are secured  we would remind investors that these were the necessary obstacles to overcome for Potash One before being taken out by K S  We believe the entry of a strategic partner  acquirer or offtake partner is more likely when a company completes its bankable feasibility study and receives the necessary EIA approval  TER  Karnalyte Resources Inc   KRN TSX  is another company you cover  How do its prospects look at this time  AR  Karnalyte is focused on bringing its Wynyard potash project in Saskatchewan to production  We like that the project and plant have been designed so they can be built in stages  this offers significant advantages in terms of capex  Even though we are discouraged by the large number of producers already looking to develop potash projects in Saskatchewan  we feel the high quality of the project and phased approach to production separate the Wynyard project from others in the basin as having the best chances of being financed through construction  Gujarat State Fertilizers   Chemicals made a CA 45 million strategic investment and offtake agreement in the company early this year  We viewed this as a big vote of confidence in the project and believe the entry of the strategic partner and offtake partner marked the beginning of wider project financing activities for Karnalyte  Our understanding is that Karnalyte will continue its discussions with other potential strategic partners  the entry of which we view to be a strong possibility  We believe there s room for a second strategic investor to enter the picture in the near term  TER  You recently visited Allana Potash Corp  s  AAA TSX  ALLRF OTCQX  project in Ethiopia and just increased your 12 month target price  What would be the catalysts to cause that substantial move from the current price  AR  Allana s is another interesting story we have been following for a while  The company s focus is on developing a potash project in Ethiopia  This is expected to be one of the lowest cost potash projects globally due to shallow depths of mineralization and a favorable hot climate that should allow for solar evaporation  materially lowering energy costs in the solution mining process  We also like that the company is uniquely situated to appeal to key import markets in India and China and enjoys long standing financial support from strategic investors  IFC  a member of the World Bank Group  and Liberty Metals and Mining Holdings  We are also encouraged by the Ethiopian government s support for companies such as Allana as part of its commitment to move Ethiopia from an agricultural to an industrial economy  We upgraded our target price after the company significantly derisked the project with a positive feasibility study earlier this year  We expect the receipt of the Environmental  Social and Health Impact Assessment and the mining license  anticipated for receipt later this quarter  to serve as significant catalysts for the story  In addition  we are encouraged by the advanced offtake discussions the company is conducting with a number of parties and strategic partners  We feel that combined  these mark the project as a high candidate to be financed through production no small feat in today s unfavorable financing environment  TER  What level of risk do companies that export from the port of Djibouti face  considering the reports of piracy in the area  AR  The piracy problem appears to be winding down as the presence of Somali pirates  who have historically been plaguing the waters surrounding the Horn of Africa  have effectively been shut down in the past two years due to a large military presence by a number of countries in the port of Djibouti and surrounding areas  This is a very positive data point for anyone planning to transfer goods in this region  TER  What s your strategy on how investors should approach potash stocks in the current market environment to minimize risks and take best advantage of the opportunities you see now  AR  A lot of the junior and small cap stocks have been crushed in the current market  along with the stocks in the junior potash developer sector  We believe in strong long term demand drivers for potash  the depressed prices present opportunities to accumulate shares of select junior potash developers  However  we caution that due to the large number of companies present in the universe  focusing on the highest quality names is imperative  We favor companies that have strong management teams  appeal to strategic investors or have distinct advantages in capital and other costs  The quality of the project  presence and likelihood of offtake partners  the cash balance and the potential sources of funding are all hugely important  TER  Thank you for sharing your market

16852,238367,VALE,Anorthosite  What It Is And Why You Should Care,opinion,Copper and nickel are two metals modern society cannot get enough of  but there is not enough to go around  says Rick Mills  publisher of Ahead of the Herd  Add in mounting production costs and you have a supply and demand disaster in the making  But when it comes to making fiberglass and aluminum  Mills says in this interview with The Metals Report that he sees a revolution in the making  and its name is anorthosite  The Metals Report  Rick  you have concerns about supply problems for many industrial metals  Let s start with the importance of copper and nickel to global growth  Rick Mills  Modern society would grind to a halt without copper and nickel  Nickel has more than 100 000 applications  Copper is everywhere as well  But growing structural imbalances in the supply and demand equation do not bode well for future resource extraction  Mining is extremely capital intensive  The initial capital expense  capex  of building and developing a mine is high  Company built infrastructure assets roads  railways  bridges  power generating stations  seaports are often needed to extract and transport the ore and concentrate  Second  the operating expenses  opex  rubber tires  wages  fuel  camp costs are not stable  they keep going up  TMR  Production costs have been high for a while  Why are you so concerned now  RM  Copper has become especially capital intensive  The low hanging fruit has been mined  Companies have to go further off the grid to find deposits  The deposits now being mined are getting older  the metallurgy is more complex and grades are going down  In 2000  it cost  4 000 5 000 on average to build the infrastructure to produce a ton of copper  Now that number is north of  10 000 ton  Nickel is the only other metal with that kind of increase in capital intensity  Declining ore grades mean miners need a much larger relative scale of mining and milling operations to get the same amount of metal  New mining projects are often in remote areas of developing countries with little to no infrastructure  When you are in the middle of the jungle  without access to roads  railways or seaport  you have to build all that  That s why new copper and nickel mines cost upwards of  8 billion   8B   TMR  Do you think the economy is recovering and how does that impact the demand for copper  RM  Economies in the developing world the U S   Japan  the Eurozone are not recovering   See chart below   I would expect growth to be 1 5 2  for the next couple of years  which is not enough to stimulate new demand  In contrast  the BRIICs  Brazil  Russia  India  Indonesia and China  are expected to grow at least at a 6  average  These countries are undergoing massive industrialization and urbanization that will more than make up for the slowdown in the West TMR  Given the copper shortage  will senior companies like Teck Resources Ltd   TCK NYSE  TCK A TSX  and Vale S A   VALE NYSE  go looking for new deposits or do you see more merger and acquisition activity  RM  I prefer junior companies that already have a deposit  One that meets my criteria is VMS Ventures Inc   VMS TSX V   Its Reed Lake project in Manitoba  Canada  is a 70 30 joint venture with HudBay Minerals Inc   HBM TSX  HBM NYSE   It will be in production later this year  The ore will be trucked to HudBay s milling and concentrating facilities  By 2015  VMS will have decent cash flow after paying back HudBay  with close to  100 million   100M  flowing to VMS over the current five year life of mine  LOM   The deposit could grow along with the LOM  Manitoba is mining friendly  has a skilled local workforce and all the infrastructure you need  TMR  Could HudBay take over Reed Lake outright  RM  I would rather see HudBay continue as the operator and see VMS use the cash flow  Right now  VMS has  10M in its treasury  It could use that money to explore or acquire another project  Plus  it already owns 21  of North American Nickel Inc   NAN TSX V   TMR  What about nickel  Are there shortages there too  RM  The biggest problem I see with nickel concerns the types of deposits  Nickel deposits come in two forms  sulfide or laterite  About 60  of the world s known nickel resources are laterites  Sulfide metallurgy is much simpler and therefore sulfide nickel is much cheaper to produce  The principal ore mined from sulfide deposits is pentlandite  which has simpler metallurgy  Laterite metallurgy is more complicated  and the deposits are often in equatorial countries that carry higher geopolitical risk  We have not had a new major sulfide discovery in years  They just are not being found anymore  We have laterite nickel deposit discoveries  but there is no simple separation technique for nickel laterites  The rock must be completely molten to enable nickel extraction  Laterite projects require large economies of scale to be viable because of their higher capital costs per unit  We are looking at north of  35 pound  35 lb  of capital intensity to build these very large ferronickel and high pressure acid leach projects  TMR  You mentioned North American Nickel  Can you tell us more  RM  North American Nickel started drilling its Maniitsoq  Greenland project last year and got fantastic results  The principal ore is pentlandite  which is the first important factor  The second is that Alex Balogh  former CEO of Falconbridge  is on North American Nickel s advisory board  That is a huge endorsement  The company has about  1 5M in the bank and is planning a 3 000 meter drill program at Maniitsoq  It will target high priority  variable time domain electromagnetic conductors and follow the open high grade sulfur mineralization  This is a huge camp  a 100  owned district  VMS and the Sentient Group out of Australia are big supporters  North American Nickel is currently raising  7 5M for a huge Greenland program this year  TMR  Our next topic may be new to our readers anorthosite  What is it and why are you so excited about it  RM  Anorthosite is calcium feldspar  which is basically sand containing aluminum  calcium  low levels of soda and 1  iron  It could serve as an alternative material in many industrial applications  For example  it could replace kaolin  a major component of glass fiber manufacturing  TMR  What about anorthosite s potential for aluminum manufacturing  RM  That is a much bigger prize  but it will take longer to get going  Anorthosite has three things going for it  First  it is highly soluble in hydrochloric acid  Second  if the anorthosite ore contains little iron  it is easy to extract the calcium and the alumina  Third  and most important  acid regeneration technology could allow processors to capture the hydrochloric acid and use it again  saving a lot of money  That could be a cheaper alternative to the Bayer process many producers use today  Bauxite is the main source for aluminum  Today  bauxite producers do not factor in the cost of sequestering their tailings their red mud into their expenses  If they did  their margins would change  In the past  producers have dumped their red mud into the ocean this is not acceptable today  Meanwhile  the process of calcining the bauxite consumes enormous amounts of power  and costs are rising for caustic soda  which is used in this process  The electrolysis process used to create aluminum is also energy intensive  TMR  What companies are mining anorthosite  RM  Hudson Resources Inc   HUD TSX V  is working the White Mountain anorthosite project in Greenland  The company had been working on its rare earth and found a large anorthosite body  This stuff is easy to mine  You do a little blasting  a little digging  Hudson Resources has proven it can reduce the anorthosite s iron content by running it through the company s onsite magnetic separator  The soda content is averaging 2 3   Both of these are below the levels needed to create a ready mix replacement for kaolin  The company is close to the point where it can load its anorthosite onto a deep sea cargo ship and transport it anywhere in the world  year round  It has a resource estimate and a prefeasibility report is due out in Q3 13  This company could hit a homerun for investors  Interestingly  Alcoa Inc   AA NYSE is building an aluminum smelter in Maniitsoq  Greenland  The company has the potential for a 600 megawatt electrical plant up  It is building the plant to provide the cheap hydroelectricity needed for alumina production  TMR  Rick  we

16854,238369,VALE,Why Platinum And Palladium Should Continue To Outperform ,opinion,There are real supply concerns for Platinum Group Metals  PGM s  as laborers continue to protest for higher pay in South Africa  Laborers may demand a large pay increase while the South African producers are unable to stay profitable  There is increasing speculation that PGM s could soar higher Investors could use this pullback in the metals to add to platinum and palladium at the price levels it was before the violent labor protests which killed over 44 miners  South African labor issues combined with increasing auto demand from emerging economies could lead to a supply shortfall and a major price increase in platinum Some large producers such as Anglo American may close some mines  Platinum and palladium are extremely undervalued as most miners can t be profitable at current price levels  South African companies are struggling to survive with high cost production and rising labor costs  Investors should look at advanced undeveloped projects in mining friendly jurisdictions For several months  I have written to my readers that platinum and palladium may outperform gold and silver  Now other big investors are catching onto this theme first brought to you right here Over the past year  palladium is the only metal that has gained ground in an uptrend and platinum has held 52 week lows while gold  silver  and copper have hit new lows  The reason behind this outperformance in Platinum Group Metals  PGM  during a weak metal market should be addressed Platinum and palladium have recently outperformed gold and silver after underperforming relative to gold since the credit crisis as the auto industry collapsed and was bailed out by Washington  Weak demand and volatility in the auto sector caused the industrial side of the PGM market to be in surplus However  since that time automobile manufacturers have rebounded significantly  Demand for automobiles especially from emerging nations such as China are surpassing that of the United States  These countries dealing with significant air pollution need platinum and palladium for catalytic converters to decrease noxious emissions At the same time  labor disputes are putting constraints on supply from South Africa  Platinum and palladium is unprofitable to mine there as the country has some of the most deepest  dangerous and high cost mines in the world Russia becomes the next big player for PGM s and their stockpiles have been rapidly dwindling With the increase in demand for platinum and palladium worldwide and the constraints on supply from South Africa and Russia  I expect to see these metals continue to significantly outperform as they did before the credit crisis in 2008  This pullback in the metals complex may give an opportunity for investors to diversify into platinum and palladium  which have both a practical use as a monetary hedge against inflation and as a critical industrial component for clean automobiles  In addition to automobiles  PGM s are used in cell phones  jewelry and computers   Supply for Platinum group metals may be at an all time low  while increasing demand for clean automobiles  investors and consumers will need addition platinum and palladium projects in stable mining jurisdictions  Recycling can not fill the supply gap   Prophecy Platinum  NKL V  controls one of the largest undeveloped platinum and palladium projects in the world  This Wellgreen Deposit in the Yukon could be one day the third largest producer of both platinum and palladium in North America after Stillwater Mining and Vale  Prophecy s exposure to platinum and palladium which could be in a supply deficit this year is a big advantage in a tough resource market  There are very few companies with top notch undeveloped projects Prophecy s Wellgreen Deposit could be a major answer to fill North American demand for additional secure supplies from new mines in stable jurisdictions  The increase in demand for platinum and palladium can not be filled through recycling alone Prophecy Platinum s Wellgreen Deposit is already a major deposit with a published Preliminary Economic Assessment yet has room to potentially grow  The company is working to develop some very exciting exploration targets  which they will be looking to drill later this summer Despite the

16860,238375,VALE,Can This  BRIC  Bounce ,opinion,Last week  many of the major stock indexes around the world came under selling pressure  It seems that all of the global money printing by the central banks could not keep the major global stock indexes buoyant  In this weeks report  we shall examine the support levels for one of the highly followed BRIC nations  Brazil First  lets start with the Brazilian markets  using the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped Index  EWZ   On February 22  2013  the EWZ finished the week lower closing at  54 82 a share  This index had a loss of  1 28 for the week  There is still some short term support around the  54 00 area  so a near term bounce should not be ruled out early next week  Should the  54 00 level fail to hold as support on the daily chart then the EWZ will be vulnerable to further declines  The near term support levels are  53 25   52 29  and then more support around the November 2012 double bottom low of  50 49  Please understand  these are just near term support levels for the EWZ  The larger time frames are not bullish and could possibly be setting up for further declines later this year Some Brazilian stocks that will usually follow the EWZ include Vale S A   VALE   Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA  ADR   PBR   Companhia Siderurgica Nacional  ADR   SID   and Itau Unibanco Holding SA  ADR   ITUB   While these stocks are certainly effected by the overall Brazilian market  they should be viewed on an individual basis ,2013-02-25,Nicholas Santiago,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-this-""bric""-bounce-156501",156501

16864,238379,VALE,Commodity Update  Crude Bounces Off 100 DMA,opinion,Energy  April Crude oil bounced off its 100 day MA and is trading near its highs on the session as of this post  A trade above  93 50 should lead to further upside with the 50 day MA coming into play  I m suggesting bullish exposure to play a trade  1 50 2 50 higher from current levels  RBOB has held the 50 day MA on every attempt in the last 2 weeks including multiple attempts the last 3 sessions  Prices could go either way from here   I suggest playing a trade above  3 15 or below  3 08 which would determine the direction of the next leg  My bias is higher but clients currently have no exposure  Heating oil futures are finding mild support just above their 50  Fibonacci level  in April at  2 90  I see support at that pivot point followed by  2 82  A surprise in the AGA inventory report today put natural gas higher by better than 4  and prices at 3  month highs  Some clients are in bearish trade short  3 50 calls  Today was painful as they are effectively short futures  They have 12 days to see prices retrace as I believe they will  No I m not bearish but after a 70 cent appreciation a correction should play out   Stock Indices  The grind higher continues with the S P posting a 0 40  gain  Prices have been above the 9 day MA for the last 10 trading days and climbed 3 6  in that time frame  Prices trend higher unit they don t my thought has been for weeks we are overdone but I ve been wrong  I m recommending the sidelines or to be hedged via owning put options if still in with any size in the stock market  As for picking a top I ve abandoned that play with spec clients  Twelve out of the last thirteen sessions we ve been in the green as the Dow is within 500 points of 15 000  We ve climbed 750 points in the last 2 weeks and 125  off the lows in 2009 unreal people  At this pace we re on our way to 30 000 in the next couple of years yeah right  I would rather miss the top then be there holding the bag when the music stops   Metals  Gold closed marginally higher but well off its lows  settling at  1590 in April after trading at  1575 ounce in early dealings  I view the recent action as a coiled spring that will pop higher in the coming weeks  I maintain that  1560 1570 should support and have an upside objective  1625 followed by  1650 in April  Silver is lower the last 2 sessions but again is finding vale just above  28 50  Looking at a longer term price chart back to early 2011 this level has served as a pivot point so I think it would take a significant event to breach these levels  Furthermore if the dollar was to back off I think that would be constructive for this complex   Softs  Cocoa prices have closed in the red the last 2 sessions but did hold the 20 day MA today  We are still  100 off the lows last week and in my eyes taking a breath before we see further upside  In May futures I m still targeting 2250 trade accordingly  Sugar bounced off the 9 day MA able to recover off the previous 2 days of losses  Unless prices take out 19 cents in the next few sessions I am sticking to my guns that we retrace back near 18 25 in May  Cotton surged 2 5  today to propel prices to 11 month highs above 90 cents  Much of the recent move is from increased buying from China but when will the hoarding end  A near 30  appreciation should discourage this but I may be speaking my position as I have some clients in bearish trade  We are very close to taking the loss stay tuned  Coffee futures have closed lower the last 4 sessions dragging prices to 3 week lows  I expect to find buying inertest just under current trade  My objective remains a trade closer to  1 50 in the next 3 4 weeks   Treasuries  30 yr bonds have tread water the last 4 sessions as 140 16 appears to be the line in the sand in the June contract  From here I think prices find their way back above 143 00  10 yr notes are finding mild support just above 130 00 closing at the 38 2  Fibonacci level today  I see a trade north of 131 00 and would not rule out a probe of 132 00  Lighten up on late dated bearish Euro dollar plays and be willing to work your way back into the trade from higher levels   Livestock   Live cattle have met resistance at their 9 and 20 day MAs just above current prices  If the recent lows hold on a closing basis aggressive traders can probe bullish trade  Truly to get confirmation we need consecutive settlements above those key pivot points  in April at 128 40 and 128 90 respectively  Higher trade was rejected in May feeder cattle with the lowest trade in 7 months today  Look out below if the sellers want to take control  We re seeing mixed results in June lean hogs of late but I feel we are close to turning higher  I would be comfortable with a small bullish trade willing to add if the market proves me right  My suggestion is long June futures while selling out of the money calls 1 1   Grains  May corn futures closed higher by 0 88  but have been unable to take out the 61 8 Fib level the last 3 days  May futures will need to take out  7 20 to see the bullish momentum to continue  Those long should remain in the trade with stops just under  7 bushel  In the last 3 days soybeans are lower by nearly 50 cents as prices retraced back near their 50 day MA  in May at  14 20  I think lower trade is likely but have no current exposure unless the clients put themselves in the trade  Today s chart of the day was wheat  May futures closed higher by better than 2  finishing above the 20 day MA for the first time in 6 weeks  A penetration of the down sloping trend line should get shorts covering and the move higher well under way  My current trade is long futures while simultaneously selling out of the money calls 1 1   Currencies  7 month highs were rejected in the US dollar and we settled lower by 0 34   A close under 82 50 tomorrow or early next week should signal today being the interim top  The Cable was higher by 1  nearly taking out the 20 day MA  a pivot point for the last 5 weeks  I advised clients looking for a fresh entry to get long in the Pound today  If the dollar does retreat we could see a quick 2 3  move here in my estimation  The only other viable play I see is long the CAD  higher by 0 50  today closing above its 20 day MA for the first time in 5 weeks  I ve been advising

16918,238433,VALE,David Baker  Three Must Haves For The New Generation Of Gold Companies,opinion,Mining companies have lost the trust of investors  says David Baker  managing partner at Baker Steel  Baker sees the gold market as at a watershed point and the miners must change to stay afloat  In this interview with The Gold Report  Baker sets out his prescription for nursing the industry back to health  Will the restrictions his company and other investors are putting on gold companies increase reporting clarity  investor trust and money earned   The Gold Report  The major gold producers have ceded market share to gold exchange traded funds and royalty companies and are vastly underperforming those investment vehicles  If you were running a major gold producer  how would you go about restoring the appeal of your company s shares   David Baker  Mining companies need to restore trust and give more clarity  They are confusing investors because on the one hand they tell us they have so many ounces of gold in reserves and are producing so many ounces of gold  and then they confuse us by benchmarking all this to dollars a depreciating asset  We believe the mining companies should be consistent and report in gold  this would then give investors a clearer picture on how much gold it is costing to mine the resource and how many ounces of gold are added to the shareholder vault   There are a number of challenges out there  first is the issue of the dollar cost inflation  When measured in dollars  the capital and operating costs of a mine have gone up  but when measured in gold  costs are fairly stable  Back in 2008 when gold was  800 ounce   800 oz   a 100 000 oz per annum gold mine would typically cost  80 million   80M  or 100 000 oz  today that same mine will cost around  170M  again around 100 000 oz  In dollars  costs are up by over 100  but in gold ounces they are steady   We are using the wrong measure of costs  we are using a depreciating asset dollars to measure costs instead of a real asset  gold  So by mixing dollars and gold we are confusing investors  Now if costs in ounces had risen  we would have a serious problem  To compound the issue  analysts are forecasting higher dollar costs and lower future gold prices  Put these together and this spells a potential margin squeeze  Under this scenario  a new gold project has little value  and the shares get de rated   Second  the gold exchange traded fund  EFT  has outperformed the gold equities  how do we reverse this trend and convince investors to sell some of their EFTs to buy a gold share  As it stands today  if you sell your gold ETF to buy a gold share  what you get is a company who digs gold out of the ground  brings it to surface and then converts it back to dollars  which when you think about it  is not what the EFT holder wants  We believe gold miners need to give investors gold  not dollars  and they could start doing this by reporting in gold  holding gold on their balance sheet instead of dollars and paying a gold royalty or gold dividend   TGR  Even if companies do put their gold production on the books  they re still going to need to liquidate some of that gold in order to meet day to day expenses   DB  That is exactly right  but the balance should be held in gold  When we analyze a typical gold mine  it takes about 10  of the deposit to build the mine  40 45  of the deposit to mine it  about 15  to pay government taxes and maybe 5  for sustaining capital  The balance  20 25   is the return and instead of selling this for dollars  the mining company should hold these gold ounces on its balance sheet   Why is this a good idea  First  it makes no sense to sell an appreciating asset for a depreciating one  second  holding gold instead of dollars will also preserve the purchasing power of the company  A mining company with gold in its vault and lucky enough to discover a new gold project will no longer face a problem of capital cost inflation  As explained  capital costs are fairly stable in ounces and account for around 10  of reserves  Holding gold on the balance sheet will also act as a new source of demand  keeping more gold off the market  Gold producers should then start to emulate the ETF   Companies should review their mission statements  they should change it   to build and grow shareholder value expressed in ounces of gold    This will give management more focus and investors greater clarity   TGR  When you bring up this idea to boards of gold companies  what s their response   DB  I would say that overall we are getting a very positive response  they like the logic and it is certainly stimulating debate   There is clearly an appetite for gold projects  Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW  recently raised  1 9 billion to buy a gold stream off Vale S A   VALE   it risked that amount for a gold stream at a fixed cost  So we can conclude there is a market for this model  Unfortunately  when gold companies sell a royalty to the royalty companies  they have been giving real margin to the royalty companies  and shareholders have ended up with less  Just look at the difference in share price performance of the royalty companies and the gold miners it says it all  The gold companies don t give away much and they hope shareholders hardly miss the 1 75 2  of the gold they sell  but the royalty companies have made a great business out of this   There is an understanding that something has to change  that the business model isn t exactly working for gold equity investors we are giving our margin to others  We argue that royalties should also be paid to current shareholders of the mines  It doesn t have to be much  say 2 2 5  of the gold mined  but this will link the gold in the ground to what the shareholders get  there is then a tangible way to define what an increase in reserves means to the value of the company  After all  I tell the mining companies   When you re going down to your pit and you do 20 shovels to put to the mill  all you have to do is one half to one shovel to shareholders  It s not too much to ask    TGR  How far off is that   DB  We re starting small  Korab Resources Ltd   KOR ASX   an Australia listed company  has just announced a gold reporting  gold strategy and gold dividend policy  We have others in mind  We have confirmations that the strategy will be discussed at board level for a number of companies with the view that they will adopt these policies  so we are getting traction  They are listening  but it is hard being the first mover  Our aim is to allocate funds to those companies who adopt our strategies   In a nutshell we need to restore the trust between the mining companies and investors and we believe our strategies are one way to do just that  The miners have to be held to account   TGR  There s precedence for this  After gold reached its all time high in early 1981  a number of companies started forward selling their gold so they could better control their costs  Shareholders ultimately were the benefactors of that  They ve done it once before  so it can be done again   DB  In the 1980s and 1990s  the gold price was falling and the dollar was rising  It made every sense that once you dug your gold out of the ground  you converted it straight into dollars  It was such a convincing trade that people were selling gold they had yet to mine to convert into dollars  and that was the advent of forward selling  It took about 10 years to get it entrenched that the gold price was falling  and the dollar was rising  We then took 10 years  from 1990 to 2000  for everyone to get on the trade and forward sell  At the bottom of the market  there were well over 3 300 tons gold forward sold   TGR  Practically all production   DB  It was over one year s annual production  Now the situation has reversed  the gold price is rising and the dollar is depreciating  and this should continue as long as the central banks carry on printing more and more money  Over the last 10 years  gold has been rising at around 15  per annum  so we are now just getting the hang of this trend  We have to become gold centric  the miners need to be forward buying gold  holding gold on the balance sheet  instead of forward selling gold  The dollar period was the 1980s to the 2000s  now we re in a gold period   TGR  Some countries are doing that  China has dramatically increased its gold imports from Hong Kong  putting it ahead of India as the world s largest gold consumer   DB  Many central banks are printing money  They re trying to get their currencies cheaper than others so they can capture market share and generate growth  the so called currency wars  but they all know that if everyone is printing money  they cannot all devalue against each other  They have to devalue against something  and gold is a currency that can t be printed  So these central banks are starting to see the writing on the wall  and they re buying physical gold  converting dollars and buying gold  That s a positive  That s going to carry on  But nothing goes up in a straight line  At the moment  we re going through this consolidation  which has felt as if it s lasted forever  It s probably been about two years  Hopefully  we re coming to an end of it   TGR  In early February  a story in Canada s Globe and Mail suggested that IAMGOLD Corp   IAG  could soon be the subject of a takeover bid  Do you believe there s any substance to that idea   DB  I m not convinced  IAMGOLD has purchased a project in Canada that is very low grade with low returns  Maybe that s the opportunity  but not in our book  Baker Steel separates the wheat from the chaff by looking at the quality of the projects  We analyze returns and how the company is going to finance the development will it use debt or equity  In a high inflation environment  debt would be the logical choice  but we re very reluctant to go down the bank route as this normally entails forward selling part of future production  Recently an Australian company raised  50M of debt and had to forward sell over  300M worth of gold to do that  That didn t seem logical to us   In the last 10 12 years  we ve seen cost inflation of 12 15  and the gold price running up at a similar rate  If you forward sell  300M of gold  and gold continues to rise at the same pace it has over the past 10 years  then in a couple of years  the cost of this debt is going to be greater than 100   simply in the lost opportunity cost of not being able to sell gold at market  A disproportionate share of our projected returns will either end up in money heaven through the lost opportunity of forward selling or to the bank through fees again shareholders are short changed  Investors have cottoned on to this and are deserting the developers in droves   TGR  Baker Steel funds have underperformed in lockstep with gold equities  What approaches are you employing to offset the recent dismal performance in gold equities   DB  The market is very cheap  A lot of resource companies are trading on single digit multiples  whereas the market as a whole is trading at 15 20 times multiples  Gold equities used to trade at a premium to the general market but are now trading at a significant discount  That s the opportunity  We re looking for well managed companies and companies that are diversified and well capitalized   Our focus is the mid cap  400 000 600 000 oz  400 600 Koz  gold producers that have two or three operations  with potentially a growth asset as well  We ve built up a nice portfolio of these  Unfortunately they still haven t caught traction in the market  you can buy these companies for around 6 8 times price earnings ratio  They re very cheap   TGR  Do you visit the companies   DB  Yes  last year I went to Chile  Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  and others in our investment team travelled to Papua New Guinea  Africa  Indonesia and other sites  We do a lot of due diligence   TGR  You have investments in what would be classified as safer jurisdictions  like Canada  Mexico and Australia  but you also have investments in places with greater risk  like South Africa  Eritrea and Zimbabwe  Would it be fair to say that when Baker Steel is evaluating a potential asset  it doesn t put as much emphasis on jurisdiction risk as it does on potential return   DB  We risk adjust all of our investments  we are interested in risk adjusted returns  For example  we would place a higher discount rate on a mine in Zimbabwe  Zimbabwe producers have been completely de rated by the market  to the point it probably couldn t really get much worse  In an effort to survive  many of the Zimbabwean companies have had to modify the way they do business in an effort to make their model work  They re starting to produce gold at relatively good costs  There are still some political issues  but you can buy these assets for 10 cents on the dollar  We re putting in just enough money that if we get it right  investors will be glad  And if it doesn t go right  it s not going to be so big a deal for us   South Africa has been a challenge  but Harmony Gold Mining Co   HMY   which has been totally de rated  came out with a result this week that shows that the company is actually performing quite well  We see great value in a number of South African companies   AngloGold Ashanti Ltd   AU  produces about 42  of its gold in South Africa yet has been sold down as if all its ounces were in that country  And even those South Africa ounces are generating very good cash flow  Those are the opportunities that we re looking at  AngloGold is trading at a projected seven times earnings  its yield could be higher but it is currently in a capital intensive phase   Endeavour Mining Corp   EVR ASX  is one of our bigger holdings  the company is a diversified producer that recently acquired Avion Gold Corp  It s a low cost producer that has a reasonable balance sheet and looks interesting   TGR  Most of Avion s producing assets are in Mali   DB  There is obviously a risk  but we believe this is somewhat discounted by the market  Take Resolute Mining Ltd   RSG ASX   for example  the company operates the Syama gold mine in Mali and gold mines in Australia and has a market capitalization of  840M  It has  100M worth of gold cash and investments on its balance sheet and is generating probably  60 70M quarter now that is cheap  There s been no production lost at Syama but the market has sold it down as if the mine faces major disruption  Now  admittedly  the costs have had to increase because Resolute has had to add to security  but the stock does look very cheap   Also  we manage a diversified portfolio  It s not as if we re putting everything into these names  We have around 4  in both Endeavour and Resolute  We can live with the individual company specific risk  particularly for the price  And while we are waiting for the market to recognize the opportunity  Resolute is paying us a good dividend yield as well  and it is holding some of its profits in gold  which  as we have discussed  matches our strategic objectives   We have a position in Ivanplats Ltd   IVP TSX  across some of our funds  Founder Robert Friedland used to be in Ivanhoe Mines Ltd  Ivanplats has three world class assets  it just increased its resources at its Platreef project  an ore body that is around 14 meters in width  compared to 40 150 centimeters for the typical Merensky reef mine  both with similar grades  Ivanplats is going to be a game changer in this industry   TGR  Are you bullish on platinum   DB  You have to be positive on platinum  given the problems in South Africa and the challenges that the platinum producers have there  Anglo American Platinum Ltd   AMS JSE  has recently cut production  I don t think there can be a lot of downside in the platinum price  If there s not a lot of downside  presumably there s some good upside   TGR  Do you have any holdings in the DRC   DB  We have a very small holding in Banro Corporation  BAA    TGR  Is its Namoya project on track to begin production later this year   DB  That is correct but we understand that the company will need  35 45M to complete this  With Banro s Twangiza project  we re getting there  but we re not there yet   TGR  It produced about 20 Koz gold in Q4 12   DB  Twangiza needs to be doing much more that  at least 35 40 Koz quarter and we need to see some consistency of production  Having said this  we did note that the increase in the resources and the oxide is a positive for that company   TGR  Let s move to the South Pacific and New Zealand   DB  Evolution Mining Ltd   EVN ASX   OceanaGold Corp   OGC ASX   Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd   KCN ASX   Silver Lake Resources Ltd   SLR ASX   Archipelago Resources Plc  AR LSE  and St  Barbara Ltd   SBM ASX  are our key holdings in this region  They all have decent balance sheets and are generating cash  You can buy Evolution under single digit multiples  It seems incredible   TGR  What sort of growth should investors expect from Archipelago in 2013   DB  Archipelago is producing around 120 140 Koz with potential going up to 165 Koz and even maybe 200 Koz per annum  all self funded  It is getting some good results from recent drilling and this will allow the company to upgrade its plant and increase production and profits  Archipelago is generating good cash at the moment  although I would like to see that reported and held in ounces  The challenge for Archipelago is whether the major shareholder allows it to grow through acquisition   TGR  What s on your list in North America   DB  Lake Shore Gold Corp   LSG TSX  and AuRico Gold Inc   AUQ   which owns the Young Davidson mine  Lake Shore reduced its 2013 capital expenditure budget by about  18M  but we need to start seeing some returns  When we see Lake Shore this month at the BMO Conference in Miami  this is what we re going to be discussing  It sold a royalty to Franco Nevada Corp   FNV   so maybe the company should consider a royalty to shareholders in return for all our patience  AuRico sold off some assets to focus on Young Davidson  so now it has a better balance sheet  It is looking at potentially paying a high yield  We d like to see that as a gold royalty as opposed to a cash yield  but that s a discussion we have to have with the company   TGR  What about your silver holdings in North America  You have a position in First Majestic Silver Corp   AG    DB  We used to  we made a good return on that and moved on  Our main silver holding is Polar Silver  privately held   this company owns a share of a very high grade silver project in Russia  which we re valuing at about  0 25 oz silver  We think we can bring that to market for at least  1 oz  if not more   TGR  Thank you for your insights   David Baker is a managing partner at Baker Steel and heads the company s Sydney  Australia

16989,238504,VALE,Rick Mills  Secret To Making Money Off China s Stealth Metal Demand,opinion,When it comes to supply and demand dynamics  Aheadoftheherd com Publisher Rick Mills does his own math  China may make a show of its alleged copper surplus and Germany may downplay its need for efficient energy sources  but Mills foresees demand spikes in a number of specialty metals  In this interview with The Critical Metals Report  Mills discusses the positions he s establishing while looming supply shortages remain under the mainstream radar  The Critical Metals Report  Let s talk about specialty metals that present opportunities for investors  What s on your radar screen  Rick Mills  There are several metals that we ve taken for granted because the prices are low  such as nickel and uranium  I shake my head that copper is only  3 50 lb  A lot of what s going on in copper can be extrapolated to the other metals as well  Let s start with capital expenditures  or capex  Mining is definitely one of the more capital intensive businesses  There are large  upfront costs for construction of the mine  As the low hanging fruit has been picked  companies have to go off the map to find deposits in remote areas with lower grades and more complex metallurgy  There is little to no infrastructure  so it can cost from  5 billion   5B  to  9B to build today s mine  TCMR  That s true of any metal you might mine  RM  True enough  but some metals are more supply side challenged than others  Operational expenditures are also continually increasing  These are day to day costs of operation wages  tires  fuel and camp costs for employees  The average capital intensity  or the capacity to produce 1 ton  t  copper  for a new mine in 2000 was  4 000 5 000   5K   Today  capital intensity is north of  10K t on average for a new copper project  Some projects that are  5 5B are going to produce 60 000 tons  60 Kt  copper per year  Do the math  capital intensity numbers are scary  Capex costs are escalated because declining copper ore grades mean a much larger relative scale of required mining and milling operations  and a growing portion of mining projects are in remote areas of developing economies where there is little to no existing infrastructure  TCMR  Could the declining growth of China  which is probably the world s largest consumer of copper  be contributing to a slowdown  RM  China recently published figures saying that it has 1 9 million tons  Mt  copper in its inventory  It brought over a bunch of analysts and showed the copper all stacked up  the stacks leaning over and the ground compressing  The analysts came away suitably impressed that China has too much copper when  in fact  nothing could be further from the truth  China has 1 9 Mt copper  About half of that would be in the supply line somewhere  It s going to be used  China usually keeps around 600 Kt as a rainy day fund  The bottom line is China needs 50 Mt copper during the next several years  If you needed that much copper  what would you be doing  What kind of games would you be playing if you knew you had to buy it in the open market  You d be telling everybody that you had way too much  Let s face it  China needs copper  It s going to grow 7 7  this year  It has been growing at an average rate of 9 11  year for 20 years  TCMR  How does an investor capitalize on increasing copper demand and shrinking copper supply  RM  Do you invest in an off the map area in a geopolitically risky country  I don t  There s enough risk in this sector without purposely increasing it  I also want something that s high quality yet small enough that capex and opex are not going to be a killer  I look for a company that turns the negatives  the increased capex opex  the increasing resource nationalism  the increased environmental regulation  etc   into nonexistents  One on my radar is VMS Ventures Inc   VMS TSX V  There s little risk of resource nationalism on the Reed Lake deposit in Canada  Its well funded partner  HudBay Minerals Inc   HBM TSX  HBM NYSE   operates several mines in the area  One of them is going to be closing shortly  so the skilled people will become available  Reed Lake is a high quality deposit  It s underground  but it already has infrastructure in the area  It already has the mill and the processing facility  Financing is not going to be a problem  Permitting is not going to be a problem because most of it is already permitted  The area is a well known mining camp  I don t see any operational issues  There s little risk from environmental groups and or labor  It s an economically attractive project  because the risk has been removed  The cash flow for VMS is about  100 million  M  over the present mine life  It s a very attractive position for investors to start taking as this company is going into production next year  It will pay back its partner HudBay from its first year of production  In 2015  VMS is going to have an enormous amount of money in its coffers  TCMR  Is it still exploring  RM  Yes  the company is exploring the area around the mine and will drill from underground  trying to increase even further the size of the deposit  and VMS will shortly be releasing its winter drill plans on its 100  owned projects  TCMR  VMS  stock is trading at  0 19 with a  23M market cap  To what do you attribute the lag  RM  The best time to buy a junior is when it s still exploring and hope it makes a discovery  or secondly  just before it puts out its first NI 43 101 or just before it goes into production  We re in that period of time now when there is not really a heck of a lot to report  It s that quiet time in front of production and its winter exploration program  TCMR  What other metals are suffering supply shortages  RM  Investors should be looking at nickel  It s present in more than 3 000 different alloys used in more than 300 000 different products  About 65  of nickel is in alloy with chromium and other metals to produce stainless and heat resisting steels  Another 20  is used in noncorrosive and super alloys  About 9  is used in plating and 6  is used for other uses  such as in coins  electronics and nickel hydride batteries in cellular phones  Then there are nickel cadmium batteries to power cordless tools and appliances  The U S  Department of Energy is funding research and development of renewable energy sources  That is expected to expand the use of nickel  It s quite interesting what they re discovering as new uses and increasing the old uses of nickel  Nickel used to be produced from laterite deposits  When the Sudbury sulphide nickel camp was discovered in Canada in the early 1900s  it completely dominated global production  The problem is that nobody is finding those large sulphide deposits anymore  We re going back to laterites  which are big  layered deposits of often a billion tons or more located close to the surface  Unfortunately  they necessitate different metallurgical applications and recovery processes for each zone or layer  The processes have enjoyed a highly mixed performance record and can be extremely expensive  It s a little different for each deposit  A lot of the companies are having major problems with the metallurgy  Because it s lower grade  they have to go with that economy of scale  Because the laterites are caused by weathering of ultramafic rock  they typically occur in equatorial zones  That means that a lot these deposits are located in the sketchier countries that carry heightened geopolitical risk versus the sulphides  which seem to happen in places like Greenland and Canada  The same thing that happened with copper is happening to laterites  with capital intensity shooting through the roof  Here s what s happening to a few of the deposits many are counting on for future global nickel supply  Vale S A  s  VALE NYSE  New Caledonia project  which used to be called Goro  is many years behind schedule  It s almost become the bad boy poster child for problems with one method of nickel mining technologies  HPAL  high pressure acid leach processing   Sumitomo Corp   8053 TKY  SSUMF OTCPK  and Mitsui   Co  Ltd   8031 TKY  have reduced their participation  Vale has problems in its Onca Puma project  It doesn t even have a return of production yet  It shuttered its Frood mine  Xstrata Plc  XTA LSE  has increased the capex at its Koniambo project due to growing labor costs from competition from the oil and gas sector for an extremely limited labor pool on a very remote island  Its first pour was supposed to be earlier this year  but there has been no news from it  Xstrata has closed its Cosmos mine  BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK  has been trimming costs at its Australian operations  Anglo American Plc  AAUK NASDAQ  closed its 17 Kt year Loma de N quel mine due to disputes over mining concessions  TCMR  With mines slowing down or shuttering production  have we seen any increases in the basic commodity price for nickel  RM  The nickel glut is nonexistent and nickel is going to rally  There is no doubt nickel has been the worst performing metal lately  However  BNP Paribas is now forecasting a much smaller than expected supply in 2013  It has cut its projection three times since April  Credit Suisse and Citigroup have lowered their forecasts  They re saying nickel is going to average 15  more in the second quarter than now  TCMR  Where can an investor find companies with deposits that are cheaper to process in areas without jurisdictional and geographic problems  How can an investor participate in the nickel market if there s this kind of a looming shortage  RM  One of the reasons market watchers are paring the supply forecasts is because all of these projects are falling behind schedule  The market balance is much tighter than everybody  except apparently me  has been predicting  There are a lot of operations and capacity that have run into various issues  Investors have to figure out which companies don t have these problems  One that doesn t have these issues is North American Nickel Inc   NAN TSX V   It owns a nearly 80 kilometer trend of historical nickel mineralization in Greenland  It has done a small drill program this year to start to define one of its almost 80 targets and had some very encouraging assays come back  It is going to be able to put together a much larger program and get at it next year  The company is well backed by The Sentient Group and a large institutional player  VMS Ventures owns 26  of its shares and doesn t want to be diluted  financing is not going to be a problem  This is a company in which an investor can start to take a position and slowly increase it  knowing that there is some time to work on it  TCMR  Are there any other metals that you want to talk about today  RM  One that investors are missing the boat on is uranium  TCMR  What s your take on uranium stocks right now  RM  The question is  When do you buy  We talk about this all the time  It s when nobody else is buying  when the herd doesn t love it  That fits uranium pretty well right now  The fact is that investors aren t paying attention to what s going on on the supply side  The demand side is going to increase  Japanese reactors are off line  Germany took its reactors off line almost overnight  Chinese demand slowed as they do some serious safety studies  Fukushima put a dark cloud of negative sentiment over the entire industry  Demand fell through the floor  People were worried  and rightly so  Everybody was watching the spot price  Utilities weren t buying  they were sitting on the sidelines  waiting for prices to come down  China has released its new nuclear energy plans  It has moved toward safety  Any reactors currently under construction will be allowed to continue  but the new reactors will have to use the third generation technology  the European Pressurized Reactor or the AP1000  This is a huge boost for the demand side  China has 12 5 gigawatts  GW  in operation with 26 GW under construction  It wants 40 GW in nuclear power by 2015 and to reach 80 GW by 2020  China is back in the market  Yes  the Germans are going to sell  but now we re finding out that Japan is reopening its nuclear reactors  and I have no doubt it is going to build more  TCMR  And Germany  RM  Germany is totally green washing the world  The monkeyshine coming out of Germany today is off the wall  It is importing more and more nuclear produced electricity from Holland  the Czech Republic and France than it ever was  It touts itself as a poster child for green energy  yet its industry is suffering and leaving in droves because of blackouts or brownouts and the high cost of electricity  Germany is sucking up nuclear generated power  just not from reactors on its own soil  A lot of people don t know that Germany is currently building 23 new coal fired power plants because it is worried about the increasing costs of electricity and its industry leaving  If you can t do business because of brownouts and blackouts  you re going to move to where you can get a steady supply of electricity  Germany opened a  3 4B  2 200 megawatt  MW  coal fired power plant just in August  Instead of the 15 t of carbon dioxide  CO2  the old ones vomited  these new ones  which are 10  more efficient and burn only the cleanest coal ignite  still pump 13 Mt CO2 into the atmosphere  In just one year  this coal burner is going to generate more CO2 than Germany s entire nuclear fleet would have over 20 years  Germany s  green energy  plan doesn t work  the country can t afford to be without nuclear energy and it s very obvious that Japan can t  either  TCMR  Let s talk about uranium companies that you like  Rick  RM  Nuclear power is not going away  In fact  it will increase exponentially  Mine supply is at  40 lb spot price  You need  70 85 lb incentive price to get new mines going  And then it takes 10 years to get a uranium mine up and running  Let s focus on the U S  The U S  uses 55 million pounds  Mlb  uranium per year  It produces 4 Mlb  Where is the U S  going to get its uranium  There are two companies that are going into production right away  I m not going to mention a certain name because I don t like being negative  but one of the companies might not make it  Apparently  there are some sage grouse nests on its property  We re going to save the birds  TCMR  Which one will go into production  RM  The one that s going to make it into production next year is Uranerz Energy Corp   URZ TSX  URZ NYSE MKT  in Wyoming  It is fully permitted  It is building the pads for the first deep disposal well  which should take several months  Then it will need to build a second  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has to do an inspection  Remember  this is the first uranium mine that s been opened in the U S  since 1996  so the NRC s going to be very thorough  It will probably take about a month to complete the inspection  I expect Uranerz  barring any inspection delays  to be in production by the end of July 2013  It has two offtake agreements already signed at a much higher price than spot  It has Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE  doing its processing  It is going to be producing 600 800 Kt year yellow cake  It s in situ leaching and the company is the world s leading expert on it  TCMR  I really enjoyed our conversation  RM  It s been a pleasure  thank you   is the founder  owner and president of Northern Venture Group  which owns

gives way to some relief  A report from Chinese press citing an official with the NDRC has indicated a widely anticipated fiscal package may well be forthcoming shortly  just as Beijing prepares for leadership transition at its 18th Communist Party congress set to start in exactly two weeks  Similarly in Japan  local press noted the government is preparing a  400B stimulus to be approved as early as tomorrow while credit rating agencies fret about its fiscal stand off  Finally  the FOMC decision in US hours was largely a repeat of last month s statement  pledging QE infinity and  exceptionally low levels at least through mid 2015   albeit with an acknowledgement of inflation picking up and household spending  advancing a bit more quickly  In the currency markets  USD JPY and NZD USD were the biggest movers   the former in favor of USD following a warning pertaining to Japan govt unable to agree on deficit covering bonds and the latter after less dovish than expected statement from RBNZ  In sum  2 week highs in NZD USD and a fresh test of the  80 USD JPY handle resulted in NZD JPY cross hitting 6 month highs near the  66 level  Regarding Japan  S P analyst said that further delays in passing deficit financing bill has serious implications for Japan s sovereign debt rating  even if the danger is not immediate  Recall opposition party continues its stand off with the cabinet in search of a more concrete date for PM Noda to dissolve national elections  In New Zealand  RBNZ decision was the first under the leadership of its new governor Wheeler  who added that market sentiment has improved and risks to global outlook more balanced  This was perceived as a departure from his more dovish predecessor who left the door open to more easing in the event of deteriorating conditions  After the decision  New Zealand economic development minister Joyce warned it would be no surprise if economic growth slows in H2  noting the NZD currency is impacted by more than just the cash rate Fixed Income Currencies CommoditiesNZD USD  Extending gains above  0 82 in the wake of RBNZ rate decision  Up about 60 pips AU  S P revised New South Wales long term Outlook to

17047,238562,VALE,The Sky s The Limit In Saskatchewan  Tom MacNeill,opinion,Saskatchewan s unique political history has created a modern day last frontier for exploration  Within its borders is a treasure trove of early stage resources  so many that Tom MacNeill  president and CEO of 49 North Resources  says his Saskatchewan focused natural resources company can t tackle every project it wants to  As an incubator enterprise to raise capital for early stage projects throughout Saskatchewan  MacNeill s company is capitalizing on the build out of capital markets in the province  Read why MacNeill says Saskatchewan is wide open in this exclusive interview with The Gold Report    The Gold Report  Tom  few if any Canadian provinces are booming the way Saskatchewan is  Qu bec used to be Canada s top province for mineral exploration and now some believe the recent election of the Parti Quebecois could curtail resource investment in the province  Is Saskatchewan just an election away from boom to gloom  Tom MacNeill  I seriously doubt that  Saskatchewan is fundamentally different than Qu bec in that Saskatchewan doesn t politicize as many things  More important  a lot of the changes happening under the current Saskatchewan administration were initiated by a left wing government starting with the Roy Romanow and Lorne Calvert Saskatchewan New Democratic Party  NDP  administrations  We ve come out of the dark ages here  We had very left leaning governments that led us on a path to overt nationalization of certain parts of industries in the 1970s  In the 1980s  the pendulum started swinging in the other direction  A big part of the changes with leveling the royalty playing field in oil and gas and becoming friendly to mining development and business started in the 1990s and 2000s under NDP administrations  We don t have any fear that we could go back with a swing in government  That was obvious in the election last fall  Dwain Lingenfelter  the leader of the New Democratic Party at the time  started making noise about creating a Saskatchewan oil and gas company again  using old party rhetoric from the 1970s and 1980s  He was rebuffed even by his own party because things are good here because business is getting done  We re not going to go back  Also  Qu bec didn t have the mandate to change as much as one thinks  Anything the Parti Quebecois wants to do will take budgeting  Since they have a minority government  there will be a confidence vote the first time they try to do anything rash  Their rhetoric is mostly hot air because the party is going to be compromising on a whole range of issues or else it will not be able to govern  We don t have that problem in Saskatchewan  TGR  Do politics play too much of a role in resource development  TMacN  It can play a good role in resource development by staying out of it unless necessary  In the 1970s  we created three of the most detrimental things to our capital market in Saskatchewan history  SaskOil  Saskatchewan Mining Development Corp   the forerunner of Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE   and Potash Corp  of Saskatchewan  PotashCorp   POT TSX  POT NYSE   which was formed in 1975 through legislation  At that time  the government gave itself the right to back into any project it wanted by recouping 50  of the capital costs to the explorers and developers that expended it  The effect was similar to what we see in other jurisdictions that lean that way it scares away external capital  People don t want to deal with government because they feel that it can change the rules at any time  More important  the average taxpayer was burdened with the risk of resource development  Taxpayers were saddled with the risks of the downtimes  The Saskatchewan government jumped headlong into the resource business because resource prices had gone up 400  between 1969 and 1974  It s a very volatile business  as we all know  The commodity cycle goes up and down  By the time it went down  taxpayer dollars were being expended on capital projects and investments that were underwater  TGR  Let s get into a tangible example of politics playing a role in investment in Saskatchewan  In fall 2010  Anglo Australian mining powerhouse BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK  made a bid for Potash Corp  of Saskatchewan  but the bid was killed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper  his conservative government and Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall  Did that send the wrong message to the investment community  TMacN  It probably wasn t helpful from Saskatchewan s perspective  The whole world is getting sensitive about trade barriers and international capital flows and that didn t do us a lot of favors  It didn t particularly hurt us either because we re wide open for business  which is clear  We had the unique situation where a very high profile transaction happened leading into an election year and that really got the fervor going  TGR  Saskatchewan remains fairly top heavy when it comes to publicly traded resource companies  There is Potash Corp   Cameco and not a lot else  Why is that  TMacN  It s a function of our history  Both of those were Crown corporations  Since they ve been unshackled  they have become the best companies in their leagues in the world  As Crown corporations  they were sterilizing the rest of the capital market beneath them because capital fled  Saskatchewan has early stage prospectors and senior mining companies that are absolutely behemoth  but we have no capital market supporting that because our capital market left in the years when socialism was the flavor of the day  Capital markets are just starting to come back  We ve got one investment banking group in Saskatchewan  Jeret Bode and Kevin Thompson at MGI Securities in Saskatoon have done in excess of  500 million  M  in core finance activity  maybe more  in the last few years  There s also 49 North Resources Inc   FNR TSX V   two labor sponsored venture capital funds and Lex Capital Management  which operates a couple of funds out of Regina  That s our entire institutional capital market     still very  very small  We re still living the hangover  However  that hangover is an opportunity that s similar to our neighboring province Alberta a half century ago  There s a big void between the top heavy senior mining companies and the bottom end of the scale where we work  but we re happy to watch that fill up over the coming decades  TGR  You ve been able to take advantage of that paucity of capital  TMacN  We get to deal directly with the majors once we prove something up  We can deal directly with the senior mining companies  All the major ones are in Saskatchewan now  Rio Tinto Plc  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  RIO LSE  RTPPF OTCPK   Vale S A   VALE NYSE  and BHP are all here and looking for the large scale projects that this province is filled with  Our advantage is that there is no one else here doing it  We see everything that s happening on our landscape  Once we get to the point where we ve developed an asset that would be of interest to a large integrated miner or oil and gas enterprise  we can deal with it directly  TGR  Have you had any trouble raising funds  TMacN  We haven t tried in the last two years  We ve been working internally with our own generated cash flow because the capital market has been abysmal  From July 2010 to July 2011  there were about  4 3 billion  B  in financings on the TSX Venture Exchange  The following 12 month period had just  1 2B  We ve been keeping our powder dry waiting for things to turn  We saw a false market bottom in 2010 2011 because the companies had enough money to limp along  That s finally been drained out of the system  TGR  You don t believe we ve seen the bottom  TMacN  We re heading to it now  The most recent bottom was this summer  but things haven t improved enough for me to confidently say it was the bottom  There s too much at play right now  TGR  Are there some tangible financing advantages for a company operating in Saskatchewan  TMacN  There would be some real advantages if there were others besides us  They would have a wide open playing field  We have a backlog of resource projects in our own offices here in Saskatoon  There are reams and reams of projects  We simply cannot develop every high quality project that we see  The Saskatchewan Geological Survey has been around for about 75 years and it does some of the best work in the world to get explorationists a head start  Government is very supportive  We have infrastructure everywhere  It s still wide open here  TGR  Are there any other publicly traded companies that are operating exclusively in Saskatchewan  TMacN  There are very few of those  Typically  a Saskatchewan project is brought into a company that exists with assets elsewhere  We have a large holding in Westcore Energy Ltd   WTR TSX V   a Saskatchewan headquartered company developing coal  It s a long term project with the intention of defining a substantial resource in thermal coal for conversion to crude oil and other high value carbon products  It has a partnership with Quantex Energy Inc  in Calgary  has defined a number of deposits and is in the process of putting together the initial NI 43 101 calculation of the size of the coal deposits it has identified so far  TGR  You re a contrarian investor  What are some recent investments you ve made  TMacN  We haven t made a lot of new investments this year  We ve been trading the companies in our portfolio  We ll continue to buy shares of Tembo Gold Corp   TEM TSX V  TBGPF OTCQX  because it s been so beat up  We buy Westcore Energy when it s been beat up  We have been cultivating the investments that we do have and making sure that those companies have enough cash to keep moving through this dry spell in the capital market to keep projects advancing  That s why we created 49 North  Until we came on the scene  when things got really lousy  companies had nowhere to turn  49 North supplies capital when the times are very lean so the companies within our portfolio can avoid hyper dilution  The companies that are near and dear to us  we care about their health and welfare and can help them with their cash flow by taking a financing down at reasonable prices and they can view that as an untouchable part of their float until markets turn  We re a bit of a lender of last resort or an investor of last resort in the bad times  not just there to exploit things in the good times  TGR  What is Tembo doing  TMacN  It s caught in the crossfire of a downward gold market  However  everything that it s been working on is going as planned it defined a series of new targets  did a broad based exploration program and is now homing in on the Nyakagwe and Ngula targets  which look prospective and are continuations of the structure that comes off of Bulyanhulu  the largest mine in Tanzania  which is owned by African Barrick Gold Plc  ABG LSE   Tembo has been crucified on the back of bad news from other companies in the region  For example  Canaco Resources Inc   CAN TSX V  announced results in May on a resource calculation that was much less than what the market expected  Hana Mining Ltd   HMG TSX V  had the same experience in that the market was very disappointed with the resource calculation on its copper project in Botswana  Investors typically buy in a jurisdiction  If they own Canaco  they were likely to own Tembo  Some institutions said   Whoa  We re getting scared by some of the things that are happening here   Ironically  Hana just received a takeover offer at twice its recent trading price  Things can happen fast  It s the early days for Tembo  It has been doing great work with lots of exploration and drilled many holes  nearly all of which are hitting exactly what one would expect to hit  There are more than 2 000 artisanal miners in more than 100 shafts and lateral workings on the property  mining gold anywhere from 8 50 grams per ton  g t   In this sense there s already an active gold mine on the property  Tembo is drilling underneath where the artisanal workings are and hitting the same type of structural material as Bulyanhulu  and Bulyanhulu typically gets better at depth  TGR  Does it have the cash to drill more holes  TMacN  Tembo is in the midst of a  4M fundraising right now  There isn t a lot of money going around  but there always is money for good projects  In a down market the investment community likes the dust to settle first and then look around to see who s still alive  Tembo is definitely one of those enterprises that is worth paying attention to because once things turn  it should turn quickly  I ve said to Tembo s management that my expectation is that once they put 100 more holes into the project they will probably have proved up the region s next mine  We will continue to buy at these extremely cheap levels and support the company any way that we can as it moves forward  TGR  You recently bought back about 10  of your share float  What s the thinking behind that  TMacN  We renewed our normal course issuer bid because our stock is grossly undervalued  Our stock trades at less than  2 share with a  30M market cap  That s significantly less than the gross value of our oil and gas alone  which we carry at book value  We ve got significant cash flow from our oil and gas operations  We have the ability to farm out to those with deeper pockets because we have so much development land  We end up with a big hunk of free oil for doing that because we ve spent the money upfront derisking it  We re a very deep value play at these prices  Buying our own stock back is one of the best deals out there  TGR  You recently sold CVG Mining Ltd  Tell us about that deal  TMacN  Omineca Mining and Metals Ltd   OMM TSX V   a group that we ve worked with for a very long time  is taking over CVG Mining  Omineca is the product of a spinout from the sale of Copper Canyon Resources to NOVAGOLD  NG TSX  NG NYSE MKT   We were significant institutional investors in Copper Canyon with the resulting sale to NOVAGOLD working out very well for all involved  It s a way to give CVG the profile needed to raise the capital that s necessary for start up  The cash flow should be extraordinary in a short period of time and it likely will take much less than  10M to put into production  Omineca s associations  high quality management team and excellent track record  combined with our connections provide it a number of avenues to raise capital  The group at Omineca is very good  The company is based in British Columbia  has very close connections in industry and government and is familiar with the permitting environment  The project is nearly fully permitted and ready to go  TGR  You have a position in DNI Metals Inc   DNI TSX V  DG7 FSE   which plans to use bioleaching to recover various metals from black shale in Alberta  What s happening with that company now  TMacN  DNI Metals has been doing everything it said it was going to do and has been having great success with it  The initial resource on the Buckton Zone  which is a shale that runs 10 20 meters  m  thick with polymetallic material in it  was defined at 250 million tons  Mt   It also is abundant in rare earth elements  which makes the per ton value very attractive  The LaBiche formation  another black shale that was assumed to be barren cover rock  turned out to have better rare earth element content than the Buckton pay zone  The LaBiche formation is so thick  up to 100m  that it has a multiple of the tonnage of the 250 Mt initial Buckton resource  The company should be able to expand the gross Inferred resource in short order to 3 5 billion tons  Bt  and once all of the work from drilling is processed  likely in 2013  it should be able to report on a resource of about 5 Bt  Let s look at the metrics  5 Bt of  30 rock  maybe even  50 rock with scandium credits  and costs of  5 15 ton based on other projects like Talvivaara in Finland  creates a profit somewhere around  20 ton  It costs about  1B to build the plant  Even if it only profits  10 ton and metals prices stay where they are  there s  50B in potential profit sitting in the ground  TGR  Why isn t the project getting more attention  TMacN  People don t understand it  In 1967  when Suncor Energy Inc  s  SU TSX  SU NYSE  first operating mine started processing bitumen into synthetic crude oil  they cracked the champagne bottle  But the oil sands were misunderstood by the investment community  It took a long time  Quite frankly  it was not until the late 1990s that the international investment community perked up to what was going on there  It s a process     given the success of the oil sands  the timeline for DNI Metals should be much shorter  DNI Metals has been doing a great job of going through all of the scientific work  making sure that it is professional  confirming and reconfirming that drilling is where it needs to be  The preliminary economic assessment  PEA  is underway  The company should be able to finish up the processing work on the drilling that s been done so far very shortly  It is striving to hit a 5 Bt resource at grades that should provide rock values in the  30 50 ton range  This suggests an enormous quantity of profit in the ground that is an analog to the neighboring oil sands mining that started 40 years ago  The beautiful thing for DNI Metals is all of the roads  power  manpower  infrastructure and experience with strip mining in the area it s all there  DNI Metals is a small junior exploration company that doesn t spend its budget on beating its drum  It spends it on good science and that s good for us because we love massive resources that are being developed at low costs  It will catch on  TGR  Investors want something that s more near term  maybe  TMacN  This is very near term  DNI Metals is going to have a PEA and a resource calculation that s huge  The next steps will be to either finance its way into or partner up for a test facility  If you do good science  you end up with good projects  and then the capital market comes knocking  TGR  When we spoke in February you said that it would take a few more years to see where the macroeconomic policy of the world s financial leaders takes us  but that it would ultimately prove positive for gold  Is that picture any clearer now  TMacN  It s not a lot clearer because there hasn t been much traction in world economies  Central bankers are going to keep their foot on the gas pedal until the car fires  If you ve ever owned a car that s carbureted  during a cold winter you go out and try to start it by pumping the pedal a couple of times  That s the first round of quantitative easing  QE   But it doesn t start  so you try it again  You pump it a few more times and it fires  but it stalls out  That is QE2  So  you put your foot right to the floor  You hold the choke all the way open until it fires and when it fires it runs a like a son of a gun because there s so much fuel coming through it and you can t even contain the revving for a while  even when you take your foot off the gas  That s QE3  Central bankers have said that they re going to hold the gas pedal all the way down until the car starts  Great  because you will  at some point  have a period of inflation that cannot be contained no matter how much they try  All of this macroeconomic QE is likely to result in inflation at some point  which is going to be very good for gold  Let s say that all of this macroeconomic QE doesn t cause rampant inflation  but instead sticks the way the central bankers want and that it creates real economic growth  That s going to be good for oil because it s at supply demand capacity right now and an expanding economy on the back of QE will drive up the price of oil  That is going to be inflationary  There will be a follow on that will bring the price of gold up  Oil trading volume is up 25  in the last quarter  which means that institutions and investment bankers are trading it as if it were just another financial asset  That adds volatility to it  We ve seen oil go up to  110 barrel  bbl  and down to  79 bbl in the last 12 months  and then back and forth and anywhere in between  That means the world doesn t know which way it s going yet  TGR  Are you more bullish on Saskatchewan or gold  TMacN  I can predict Saskatchewan a little bit better than I can predict the price of gold  We re going to do fine because we re in the very early stages of economic development in Saskatchewan  Saskatchewan is going to do great over a very long period  However  there are likely going to be much higher gold prices very quickly  There s too much implied risk in the system and too much desire for competitive currency devaluation worldwide in order to get rid of debt on government balance sheets  It s coming  I will not predict when because things are too volatile at this stage but we can see those clouds on the horizon  TGR  Thanks  Tom   established 49 North

17048,238563,VALE,Vale  Jacques Barzun ,opinion,The wonderful French born but long since Americanized scholar Jacques Barzun died last week  October 25  2012  roughly a month short of what would have been his 105th birthday  I won t write him an obituary  Many fine samples of that craft are available  Here is a link to one from The New York Times that gives the basics of his long career in the world of  What follows is  rather  my own unauthorized summary of his leading ideas  and a reflection  Barzun was a Romanticist  He thought that the pinnacle of western civilization had been the Romantic era of the early and mid 19th century  The characteristic biology of this great period was that of Lamarck and Goethe  which acknowledged the transformation of species and saw it as a vitalistic  even a spiritual  development  the characteristic social philosophy was that of the French utopian thinkers  Barzun called them  eutopians   because the mere addition of an  e  changes the literal meaning from  advocates of no place  to  advocates of the good place  without even changing the pronunciation   the characteristic music was that of Beethoven and  after him  of Berlioz  But then  in the late 1850s  came a terrible turn  Three events in the world of art and ideas in those years that are often considered separately  that are always taught separately  were in fact intimately connected  Mechanism  scientism in the name of science  took over each of these three fields just described  Barzun wrote a short book called   1941   in order to express this interconnection  Survival of the fittest became the predominant explanation of the transformation of species  an inevitable and materialistic dialectic was installed at the center of social philosophy  and the making combining of atomic  motifs  became the key to operatic music under the tutelage of those respective figures In recent years  a disproportionate number of Barzun s admirers have been political conservatives  They admire the fact that he helped establish what is now known as the  core curriculum  in US colleges  They admire his devotion to the canon of Great Books and great musical artistic achievements  They see the nostalgic elements in his thought as akin to their own  And of course they respond to his unhappiness with Marxism and its rise to prominence But   Barzun himself was never a political conservative  I had the honor of corresponding with him for a period in the early 1990s  and I pressed him a bit on social political philosophy  I learned that his admiration for pre Marxist socialists like Saint Simon and Robert Owens was genuine  not simply a foil for his opposition to Marx  Thus  in no narrow literal sense was he a natural ally either for the sort of conservatives who often admired his works or  and this was my situation at the time  for a libertarian working his way toward a Rothbardian anarcho capitalism Still  the amount of time he would take to answer the letters of an unknown like myself was itself astonishing  and in both these letters and his published work he displayed a remarkable energetic and wide ranging mind  whence one could not help but learn if one was simply open to it The worries of this world are behind him now  What remains is his influence  which will surely grow for a long time to come For myself  I remember in particular a bit of advice he gave me in 1993  After reviewing something I had recently written  he said   the strength of your case consists in analysis  not remonstrance or objurgation   I have since striven to stick to the former  and excise the latter ,2012-10-30,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vale:-jacques-barzun-141630,141630

17050,238565,VALE,Vedanta Resources  Bidding To Join The Big Boys,opinion,Not all miners are the same  obviously  but not all miners should be viewed as equivalent even when weighted for size Take Vedanta Resources   London listed  but almost 60 percent owned by its founder  Anil Agarwal Agarwal s avowed aim is for Vedanta to be viewed like Rio Tinto  BHP Billiton or Vale  On the face of it  the firm is well on the way  ranking 7th in the world among mining giants according to the Telegraph and with operations in today s metal prices   MetalMiner IndXaluminum  copper  coal  zinc  gold  iron ore and oil spread across four continents So why are its shares trading at only three times earnings and the firm s status as a top FTSE 100 listing said to be under review by the UK Financial Services Authority In large part  the firm is a victim of its own opaque structure   some would say a legacy of its growth strategy in a state dominated business environment  others would suggest it has more to do with deliberately obfuscating the extent of real ownership in its declared assets Wacky Structure  Controlling SharesFirstly the structure  Vedanta has some 99 principal subsidiaries  but doesn t own any of them outright  Indeed  last year only some 5 percent of profits were attributable solely to Vedanta  95 percent are said to be attributable to other parties Likewise a  60 million   96 million  dividend was paid to parent company holders  but  144 million   230 million  was paid to other parties  Agarwal s near 60 percent shareholding is in turn held in Bermuda  an offshore tax haven  under the name of Volcan Investments The most worrying aspect is probably that Vedanta does not hold a controlling share in many of these subsidiary companies  Last year  Vedanta said its  non controlling interests   or the proportion of the company s assets that are in fact owned by someone else  amounted to 59 percent of the company  In the latest report and accounts  filed in March  non controlling interests soared to 75 percent of the company So as the Telegraph explains  although Vedanta claims to have assets of  18 4 billion  shareholders in the parent company own just  4 7 billion Explanation  PleaseYou may reasonably ask how such a position could come about  Well  one explanation is Vedanta has acquired many of its domestic assets from partial privatizations made by the Indian state  companies such as Hindustan Zinc and Bharat Aluminum are still partially state owned Others like Sesa Goa  the iron ore producer  are stock market listed and Vedanta controls some 57 percent of the shares  Vedanta is in effect more of a holding company for Agarwal s personal investments  admittedly with considerable management control over its investments  than it is a miner in the sense that Vale or BHP are Moves to consolidate the structure are said by the firm to be hampered by the need for Indian government approval  but critics say this has been a problem for years and only in recent months has the firm taken any action In the meantime  Vedanta will continue to be viewed  particularly in a risk off environment when scrutiny and caution are greater  as more like London listed Kazakhstan miner ENRC and Indonesian Bumi Resources  and its share price will reflect the lower level of investor confidence in its structure and hence governance By Stuart Burns,2012-11-11,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vedanta-resources:-bidding-to-join-the-big-boys-142925,142925
17051,238566,VALE,Management Team Assembled To Advance World Class Platinum Discovery  ,opinion,Precious metals such as gold and silver are good investments to hedge against the coming hyper inflation but a couple of weeks ago we told our readers that platinum may soar more Platinum is thirty times rarer than gold  yet it is trading at a discount right now  However  this historic bargain situation may not last long as the current supply is under pressure from rising costs in South Africa as the easy  nearer to surface metal supply has already been mined  Demand for platinum is soaring  not only as a precious metal but in industry as it is used in cars  high tech  medicine and jewelry We like gold and silver here as we believe the prices are headed higher  but are even more excited by platinum  which we believe could outperform The recent labor turmoil and violence in South Africa which boosted the platinum price may be just the beginning of a major price spike  South Africa supplies over 75  of the world s platinum and they may be running out as the mines are getting more dangerous and costs are escalating rapidly  The precious metal is more difficult to extract and mine than gold and silver Annual platinum production is less than ten percent of annual gold production  Platinum over the last thirty years has traded at an average 30  premium to the price of gold  Now the price of platinum has deviated from the mean as it trades at a discount to gold  This is a rare and historic anomaly  which will not last forever We believe the trend in precious metals will continue higher with the possibility of platinum outperforming as the price returns to historic premiums in comparison to gold  When Russia curbed its palladium exports in 2000  prices spiked from  150 to over a  1000 an ounce  Russia  Zimbabwe and South Africa control over 90  of global platinum supply and these are not exactly the most stable jurisdictions  A price spike could occur again  which could benefit some of the undeveloped mining projects in North America The large mining companies may begin acquiring undervalued platinum companies developing projects in mining friendly North America  Platinum discoveries are extremely rare One of these unique world class discoveries in North America is Prophecy Platinum s  NKL V or PNIKF  Wellgreen Deposit which recently announced a Preliminary Economic Assessment showing robust economics of a  2 4 billion NPV  The company has signed an exploration agreement with the First Nations and recently released a positive metallurgical studies   has a very large resource of nickel and Platinum Group Metals with the lowest cash costs compared to the other top 5 undeveloped nickel sulphide projects  Wellgreen is right near the paved Alaskan Highway  The nickel content covers the costs and the PGM content provides the upside  Wellgreen could be one of the lowest operating nickel projects once it comes into production  Annual platinum production is about 13 million ounces  with only 1 million coming from North America  Wellgreen could one day provide up to 20  of North American supply  The company assembled a 17 5 km district where there are extensive occurrences with limited drilling  The existing resource only covers around 2 km of the district  Over 80  has not yet been explored  The management team believes that there is additional exploration upside Investors should be cautioned that there still needs to be a lot of work on the property as they move into the pre feasibility study  The company is making rapid progress and has strengthened its management team this November to move forward to production with the hiring of Greg Johnson as CEO  John Sagman as Chief Operating Officer  Jeff Mason as Chief Financial Officer and Samir Patel as Corporate Secretary Prophecy Platinum s new CEO Greg Johnson was an instrumental force behind Novagold where he took the company from a  50 million market cap to over  2 billion  Mr  Johnson was a key player in the advancement of the 40 million ounce Donlin Creek gold deposit in Alaska In addition  the new COO  Mr  Sagman has thirty years under his belt of designing mines  Most recently he led the Prefeasibility studies at the Capstone s Minto copper gold mine  Mr  Sagman knows the terrain as the Minto mine is located approximately 150km northeast from Prophecy s Wellgreen deposit in the Yukon and he knows production as Minto produced 37 million pounds of copper in 2011  In addition to the Minto Copper Mine  Sagman has built nickel mines and published feasibility studies for Vale Inc  Xstrata and Placer Dome This is a major achievement for Prophecy to attract this type of management talent with proven experience  They now may have the capability to build and successfully operate the next major nickel PGM in North America  As the CEO stated in their most recent news release    we are putting in place a highly experienced management team to advance the development of the world class Wellgreen PGM Cu Ni project in the Yukon  Despite a new managerial team that is highly capable of taking the project into production and a published PEA with a  2 4 billion NPV  Prophecy Platinum is trading at multi year lows  below the average prices paid by management  insiders and funds  We could be forming a major bottom here as the new management team has been assembled to advance this world class asset and take this project forward Disclosure  Author or Family of Author May Own Equity Position Below you may find the video

17072,238587,VALE,By 2015 Hard Commodity Prices Will Have Collapsed,opinion,For the past two years  as regular readers know  I have been bearish on hard commodities  Prices may have dropped substantially from their peaks during this time  but I don t think the bear market is over  I think we still have a very long way to go  There are four reasons why I expect prices to drop a lot more  First  during the last decade commodity producers were caught by surprise by the surge in demand  Their belated response was to ramp up production dramatically  but since there is a long lead time between intention and supply  for the next several years we will continue to experience rapid growth in supply  As an aside  in my many talks to different groups of investors and boards of directors it has been my impression that commodity producers have been the slowest at understanding the full implications of a Chinese rebalancing  and I would suggest that in many cases they still have not caught on  Second  almost all the increase in demand in the past twenty years  which in practice occurred mostly in the past decade  can be explained as the consequence of the incredibly unbalanced growth process in China  But as even the most exuberant of China bulls now recognize  China s economic growth is slowing and I expect it to decline a lot more in the next few years  Third  and more importantly  as China s economy rebalances towards a much more sustainable form of growth  this will automatically make Chinese growth much less commodity intensive  It doesn t matter whether you agree or disagree with my expectations of further economic slowing  Even if China is miraculously able to regain growth rates of 10 11  annually  a rebalancing economy will demand much less in the way of hard commodities  And fourth  surging Chinese hard commodity purchases in the past few years supplied not just growing domestic needs but also rapidly growing inventory  The result is that inventory levels in China are much too high to support what growth in demand there will be over the next few years  and I expect Chinese in some cases to be net sellers  not net buyers  of a number of commodities  This combination of factors   rising supply  dropping demand  and lots of inventory to work off   all but guarantee that the prices of hard commodities will collapse  I expect that certain commodities  like copper  will drop by 50  or more in the next two to three years  Not everyone agrees  In the July 17  entry I made a reference to a book by Dambisa Moyo  a former investment banker turned economic writer  called Winner Take All  in which the author argues that the world is facing a crisis in the form of a commodity shortage  and she expects prices to surge  Unlike her  however  I expect the price of hard commodities and certain industry related soft commodities  like rubber  to drop sharply in the next three years  and to stay low for many years thereafter  To address the first of the four reasons I expect hard commodity prices to drop  excess growth in supply  one month ago I spoke at a conference in Sydney  after which Gerard Minack  chief economist at Morgan Stanley Australia  gave a presentation on the world economy and  more specifically  on commodities  His presentation was an eye opener for me  Based on my many trips in recent years to places like Australia  Peru and Brazil  I had plenty of anecdotal reasons to believe that commodity producers had significantly overestimated the sustainability of the Chinese growth model  or  perhaps more accurately  had not really thought about whether or not it was sustainable   I was worried that they were expanding production very quickly  Everywhere I went I heard stories of large scale investments to expand production  Many producers have acknowledged recent price declines  but they seem to believe that these are likely to be short lived and that prices will soon rebound when Chinese demand returns   For example the Financial Times  Alphaville quotes Nev Power  chief executive of Fortescue Metals  discussing iron ore at a recent meeting  Iron ore prices have slumped to  US104 a tonne in recent days  yet Mr Power said it could soon rebound as high as  US150   As soon as restocking and production returns to normal we expect to see prices back in the  US120 to  US150 per tonne range   he said  Production capacity has grown He will almost certainly be wrong  But whereas my evidence for claiming continued high growth rates in production was conceptual and anecdotal  Minack has actually gone out and tried to measure the potential increase in supply  Minacks  argument is that because of twenty years of stable or falling prices  until the early part of the last decade there had been a minimal amount of investment globally into commodity producing facilities  Commodities seemed to be in a permanent slump and no one was interested in expanding supply  The surge in Chinese demand at the beginning of the last decade consequently caught everyone by surprise  Minack shows  for example  that in the past twenty years  global demand for steel grew by roughly 6  a year  with most of that coming in the past decade  If you exclude China  however  global demand for steel grew by only 2  a year in the past twenty years  implying that China accounted for almost all the increase in global demand in the last twenty years   and almost all of that occurred in the past decade  In the past ten years Chinese demand for iron ore has grown by 16  a year on average  The initial surge in demand caught commodity producers off guard  Because they were unable to ramp up production quickly enough  prices surged  After a few years of high prices  however  commodity producers responded to the huge new increase in demand by planning major expansions in production facilities  Changing production requires years of exploration  investment  and upgrading  however  so the decision to increase production could only result in higher production many years later  This is shown by a set of cost curves  which are at the heart of Minack s presentations  and these curves graph the short term relationship between price and volume  For any given amount of demand  in other words  the graph showed the corresponding price  The supply curves  of course  are positively sloped   the higher the price of copper  for example  the more copper will be produced and sold  The slopes of the curves  furthermore  are very sensitive to existing production capacity  and Minack lists curves for several points in time as production capacity changes  As one would expect  when demand for copper is less than production capacity the curves slope gently upwards  implying that small increases in copper prices correspond to very large increases in copper supply  But this curve slopes gently upwards only up to a point  representing the limits of normal production capacity  after which the slope of the curve is almost vertical  Beyond this point   of maximum capacity   no matter how high the price of copper  in the short term supply cannot be substantially increased  Or to put it another way  beyond that point small increases in demand translate into large increases in price  In 2001  according to Minack s numbers  this transition point for copper was roughly 12 million tons  above which it would be extremely difficult for copper producers to supply demand except at extremely high prices  There was some improvement in capacity during this time but not much  By 2004 this same inflection point had increased only slightly  to roughly 13 million tons  This  as Minack pointed out  reinforces the argument that copper producers were not expecting any significant increase in demand and so had not prepared for it  But by 2004 5 it was increasingly evident that demand was rising quickly  Copper producers responded  and thanks to increased investment in countries like Peru and Chile  among others  production capacity surged  By 2018 the inflection point is projected to be at roughly 21 million tons  suggesting that between 2004 and 2018 an enormous amount of additional copper production has become or is going to become available  In his July 17  Down Under  note  Minack goes on to say  What s notable  in my view  is the forecast increase in supply versus the actual supply increases seen over the past decade  For copper  the increase in global supply in each of the next seven years will be roughly equal to the increase in supply over the decade to 2011  Consequently  it would require a material acceleration in demand to keep prices at current levels in the face of this supply increase  The same story is more or less true for iron ore  although the expansion is supply has been more dramatic  In 2006  according to Minack s numbers  the inflection point was at roughly 900 million tons  above which iron ore producers would have difficulty supplying demand  By 2011 it was at 1 300 million tons and by 2014 and 2020 it is expected to be1 900 million and 2 600 million tons respectively  In just over ten years  in other words  production capacity will have nearly tripled  This is a lot of iron that has to be absorbed by someone  The supply considerations are exacerbated by the amount of stockpiling taking place in China  I won t rehash all my arguments from earlier newsletters about stockpiling but it is enough  I think  simply to list some of the articles I found in my daily readings last week  Stockpiling The first  came on Tuesday from Bloomberg  Cotton consumption in China  the world s largest user  may shrink 11 percent this year as a deteriorating economy hurts demand and causes a buildup in commodities  according to Weiqiao Textile Co   Coal inventories at Qinhuangdao port rose to 9 33 million tons on June 17  the highest since 2008  data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association showed  Stockpiles were at 6 69 million tons as of Aug  19  While steel product stockpiles at the nation s 26 major markets have dropped for five months as the end of July  they re still 19 percent higher this year  according to the China Iron   Steel Association  Commodity related companies have flagged their concern  Noble Group Ltd   NOBL    s biggest listed commodity supplier  expects a tough environment for the next 12 to 24 months  Chief Executive Officer Yusuf Alireza said yesterday  Vale SA  VALE5   the world s largest iron ore producer  said this month that China s so called golden years are gone as economic growth slows  The  in Tuesday s Financial Times talks about excess inventory of a wide variety of products and refers to an earlier article  from July  that claims that China s coal inventory is up 50  from last year  Memories of the London Olympics are already beginning to fade  Li Ning  a Chinese sportswear maker  had better hope that they last a while longer  Like thousands of Chinese companies from property developers to car manufacturers  Li Ning is sitting on a mountain of unsold products  Whether they can whittle down these bulging inventories is the single most important question facing corporate China and arguably the economy as a whole   The problems of Li Ning and the sportswear industry are just the tip of the iceberg in China  Across virtually all corporate sectors  inventories are excessive  The stock of unsold homes is the most worrying  because property plays such a dominant role in the economy  Vanke  the country s biggest developer  estimates that it would take about 10 months to absorb all the unsold homes in China  which is reasonably quick  The snag is that this figure doesn t count the millions of homes that have been sold but are sitting empty  Then there is the auto sector  Car sales have been remarkably resilient despite the economic slowdown  But manufacturers have been more bullish than consumers  The inventory index  inventories divided by sales  was 1 98 at the end of June  according to industry data  More than 1 5 is seen as critically high  The unsold mountains of electronics and white goods are also looking Himalayan in scale  Over the past week  the country s main retailers descended into a price war  It began when online retailer  vowed that it would sell home appliances at a zero profit margin   The commodities sector is also dealing with a huge inventory overhang  most graphically in the piles of coal that have built up at ports across the country  In an  one day later from the South China Morning Post  the concern is about copper  At first glance  China s copper demand is soaring  According to Ross Strachan  commodities analyst at independent research house Capital Economics  if you add domestic production of refined copper to China s imports and changes to official stockpiles  then it appears that copper consumption leapt 22 per cent in the first seven months of 2012 compared with the same period last year  But if you look at the volume of copper products actually turned out by China s factories   pipes for air conditioners  windings for electrical transformers  foil for circuit boards and the like   then output was flat in July compared with a year earlier  see the second chart   Weak output makes sense  Together  manufacturing industries  home appliances and the construction sector accounted for half of China s copper consumption last year  With economic growth now slowing and property investment weak  demand is bound to be soft  Analysts at Credit Suisse expect China s copper usage to grow by just 2 per cent this year and 1 per cent in 2013  in contrast to the 26 per cent growth seen at the height of China s stimulus effort in 2009  This gaping discrepancy between apparent demand and actual consumption implies there has been a massive build up in unreported stocks of refined copper held in bonded warehouses and elsewhere  Strachan at Capital economics believes these stockpiles have climbed by 900 000 tonnes since the middle of last year  Standard Chartered puts the total amount held in bonded warehouses at 600 000 tonnes  together with another 400 000 held elsewhere  To put these figures into perspective  the LME s worldwide network of warehouses reports copper stocks of just 231 000 tonnes  In other words  China is sitting on a huge overhang of refined copper  This partly reflects state corporations  efforts to build strategic reserves of the metal  But it is also the result of massive speculation in copper  The details of the trade are complex  But in a nutshell  companies buy copper on margin  then use the metal as collateral to obtain low cost loans  using the proceeds to bet on higher yielding assets  Not just the raw stuff And just one day later I saw this  in Bloomberg  Rubber is poised to drop as sustained supplies from Southeast Asia and falling demand from China s tiremakers push stockpiles to match their record at Qingdao port  the main shipment hub  an industry executive said  Futures fell for the first time in four days  Inventories in the bonded zone  where traders store deliveries before paying duties  will probably climb to 250 000 metric tons by end August from 240 000 tons last week  Li Xiangou  chairman at the Qingdao International Rubber Exchange Market  said in an Aug  17 interview  China accounts for 33 percent of global demand and tires represent 70 percent of natural rubber consumption in the country  Reserves last reached 250 000 tons in mid January  he said  The article goes on to quote one Chinese rubber trader as saying  Many Chinese tire makers are mired in high inventories of end products right now   I can easily cite many more articles  but as this short roundup suggests  finding articles about huge stockpiles in China is a pretty easy game to play  This shouldn t come as a surprise and indeed I have been discussing this for the past three or four years  When financing costs are low or even negative in any economy  there is a tendency to accumulate inventory since it is not only easy to finance but  thanks to low or negative financing costs  it can also be extremely profitable  If prices just keep up with inflation  inventory earns a profit  and the greater the pile  the greater the profit  In addition in the past decade as China s trade relationship with the rest of the world has expanded and as China s economy has grown  most Chinese businesses have only experienced rising prices   both for commodities and many kinds of goods  As a result firms that tended to hold high inventory have outperformed firms that haven t  This has created a selection process that favors accumulation  Companies that prefer to hold more  rather than less  inventory of commodities and goods in which commodities are a high cost component have outperformed their rivals  and so the whole market has moved towards a preference for stockpiling  much in the same way that  according to Hyman Minsky  periods of stable or rising asset prices force the financial system into taking on excessive risk  Since overstocking has always been a winning strategy until very recently  it is a pretty safe bet to assume that Chinese traders  speculators  end users and investors have a built in prejudice towards being long or longer inventory  The overstocking problem in part has also had to do with financing constraints  In late 2010 and early 2011 in this newsletter I wrote often about commodity inventory financing as a popular tactic among Chinese businesses and banks aimed at getting around regulatory constraints on lending  By importing commodities that were funded through trade financing and then using inventory receipts to borrow domestically  banks and borrowers could get around lending restrictions  We have never been able to figure out exactly how much of this was going on  but there was plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that this was a pretty wide spread scheme and it involved a variety of commodities   copper  most famously  but also soy  magnesium  cotton  rubber and several others  Finally  I should add that in China there is  more than in any other country I know  a sense that physical ownership of commodities or of commodity producing facilities creates substantial intangible benefits  This may be a legacy of Maoist perceptions of self sufficiency  or it may have to do with a history of unstable political and monetary arrangements  but whatever the reason Chinese are often obsessed with the need for physical control of commodities  The result has been a tendency to hold much larger commodity inventories than can be justified by business needs and risk management concerns  By the way when economists try to calculate the amount of unsold inventory of commodities they typically focus on the raw commodity  but it is important to remember that inventories of finished goods are also forms of raw inventory  An empty apartment  for example  contains lots of copper wiring  and although it is extremely unlikely that the copper will ever be melted down and sold  it nonetheless has the same price effect as unsold copper inventory  Why  Because an empty apartment today is one less apartment that will be built tomorrow to fill real demand  and so it represents a reduction in the future amount of copper that will be purchased to make copper wire  The same is true of other finished goods  What about demand  China currently is the leading consumer of a wide variety of commodities wholly disproportionate to its share of global GDP  The country represents roughly 11  of global GDP if you accept the stated numbers  and substantially less if you believe  as I do  that growth has been overstated because of the difference over many years between reported investment  i e  its input value  and the actual economic value of output  China nonetheless accounts for between 30  and 40  of total global demand for commodities like copper and nearly 60  of total global demand for commodities like cement and iron ore  The only reason China has provided such an extraordinarily disproportionate share of global demand for hard commodities has been the nature of China s growth model  While China may represent only 11  or less of the global economy  it represents a far  far greater share of the world s building of bridges  railroad lines  subway systems  skyscrapers  port facilities  dams  shipbuilding facilities  highways  and so on  Over the next decade  two things are going to change  The first is increasingly recognized  and that is that Chinese growth rates will drop sharply  The second is that China will rebalance its economic growth away from its appetite for commodities  The consensus on expected economic growth among Chinese and foreign economist living in China has already declined sharply in the past few years  From 8 10  just two years ago  the consensus for average growth rates in China over the next decade has dropped to 5 7   But the historical precedents suggest we should be wary even of these lower estimates  Throughout the last 100 years countries that have enjoyed investment driven growth miracles have always had much more difficult adjustments than even the greatest skeptics had predicted  After all  there were many Brazilians in the late 1970s who worried that Brazil s growth miracle was unsustainable and would end badly  but none expected negative growth for a decade  which is what happened during the terrible Lost Decade of the 1980s  Towards the end of the 1980s  to take another example  a few brave skeptics proclaimed that the Japanese miracle was dead and predicted that for the next five or ten years average Japanese growth rates would slow to 3 or 4   in 1994 the IMF belatedly proclaimed that Japan s long term growth rate had dropped to 4    but no one  even the most skeptical  predicted twenty years of growth below 1 percent  Finally when the USSR s economy was hurtling forward in the 1950s and 1960s  and expected to overtake the US within a few decades  even the most die hard anti communists did not expect the virtual collapse of the economy in the 1970s and 1980s  Similarly  the current consensus for Chinese growth over the next decade is almost certainly too high  Even if Beijing is able to keep household income growing at the same pace it has grown during the past decade  when Chinese and global conditions were as good as they ever could be  it will prove almost impossible for the economy to rebalance at average GDP growth rates over the next decade of much above 3 percent  This 3  average will not be distributed evenly  of course  and we should expect higher growth rates at the beginning of the period  perhaps 5 6 percent over the next two years  and lower growth rates towards the end  But as this happens  over the next two years the consensus on China s long term growth rate will continue to drop sharply  and this will further affect commodity prices  But even this underestimates the change in demand for commodities  For thirty years  and especially for the past ten years  China s extraordinary GDP growth was driven by even higher rates of investment growth   generating for China the highest investment rates and investment growth rates in history  Consumption growth failed to keep pace during this time  But rebalancing means  by definition  that for the next few years consumption growth must outpace GDP growth  and so also by definition investment growth must be less than GDP growth  Even if China is able to achieve 5 7  growth rates over the next decade  which I think is almost impossible  this implies that consumption growth will rise to 7 10  annually  and so from 25  growth in the last few years Beijing will be able to allow investment to grow no more than 2 4  annually  and much less if GDP growth rates are as low as I expect  Which way can prices go  For these reasons I am very pessimistic about hard commodity prices and expect them to drop substantially further in the next two to three years  Production capacity for hard commodities is rising much too quickly  in a belated response to the unexpected surge in demand just under a decade ago Expected economic growth rates in the country that has been biggest source of new demand   virtually the only source   have fallen sharply and commodity prices have fallen with them  Historical precedents and the arithmetic of rebalancing suggest  however  that the current consensus for medium term Chinese growth is still too optimistic  Expected growth rates will almost certainly fall further in the next two years Beijing has finally become serious about rebalancing China s economy  and rebalancing means shifting Chinese growth away from being disproportionately commodity intensive  Instead of representing 30 60  of global demand for most hard commodities  Chinese demand will shift to a more  normal  level  Remember that even a very limited shift   from 50  of global demand  for example  to a still high 40  of global demand   represents a sharp drop in global demand There has been so much stockpiling of commodities and finished goods with implicit commodity content in China that the country could well become a net seller  and not net a buyer  of a wide variety of commodities in the next few years This is going to come as a shock to many people   In my discussions with senior officials in the commodity sectors in Brazil  Australia  Peru  Chile and even Indonesia  it seems to me that many analysts have been insufficiently skeptical about the Chinese growth model and are unaware of how dramatically the consensus has changed in the past two years  They have failed to understand how deep China s structural problems are and how worried Beijing has become  this worry may be best exemplified by the extraordinary growth in flight capital from China since early 2010   Under these conditions I don t see how we can avoid a very nasty two or three years ahead for commodity producers  This isn t all bad news  of course  What will be a disaster for hard commodity producers will be great news for companies and countries that are commodity users or importers  One way or the other  however  we are going see a big change in the distribution of winners and losers This is an abbreviated version of the newsletter that went out three weeks ago  Academics  journalists  and government and NGO officials who want to subscribe to the newsletter

218596,440112,VALE,Can Value Investors Consider Vale  VALE  Stock Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Vale S A    NYSE VALE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Vale has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 97  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 63  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Vale s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 7 15 the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 13  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Vale has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 37  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Vale has a P S ratio of about 1 65  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 4 01x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Vale currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Vale a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 66  which is far better than the industry average of 5 44  Clearly  VALE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Vale might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A  This gives VALE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been robust at best  The current quarter has seen one estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period  This has had just a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below VALE S A  Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat solid trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineVale is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 44  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Mining   Iron industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2019  while the S P 500 gained

218597,440113,VALE,Vale s 2019 Iron Output Drops 22  Due To Brumadinho Disaster,opinion,Vale S A  s   NYSE VALE   latest report reveals that production declined for all metals barring gold  While the Brumadinho disaster and its aftermath impacted iron ore production for the company  weather and maintenance at the Uricum mine put pressure on the manganese production  Nickel production was lower owing to maintenance shutdowns  while lower production hurt copper production 2019 iron ore production plunged 21 5  on a year over year basis to 302 Mt  primarily due to the operational disruption  This was preceded by the Brumadinho disaster and stronger than usual weather related seasonality in the first half of 2019  Sales volumes of iron ore fines and pellets were 312 5 Mt in 2019  in line with the company s guidance of 307 312 Mt In the fourth quarter  Vale s iron ore fines production came in at 78 3 Mt in the fourth quarter  9 6  lower than the prior quarter  primarily due to unscheduled maintenance stoppages carried out at Northern range s crushers and beneficiation plant  Further  suspension of tailings disposal at the Itabiru u and Laranjeiras dams  sourced by the Concei  o and Brucutu plants  respectively  while the dams  geotechnical characteristics were being assessed  led to the downfall   Vale s iron ore fines and pellets sales amounted to 88 9 Mt in the fourth quarter  4 4  higher sequentially Nickel  Manganese   Copper Production Down in 2019Finished nickel production totaled 208 kt in 2019  down 15  from 2018 mainly due to reduced feed from third parties  lower source ore from Thompson and VNC  Operations had also been impacted due to maintenance shutdowns at the refineries  These operations have been resumed and are now operating at regular rates  Nickel sales were at 205 7 kt  down 13  year over year due to lower production levels In the fourth quarter  nickel production reached 56 7 kt in 4Q19  10 3  higher sequentially primarily due to resumption of regular production at On a Puma and the ramp up in production at the Copper Cliff and Clydach refineries after maintenance activities  In the fourth quarter  nickel sales came in at 47 kt  down 7 7  sequentially owing to management s decision to retain inventory awaiting better market conditions Copper production was at 90 3Kt in the fourth quarter  8 5  lower than the third quarter primarily owing to the unscheduled maintenance shutdown at the processing plant in Sossego  The site is now in operation  Sales volumes of copper reached 87 8 kt in the quarter  down 4 6  on a sequential basis mainly blamed on lower South Atlantic production volumes  This was partly offset by the timing of customer deliveries and higher production in Canadian operations in the quarter In 2019  copper production was 381 1 kt  down 3 6  from 2018  mainly due to lower production from Sossego  which was partly offset by the all time record production of copper concentrate from Sudbury  Copper sales for the year fell 3 6  year over year to 365 2 kt due to lower production levels Cobalt production reached 1 140 metric tons in the October December period  up 13  sequentially  In 2019  Vale produced 4 376 metric tons of cobalt  14 1  lower than the prior year In the fourth quarter  manganese ore production totaled 450 kt  1 7  higher than the prior quarter  Manganese ore sales volumes were 570 kt  280  higher sequentially  The drop in the numbers were due to operational improvements and maintenance conducted at the Urucum mine in the second quarter and unusual weather related conditions in the first half of 2019  In 2019  manganese production declined 14  year over year to 1 576 kt  while sales dipped 32 4  to 1 063 kt Coal production came in at 1 9 Mt in the fourth quarter  down 19  sequentially  In 2019  production was down 24  to 8 8 Mt from 2018 thanks to lower productivity at the processing plants throughout the year  Vale has thus reviewed business plan in 2019 and implemented two initiatives   a new mining plan and a new operational strategy for the processing plants  These are expected to produce sustainable results Gold production was up 0 6
