31685,253200,PIPR,StockBeat  Ulta Beauty Turns Ultra Ugly Following Guidance Cut,news,"Investing com   Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA  slumped on Friday after the company s guidance cut and earning miss triggered a wave of downgrades from analysts 
Ulta cut its guidance on full year earnings per share to a range of  11 86 to  12 06  from a prior range of  12 83 to  13 03  sending its shares tumbling 30   The stock turned negative for the year so far  down about 2 5     
The company reported earnings per share of  2 72 on revenue of  1 67 billion  Analysts polled by Investing com anticipated earnings per share of  2 80 on revenue of  1 68 billion  
It wasn t so long ago that Ulta  could do no wrong  bucking the gloomy backdrop for cosmetics  but its profit cut and earnings miss during the second quarter was  thesis changing   said   Morgan Stanley    NYSE MS   as it joined in on the slew of rate cuts on the stock 
Morgan downgraded Ulta to equal weight from over weight and slashed price target to  275 from  395  Piper Jaffray  NYSE PJC  downgraded the shares to neutral from a buy equivalent and cut its price target to  250 per share from  360  
But among the wave of downgrades  there are some  however  who are not ready to call time on the stock just yet  Gina Sanchez  CEO of Chantico Global said in a CNBC interview on Thursday  
She cautioned  however  that Ulta s valuation had become  too lofty  
Sanchez was not alone in her backing the stock as Loop Capital insisted the long term outlook for the company was  fairly bullish  given the continued weakness in the mall based department store channel and the retailer s  top notch  loyalty program 
Ulta has a consensus price target of  370  according to estimates compiled by Investing com ",2019-08-30,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-ulta-beauty-turns-ultra-ugly-following-guidance-cut-1967553,1967553
31686,253201,PIPR,Is Tesla s  TSLA  Q3 Performance A Sign Of What s To Come  ,opinion,"Shares of Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   soared after it reported third quarter earnings where it raised cash and increased its margins  Tesla posted just its fifth quarterly profit since going public in 2010  after accumulating a loss of more than  6 billion so far  Since the company was formed  investors pointed to a few persistent problems like a large debt load  sales boosted by government subsidies to buyers  and consistently missed production forecasts 
Elon Musk s antics are also highlighted as a problem as the sometimes eccentric behavior the Tesla CEO exhibits has people scratching their heads  The electric car company seems to have made the right adjustments in Q3  but will those adjustments be permanent solutions 
Benchmark Performance  
The question on everyone s mind after Tesla posted  1 86 per share and  6 3 billion in revenue is  can Tesla keep this up or will the rollercoaster ride continue  Sustained profitability has been on every investor and analyst s radar when examining Tesla  and this latest report gave investors a nice surprise 
 Skeptics had legitimate concerns in the past  but Tesla is now building cash  winning market share  and boosting margins   all while preparing to launch products in untapped segments and regions   Piper Jaffray   NYSE PJC   analyst Alexander Potter said in a note to investors after the results  Tesla also shared photos of its new factory in Shanghai where the company says its already begun trial production runs 
The company also said it was ahead of schedule on its long awaited Model Y crossover  which it now expects to launch by next summer  At the same time  Tesla says it is planning to make a limited run of its Tesla Semi truck next year  and hopes to soon announce the location of its European Gigafactory  where it aims to begin making electric vehicles in 2021  Additionally  in Q3  Tesla released over the air software updates including the Smart Summon Feature  which allows Tesla drivers to remotely call and control their cars 
Investors with short positions on the company are feeling the heat after its latest report as they lost about  1 billion on Thursday  Has Tesla finally bested the investors betting against it  or are they not out of the woods yet  Well  the road that lies ahead for the company is anything but a cake walk 
The company needs to deliver at least 104 800 cars in the fourth quarter to meet the low end of its 2019 forecast of 360 000 400 000 vehicles  On top of the daunting number of vehicles it must deliver to reach its forecast  federal tax credits on electric vehicle purchases are set to expire at the end of this year  which can have an adverse impact on the business 
The company is often accused of spending too much to fuel its growth trajectory which is why Q3 s 7  top line decline was worrisome to some analysts  The bulls contend that Tesla should be valued like a momentum tech name  making its revenue a crucial metric when examining the company  If the company s revenue growth continues to decline  bullish investors may cut their losses and flee 
Takeaway 
For the time being  Tesla short sellers are feeling the heat from the company s latest surge but some still feel the company is destined to see its valuation plummet  Tesla has its work cut out for it next quarter if it wants to keep the pressure on the 20  of its stock that is being shorted 
The slowing automotive market and decelerating global economy are additional headwinds that Tesla will need to deal with to close out its fiscal year on a high note  The Tesla bulls won this round  but the fight over how to value Tesla will continue next quarter

31690,253205,PIPR,Top Ranked ETFs   Stocks To Feast On Thanksgiving And After,opinion,"According to the Stock Trader s Almanac  stocks normally offer solid returns onthe Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Friday after combined  albeit at a low volume  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced only   However  the wining trend dwindled in the past two years as the Dow was down about 32 points and 180 points in 2017 and 2018 around Thanksgiving  respectively 
This makes us analyze  will the U S  stock market continue the age old wining trend this year too or not  Let s find out 
Markets at All Time High
Trade and Fed optimism have taken Wall Street to new highs several times this year The S P 500 breached the 3 100 level while the Dow Jones topped the 28 000 milestone  Stellar show by the tech and biotech stocks has made this uptrend possible  The S P 500 is up 25  in 2019 and on its way to the largest  
The forward rally from here depends largely on the news coming out on the U S  China trade front  Just before Thanksgiving   U S  President Donald Trump said the United States and China were  of a trade deal  
Oil on Upbeat Mode
OPEC and Russia  or OPEC Plus  will meet in Vienna next week  and it is widely expected that the group will extend their output cut agreement to June or even the end of next year  The current agreement is in place till March 2020 
If this is not enough  talks of a trade deal by mid December is pushing oil prices up  China s latest move of  on Intellectual Property theft has also been acting as a tailwind to the potential trade talks 
Global Slowdown Seems to Be Passing By

The Fed s three rate cuts and chances of no hike in the near term is a positive   When the Fed eases during soft patches  equity markets rally significantly over the next year  20  on average    per Barclays strategist

31691,253206,PIPR,Should Value Investors Pick Piper Jaffray  PJC  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Piper Jaffray Companies   NYSE PJC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Piper Jaffray has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 24  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 25  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Piper Jaffray s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 11 47 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 58  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Piper Jaffray has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 86  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Piper Jaffray has a P S ratio of about 1 38  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 33x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Piper Jaffray currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Piper Jaffray a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  What About the Stock Overall Though Piper Jaffray might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of F  This gives PJC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been solid at best  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period  This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Piper Jaffray Companies Price and Consensus   This somewhat robust trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term  Bottom LinePiper Jaffray is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 36  out of more than 250 Zacks industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial   Investment Bank industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech

While Amazon and e commerce in general are largely blamed for igniting the retail store apocalypse  discount stores like Dollar General   NYSE DG   and Dollar Tree   NASDAQ DLTR   were thought to be immune from the epidemic  as Amazon required a set dollar amount needed to spend to qualify for free shipping 
Dollar stores have kept their hold on the market by opening stores near lower income areas and by creating a  treasure hunting  experience that gets consumers in the store and drives up the average transaction ticket  Other companies like Target   NYSE TGT   scatter their seasonal discounted items to create a similar atmosphere for their consumers and recently saw comp sales grow 3 4  in Q2 with their average ticket price increasing roughly 1  
To compete with the discount retailers Amazon is allowing a slew of products priced below  5 to qualify for free next day shipping through Amazon Prime  The e commerce giant is hoping that the convenience of quickly finding a small item then receiving it in the mail next day will outweigh the excitement of physical discovery in a traditional brick and mortar store  While this may seem like a deeply unprofitable strategy  the use of Amazon s own logistics network and subsidies from participating brands could mitigate the impact on the company s bottom line 
This isn t the first time Amazon has tried to tap the discount retail market  It previously launched its  add on  feature that identified inexpensive items that could be added to an order valued at  25 or more and  if shipped to the same address  qualify for free shipping  They also lowered their Prime membership for qualifying customers and instituted installment plans 
Outlook 
Despite the company s previous efforts to tap the discount market  Amazon has struggled to make its presence felt  Last October  Piper Jaffray   NYSE PJC   estimated that only 60  of US households with annual incomes between  21 000 and  40 000 had Prime subscriptions  versus nearly 85  of higher income households 
Now that Amazon announced that Prime Day was  once again the largest shopping event in Amazon history   Wall Street will be anticipating a significant boost in Q3 sales  The company decided to extend their annual event from 36 to 48 hours  which could potentially provide some positive surprises in the firm s top line  Amazon typically doesn t report the exact revenue that Prime Day brings in  but estimates from last year s event are over  4 billion 
Investors should also closely monitor the company s Amazon Web Services  which has continued to grow as it maintains its lead in the cloud computing market  As the world s ongoing digital transformation continues  AWS could continue to be the industry leader  Some think Amazon s cloud computing business alone could be worth as much as  400 billion 
Q3 will also be the first full quarter of results since it announced next day shipping for many items  The company said back in April that faster shipping would initially be available on about 100 million items that previously shipped within two days and that that number would grow in the future 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast Amazon to see an earnings decrease of 22 43  to  4 46 per share while sales could reach  68 57 billion for a 21 2  hike  Online stores are projected to grow 15 4  while physical stores see a 2 44  increase  The firm s Amazon Web Services is anticipated to nearly double from the year ago quarter to  9 13 billion and subscription services are forecasted to climb 34 7  to  4 98 billion 
Bottom Line 
Amazon continues to apply pressure to a wide array of companies  even those that were once thought safe from the ecommerce giant s expansion  The company is trying to force its way into the discount retail market  and time will tell if its latest initiatives will successfully pry consumers away from traditional discount stores  The lead it holds within the cloud computing market will be vital to the company s future as AWS is the primary source of its profitability and modern companies continue to move towards cloud computing

Both firms gave the same reason for the cut  OncoMed  that their lung cancer drug  Tarextumab  didn t meet endpoints in Phase 2 of its clinical trial  
The results of the clinical trial of the cancer drug with chemotherapy showed little difference from the combination of chemotherapy and placebo 
 Small cell lung cancer is a very difficult to treat disease and unfortunately  tarextumab did not show benefit over placebo in this Phase 2 trial   said Paul J  Hastings  OncoMed s Chairman  and CEO 
Furthermore  OMED gave another factor for the rating cut  The pharmaceuticals company also announced that the enrollment of brontictuzumab to Phase 1  a drug for colorectal cancer  has been discontinued 
The company said that it is going to  undertake a comprehensive portfolio prioritization review immediately  
Things will not look too good for the drug developer  if they don t put their  focus on rebuilding the research and development pipeline in a capital efficient manner   Leerink Partners analysts Michael Schmidt wrote in a note 
Currently  OncoMed has six drug candidates being evaluated in ten clinical studies  All of them are either in progress or have begun enrolling patients  2017 will not be a good year for the company if a few more its drugs follow the trend of its predecessors 
OncoMed s stock has lost 50  of its value since the beginning of 2017

31798,253313,PIPR,Why Are Shares  Groupon  GRPN  Surging Today ,opinion,"Shares of Groupon Inc    NASDAQ GRPN   are surging today after analysts at Piper Jaffray Cos    NYSE PJC   upgraded its recommendation for the online marketplace from neutral to overweight  citing that the company has narrowed its focus and has increased marketing spending  They also issued a  6 price target for the stock 
In a note  Piper Jaffray analyst Samuel Kemp wrote   Groupon is quickly narrowing its product and regional focus to the categories where it can be successful  while deploying marketing dollars to drive growth in North America local deals  
Shares of Groupon spiked more than 11  Monday  bringing the stock s year to date gains up over 26  for 2016  The company is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock 
Once a favorite tech stock for investors and analysts  the company has struggled since its IPO in 2011 to grow its user base and profits  Groupon replaced its CEO in November 2015  and new CEO Rich Williams has increased marketing budget in an attempt to revive and reinvent the company  The company will spend  150 million to  200 million on marketing this year  which will drive as many as 4 5 million new accounts over the course of the current year  and lead to similar levels next year  Those new accounts will eventually drive  215 million to  280 million in annualized gross profit  and return North America local billings growth to double digit levels  according to Kemp 
Bottom Line
Groupon has had a successful run thus far in 2016 as seen in the growth of its stock price  and the company is looking to continue its run  With a new CEO at the helm and the possibility of its sales and profits growing at double digit pace  it could very well do so  Though it s just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  now  things are looking up for Groupon  and if more analysts from other firms become more bullish on the company  that ranking  and its stock price  could be on the move ",2016-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-are-shares--groupon-(grpn)-surging-today-200142583,200142583

Munster s optimism around the stock comes from Amazon s Prime subscription service and same day delivery  Munster believes that the Prime service will see growth in subscribers  which will translate into increasing revenues  The same day delivery service on the other hand will give the company a competitive edge in the e commerce market  The optimism comes from the recent revelation by the company that about 10 million new members tried Amazon s Prime service for the first time  this holiday season  leading to yet another record holiday period for the e commerce giant  The Prime service charges customers a membership fee of  99 per annum and grants members the benefit of guaranteed two day shipping  This could have been one of the reasons why the service attracted millions of first time members doing some last minute shopping for their loved ones for Christmas  In its annual post Christmas debriefing session  Amazon also talked about its plan of expanding its one hour delivery service and mobile based shopping  This is the latest effort by the company to expand its operational activities  shopping  and increase delivery options  Amazon com  one of the largest online retailers in the world  is performing true to form  in our view  We believe that the company s increasing content portfolio  expansion of its Prime service to different cities and delivery options will attract more customers  thereby expanding the company s revenue base  However  the e tailer is under certain amount of pressure from investors who are increasingly unimpressed with its huge investments that continue to yield low returns because of its aggressive pricing strategies  Also  its dominant position is now threatened more than ever  with a number of companies jumping on the e commerce bandwagon  It has been facing stiff competition from other online and mobile commerce giants such as Alibaba Group  NYSE BABA  and eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   A better ranked stock in this industry is MercadoLibre  NASDAQ MELI   which carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2014-12-30,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/piper-jaffray-reiterates-amazon-price,-target-rating-237093",237093

Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  everyone  I m here with Deb Schoneman  our President  and Tim Carter  our CFO  We would like to thank you for joining us to discuss the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019  After our remarks  we will open up the call for questions  Reflecting on the year  we generated record revenues and earnings and completed a number of strategic actions  2019 was a year of growth and transformation  It s very fitting  that 2020 marks the firms 125th anniversary  Our history is one filled with growth and change  the most recent being our new name  Piper Sandler Companies  Our dedication to serving the best interests of clients  employees  shareholders and the communities where we live and work has been the foundation of our success  I m excited to celebrate our 125th anniversary with clients and colleagues  while executing on our future strategic priorities Let me begin by providing a summary of the strategic activities that shaped 2019 and our goals for 2020 and beyond  In early August  we closed on the acquisition of Weeden   Company  which significantly enhances the scale of our equity brokerage business by upgrading our trading capabilities and broadening our client base  In late September  we closed on the sale of Advisory Research  our traditional asset management business  This business no longer fit with our strategic vision and the sale was the best course of action for our clients  employees and shareholders Finally  early in July  we announced the acquisition of Sandler O Neill  The acquisition closed on January 3 of this year  Sandler adds the leading investment banking firm  focused on the financial services industry to our growing investment banking platform  I look forward to working with Jon Doyle and Jimmy Dunne and the fantastic team they lead  In 2020  we look to build on the record financial results achieved in 2019  With Sandler successfully closed  we now look forward to providing clients access to the full breadth of our combined capabilities  Both Weeden and Sandler were market leaders  who chose to partner with us  Part of our continued growth will include selectively adding partners  who share our client centric culture and who can leverage the Piper Sandler platform to better serve clients  Development and retention of our own talent provides the most profitable growth and we continue to invest in the development of our future leaders Next  let me provide some overall comments on our financial results for 2019 and an update on our advisory and equity capital markets businesses  In Q4  we generated  276 million of adjusted net revenues and  2 89 of EPS  both quarterly records  Our strong finish to the year led to adjusted revenues of  824 million for 2019 and EPS of  7 36  also records Turning now to advisory services  Advisory generated quarterly revenues of  144 million  up 35  from Q3 and 12  from the year ago quarter  Q4 advisory revenues were led by our market leading healthcare franchise  with strong contributions from consumer  technology and industrials  For the year  advisory revenues were  441 million  up 12   reflecting strong broad based performance  Our healthcare  consumer and industrial teams all performed well  generating record or near record results We advised on 178 transactions during the year  up from 170 in 2018  We continue to focus on elevating our platform  by leveraging our brand to win larger deals and enhancing our value proposition to clients by providing more products and deep sector expertise  This is reflected in our median fee increasing 16  from a year ago  driving increased revenues  Growing and broadening advisory services has been a long standing focus for us  Our revenues have more than doubled in the last five years  reflecting strong market share gains  These results are a function of internal development  selective hiring and corporate development activities  We ve previously discussed remixing the business toward capital light  variable cost businesses such as advisory  For the third year in a row  advisory revenues represented over 50   Phonetic  of our total revenues  a trend we expect will continue We re excited to add Sandler to our platform  a market leader in the financial services industry  Sandler is also an advisory led franchise with approximately 50  of revenues generated by advisory services  The combination significantly elevates our advisory practice with market leadership in healthcare  financial services  consumer and energy and we expect to be in the top 3 of all U S  investment banks in terms of deal flow Trade tensions  geopolitical risks and the U S  Presidential election create headline risk for 2020  However  conditions for M A in the middle market remain conducive to transactions  due to demand from PE investors  attractive valuations  low financing rates and continued solid economic growth  Our pipeline is really strong across our industry verticals  albeit back half weighted again as we reload from the strong Q4 Turning to ECM  Equity financing activity finished the year very strong with Q4 revenues of  43 million  driven by our healthcare team  For the quarter  we raised  3 9 billion in capital for our clients and we re bookrunner on 76  of transactions  For the full year  we generated  105 million in equity financing revenues  down 14  from 2018  reflecting challenges in the cyclical energy sector and the impact of the federal government shutdown in early 2019 Looking forward to 2020  the combination with Sandler adds a market leading franchise to our capital markets offerings and expands our platform as financial services  represents a large and broad fee pool from a corporate capital raising perspective  We previously set a long term goal of growing annual advisory and corporate financing revenues to  750 million  With the addition of Sandler  we should be close to achieving that goal We see continued growth over the medium term by adding talent in certain sub sectors to broaden our industry teams and continuing to increase banker productivity  We also see an opportunity to capitalize on the strength of our U S  franchises by expanding in Europe  As a result  our new goal is to grow advisory and corporate financing to over  1 billion of combined annual revenues over the next several years I will now turn the call over to Deb to discuss our public finance and brokerage businesses Deb Schoneman    Managing Director  PresidentThanks  Chad  Let me begin with an update on our equity brokerage business  Equity markets in the fourth quarter saw low volatility and volumes  There were few catalysts motivating clients to trade  as markets continue to advance higher  despite global growth concerns and trade tensions  Our equity brokerage business generated revenues of  32 million for the quarter and  89 million for the year  up meaningfully compared to the prior period  driven by the addition of Weeden to our platform  On an annual basis  inclusive of Sandler  we expect equity brokerage revenues to be approximately  130 million  providing meaningful operating leverage in the business  as we capitalize on cost synergies  With a comprehensive suite of products  one of the largest client base with the domestically focused brokers and a high quality research franchise covering 875 stocks  we believe that we have a significant market share opportunity in front of us as participants consolidate toward larger  broader and higher quality providers Turning to our public finance business  debt financing finished the year very strong with  31 million of revenues for the fourth quarter  up 37  from Q3 and 13  from a year ago  We benefited from a surge of new issuance volume in the market  as clients took advantage of low rates  In addition  we completed several higher spread financings  as demand remained strong for high yield muni offerings in this lower interest rate environment For the full year  we generated  86 million of debt financing revenues  up 17  from a slow 2018  Market conditions significantly improved as the year progressed  driven by low rates and investor demand  Increased issuance for 2019 was driven by a pickup in refunding activity  especially taxable refinancings and an increase in new money issuance  We expect the debt financing momentum we experienced in 2019 to carry over into 2020 with another strong year of market issuance  Our pipeline is solid with several higher spread financings in the backlog  As always  our ability to execute on our backlog is contingent on market conditions Investors value the tax exempt feature of municipals and differentiated high credit quality of this asset class  making it a valuable component of our product capabilities  Our commitment and expertise in the public finance market has led to increasing market share over time and makes us a natural destination for talent  looking to best serve their clients  In 2019  we added nine senior bankers  expanding our presence in Nebraska  Colorado  Pennsylvania and Ohio  We are one of the most active municipal debt underwriters in the market  ranking in the top 10 based on par value and top 3 based on volume of deals In the fixed income markets  yields normalized in the fourth quarter as the yield curve steepened  easing concerns about an inverted curve  The 0 2   Phonetic  spread expanded from 5 basis points at September 30 to 34 basis points at year end  For the quarter  we generated fixed income brokerage revenues of  25 million  consistent with Q3  and up 73  over the very challenging year ago period For the full year  we produced  95 million of revenues  a 40  increase from 2018  A combination of conducive market conditions  increase in client activity and strong execution drove a very successful year for our fixed income franchise  It s important to note  we achieved these results in a lower risk profile  and with a reduced headcount and cost base  driving a meaningful increase in the returns for this business  Looking to 2020  we re excited by the opportunities the combination with Sandler presents  given the complementary products and expertise Now  I will turn the call over to Tim to review our financial results and provide an update on capital use Tim Carter    Managing Director  Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Deb  My comments will be focused on our adjusted non GAAP financial results  However  let me first highlight a few items impacting our GAAP results  Our GAAP results include amounts related to the discontinued operations of advisory research  our traditional asset management business  For the year  we recorded net income from discontinued operations of  23 8 million or  1 65 per diluted common share  which included a gain on the sale of this business  In addition we incurred restructuring and integration costs of  1 8 million in Q4 and  14 3 million for the full year  related to the acquisitions of Sandler and Weeden  These costs consisted of severance benefits  contract termination costs and transaction related professional fees  We expect to incur additional restructuring and integration costs in the first half of 2020 associated with the Sandler acquisition Turning to our adjusted financial results  We achieved record revenues of  276 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 and  824 million for the full year  Our Q4 revenues increased 36  sequentially  with strong performances across investment banking  but especially in equity capital markets  which finished the year very strong with  43 million of revenues  the highest quarterly level in over a decade Compared to the year ago period  quarterly revenues were up 29   with increases across all of our business lines  For the year  revenues increased 12   driven by growth in advisory services and an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues  which rebounded 40  from the depressed 2018 levels  We produced an operating margin of 20 4  for the fourth quarter  generating pre tax profits of  56 million and diluted EPS of  2 89  illustrating the operating leverage in the business at higher revenue levels For the year  pre tax profits were  136 million  an increase of 26  from 2018  By maintaining cost discipline  we were able to grow profits at twice the rate of revenues  This drove a 16 6  operating margin for the year  a meaningful expansion from 14 7  in 2018  On a year to date basis  EPS was  7 36  an increase of 29  from 2018  driven by higher revenues and a higher operating margin Turning to operating expenses  Our compensation ratio of 61 2  for the quarter was below our target range of 62  to 63   Robust revenues in the quarter enabled us to leverage fixed compensation costs in the business  For the full year  our comp ratio was 62  at the low end of our stated range  Given our focus on corporate development activities in 2019  we did fewer senior investment banking hires  which drove our comp ratio to the lower end of the range  Quarterly non comp expenses of  51 million were elevated due to increased deal related expenses  driven by higher investment banking revenues  For the year  non comp expenses were  176 million  Although non comps averaged  44 million per quarter  they trended higher in the second half of the year  given the addition of Weeden to our platform  We continue to carefully manage non comp expenses as these costs are an important source of operating leverage Our adjusted tax rate was 26 3  for the quarter and 22 1  for the full year  The lower annual tax rate was a result of a  5 1 million tax benefit from restricted stock awards  vesting at values greater than the grant price  Excluding this tax benefit  our adjusted tax rate was 25 9  for the year  Over the past few years  we have recorded a tax benefit  resulting from restricted stock awards  vesting at values greater than their grant date price  However  this is dependent on the share price at vesting relative to the grant date price and can result in either a tax benefit or additional tax expense  For 2020  we do not expect to generate a tax benefit at the same levels as the past few years At our current share price  we re projecting no tax benefit related to the awards vesting in the first quarter of 2020  Also  given the recent changes to our business related to corporate development and strategic activities  we expect our tax rate in 2020 to increase  As such  we are updating our full year estimated tax rate guidance to a range of 26  to 28  Turning to capital  Our goal is to maximize shareholder value  This includes  maintaining our dividend policy of returning 30  to 50  of non GAAP earnings to our shareholders  repurchasing shares on an opportunistic basis and to offset the dilution from stock vestings and deploying capital toward high quality acquisitions to accelerate growth in the business  Our relative weighting toward each of these levers is dependent on a number of factors  including the market environment and our performance  In the near term  we are more biased toward investing in the business In regards to dividends  the Board approved a special cash dividend of  0 75 per share to be paid alongside the first quarter dividend  When combined with the  1 50 of regular quarterly dividends  total dividends for fiscal 2019 will be  2 25 per share  This represents approximately 33  of our adjusted net income for 2019 The Board also approved a quarterly dividend of  0 375 per share to be paid on March 13  2020  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 2nd  2020  In 2019  we repurchased  50 6 million  or 702 000 shares of common stock at an average price of  72 09 per share  In total  we returned  86 million to shareholders in 2019  through dividends and share repurchases  These amounts are in addition to deploying capital toward the Sandler and Weeden acquisitions  We entered 2020 in a strong capital position  with only a modest level of debt on the balance sheet  We maintained the financial flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders  while investing in the business Let me finish by reiterating some of the high level guidance we provided in Q3 regarding our go forward operations with a full year of both Weeden and Sandler in our results  We continue to project that Sander will add approximately  300 million of revenues in 2020  Going forward  we expect our compensation ratio to be consistent with current levels in the range of 62  to 63   This level gives us the flexibility to continue investing in the business  Non comps may vary from period to period  depending on the amount of deal related expenses  We re adjusting our non compensation guidance to exclude the more variable deal related expenses In 2020  we estimate non comp expenses  excluding deal related expenses  to range from  53 million to  57 million per quarter  We have revised this range to include office space consolidation costs in 2020  These office moves will generate savings in future periods and will allow us to integrate the teams across platforms and drive more connectivity and synergy among our employee partners  In regards to deal related expenses  these expenses should generally be viewed as a function of banking revenues  Based on historical experience  we estimate that deal related expenses will represent approximately 3 5  to 4  of investment banking revenues Before going to Q A  I d like to turn the call back to Chad for a few additional comments Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Tim  Let me close by thanking all my employee partners for their hard work and dedication and congratulating them on a record year and also welcoming our new employee partners from Sandler  The new Piper Sandler has an enviable market position and financial profile  Our market leadership  sector expertise and broad product capabilities are unparalleled in the middle market With over  1 billion of annual revenues  strong margins  modest leverage and limited incremental operating capital needs  we are nicely positioned to generate profits to further propel our growth and shareholder returns Thanks  and now  let s open up the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  The floor is now open for questions   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities Devin Ryan    JMP Securities    AnalystGreat  Good morning  guys  How are you Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Devin Deb Schoneman    Managing Director  PresidentGood morning Devin Ryan    JMP Securities    AnalystCongratulations on the nice end of the year  So first question  just on the Sandler deal  So I know you re still expecting  300 million of revenue contribution at the moment  And I m just curious how that number compares to what the actual kind of 2019 level was  And it seems like business in the financial vertical starting on a pretty good note here  So I m just trying to get some context on maybe some of the areas that might be lower relative to last year  as it seems that that s the implication off of the  300 million  and maybe you re leaving yourself some room for upside  but just trying to think about the moving parts there Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  sure  I can take that  Yeah  Sandler had another good year in 2019  We had disclosed in January  the revenues from the last few years  They had their third year in a row with revenues north of  300 million  Obviously  that was the target we gave in July  when we announced the deal  We still feel very comfortable with the guidance that we expect it will add  300 million of revenues  relative to some of their business segments  They had another strong advisory year  And I would say  like our business and others we ve seen on The Street  a really strong finish to fixed income as well And  yes  I think  it s true  They ve got a good backlog  good pipeline  I think  like our business  just looking at some of the announced deals and projected closing dates  I think  they like us  will be more back half weighted than first half weighted  But  yeah  we expect another strong year  Terrific  Thanks  Chad  And    maybe  a follow up for Tim  on the capital commentary and appreciate the detail  And it sounds like the philosophy is pretty consistent  But clearly  the business could be throwing off a lot of cash here  And I m just trying to think about any additional capital needs of the business moving forward  whether there be opportunities in fixed income with the combined franchises  You spent more time thinking about opportunities there or more to do on the financing side  I m just trying to think about any other areas within the business that could actually consume capital relative to maybe  what you re running at previously Tim Carter    Managing Director  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Sure  Devin  I think you re right in terms of how we continue to think about it  It s really consistent with what we ve talked about before  I don t think that additional capital within the business changes really all that much  With the Sandler acquisition  I think the capital we have deployed in the various businesses I think remains fairly  Technical Issues  going forward  I think we ve got some ability to leverage the combined platforms from that perspective  But for us  yeah  it s going to continue to obviously return capital through the dividend  which we very much expect to do and then look for other ways to invest in the business from a corporate development perspective  and then continue to look opportunistically at share buybacks  But that s probably the last priority here at least in the near term Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Devin  its Chad  I would just add  We continue to be active  And I think just given the growth of the platform continue to be shown  interesting opportunities on the corporate development side  Clearly  our integration with Sandler has gone well  I mean  frankly  the    especially  the integration on the investment banking side just given there was so little overlap that was pretty seamless and we re off to the races  So I think it s unlikely  we would do something large  But very likely we ll continue to look at tuck in acquisitions or boutiques  especially where there s very little overlap  and it gives us some market leadership in some sub verticals Devin Ryan    JMP Securities    AnalystTerrific  And maybe just to end on that point  So you highlighted the  1 billion plus advisory financing target  It seems like you guys are    you re well on the way there  So maybe just kind of outline the path that you see to that  And I believe that would be all organic  And then to the extent there are kind of M A opportunities just maybe update us on some of those verticals that you feel like it would make more sense to buy versus build organically  And even maybe to end on any other areas outside of investment banking that could be complementary inorganically to the business as you re thinking about kind of the overall corporate development Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would take that  For us  I mean  we like to have sort of these internal targets of where we think we re going to take the banking business  And I just think back to 10 years ago  when we had  150 million banking business we really felt we could drive that to  500 million  We ve now had three years sort of in and around that range  And as we ve said many times that came from about half organic and half corporate development  I think a year ago  we sort of set a new goal that we could do  750 million  I think we thought that would take several years through smaller acquisitions and organic growth Obviously  we were very happy to partner with Sandler and that probably launched us right to that  750 million mark  and so now we ve just got this  1 billion target for financing and M A over the next few years  And I would say that will be a combination of continued organic growth  as we ve said in energy even in healthcare  Even in our strongest places there are sub verticals for organic growth  We talked a lot about the opportunity to do more in FinTech with the combination of our software platform and Sandler s financial services platform  But I think also in that goal would be some smaller boutiques  smaller team lift outs like we talked about  So I think it s a combination of those And then your last question is  we d still be very open to opportunistic acquisitions or team lift outs in our public space  Phonetic  and some of our specialty areas  And then I would also just add we re    the combination  we re seeing some great early signs in fixed income  Obviously  the integration in fixed income and equities is a little harder than banking since we are already in some of those businesses  But I don t think it s out of the question that we could look to more corporate development and fixed income down the road as well Devin Ryan    JMP Securities    AnalystGreat  Thanks for all the color and taking all my questions Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Devin Deb Schoneman    Managing Director  PresidentThanks  Devin OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Walsh of Wolfe Research Chris Walsh    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey guys  Good morning Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Chris Tim Carter    Managing Director  Chief Financial OfficerHey  Chris Chris Walsh    Wolfe Research    AnalystCongrats on the quarter Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Chris Walsh    Wolfe Research    AnalystFirst one  I just wanted to touch on was the ECM outlook  You saw a big step up in 4Q  Based on all the commentary from the universals that have already reported it seems like the outlook there is still fairly bullish and there might be clients that are trying to pull forward some of their equity raises in front of the U S  election  We re just looking for any color on what you re seeing among your client base Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So I can take that  We are definitely off to a better start this year in January  Admittedly  we had a crazy low bar with the government shutdown last year  But I would say  we are seeing very much the same thing  I think the first half will be quite active  And I do think that there are people that are going to try to stay away from October and November with the election  And if they were going to finance around that time  they ll try to do it sooner  but it s really hard to predict how that will impact the second half  But I would agree  generally we see pretty good climate here in the first half for ECM Chris Walsh    Wolfe Research    AnalystAnd then just in terms of the sector mix  I would assume that s fairly skewed toward healthcare  Would that be fair Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  The entire sort of middle market fee pool in ECM has continued to concentrate even more in healthcare  Obviously  we re really strong in healthcare  So that s good for us  But even our ECM results were impacted  We did much less energy ECM last year than we did the year before  So I actually expect we ll do a little better in some of the other sectors this year  but the lion s share again will be healthcare  And obviously  we re really excited to add the financial services fee pool for ECM because that s a fairly large people  Phonetic  Chris Walsh    Wolfe Research    AnalystAnd then just one last one on the advisory business  You said there are a higher number of transactions  but also an increase in median fees  which I think you said were up 16  over the course of 2019  it d be great if you could just comment on the underlying drivers there that have been driving your median fee rate higher Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So our median fee rate went up  It s    sometimes when you re looking at an average  it can be driven by the bigger  The bigger tickets obviously here  we re talking about the median fee  I would just say  And this is true for our outperformance in Q4  We had a couple of nice transactions slightly north of  10 million  But the massive    or the biggest part of our revenue stream really just came from fees  2 million to  5 million  We just see more and more   3 million   4 million   5 million fees as our    lots of our bankers are doing somewhat larger transactions  So I think all of that has helped  We still do plenty of  1 5 million fee  So that s in the sweet spot of the middle market  but we re definitely just seeing more 3s  4s and 5s on the advisory side Chris Walsh    Wolfe Research    AnalystAwesome  Thanks  Chad OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Brown of KBW Michael Brown    KBW    AnalystHi  good morning guys Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Deb Schoneman    Managing Director  PresidentGood morning Tim Carter    Managing Director  Chief Financial OfficerHey  Mike Michael Brown    KBW    AnalystSo  appreciate the color on Sandler integration  Just kind of wondering are you seeing any material changes and how you re viewing some of the synergy potential across the platforms  And then  specifically on the expense side  how far along is integration  I understand it s been only a couple of weeks  but is there still kind of more redundancies that need to be eliminated and kind of how should we think about how is that path will play out through 2020 Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll take the first stab at that  Obviously  we look at synergies two ways  what are the revenue opportunities and then on the expense side  I think relative to the revenue opportunities  obviously  we haven t    we re early days and we haven t sort of closed any of those transactions through cross referrals  but we re definitely seeing across public finance and our various industry groups  lots of collaboration  lots of relationships And so  we do still think in the long term we ll see some revenue pickup and as when we announced the deal in July relative to expenses  this transaction    Sandler already ran very efficient operating margins and while there are some opportunities for cost synergies sort of as planned and we re still sort of tracking those  the transaction was never about super huge cost synergies and there ll be things that go the other way  We re actually looking now with some offices that we ve got an ability to consolidate more quickly  So  we may end up having some more double rents this year  but we feel really  really good about the combination  how the early teams are working together  Ultimately  over the long term  we will get some more cost synergies  but that wasn t the big driver here in the short term Michael Brown    KBW    AnalystGreat  thank you  And then  the 17  to 19  targeted operating margin  you hit 16 6  this year  Can you just remind us  kind of  what s the timeline that you expect to kind of achieve that post the Sandler integration Tim Carter    Managing Director  Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Mike  You re right  I mean  we saw a pretty big expansion this year  I think  just  there is a lot of leverage that can be in the business that levels  As we look at it  sort of  going forward  we may not get to that targeted level in 2020  partly based on some of the costs that we ve talked about  Chad mentioned sort of this occupancy piece that  as we consolidate  we ve got some additional costs in 2020  So  it may not get to that level in the near term  but there is a clear path to get to that level  evidenced by sort of the leverage that you see in 2019  And obviously with the Sandler acquisition coming in  it drives earnings nicely and is sort of in line with what we plan from an overall earnings accretion perspective Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd  I would just add  I mean when we announced that in July that was obviously based on Sandler having really good margins  some opportunity to get some minimal expense synergies  So  our target was in the first couple of years  we could get to the bottom of that and it might take a couple more years to get to the top of that  but we still very much believe on a combined basis  we can get to the top of that range Michael Brown    KBW    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you for the color on that  And just one more for kind of modeling purposes  as we think about the quarterly trajectory in 2020  heard you loud and clear on kind of the back half waiting for investment banking  obviously  with the integration of Weeden  the brokerage business certainly has a little bit of a different quarterly trajectory as well  So  any color there as to how you expect those revenues to flow through and then is there any other seasonality we need to make sure we consider in our modeling Deb Schoneman    Managing Director  PresidentYeah  Maybe starting with equities as you were just speaking to with    in one of the things as you probably know as we ve seen more cyclicality of that business historically  as we paid for research more in the  maybe  second half of the year  Not perfectly clear what that will look like  as we head into a new year with the combined platform  but clearly having a stronger execution platform in a commission management business there  It is likely  we could see some less cyclicality  but left to be played out  And then  maybe  I would also just note on the public finance business is a business that historically has had pretty weak Q1s over the last number of years and we re feeling good about the momentum we re seeing carrying over from Q4 into Q1  not necessarily at that same level  but maybe more than we ve seen historically Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah and I would just say  yeah  relative to the rest of the business  I mean  if you go back 15 years or 20 years  usually four years out of the five years were stronger in the back half than the first half and that can be sometimes skewed based on some big transactions  in Q1  Q2  we feel very good about our visibility in the pipeline and we re off to a good start  but we re highly confident in the pipeline  but really do think it will be the closures  maybe not the announced deals  but the closures will be and the revenue recognition will be more back half weighted Michael Brown    KBW    AnalystThanks for taking my question Deb Schoneman    Managing Director  PresidentThank you Operator Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl of Northland Securities Mike Grondahl    Northland Securities    AnalystHi  yeah  Congratulations on the great year  kind of  transformational and also the strong fourth quarter  Chad  you talk about a 122 investment banking MDs  What is a rough range to think about that maybe one year from now and two years from now  What would you like to get that to  as you make some tuck ins or contemplate some tuck ins Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  no  I think  that s a good question  I mean when we were kind of operating close to 90 MDs on our own  Obviously  with the combination  about half of our financial services team joined the Sandler platform plus you had their MDs  So  that s sort of why we use the 122 MDs that s sort of as of January 3  how many MDs we had  That number does not include our own organic promotion class  which we will announce in March  which is one of our larger classes  So  I sort of expect and hope we could end in the high 120s  maybe close to 130 this year  And  yeah  we sort of targeted to get to that  1 billion  that s probably 150 MD or 160 MD number over the next three years  four years  five years  and I would say probably that incremental 20 MD will come through a combination of organic hires and team lift outs and internal development Mike Grondahl    Northland Securities    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  Anything to call out  I know you did a lot of planning with Sandler before the close  It s closed less than a month  but anything that you re really delighted with so far or maybe even a little bit pleasantly surprised with Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  maybe I ll give you a couple of things  I mean  the Sandler folks are super collaborative  I think you can just tell from their culture of how they run the business the last 30 years  everybody thinks about driving revenue across sort of silos or products  it doesn t matter  I mean  they re all sort of sharing our relationships  already bringing us ideas and different verticals  So  I m very optimistic about that and I would just say  if there is sort of a little extra giddy up in our step  it s just the opportunity in fixed income  We re seeing some very cool things across the combination of our two platforms that    it s going to take a while for us to see major upside on that revenue  but some of the stories are quite fun Mike Grondahl    Northland Securities    AnalystAnd  just lastly  on the fixed income side  is it more clients  cross sell product  maybe just detail that a little bit more for us on fixed income Deb Schoneman    Managing Director  PresidentYeah  fixed income from a client perspective  we really saw minimal overlap  unlike  maybe the equity side of business as you think about bringing in both Sandler and Weeden  So  it s really more  I would say  in a combination of product and analytics and expertise  And on both sides  both Sandler and Piper  historically had different expertise in different products  call it  in SA  Phonetic  municipals and some other taxable product on our side and things like loan trading and derivatives products and things that are more unique that in both cases  we can leverage that across our broader client platform Mike Grondahl    Northland Securities    AnalystGot it  Great  And hey  good luck in 2020 Deb Schoneman    Managing Director  PresidentThanks  Mike Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mike OperatorAnd that was our final question  I d like to turn the floor back over to Chad Abraham for any additional or closing remarks Chad Abraham    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks  operator  We look forward to updating you again in April and
