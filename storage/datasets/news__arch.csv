11742,233257,ARCH,Can Peabody   Arch Coal JV Counter Drop In Coal Demand ,opinion,Peabody Energy Corporation   NYSE BTU   and Arch Coal Inc    NYSE ARCH   have decided to form a joint venture by merging some of their most productive coal mines in Powder River Basin and Colorado  The decision comes at a time when coal continues to lose its popularity as an energy source in the United States  Despite the new administration s pro coal stance  increasing usage of clean natural gas and renewable sources is alarming for the U S  coal mine operators The joint venture  which will be owned 66 5  by Peabody Energy and 33 5  by Arch Coal  will require regulatory approval  Rationale Behind JV Amid increasing concerns about emissions and greenhouse gas  we could notice a clear shift in energy choice among utility operators  At present  natural gas and renewable energy are being preferred over coal for energy needs Availability of cheap shale gas in the United States  technological advancement and incentives on usage of renewable energy continue to push back coal as a source of energy  The latest report from U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   forecasts 2019 coal consumption in the United States to fall to 602 million short tons  MMst   reflecting a 12 3  decline from the 2018 levels and coal consumption to further drop to 567 MMst in 2020 EIA forecasts that the share of electricity generation from coal in the United States to average 24  in 2019 and 23  in 2020  down from 27  in 2018 Given the persistent drop in domestic consumption  U S  Coal producers were looking forward to coal exports  which were aiding U S  Coal miners to gain some lost ground  However  the latest projection from EIA indicates that coal exports from the United States will drop to 101 9 MMst in 2019 or 11 8  from 115 6 MMst in 2018  U S  coal exports are expected to drop further to 94 8 MMst in 2020   Can This JV Deliver The U S  Coal industry is currently going through a very difficult phase  so this joint venture of the top two operators in the U S  Coal industry  could be the way forward for the troubled coal companies   This JV is expected to unlock a pre tax synergy of  820 million and average joint venture synergies are projected to be nearly  120 million per year over the initial 10 years  The aim of the JV is to combine best productive assets of both the companies and reduce costs beyond the capacity of a single company to achieve This joint venture has the potential to deliver desired results as the decline in cost of operation will make it more competitive in comparison to natural gas and renewable sources of energy  High quality coal production from the mines controlled by Peabody and Arch Coal will also help to increase thermal coal export volumes to Asian countries Coal reserves across the globe are currently estimated to be 1 1 trillion tons and this fossil fuel can last nearly 150 years at the current rates of production  Since coal reserves will last much more than oil and natural gas reserves  initiatives are being taken across the globe to utilize coal more efficiently  keeping a check on emission levels The best part of the JV is that these high quality coal companies will no longer compete with each other for orders but will work jointly and share profits Zacks RankPeabody Energy and Arch Coal currently have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  each  Better ranked stocks from the same  worth considering are Natural Resource Partners LP   NYSE NRP   and Warrior Met Coal Inc    NYSE HCC   both have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Natural Resource Partners and Warrior Met Coal returned higher than its industry in the past 12 months Price PerformanceNatural Resource Partners reported average positive earnings surprise of 11 01  in last four quarters  Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 moved up 19 3  to  5 75 per share in the last 60 days Warrior Met Coal reported average positive earnings surprise of 5 05  in the last four quarters  Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 moved up 12 9  to  6 23 per share in last 60 days Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you can do today to become one of them in a new Special Report   7 Things You Can Do Now to Retire a Multimillionaire  ,2019-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-peabody--arch-coal-jv-counter-drop-in-coal-demand-200433251,200433251
11753,233268,ARCH,Southern Copper Cost Cut   Expansion Plans Solid  Debt High,opinion,On May 20  we issued an updated research report on Southern  NYSE SO  Copper Corporation   NYSE SCCO    Backed by its largest copper reserves in the industry  and constant endeavor to increase low cost production and investment in capacity  the company remains well poised for growth  However  current weakness in metal prices and high debt levels will affect near term results Expansion Projects on TrackThe Toquepala concentrator expansion was completed during the fourth quarter of 2018 for  1 3 billion  It reached 86  of capacity usage at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and is anticipated to achieve full capacity by the second quarter of 2019  This expansion project will increase Toquepala s annual copper production to 258 000 tons in 2019  a production improvement of 52  for this operation compared with last year  It will raise the company s copper production in 2019 to 986 700 tons  higher than 883 689 tons in 2018 In Mexico  the company has a planned investment of  413 million in the Buenavista Zinc Sonora project which includes development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80 000 tons of zinc and 20 000 tons of additional copper annually  Once completed  this new zinc concentrator is likely to double the company s zinc production capacity  An investment of  159 million is estimated for Pilares Sonora project in Mexico which consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35 000 tons of copper in concentrates  It will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade  Additionally  the company has number of other projects that it may develop in the future  Notably  the company expects to reach 1 5 million tons of copper production by 2025 Low Cost   Largest Reserves  A Winning CombinationThe company continues to witness the benefits of cost reduction programs and expansion actions  During 2018  it obtained a cash cost reduction of 5 3  to 87 cents per pound  despite an increase of 16 5  in fuel cost and other materials  Considering last year s average prices for its main products  Southern Copper expects cash cost to average 80 cents per copper pound in 2019  an additional reduction of 8   fortifying its leadership as a low cost producer Southern Copper boasts of the largest copper reserves in the industry  and operates high quality and world class assets in investment grade countries  such as Mexico and Peru  Backed by a positive market outlook  constant commitment to increasing low cost production  largest copper reserves and growth investments  the company is well poised to continue delivering improved performance Betting on Peru s Growth Prospects Peru is currently the second largest producer of copper and its national output is expected to hit 4 8 million ton per year by 2021   double the output of 2017  In June 2018  Southern Copper completed the acquisition of Michiquillay project in Cajamarca  Peru  which boasts mineral resources of 1 150 million tons and copper grade of 0 63   It will produce 225 000 tons of copper annually and by products such as molybdenum  gold and silver  at a very competitive cash cost  Michiquillay offers immense growth opportunities for the company and fits into the company s portfolio of mining projects in the Americas  especially in Peru  It is likely to become one of the largest copper mines in Peru  Taking the Michiquillay   2 5 billion  and Los Chancas   2 8 billion  projects into consideration  the company s total investment program in Peru runs to  8 1 billion  Low Metal Prices  High Debt  Near term Concerns During first quarter 2019  the LME per pound copper price decreased 11  to  2 82 reflecting the market uncertainty owing to trade war between the United States and China  and Brexit concerns  Average molybdenum and zinc prices in the first quarter of 2019 also decreased 3 6  and 20 6   respectively on a year over year basis  Average silver prices also decreased 7 0  in the first quarter of 2019 from the prior year quarter Further  the company s debt to equity ratio stood at 89  at first quarter 2019 end  which is also a cause of concern Metal Prices to Pick Up in the Long TermNotwithstanding the current low copper prices  the impending demand supply imbalance will eventually drive copper prices  Copper production has recently been affected by persistent decline in investments  Notably  this issue has been plaguing several companies in recent years  On top of this  labor unrest  excess government taxation and technical difficulties are impacting production  Further  during the first quarter of 2019  heavy rains led to production losses in Chile and Peru  This will also lead to a deficit this year   On the contrary  demand is on the rise for the metal given its requirement across a gamut of industries  Molybdenum prices are set to increase on the back of healthy demand from the oil and gas industry  and decline in supply and recovery of the U S  economy and developed countries  Long term fundamentals for zinc remain strong due to its significant industrial consumption and expected mine production shutdowns  Further  silver prices are likely to gain driven by its industrial use and impending demand supply imbalance Share Price PerformanceShares of

Estimate of 28 cents  Net sales in the quarter rose 3 8  year over year to  179 8 million and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  166 million Franco Nevada s shares have appreciated 8 5  in the past year  outperforming the  s growth of 4 2  Momentum in Oil   Gas Portfolio to Drive GrowthPerformance of Oil   Gas remains robust  with revenues of  20 8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2019  up from the year ago quarter s  19 million  This can be attributed to higher oil prices and increased production from the U S  assets  During the quarter  energy revenues benefited from the company s investment in the Royalty Acquisition Venture with Continental  Moreover  Drill activity is higher and drilling productivity is better than expected Backed by better than anticipated contribution from its previously acquired U S  assets and higher oil prices  Franco Nevada projects revenues between  70 million and  85 million from its energy assets in 2019 Strategic Relationship With Continental Resources A Key CatalystLast October  Franco Nevada contributed  214 8 million to close its transaction with Continental Resources  Inc   in order to acquire the Oil   Gas mineral rights in the SCOOP and STACK plays of Oklahoma   two of the most economic and attractive plays in North America  The company has also committed  subject to satisfaction of agreed upon development thresholds  to spend up to  300 million over the next three years to acquire additional mineral rights through a newly formed entity This represents a new business development opportunity for Franco Nevada  It gets an acquisition vehicle  which provides the ability to acquire assets at the grassroots level or directly from individual owners  This is a segment of the market previously inaccessible to the company due to lack of staff or resources for carrying out such smaller scale acquisitions  More importantly  Franco Nevada benefits from the operators  drill plans  along with their knowledge of local land title and geology Cobre Panama Project   Candelaria Mine Bode WellFranco Nevada has completed its  1 billion commitment for the Cobre Panama project  In first quarter 2019  Cobre Panama

the end of this year  It also expects this project to reach its mill throughput capacity of 100 million tons per year in 2023  For the ongoing year  the company anticipates to produce 20 000 40 000 ounces gold from Cobre Panama project  The Candelaria mine operation is likely to benefit in the second half of 2019 from more than  1 billion in fleet purchases  stripping and development  The company expects improvement in gold and silver deliveries from Candelaria in the second half of 2019 Franco Nevada remains optimistic about attributable royalty and stream production to total 465 000 500 000 Gold Equivalent Ounces  GEOs  from its mining assets for 2019 Poised Well for the Long TermFranco Nevada strives to generate revenues from precious metals over long term horizon  With precious metals generating around 88 4  of revenues during the March end quarter  the company has the flexibility to consider diversification opportunities outside of the precious metals  space and increase exposure to other commodities while maintaining its long term target Further  Franco Nevada appears to be on a promising long term trajectory backed by a healthy portfolio of streaming and royalty agreements put in place years ago  With more mines coming online in the next several years  it will benefit from higher levels of precious metal sales and higher prices The company had previously guided a solid growth outlook till 2023  forecasting production in the range of 570 000 610 000 GEOs by 2023  With the continued development of its U S  oil   gas assets  the company expects energy assets to contribute 16 17  of revenues by 2023  Moreover  the company has planned expansion or start up of a number of smaller mines over 2019  and more than 50  expansion of Stillwater by 2021  Furthermore  Franco Nevada s balance sheet remains debt free Concern Over Lower Gold PricesThe prices of precious metals  particularly gold  are a determining factor for profitability for Franco Nevada  Gold prices have been affected by the trade tussle between the United States and China  interest rate hikes and a stronger dollar in the past year  During first quarter 2019  average prices of gold and silver were down  Lower prices are likely to weigh on Franco Nevada s performance  Moreover  the company s GEOs may be affected by commodity price volatility Franco Nevada Corporation Price

improvement of 13   The bottom line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents  Despite seasonal factors and unprecedented rainfall levels which impacted construction activity in many of its markets  the company delivered improved results thanks to the execution of various strategic growth initiatives Higher Steel Demand to Drive GrowthStrong bid activity has led to significant growth in the company s backlog  Continued strength in global demand for steel has led to increased margins across the company s segments  Additionally  spending in construction activity in the United States continues to rise  Market conditions in the United States and Poland suggest continued economic growth  which is anticipated to translate into improved long product steel demand Focused Investment in GrowthCapital expenditures were  67 million in the fiscal second quarter  while capital spending for fiscal 2019 is likely to be in the range of  170 million to  225 million  The ramp up of production volumes at the micro mill in Durant  OK  is progressing well  The facility had increased shipments during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and is generating higher than expected returns aided by the strong rebar demand and improved metal margins Construction is well on track at the Arizona micro mill where the company has invested in a second spooler to produce hot spooled rebar  The facility will likely start producing spooled material during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  Commercial Metals has started construction on expanding the finished goods production capacity by approximately

Gerdau S A   a producer of long and specialty steel products in the Americas  In the fiscal second quarter  the acquired assets added  383 6 million to the company s revenues and  32 9 million to operating income The acquisition will add more than 2 million tons of rebar capacity  as well as approximately 800 000 tons of fabricated steel capacity  Additionally  the company will have an expanded geographic presence in the largest construction regions in the United States  This buyout is anticipated to be accretive to earnings and cash flow within the first year of transaction  The company has already developed execution plans to deliver synergies with expectations to exceed  40 million in the coming quarters Few Headwinds RemainInflationary pressure on manufacturing costs owing to tight labor market and consumable raw material prices will dent the company s margins  Furthermore  its debt to equity ratio has shot up  in order to fund the acquisition of certain U S  rebar steel mill and fabrication assets from Gerdau S A  Consequently  higher debt levels and interest expense remain concerns for Commercial Metals  Seasonal factors might also result in lower shipment

divide eased fears about abrupt changes in policies that could easily hurt corporates  And with the United States economy on track for a mind blowing year that could come seriously close to a 13 year milestone  the stock market seems to be in good shape  Thus  investing in solid stocks that can make the most of the current positives seems judicious Best Post Midterm Rally Since 1982As widely expected  the Democrats gained control over the House of Representatives  while Republicans retained control of the Senate  The results  thus  delivered a split Congress and a legislative gridlock for the remaining two years of President Trump s tenure Stock market bulls cheered the outcome  After all  things aren t that bad in case of a divided Congress  Although the markets did get a nice pop in anticipation of tax reforms  the recent trade related issues have been a dampener  Consequently  Democrats controlling the House of Representatives will no doubt compel Trump to tone down his hawkish trade policy stance The Dow Jones finished nearly 550 points higher  or 2 13  on Nov 7 and registered its best one day climb since Oct 16  The broader S P 500 climbed 58 43 points or 2 1   its third best day of 2018  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  further noted that Wednesday marked the biggest post midterm gain for both the Dow and the S P 500 since the day after the 1982 contest  when both the bourses rose 4 3  and 3 9   respectively There are  in fact  a lot of similarities between the 1982 midterm election and this year  Needless to say  36 years back  Republican president Ronald Reagan had majority in the Senate  while Democrats controlled the House Stalemate in Washington  Good for StocksSince 1928  stocks have always generated an annual average return of 12  in years when a Republican president held office  while Congress was split between the red wave and the blue wave  per Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC   And in the year after the midterm election  returns on average have surged more than 20  Goldman further added that where Democrats control the House and Republicans  the Senate  the S P 500 is widely expected to gain 20  on average in the following one year period  Meanwhile  if Republicans had won the House and Democrats the Senate  the S P 500 was anticipated to gain a meager 3  But no matter what the outcome is  the stock market is expected to gain traction post midterm  The S P 500 has increased on average 15 3  in the six months following midterm election in the third year of a given presidency  which is incidentally this year  Research also showed that the frequency of advance  FoA  for this occurrence was 94  of the overall time period of Oct 31  1944 Sep 29  2014  per S P Capital IQ And how can we forget that the stock market  historically  gains in the November through May period or the so called  winter  months  while markets have been more or less flat during the  summer  months  May October  U S  Economy in the PinkBut  why just rely on historic patterns  The U S  economy is doing well and that should eventually help the stock market maintain momentum  In the last two quarters  the U S  economy recorded the fastest six month growth in four years and is on track to hit the Trump administration s annual growth target of 3   If that happens  it would be the best yearly performance since 2005  two years before the Great Recession The U S  economy got a boost in the third quarter  with GDP increasing at an annualized pace of 3 5   per the U S  Commerce Department  In fact  the country s total output of goods and services followed an even stronger 4 2  growth in the second quarter At the same time  consumers in America are currently most confident in almost two decades  courtesy of a healthy labor market

11816,233331,ARCH,Bet On These 5 Top Ranked Liquid Stocks For Stellar Returns,opinion,Liquidity indicates a company s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents  Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns  However  investors often ignore this important yardstick Nonetheless  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination indicates underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see   Growth Style Score less than or equal to B Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only nine Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the

11817,233332,ARCH,Optimism Rises Ahead Of US China Trade Talks  6 Gainers ,opinion,Key stakeholders expressed significant optimism ahead of a crucial round of U S  China trade negotiations  slated to start on Jan 30  While Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted that substantial progress was likely  White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said President Trump was optimistic about a favorable outcome to negotiations in the near term Additionally  Donald Trump faces significant pressure from sections of loyal voters badly hurt by the trade war  Meanwhile  China s administration is also looking for a rapid resolution since the conflict has started harming its economy  This is why an end to the conflict is closer than it seems at first glance Technology  materials and industrial stocks are likely to benefit the most from such an agreement  Adding stocks from these sectors to your portfolio looks like a smart choice Key Stakeholders Express OptimismOn Jan 29  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  one of the strongest supporters in the Trump administration of a trade agreement with China expressed optimism about upcoming talks for the second successive day  Speaking to Fox Business Network  Mnuchin stated that he believes  significant progress  will be made during this week s talks  especially on market access and technology transfer When questioned about the Huawei investigations  Mnuchin said this case and trade negotiations were  separate issues   Meanwhile  Larry Kudlow  director of the U S  National Economic Council  said he was  moderately optimistic  that the United States and China would reach a trade agreement before Mar 2 Meanwhile  Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   CEO Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China have declined significantly  This has created  more optimism in the air in January   Recently  Cook had issued a warning about slowing iPhone sales  This was largely attributable to flagging demand in China Trump  Xi Under Pressure to Reach DealMarket watchers largely believe that significant domestic pressure will be the key catalyst for an early resolution to the U S  China trade conflict  Countervailing tariffs from China have proved to be extremely popular with the key sections of U S  industry  Further  loyal voters from diverse regions have expressed resentment against the ongoing trade conflict China s government also faces significant domestic pressure due to the ongoing trade war  An economic slowdown is well in evidence with the world s second largest economy exhibiting the slowest pace of growth in more than three decades last year  In fact  growth has declined even further in recent months It is  therefore  hardly surprising that China is keen to push through legislation that offers greater protection to foreign companies  The Foreign Investment Law of the People s Republic of China is likely an effort to prevent further heightening of trade tensions with the United States If a deal is not reached by Mar 2  Washington has threatened to raise tariffs on  250 billion of China s exports from 10  to 25   This is why the draft law seeks to address several of the concerns raised by President Trump at his summit meeting with president Xi in in Buenos Aires late last year Our ChoicesKey figures from the Trump administration and leading members from industry have expressed optimism that a near term solution to the U S  China trade war is extremely likely  Meanwhile  the political leadership on both sides face tremendous domestic pressure  increasing the chances of a quick trade deal Technology  materials and industrials stocks will likely gain the most from this development  This is why it makes sense to pick up select stocks from these sectors at this time  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score Jabil Inc    NYSE JBL   is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic

Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Winning Stock Picks from the Top Industries for Job Growth Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile  or paragraph  Well here we are again  with more stock picking insight  straight from last week s Employment Situation report  Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these four industries 1  Professional   Business Services   33 000 up 502 000 over the last 12 months 2  Manufacturing   22 000 up 232 000 over the last 12 months 3  Health Care   22 000 up 264 000 over the last 12 months 4  Mining   9 000Once these reports point you in the right direction  you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis  But you can go to any screener  like the one on Zacks com or the Research Wizard  and locate the sector  then industry of interest Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock picking criteria to

11822,233337,ARCH,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Triumph Bancorp  Century Aluminum  Boise Cascade  Arch Coal And Oasis Midstream,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 11  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Triumph Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ TBK    Century Aluminum Company   NASDAQ CENX    Boise Cascade Company   NYSE BCC    Arch Coal  Inc    NYSE ARCH   and Oasis Midstream Partners LP   NYSE OMP   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Q1 Earnings to Take Wall Street by Storm  Top 5 PicksRecent weeks have been dominated by escalating trade hostility between the United States and China and regulation of Big Tech  Starting this week  corporate earnings  revenues and management outlook will determine the future course of the stock market  Analysts are looking for a strong Q1 earnings season  mostly in response to the corporate tax cut policy signed into law last December  and robust economic growth both at home and abroad While the highest year over year earnings growth is likely to be notched by energy players  materials  construction  industrial products  technology and financials are also expected to contribute handsomely  Thus  for the next few weeks  let us keep an eye on stocks from these sectors that are likely to make the most of the Q1 earnings season  Here  we should also bear in mind that better than expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price  which eventually enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts Q1 Earnings to See Double Digit GainsInvestors are looking forward to the outset of the Q1 earnings season on Apr 12 and 13  when majors like BlackRock  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  will be reporting their Q1 numbers  and for the whole of S P 500 results are expected to be impressive Total earnings for the S P 500 companies are estimated to improve 16  from the same period last year on 7 4  higher revenues  Such an uptick will follow 13 5  earnings growth on 8 5  revenue improvement last quarter  marking the best quarterly performance in more than six years The gains are likely to be broad based  with nearly all the sectors expected to report year over year earnings growth  except for autos and conglomerates  Around 11 of these sectors are likely to come up with double digit growth What Will Drive Earnings Earnings are likely to rise mostly on Trump s polices  including tax cuts and solid global economic growth  The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8  and 15 5  instead of the earlier 35  for bringing back money held overseas Trump s economy is also in good shape  with the jobless rate remaining at a 17 year low of 4 1  in March  while workers  hourly wages rose 8 cents  or 0 3   to  26 82 in the month  The United States at the same time added an average of 202 000 jobs a month in Q1  faster than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016  U S  consumer sentiment in March  by the way  reached its highest level since 2004  courtesy of a healthy job market The global economy too is estimated to expand at a rate of 3 1  year over year in 2018  This comes on top of a promising 3  growth rate in 2017  per the World Bank Potential Gainers of Q1The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors  which is estimated to surge 60 3  from the same period last year on 15 6  higher revenues  Among the sub sectors  oil and gas exploration and production  oil and gas refining and marketing  oil and gas equipment and services  and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth  A healthy crude pricing scenario and positive free cash flow are primarily backing the optimism The materials sector has recently been looking up  with Q1 earnings expected to rise 41 4  on 20 2  higher revenues  Construction is likely to report the third highest year over year profit growth  with Q1 earnings poised to be up 36 1  from the same period last year on 15 9  higher revenues Earnings for the Industrial sector are set to grow 23 9  from the same period last year on 12 3  higher revenues  Firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace  Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs Some analysts  in the meantime  are worried that investors will start to rotate out of the crowded tech sector this year and into other sectors that will benefit from the lower taxes  So far though  in spite of such uncertainty  the technology sector outperformed the broader S P 500  In fact  Q1 earnings for the tech sector are poised to be up 20 7  from the same period last year on 11 4  higher revenues High profits are also expected from financial segments as well  Total Q1 earnings for the financial sector are projected to rise 19 1  from the same period last year on 4 5  higher revenues  Banks  insurers and asset managers are all expected to report double digit growth mostly on heightened volatility and higher interest rates  read more    Buy These 6 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthRepublican tax cut and a very strong economic backdrop looks

11836,233351,ARCH,Robust Private Sector Hiring In March  5 Top Ranked Picks,opinion,U S  private sector employers made robust job additions in March  per a Automatic Data Processing Inc  NASDAQ ADP     ADP   and Moody s Analytics report dated Apr 4  In fact  data from the same proved that the negative market sentiment about U S  tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum by President Trump was overblown Also  the U S  Labor Department s report released on Mar 9 showed that the economy added 313 000 jobs in February 2018  exceeding the consensus estimate of 208 000  However  wages increased by a meager 2 6  on an annualized basis compared with 2 9  in the prior month  Consequently  investors  apprehensions over rising inflation were significantly dispelled The U S  jobless rate currently stands at a 17 year low of 4 1   The ADP Moody s Analytics job data for March indicates that the labor market remains healthy despite the looming fears of trade war  Consequently  stocks from the industries which recruited aggressively in March appear to be lucrative investment options Robust Data for MarchThe ADP Moody s Analytics report revealed that U S  private sector added 241 000 jobs in non farm sectors in March  This seasonally adjusted figure was 2  lower than February s numbers but represents a whopping 97  year over year improvement  This was the fifth consecutive month that ADP Moody s Analytics data showed private payrolls were up by at least 200 000 Job additions in March were fairly broad based in nature  Small  medium and large sized enterprises added 47 000  127 000 and 67 000 employees  respectively  Services producing industries generated 176 000 jobs and goods producing industries generated 65 000 jobs  Professional and business services  trade transport utilities  construction and manufacturing were the major employers Labor Market Remains StableAlso the Fed s projection for the labor market released in March has added a little extra sweetness to the economic scenario  The central bank has reduced its 2018 unemployment rate estimate to 3 8  from 3 9  in December 2017  Unemployment rate is likely to remain stable at 3 6  in 2019 and 2020 better than the central bank s December projection of 3 9  and 4   respectively  This indicates that the U S  labor market will maintain near full employment levels over 2018 2020 Newly introduced tax reforms and deregulation policies are likely to act as a major catalyst   The corporate tax rate was lowered from 35  to 21   Moreover  repatriation of income will be taxed 8  to 15 5   instead of the current 35   President Trump has also promised removing 75  of the regulations during his tenure  Trump s business friendly policies ought to help the private employers How to Identify the Potential Winners Strong business sentiments together with business friendly policies and solid earnings should pave the way for a bull run in the second quarter of 2018  Consequently  it will be wise to invest in those stocks of those sectors which were most aggressive in recruiting  These include the professional and business services  trade transport utilities  construction and manufacturing arenas  However  picking winning stocks can be a difficult task This is where our  comes in handy  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select the winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving

11839,233354,ARCH,Nomad Foods  Arch Coal  Sturm  Ruger   Company  American Outdoor Brands And Vista Outdoor Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 4  2017    Nomad Foods  NYSE    NYSE NOMD       as the Bull of the Day  Arch Coal  NYSE    NYSE ARCH       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Sturm  Ruger   Company  Inc   NYSE    NYSE RGR        American Outdoor Brands Corp   Nasdaq    NASDAQ AOBC       and Vista Outdoor Inc   NYSE    NYSE VSTO       Here is a synopsis of all five stocks                                      With the market on an epic winning streak  breaking on through to all time highs nearly every day  you d think that I d be on here touting some high flying tech stock or a revolutionary biotech company  Well  I m sure you ve heard enough of that from other guys  So today I m digging down into my bag of tricks to find a stock that s in a much more boring  stable industry  That s right folks  with the market at all time highs I m taking a food company as my Bull of the Day Nomad Foods  NYSE      manufactures and distributes frozen foods primarily in the United Kingdom  Italy  Germany  Sweden  France  and Norway  The company s frozen food products include fish  vegetables  poultry products  and ready meals  It sells its products directly or through distribution arrangements to supermarkets and large food retail chains under the Birdseye  Findus  and Iglo brands  The company also sells its products in Austria  Belgium  Spain  the Netherlands  Finland  Greece  Hungary  Ireland  Portugal  Switzerland  and Denmark  Nomad Foods Limited is based in Feltham  the United Kingdom The reason for the Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  on this one is the recent earnings estimate revisions to the upside for next quarter  the current year and next year  Over the last thirty days  analysts have come out and jacked up their numbers for these three time periods  The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for next quarter from 24 cents to 35 cents  That s translated to the current year s numbers going up from 99 cents to  1 13 and next year from  1 10 to  1 29  Sometimes you just gotta let go  Let go of the past that is  Those Member s Only jackets may have had their day in the sun but that doesn t mean they re going to come full circle  And maybe  just maybe  it s time to give up on that 89 Dodge Caravan  Not exactly a classic muscle car  So for you folks out there thinking that we re going to get an epic surge in coal and suddenly West Virginia real estate is going outpace San Francisco  allow this to serve as a cold dose of reality Today s Bear of the Day is Arch Coal  NYSE         Arch Coal  Inc  produces and sells thermal and metallurgical coal from surface and underground mines  The company s flagship mine is the Leer Complex located in Taylor County  West Virginia  As of December 31  2016  it operated 12 active mines located in West Virginia  Kentucky  Virginia  Illinois  Wyoming  and Colorado  The company owned or controlled  primarily through long term leases  approximately 28 315 acres of coal land in Ohio  1 060 acres of coal land in Maryland  46 542 acres of coal land in Virginia  355 205 acres of coal land in West Virginia  103 733 acres of coal land in Wyoming  274 273 acres of coal land in Illinois  85 459 acres of coal land in Kentucky  9 840 acres of coal land in Montana  21 802 acres of coal land in New Mexico  358 acres of coal land in Pennsylvania  and 18 443 acres of coal land in Colorado This summer was actually slightly positive for thermal coal prices in the US  However  the overall market sentiment towards coal continues to be bearish  You have heard some campaign promises from Trump about helping out the coal industry by reducing regulation  I m sure that will continue to happen throughout the next few years  But is this going to be enough to counter market forces leading to lower demand for coal I m not saying you can t make a few bucks in the meantime  but there are easier places to turn a profit than in this industry  Year to date the S P 500 is up 12 8  while shares of ARCH are down 6 7  Additional content Gun Stocks Rally After Las Vegas Mass ShootingShares of gun manufacturing stocks rallied on Oct 2  following the mass shooting that took place on late Oct 1 at a Las Vegas music concert  The violent attack that left more than 50 people dead and over 500 injured  has been described as the deadliest mass shooting on U S  soil Why Did the Gun Stocks Spike Historically  gun stocks have experienced a surge following hostile attacks like mass shooting for reasons both political and emotional  Gun sales usually rise over concerns among customers that such violent events may lead to more stringent gun control legislation  Additionally  customers race to buy guns to defend themselves in anticipation of more such attacks in future Prevailing Trends in the IndustryIt is interesting to note that in the inexplicable dynamics of the gun industry  stocks in this space have witnessed upward movement under leaders who lobby for gun control and vice versa  Evidently  shares of gun makers have remained constrained since Trump became President Statistically  U S  Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  background checks in July fell 25  in over three years  according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation  That was the worst year over year decline in background checks since November 2013  a year after Democratic President Obama won his second election  Background checks being a strong proxy for monthly gun sales  the current numbers hint at a lackluster future for this industry However  in a bid to revive the gun stocks  the Trump administration recently engaged in easing the export rules of small fire arms  including assault rifles  as per report released by Reuters last month  Per the report  Trump s aides are chalking a plan that will transfer the surveillance of international non military firearms sales rights from the State Department to the Commerce Department  It is believed that the new law will be more  lenient  and cut the government red tape regarding the arms sales Notably  the shift of arms export directive to Commerce Department is expected to increase arms sales by 15 20  annually  as projected by Lawrence Keane  senior vice president for the National Shooting Sports Foundation  a firearms industry trade association Gun Stocks in the SpotlightFollowing the Las Vegas incident  U S  gun stocks witnessed notable gains in contrast to the double digit slump most of them have been suffering Here are three top rated gun stocks that have gained significantly following the Las Vegas mass shooting  Considering their positive traits  investors focused in the consumer discretionary stocks can keep these companies in their watchlist Sturm  Ruger   Company  Inc   NYSE        This company is engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of firearms and precision metal investment castings  Its firearms include single shot  auto loading  bolt action  lever action and muzzleloading rifles in a range of hunting calibers  shotguns in three gauges   22 caliber rimfire autoloading pistols and centerfire autoloading pistols in various calibers  single and double action as well as muzzleloading revolvers Its earnings are expected to grow 20 9  in the next year  The company currently holds a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Following the Las Vegas shooting  the company s shares gained 3 5   in the last trading session American Outdoor Brands Corp   Nasdaq        The company is a manufacturer and seller of firearms and accessory products for the shooting  hunting and outdoor enthusiast  The company s product comprises pistols  revolvers  rifles  guns  handcuffs and firearm related products and accessories Its earnings are expected to grow 65  in the next fiscal year  The company currently holds a Zacks Rank  5 The company s shares gained 3 2   in the last trading session Vista Outdoor Inc   NYSE        The company develops  manufacture and distribute optics  accessories and eyewear  Its product includes laser rangefinders  riflescopes  trail cameras  archery accessories  gun care products  mounts  powder  reloading equipment  targets as well as target systems Its annual earnings are expected to grow 32 7  in the next fiscal year  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  The company s shares rose 2 4  in the last trading session Bottom LineThe latest firearm attack has provided an impetus to gun stocks  However  it is unlikely that the trend will persist for long  That this attack may pose a threat to the amendment of the export law  it may also deter gun industry growth  Indeed  the amended law  if sanctioned  has the potential to significantly boost the stocks in this space  Alas  the law s fate and so does that of the gun industry seems to hang in balance  for now Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks Research It s not the one you think About the Bull and Bear of the DayEvery day  the

11840,233355,ARCH,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Arch Coal  CONSOL Energy  CNX Coal Resources And Alliance Resource Partners,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 4  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Coal  Part 2  including Arch Coal Inc   NYSE    NYSE ARCH        CONSOL Energy  NYSE    NYSE CNX        CNX Coal Resources LP  NYSE    NYSE CNX       and Alliance Resource Partners  L P   Nasdaq    NASDAQ ARLP       Industry  Coal  Part 2Link  Energy analysts downplay coal as a fuel source and are quite skeptical about its prospects  However  President Trump can become a game changer for the coal industry with his promised relaxation of emissions rules Apart from the relaxation of stringent environment legislation  coal demand also benefited from the higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in the global market  An increase in steel production from Asian countries like China and Japan will pave the way for shipments of metallurgical coal Per a report from the World Coal Association  there are currently 861 billion tons of proven coal reserves worldwide  implying that there is enough coal to last nearly 112 years at the current rates of production  Compared with this  proven oil and gas reserves are predicted to last around 46 and 54 years  respectively  at the current production levels The current availability of coal even outpaces the combined proven reserves of oil and gas  So  the advantages of coal cannot be overlooked and will definitely brighten the long term prospects of investors Trump s decision to walk out from the Paris Climate Agreement and repeal the Clean Power Plan should keep fossil fuel based electricity generation afloat longer  Also  the recent Supreme Court ruling temporarily halted the implementation of the Clean Power Plan Let s dig a little deeper into the factors driving this industry Coal Dominates U S  Power Generation  Coal is still among the major sources of fuel for electricity generation in the United States  Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   total U S  coal consumption will increase 0 9  from 2016 levels to 683 7 million short tons  MMst  and to 708 MMst in 2018 Apart from an increase in consumption of coal in electricity production  the EIA forecasts prices of coal to gradually increase for electric production  The price of coal is anticipated to increase from  2 11 per million Btu in 2016 to  2 15 per million Btu in 2017 and to  2 19 per million Btu in 2018 Not Just Electricity Generation  Electricity generation is just one use of coal in the United States  Manufacturing plants and industries use it to make chemicals  cement  paper  ceramics and metal products  etc  Methanol and ethylene  which can be prepared from coal gas  are used to make products such as plastics  medicines  fertilizers and tar Certain industries consume large amounts of coal  For example  concrete and paper companies burn coal and the steel industry uses coke and coal by products to make steel for bridges  buildings and automobiles  Per the EIA  consumption of coal in other sectors is expected to increase year over year in 2017 by 1 2 MMst tons to 53 7 MMst tons  Usage is expected to improve further in 2018 to 55 8 MMst tons Coal as Input for Steel Industry  Due to its heat producing nature  hard coal  metallurgical or coking coal  forms a key ingredient in the production of steel  Nearly 70  of global steel production depends on coal  Since  met coal  is an essential ingredient for the production of steel  U S  met coal producers are likely to benefit from the increase in steel consumption Although the steel industry is expected to remain under pressure for some time  it is certainly expected to grow on the back of flourishing automotive and construction industries  A recent report by The World Steel Association predicts global steel demand to increase 1 3  to 1 535 2 Mt in 2017 and another 0 9  to 1 548 5 Mt in 2018  This definitely is a ray of hope for metallurgical coal producers and will boost prospects of metallurgical coal producers like Arch Coal Inc   NYSE       Demand Upsurge in Asian Countries  The increasing demand for coal in Asian economies like China and India has been a key price driver since the end of recession in 2009  We expect this trend to continue in the future  primarily owing to rising energy needs in India  China and Southeast Asian countries Though Asian countries also produce coal  it is not sufficient to meet the growing demand in the region  resulting in regular imports  Southeast Asia has a surging demand for electricity  chiefly due to its improving economies  Numerous coal based power plants are presently under construction and more are being planned over the next few years  This will create ample export opportunities for the U S  thermal coal producers China and India s demand for coal in 2017 is much better than 2016 levels which can boost U S  coal companies  export volume  Rising demand of electricity in India is creating demand for coal and policy changes in China are driving its demand Coal exports for the first half of 2017 were 55  higher than exports over the same period last year  EIA projects coal exports for 2017 at 73 MMst  21  higher than the 2016 level MLP and Diversification  Coal based MLPs might be a mitigating element for the ailing coal industry  One such instance is CONSOL Energy  NYSE       creating CNX Coal Resources LP  NYSE        which currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Coal companies are also resorting to diversification and are on the lookout for other sources of revenue besides coal  CONSOL Energy for the past couple years has been expanding its natural gas portfolio and lowering coal operation To Sum UpInterestingly  among all other coal companies  Alliance Resource Partners  L P   Nasdaq        carrying a Zacks Rank  3  seems to be operating on a different level  The partnership surpassed earnings estimates in the last four quarters  Alliance Resource s performance is particularly noteworthy since most of the big names in the space were trying to survive in the same period  You can see  The importance of coal in the fuel source chain is far from over  For the aggressively growing and energy hungry Asian economies  coal seems to be the most popular source of power generation  despite inroads being made by renewables Coal is by far the most stable source of energy  The majority of the coal consumed in the United States is actually produced in America and the coal industry provides jobs to thousands of Americans  The  America First  approach of President Trump will help the coal stocks bounce back Even with the closing down of coal fired units  coal production and consumption are set to increase in 2017 and 2018 in the U S  This is testimony to the fact that coal will continue to be utilized in electricity generation for the foreseeable future despite increasingly stringent emission control regulations  This surely makes it a good long term investment Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market

11857,233372,ARCH,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Arch Coal  Peabody Energy  Alliance Holdings And Alliance Resource Partners,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 3  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Coal  Part 1  including Arch Coal Inc   NYSE    NYSE ARCH        Peabody Energy  NYSE    NYSE BTU        Alliance Holdings GP  L P   Nasdaq    NASDAQ AHGP       and Alliance Resource Partners  L P   Nasdaq    NASDAQ ARLP       Industry  Coal  Part 1Link    The U S  coal industry has been challenged by stringent environmental regulations over the last few years  Former President Obama s introduction of Clean Power Plan made things worse for the industry  With the policy s initiation  coal as a fuel source was pushed back further by increasing usage of natural gas and renewable energy sources to produce electricity However  conditions for the coal industry have started to change for the better after the election of the new president  Donald Trump wants to revive the industry and relax regulations that are hurting its prospects  He has started to act on his campaign promises and has taken measures to repeal the Climate Power Plan  Trump also walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement The Climate Power Plan and Paris agreement have the same objective of lowering emission levels  Coal usage to generate electricity and in other heavy manufacturing industries are the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions  No doubt we will see extended use of coal in different industries  which will help coal companies progress through these difficult times Coal is currently mined in more than 50  of U S  states  The top five coal producing states   Wyoming  40  of the total   West Virginia      Illinois  6   and Pennsylvania  6     contribute the major share of the total coal production of the country  per reports from the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  Unfortunately  all major U S  coal producers have been affected by the drastic fall in demand  and consequently prices have dipped  However  demand for coal is rising again due to helpful legislation and hike in natural gas prices  Revival of demand from China is also going to have a positive impact on overall demand for coal as source of energy It is certain that the prospects of the coal industry are gradually changing  This industry has seen difficult times  with a drop in demand and prices and major companies filing for bankruptcy protection  However  we have seen Arch Coal Inc   NYSE       and Peabody Energy  NYSE       successfully completing their financial restructuring and are trading again Per a recent release from EIA  U S  coal production touched its lowest point since 1978 in 2016  However  the EIA expects that given the gradual revival in demand and export of coal  U S  coal production will improve by 4 7  and 1 5  year over year in 2017 and 2018  respectively  The EIA expects an increase in U S  coal exports to contribute to a 5  rise in coal production in 2017 Per EIA data  in the first eight months of 2017  527 879 thousand short tons of coal was produced in the United States  This fared well compared with 463 600 thousand short tons of coal produced in the same period last year Coal and its various byproducts also find use in the industrial sector  underscoring its manifold advantages  However  unchecked usage of this fossil fuel has raised concerns in all quarters  especially those concerned with carbon emissions leading to greenhouse gas effects Zacks Industry Rank  NegativeWe rank the 265 sub industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries in two groups   the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one   To learn more visit  About  The Zacks Industry Rank  which relies on the same estimate revision methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks  currently puts the coal industry at 212 out of 265 industries in our expanded industry classification  This places the industry in the second group  corresponding to a negative outlook  However  we expect this industry outlook to change as President Trump s coal friendly initiatives will have some positive impact on the industry Of the 18 coal companies presently in our coverage  Alliance Holdings GP  L P   Nasdaq       sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and two stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Among the remaining coal companies in the space  nine carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   three carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and three have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Coal Valuation Look ExpensiveThe valuation of the industry looks expensive at present  The industry is currently trading at 18 9x P E multiple  This looks quite expensive compared to its own traded multiple  median of 15 78x  in the last 12 months  as well as the S P 500  19 97x  In addition  the coal industry has rallied much lower than the S P 500 in the 12 month period  The industry has witnessed an increase of 2 1  compared with the S P 500 s gain of 16 2  in the same period Earnings Review   OutlookOut of the 18 coal companies in our coverage  14 have come up with second quarter earnings results  Out of the 14 releases  five companies or 35 7  delivered a positive earnings surprise while the other eight missed earnings expectations and one matched estimates Alliance Resource Partners  L P   Nasdaq        currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3  surpassed second quarter estimates by 11 25   Its 2017 estimates have moved up 1 3  to  3 21 while its 2018 estimates have increased 7 3  to  1 79 in the last 60 days Miners have taken initiatives to cut costs while engaging in tactful expenditures to ensure coal mining safety  Further  high cost coal mines are being shuttered while operations are moved to low cost regions  Longwall coal mining techniques are also having a positive impact on production  The marketing teams of coal companies have been working hard to secure new contracts and renew existing long term contracts The positive developments  thanks to supportive legislations and a revival of global prices  will boost the performance of the coal stocks at least in near future if not over a longer period of time Bottom LineCoal stocks are suffering  and some presume they won t survive in the long run  Loads of negative factors are weighing on coal stocks  but do these companies have the resources to fight back successfully  We know for a fact that coal reserves at the current pace of production and consumption will last longer than all other fossil fuel resources  Further  coal is still far cheaper than other fuel sources President Trump no doubt has brought in some hope for this sinking industry  Plus  big names coming out of bankruptcy indicate a gradual turnaround of the coal group  Even though the damage done to this industry has yet to be compensated fully  the positive changes are already noticeable Even with drawbacks  coal will still account for nearly 30  of the electricity produced in the United States in 2016   not a bad achievement for an industry that has been under tremendous pressure from natural gas and booming alternative energy sources Further  the EIA has forecasted that U S  coal production will increase year over year in 2017 and 2018  This is an encouraging sign for coal investors  We still believe that coal s cost advantage and worldwide availability make it more commonly accepted source of power generation Today s

11861,233376,ARCH,Neither Stocks Nor Bonds Will Provide Protection In The Coming Market,opinion,"This week Mr  Bear was on the job again  as seen in his report card below  At week s close the 200 count is up to 12 and we see 3 Dow Jones 2  days in its eight day count  Since Charles Dow began publishing his stock average in 1885  you seldom see the Dow s 200 count at twelve or its 8 count at three except when the stock market is under stress  Keep in mind that days of extreme breadth and volatility are rare market events  Unless the market is under pressure  as it has been since the beginning of 2016  one just doesn t see five extreme market events in ten trading days as seen below 


Don t get me wrong  I m not cheering for Mr  Bear  He s going to hurt everyone before he s through  But understand that he s a force of nature  something to be feared  a reason  policy makers  and  market experts  decades ago should not have put clueless college professors in charge of the money supply and credit creation at the Federal Reserve  But ever since Greenspan s amazing bull market of the 1990s a lot of damage has been inflicted on financial markets  Mr  Bear now intends to see just how low he can drag the debt and equity markets before he s ready to go back into hibernation 
This week the Dow Jones closed down 12 69  from its all time high last May  That alone shouldn t be a big concern  But for those in charge of this circus  the people who know exactly how the Dow Jones made it over 18 000 in 2015  it is  They know all market valuations today are based on nothing but hot air  and the financial markets they pumped up with monetary inflation are now deflating  Not that they intend to take a hands off approach now in managing the market  Certainly not during an election year with so many baby boomers counting on their retirement accounts in the years to come  So stay tuned for some really idiotic  policy initiatives  to keep the markets inflated in the months to come 
Here s the chart of the Dow Jones with its 52Wk highs and lows  Fourteen months after QE3 ended  the venerable Dow is making its second foray into the 15 000s  just 322 points from a new 52Wk Low at Friday s close 
We could easily see the Dow Jones make a new 52 week low on Monday  although we may see a few positive days of extreme breadth and volatility first  Historically the stock market sees its largest daily advances during big bear markets  Daily advances of over 10  were not uncommon during the Great Depression  The credit crisis bear also saw a few daily gains of 10   which in no way signaled the end of the bear market  But you d never know that by listening to the talking heads on CNBC   Cheap stocks  in a big bear have a way of getting cheaper with the passage of time 



While the Dow Jones may be close to making a new 52Wk Low  companies trading on the NYSE have been doing exactly that as evident in my next chart  The NYSE 52Wk H L Ratio hasn t risen above 10  since the summer of 2014  and the most recent peak in the ratio was just 8 52  last March  Our current market decline has been a long time coming 


Here s my working table for NYSE 52Wk Highs and Lows  To make things simple I have noted in English when the Dow Jones or the NYSE Ratio sees an up or down day  Since December 1st note how often the Ratio sees a down day on days the Dow Jones advances   not a sign of market strength  The  DJIA BEV  column lists the percentage decline the Dow Jones was from its May 2015 all time high  The  Days BEV Zero  column gives how many trading days have passed since the Dow Jones  last all time high  The stunning thing about this table is how NYSE 52Wk lows have skyrocketed in the eight trading days since January 5th 


The most extreme day for the NYSE 52Wk Ratio during the credit crisis bear occurred on 10 October 2008   87 45   That day the Dow Jones saw its first 40  decline since November 1974 and 2 891 of the 3 306 NYSE stocks trading that day made a new 52Wk Low  You should also note in the chart above that although the Dow Jones may have bottomed on 09 March 2009  for most of the companies trading on the NYSE the worst had already passed  Thanks to the Federal Reserve flooding the stock market with  liquidity  the Ratio recovered to down just  18 75  on March 09th with only 600 new NYSE 52Wk Lows 

It was a bleak week for the Dow Jones Total Market Group  DJTMG   No new 52Wk Highs but forty five of seventy six groups reached new 52Wk Lows  The group s average   54  was  22 1  from its 52Wk High and only 3 42  from its 52Wk Low  Things are bleak for the group  but in big bear markets things have a way of becoming even bleaker 

The table below makes two things clear 
  PPI and CPI   22   24  are contrived government statistics that have nothing to do with commodity prices in the real world    To have made any money in the commodity markets over the past year one had to be holding a short position 


FYI   20 above is Corn  not Com 

Declining commodity prices are having an impact on the larger economy  Debt laden energy companies  non ferrous miners and family farmers are all in danger of defaulting on debts accumulated during better times  The share prices for Freeport McMoran  N FCX   the huge copper gold miner  have declined by 40  in the first few days of the New Year 

 Weak oil and copper prices are really amplifying Freeport s biggest issue  which is its gargantuan debt level  That debt recently resulted in the company s credit being downgraded by Fitch  while it was also put on review for a downgrade by Moody s  


It was not so long ago everyone knew that higher  not lower energy costs were bearish for mining companies  As noted above  obviously someone changed that rule 
In a poison pen article titled  Another One Bites the Dust  by a  progressive blogger  we see the environmental lobby s reaction to this week s bankruptcy of Arch Coal  N ACI  

 Arch Coal has worked to gut basic environmental and public health protections and cheat miners out of benefits  all while cooking the climate and destroying complex ecosystems across the country  When history is written  Arch will not be cast as a good guy  


I m sure if I looked I could find a similar  progressive  article on the declining fortunes of the shale oil companies  Obama ran for president promising to destroy the coal mining industry  the only promise he made eight years ago he has managed to keep  The looming default by these coal companies on hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds seem to be of no concern to the environmental lobby  at least not yet  However before 2016 is through  they may regret the damage to their personal portfolios  company pension funds and life insurance companies should panic in the bond market breaks out  I wonder how many municipalities whose tax rolls depend heavily on the coal mining industry are also destined to default on their bonds 

Prices for basic commodities have been volatile for decades  Here are two charts for the price of a barrel of oil  in dollars and a BEV format  The two post 2000 declines in the price of crude oil are painfully apparent in the dollar chart below 


The Bear s Eye View  BEV  chart below shows just how volatile the price of energy has been since 1983  when 60  declines in the price of oil have been the rule rather than the exception 


The story told above by the price for a barrel of oil is no different than for many other commodities listed in the table above  So why have declining commodity prices brought so much turmoil in the mining and energy industries since 2014 
Coal s problems are unique  The environmental left whose control over the Federal Government s Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  is total  declared a jihad against coal mining decades ago  The switch from coal to natural gas for domestic electricity production was a master s stroke for them  one from which the coal industry will not recover  But for companies like Freeport their current problems can be placed at the table of central banks  like the Federal Reserve  who since the stock market s 2000 top have continually  stimulated their economies  with monetary inflation 
Monetary inflation was accomplished by  injecting  credit into the banking system   checkbook  money created out of nothing   whose members  banks  at first found ready clients with sound balance sheets for bank loans at  attractive  rates  Credit was also injected indirectly into the bond market to fund mining projects that were not economically feasible at an unmanipulated market rate of interest or uninflated commodity prices  A significant percentage of this credit was used to finance projects that had no actual demand  such as cities in China where hundreds of thousands  millions   of people could live  but still today remain unoccupied  In retrospect maybe it was a wise decision for China to invest in vacant cities for eventual occupation rather than hold all their dollar profits in US Treasury or Agency debt  But the demand for copper to wire these ill advised cities and connect them to the electrical grid was huge   but now gone 
Look at copper s BEV chart below  Twice in the 1970s  copper prices declined over 60  from a previous all time high  Did these declines result in any bond defaults by the large copper miners at the time  Not that I can recall  In 2002  with copper prices 68  below their last all time high  Freeport was a thriving copper miner  But the  economic stimulus  central banking  injected  into the global economy eventually drove demand and the price for copper to new all time highs with Freeport  and everyone else  taking full advantage of the cheap credit  injected  into the financial system  Now in 2016  with copper down 56   and apparently still declining  from its last all time high  most non ferrous mining companies  like Freeport  are having problems servicing the debts they ve taken on since 2002  Coal and Non Ferrous Miners are  1 and 2 in my table for the DJTMG for good reason 


The problem Freeport  China and American college students are now struggling with is best described by the Mogambo Guru below 
 Debt is the icky residue that remains after money is borrowed and spent  
  Mogambo Guru  aka Richard Daughty
Understanding the exact problem the world at large now faces is no more complicated than this  corporations  governments and individuals on a global scale have borrowed and spent money created out of nothing by central banks freed from the constraints of the old gold standard  This money created out of nothing flowing from the banking system has allowed the world to consume far above its ability to repay banks and bond holders  Debt growth exceeding the income needed to service it is now a global phenomenon half a century after the Federal Government terminated the dollar s last vestiges to the  35 an ounce gold standard 
As business and sales turn down  NYSE listed companies will begin laying off employees to reduce costs in an attempt to service their debts  That will result in a decrease in personal income in the chart below and an increase in personal bankruptcies and defaults on consumer debt  For a time the two plots in the chart below may diverge further than they already have  But it s late in the game  They may begin to collapse in the not to distance future 

Just when this will happen I can t say  However the Inventory to Sales Ratio plot below shows inventories  unsold goods  have increased faster than sales since 2011  This is par for the course before an economic decline and debt liquidation  Just this week Walmart  N WMT  announced it was closing 269 of its outlets  half of which are located in the US  No doubt the stores being closed were mostly chosen for their inability to move inventory out the door  Macy s  N M  is having problems too 
I also expect a massive increase in unemployment  Unlike the spike in the ratio seen during the credit crisis  today it s unlikely that a new round of massive monetary inflation  QE  will drive sales up  and bring the ratio down as swiftly as it did in 2009  It would more likely go into personal savings  or be used to pay down debt by a rapidly aging population 

Here s the most popular chart I publish   EP s BEV plot  Since Barron s 02 November 2015 issue  economic demand for EP has declined  The question I have is whether or not the current market decline will result in a second 5  decline in EP  as happened in December 2009  Maybe I got it backwards   the current decline in EP  economic contraction  might be leading the financial markets down 
This chart is simply amazing  The United States hasn t seen demand for electric power increase to a new all time high since August 2008  six months before Obama became president  There is something very wrong with the economy that is not being addressed   too much debt  More monetary inflation can t fix that 

No doubt about it  the years to come will prove interesting  if not enjoyable  After decades of  financial engineering  by Wall Street s derivative salesmen  something really bad is coming our way  Holding some gold and silver bullion to guard against counterparty failure seems the logical way to provide some protection for what is coming our way  That done  some exposure to the precious metal miners is warranted too ",2016-01-17,Mark Lundeen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/neither-stocks-nor-bonds-will-provide-protection-in-the-coming-market-380350,380350
11862,233377,ARCH,Waiting Now As the VIX Coils Its Springs ,opinion,"T2108 Status  9 3 T2107 Status  12 9   a fresh near 7 year closing low VIX Status  26 1   high of the day was 27 6  right under the 2012 intraday highGeneral  Short term  Trading Call  bullishActive T2108 periods  Day  8 under 20   Day  11 under 30   Day  27 under 40   Day  31 below 50   Day  46 under 60   Day  387 under 70 
Commentary T2108 closed at 9 3  on day  8 of this oversold period  Traders positioning for the next  relief  rally have been holding their collective noses for a third day now as the trading action continues to stink   to use a technical term  Three out of the last four trading days have ended with T2108 in single digits  Using the historical data I laid out last week  this scenario suggests that this oversold period could reach for a 15 day span just in time for the next meeting of the Federal Reserve 
While T2108 closed with a marginal gain  the S P 500  SPY  struggled mightily to close flat for the day  I am not calling this a bullish divergence because the change in T2108 is so small relative to the size of this bearish trading action 

The S P 500  SPY  is struggling mightily to hold support from the August Angst 
As the reality of an extended oversold period has sunk into my consciousness  I pulled the trigger on precious few trades  So now comes the time for waiting  I am waiting for a signal from the volatility index  the VIX  The last element of the T2108 trading rules is to make a move once volatility  spikes   Given my current aggressive positioning  it makes little sense to continue accumulating until the nature of trading changes in my favor  A spike in the VIX could and should signal the imminent end of this oversold period 
I now define a spike as a move well above the upper Bollinger Band  The VIX put on such a show during the flash crash of the August Angst  It is a moment when panic and fear ramp to climax levels  the ultimate peak of seller s exhaustion  I like to buy into such spikes  more conservative traders can wait until the VIX completely reverses the gains from the spike and start accumulating from there   Note that during the August Angst  the S P 500 still soon retested its lows after the volatility spike completely reversed  

I am scratching my head wondering why how the intraday high from 2012 is STILL delivering overhead resistance to the VIX 
Incredibly  despite all this persistently bearish trading action  the VIX STILL cannot crack resistance from the intraday high from 2012  This loitering around such an important resistance level makes the VIX start to look like a coiled spring  So now I wait 
As promised  I wrote an update to     I called it     Basically  if current support on the S P 500 cannot hold firm  the  200DMA signal  suggests we could be in for a 2000 or 2008 magnitude sell off albeit dragged out over time  Interestingly  Jim Cramer  last night on Mad Money using the work of famed Fibonacci technician Carolyn Boroden  Similarly  she agrees with T2108 technicals that an oversold bounce of notable size appears imminent  This is some SERIOUS bear bull tension 


After hours brought a shred of positive news with Netflix  O NFLX  managing to tack on another 7 2  on top of the 3 7  gain in the regular session  All eyes will likely be on NFLX s post earnings trading action  The stock s ability to hold support at its 200 day moving average  DMA  and then hold post earnings gains would be baby steps in the right direction  However  NFLX s relative strength has meant that NFLX s good fortunes have not necessarily translated into the fortunes of the masses  Needless to say  if NFLX manages to close below 200DMA support  such a move would add yet more anchors to bearish sentiment 

Netflix is one of the few stocks in the market still holding its 200DMA as support 
One sector in dire need of a return to cheer is the solar sector  Late last year  I admired the select bullish setups in solar stocks  Now  First Solar  O FSLR  is just about the last one left standing without a fresh breakdown  I contrast FSLR with Solar City  SCTY  as an example of the sharp divergences 

The good tidings from the Goldman upgrade did not last long  but First Solar is still holding strong at 50DMA support 

No good tidings for Solar City  O SCTY  as Chanos emerges victorious once again  Support at the 200DMA gave way to a wicked breakdown in the stock 
Finally  I neglected to acknowledge  of Arch Coal Inc  N ACI   ACI  last week  That final collapse brought a merciful end to the trade I described at the beginning of December as  A  Last Chance  Trade on Arch Coal   A title never rang so true  I am now curious to hear what Soros has to say about this turn of events  His massive bet on the company earlier in 2015 gave coal stocks one last gasp of hope

11863,233378,ARCH,Will Q4 Earnings Signal The End For These 3 Energy Companies ,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
On Monday January 11th  Arch Coal filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11  Arch Coal  OTC ACIIQ  was the second largest U S coal producer  It s now the fourth U S coal company to have declared bankruptcy in the past year  along with Alpha Natural Resources  OTC  ANZRQ   Patriot Energy  and Walter Energy  OTC WLTGQ  
The outlook for coal companies is bleak  Environmental concerns about the usage of coal has spurred new  restrictive regulations  curbing the use of the commodity and driving consumers and industrial companies to favor natural gas 
Coal companies aren t the only victims of the current carnage in the energy sector  Many oil exploration and production companies are also feeling the pain  On January 6th of this year the NYSE announced that trading on SandRidge Energy was suspended and the stock delisted because of  abnormally low  price levels  Miller Energy  a Texas based oil and gas driller filed for bankruptcy on October 1  2015 
And that s just the tip of the iceberg  More than three dozen energy companies have filed for bankruptcy in 2015  among them Swift Energy  New Gulf Resources  LLC  Magnum Hunter Resources Corporation  Cubic Energy  Inc   and Energy   Exploration Partners  Inc  which all filed in December 2015 alone  Overall  more than  17 billion worth of oil company funds are tied up in secured and unsecured debt  according to a 
Because of the business model of most energy sector companies which relies heavily on borrowing prohibitive sums of money in order to finance exploration  extraction and production activities before the first drop of oil or gas can be sold and any revenues booked with the latest market downturn and precariously low oil and gas prices  energy companies find themselves in an uncertain situation  U S  conventional oil extraction is estimated to have technical costs of around  85 USD per barrel  not including taxes or dividends to shareholders  The only countries still profitable at current oil prices are Saudi Arabia  Iran and Iraq  This chart  from the linked article illustrates the situation 
Source  Alliance Bernstein  October 2014
Which explains why energy companies are so tethered to commodities prices  For U S  companies  profitability depends on approximately  100 per barrel price for oil  That s a far cry from what we re seeing now  Commodity prices at lower levels than a company may have bargained for leaves companies powerless  unable to eke out enough revenue to repay outstanding debt 
With Halliburton  N HAL  reporting earnings on Monday  January 25th  Baker Hughes  N BHI  on the 28th  and Phillips 66  N PSX  on the 29th  the energy sector enters the Q4 playing field  Here are 3 high risk  potentially high reward  energy companies that could be facing  make it or break it  circumstances going forward 
Will they default or will investors and traders double down after they report 
1  Chesapeake Energy
Chesapeake  N CHK  has been free falling for almost a year and a half now  on the slump in commodity prices  Priced at  29 39 a share at the end of June 2014  the company closed on Friday at a meager  3 51  a fraction of its former price 
The bankruptcy threat for Chesapeake comes from multiple directions  To begin with  the amount of long term debt the company has taken on is hefty  about  10 6 billion according to the Q3 2015 report  It s safe to say   25 oil prices were likely not expected by anyone when the debt was assumed  Chesapeake also has a 0 78 current ratio  a measure of a company s liquidity vis a vis its assets  suggesting it could run into problems settling its upcoming liabilities  Indeed  for comparison purposes  an ideal current ratio would approach 2 0  On top of all this   2 8 billion in capital expenditures were sunk into the business during the first 9 months of 2015  in an attempt to drill new wells 
Was there really a need to drill new wells amid a bruising slump in commodity prices  crippling the company s cash flow  Hard to say  However  it s clear that if oil doesn t recover soon  we could see Chesapeake heading for bankruptcy protection  On the other hand  the stock is already priced for a disastrous year which includes every potential worst case scenario except for bankruptcy  If bankruptcy isn t in the cards  we believe a strong recovery will surely occur eventually  Chesapeake s Q4 earnings report is due on Wednesday  February 24th 

2  Comstock Resources
Like Chesapeake  Comstock  N CRK  crashed in the second half of 2014  The company fell from a high of  29 49 on July 1  2015 to its close on Friday of  1 70  and for good reason  revenues plunged from  145 million in Q3 2014 to  61 million in Q3 2015  with earnings declining from   0 19 to   1 06 per share  Without a doubt  the revenue decline is unsustainable and that alone could spell the company s downfall  Moreover  this decline leaves Comstock highly leveraged  with a total debt to EBITDA  Revenue   Expenses  excluding tax  interest  depreciation and amortization  ratio of 6 5 which raises questions about its ability to overcome the debt it has accumulated  In comparison  Chevron  N CVX  has a much healthier EBITDA of  21 6B to  35 8B of debt  a ratio of 1 65 
Back in November  Moody s  Comstock debt to Caa2 status with a negative outlook  showing a lack of faith in the ability of the company to straighten the ship amid low gas and oil prices  which have plummeted further in the past couple of months  On the bright side  Comstock s first wave of bonds won t mature until the end of 2017  The stock also bounced 61  in the second half of last week  after falling to under one dollar per share on January 14  the line at which NYSE officials reconsider a company s listing on the exchange  Being delisted from a major exchange can cause capital problems for publicly traded companies which often rely on the prestige of the exchange for their financing activities 
The recent bounce clearly shows that investors have not given up on the company and will try to ride it back up should oil and gas prices increase before the company runs out of wiggle room  Comstock s Q4 earnings announcement will take place on Monday February 8th 

3  Peabody Energy
Coal miner Peabody Energy Corp  N BTU   with  6 2 billion in long term debt and an EBITDA of  545 million is  like Comstock  highly leveraged  The stock and its bonds have been regularly downgraded over the past few months by rating companies  with Moody s lowering Peabody s credit rating to a dangerous Caa3 in late December  But the coal industry s troubles are now deeper than just low commodity prices  having been exacerbated by President Obama s plan to tackle greenhouse gases from coal powered power plants  As mentioned earlier  Arch Coal has already gone under  and the entire industry should be watched carefully in the coming months  A bit over a week ago  the Obama administration ordered a pause on issuing coal mining leases on federal lands  a decree roundly criticized by Republican politicians who say it is  ravaging the coal country  
If that s the case  the situation for Peabody is not just a matter of global economic supply and demand  but rather a case of direct interference by the Federal government in order to promote a Presidential climate change agenda  Peabody has  1 5 billion worth of bonds maturing in 2018  but before that even occurs  it appears its fate could be determined by policy makers rather than in the state of the market  Peabody reports Q4 earnings on Monday January 25th  and has a staggering earnings per share forecast of   8 58 ",2016-01-25,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-q4-earnings-signal-the-end-for-these-3-energy-companies-381500,381500
11864,233379,ARCH,What Twitter  Tesla Have In Common With Peabody And Energy XXI  Debt,opinion,"Two high profile commodity companies filed for bankruptcy last week  The first was St  Louis based coal producer Peabody Energy Corp  OTC BTUUQ   Peabody was the latest coal producer to file  following Arch Coal Inc  OTC ACIIQ   Alpha Natural Resources Inc  OTC ANRZQ   Patriot Coal  and Walter Energy Inc  OTC WLTGQ   BTU quickly fell below  1 on the news  Just a few years ago  Peabody s market capitalization exceeded  20 billion  On Wednesday  Houston offshore oil producer Energy XXI Ltd  NASDAQ EXXI  joined Peabody in bankruptcy court  Four years ago  EXXI was a  32 stock  On Thursday  the day after it announced its bankruptcy filing  it closed at 12 cents 
When the end comes  it comes quickly 
There are two reasons these companies fell from grace so precipitously  First  their revenues cratered as the prices of their primary products collapsed  Second  both companies are loaded to the gills with debt  Lots of debt  Specifically  Peabody has roughly  5 5 billion of debt outstanding  while Energy XXI has about  5 billion  Once revenues began to fall  and fall steeply  it was only a matter of time until BTU and EXXI crumbled under those onerous obligations 
I m always dumbfounded by the buoyancy of troubled stocks like EXXI and BTU as they approach a bankruptcy filing  In recent weeks  both traded well above  1  Shockingly  Peabody was a  6 55 stock only one month ago  While retail and other investors were buying these dogs  the publicly traded debt of each company was plummeting  and rating agencies and credit analysts who usually do a better job analyzing companies than stock analysts were warning investors about impending doom 
Given these clear signals  why were BTU and EXXI  and countless troubled stocks before them  able to remain overvalued right up until the moment they went broke  And why did both companies willingly saddle themselves with killer debt loads to begin with 
The answer to the second question isn t complicated  borrowing money is way too easy in the corporate world  That s because facilitating debt deals is way too profitable for Wall Street  Ivy League educated investment bankers are experts at convincing CEOs and company Boards to raise money via bond offerings 
The answer to the first question is a little more involved  Put simply  investors  as a group  overlook the dangers of debt on a company s balance sheet  Two stocks outside of the commodity space illustrate this point  Both Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  and Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  have taken on billions in debt in recent years  and yet nobody seems to have noticed  or care  Despite the fact that Twitter is sitting on nearly  3 5 billion of cash  the company sold almost  2 billion of convertible debt in 2015  Last year  Twitter paid almost  100M in interest on those bonds  Tesla reported  2 6 billion of debt and  1 2 billion of cash on its year end balance sheet  and paid  119M in interest in 2015  Meanwhile  GAAP losses at both companies in 2015 were enormous  Twitter lost  521M and Tesla lost  889M  While both reported much better ebitda amounts Twitter s was  558M  while Tesla lost  only   294M they both had large capital expenditures  Tesla spent  1 6 billion  Twitter  inexplicably  spent  347 million  If either company has an unexpected revenue slowdown or recall  they might deeply regret borrowing those billions 
Investors may underestimate the perils of high debt loads because our society itself does so  Homeowners are encouraged to take on mortgage debt  Most cars are bought with borrowed money  Student loan debt now exceeds  1 2 trillion  Outstanding debt on credit cards which usually charge high  double digit interest rates is about  1 trillion  The Granddaddy of all borrowers  of course  is Uncle Sam  Our nation s outstanding debt is approaching  19 trillion  up from about  10 trillion only eight years ago  Someday  possibly before I go to the giant credit bureau in the sky  folks worldwide might stop buying America s short duration debt and our 10  and 30 year bonds at today s all time low interest rates  That would be an economic disaster  As a country  we spend  600 billion year servicing our national debt  If we were forced to pay much higher interest rates to borrow  that number could easily rise to  1 trillion or more  which would  crowd out  spending on defense  entitlement programs  and so called discretionary items  government agencies  schools  infrastructure projects  NASA  etc   A severe recession and a lower standard of living would follow  Borrowers and investors in stocks with excessive debt  beware ",2016-04-19,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-twitter-and-tesla-have-in-common-with-peabody-and-energy-xxi:-debt-200125554,200125554
11865,233380,ARCH,4 Green Stocks To Buy Despite A Trump Presidency,opinion,Among the vaunted gainers from the Trump victory  energy stocks received a boost as soon as news of his win trickled in  The President elect s promises to revive the coal industry and provide policy related assistance to the oil and gas industry have come as a breather for the beleaguered sector In contrast  Trump s stance on sustainable energy options  such as solar power  has been interpreted as a body blow to companies from the sector by several market watchers  However  evidence on the ground tells a different tale and picking stocks from the sector may still be a smart investment option Reviving Conventional EnergyTrump s proposals on energy are among his most contentious campaign promises but they have managed to boost the sector  at least for now  Among other proposed actions is the headline making pledge to  save  the U S  coal sector  The President elect has also promised to help the oil and gas industry by reducing regulation and encouraging more exploration and production activities These pronouncements helped the likes of Peabody Energy Corporation   OTC BTUUQ   and Arch Coal Inc    NYSE ARCH   soar as soon as his victory was announced  Other  more profitable coal producers such as Cloud Peak Energy Inc    NYSE CLD   also experienced gains  Stocks from the oil and gas sector also moved northward on Nov 9 and afterward Renewable Energy SlumpsIn sharp contrast  solar power company SunPower Corporation   NASDAQ SPWR   suffered its sharpest decline in three months on Nov 9  slumping 14   The world s largest supplier of turbines  Vestas Wind Systems A S  declined 8 5  in Copenhagen Investor concerns heightened since Trump has promised to reverse Obama s clean energy proposals  He has promised to roll back the investment tax credit for solar power and the Environmental Protection Agency s Clean Power Plan  Also  Trump has spoken about withdrawing U S  support for the Paris Agreement However  all these actions seem quite unrealistic at this moment  First  the investment tax credit was passed with bipartisan support from a Republican dominated Congress in Dec 2015 and Trump may not receive Congressional support on this count  Also  if Trump does indeed step back from the Paris Agreement  it would help the coal industry only notionally  In fact  the agreement could only help to create an international market for clean energy and transportation technology  an area in which the U S  is a world leader Green Options Remain BrightThe only real worry for alternative energy from a Trump administration is the elimination of the Clean Power Plan  Such a move could delay the process of the retirement of coal fired plants and a reduction in the emphasis for greater solar power usage  But even if this does happen  the number of coal fired plants is expected to fall nearly 30  by 2030 In contrast with a sector beleaguered by debt and several other problems  the outlook for alternative energy is bright  Currently  the sector holds a significant advantage even in terms of government policy  According to renewable portfolio standards mandated by 29 states and the District of Columbia  electricity retail companies are required to provide an increasingly higher percentage of power from renewable energy sources More importantly  costs are falling for wind and solar power  increasing their competiveness  These advantages remain in place across several markets even without the aid of subsidies  Also  the sector is boosting job growth and increasing exports  economic benefits which Trump cannot fail to recognize  The President elect is likely to focus on results and in doing so he is likely to notice the opportunity renewable energy represents Our ChoicesSustainable and renewable energy options are facing a temporary downslide in the wake of Trump s election victory  But given their long term advantages  such a phase can only be short lived and they could return to their winning ways soon Adding such stocks to your portfolio remains a prudent option  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and

11866,233381,ARCH,Chinese Stocks  Oil  Copper And Junk Bonds Fall,opinion,"Never before have we seen a year start like this  On Monday  Chinese stocks crashed once again  The Shanghai Composite Index plummeted another 5 29 percent  and this comes on the heels of two historic single day crashes last week  All of this chaos over in China is one of the factors that continues to push commodity prices even lower  Today the price of copper fell another 2 40 percent to  1 97  and the price of oil continued to implode  At one point the price of U S  oil plunged all the way down to  30 99 a barrel before rebounding just a little bit  As I write this article  oil is down a total of 6 12 percent for the day and is currently sitting at  31 13  U S  stocks were mixed on Monday  but it is important to note that the Russell 2000 did officially enter bear market territory  This is yet another confirmation of what I was talking about yesterday  And junk bonds continue to plummet  As I write this  N JNK is down to 33 42  All of these numbers are huge red flags that are screaming that big trouble is ahead  Unfortunately  the mainstream media continues to insist that there is absolutely nothing to be concerned about 
A little over a year ago  I wrote an article that explained that anyone that believed that low oil prices were good for the economy was  crazy   At the time  many people really didn t understand what I was trying to communicate  but now it is becoming exceedingly clear  On Monday  one veteran oil and gas analyst  that  half of U S  shale oil producers could go bankrupt  over the next couple of years 

Half of U S  shale oil producers could go bankrupt before the crude market reaches equilibrium  Fadel Gheit  said Monday 
The senior oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer   Co  said the  new normal oil price  could be 50 to 100 percent above current levels  He ultimately sees crude prices stabilizing near  60  but it could be more than two years before that happens 
By then it will be too late for many marginal U S  drillers  who must drill into and break up shale rock to release oil and gas through a process called hydraulic fracturing  Fracking is significantly more expensive than extracting oil from conventional wells 

Since the last recession  the energy industry has been the number one producer of good paying jobs in this country 
Now that those firms are starting to drop like flies  what is that going to mean for employment in America 
Just today  a huge coal company filed for bankruptcy  and so did a U S  unit of commodity trading giant Glencore  L GLEN   The following comes from  

While the biggest bankruptcy story of the day is this morning s chapter 11 filing by Arch Coal  N ACI   one which would trim  4 5 billion in debt from its balance sheet while handing over the bulk of the post reorg company to its first lien holders as part of the proposed debt for equity exchange  the reality is that the Arch default was widely anticipated by the market 
However  another far less noted and perhaps far more significant bankruptcy filing was that of Sherwin Alumina Co   a U S  unit of commodity trading giant Glencore PLC  whose troubles have been extensively detailed on these pages  The stated reason for this far more troubling chapter 11 was  challenging market conditions  which is one way to describe an industry in which just one remaining U S  smelter will be left in operation after Alcoa  N AA  shut down its Warrick Country smelting ops last week 
A spokesman for Glencore  which owns the entire business  said the commodities producer and trader is  supportive of the restructuring process undertaken by Sherwin and is hopeful of an outcome that will allow for the continued operation of the Sherwin facility  

We desperately need prices for oil and other commodities to rebound significantly  Unfortunately  that does appear to be likely to happen any time soon  In fact   we could soon see the price of oil fall quite a bit more 

The strengthening U S  dollar could send oil plunging to  20 per barrel 
That s the view of analysts at Morgan Stanley  N MS   In a report published Monday  they say a 5  increase in the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies could push oil down by between 10  and 25    which would mean prices falling by as much as  8 per barrel 

If prices for oil and other commodities keep falling  what is going to happen 
Well  Gina Martin Adams of Wells Fargo  N WFC  Securities says that what is happening right now reminds her  

Recent market volatility has dredged up memories of previous times of turmoil  most notably the 2008 crisis  But Gina Martin Adams of Wells Fargo Securities has been reminded of another  less dramatic correction year   1998 
Adams posits that the current economic environment is suffering from themes that also played out in 1998  including falling oil prices  a rising U S  dollar and troubles in emerging markets  Consequently  stocks may see a similar move to the 1998 correction  which saw a 20 percent drop for stocks over six weeks 

To me  it is much more serious than that  Just before U S  stocks crashed horribly in 2008  we saw Chinese stocks crash  the price of oil crashed  commodity prices crashed  and junk bonds crashed really hard 
All of those things are happening again  and yet most of the  experts  continue to refuse to see the warning signs 
In fact  the mainstream media is full of articles that are telling people  while the financial markets crumble all around them 

There s no need to make big moves in response to the recent volatility   Regular folks should take on a long term view and avoid trying to anticipate short term market movements   says Stephen Horan  the managing director of credentialing at CFA Institute   There is almost no evidence to suggest that professionals can do it effectively and a plethora of evidence suggesting individuals do it poorly  

They want  regular folks  to keep holding on to their investments as the  smart money  dumps their stocks at a staggering pace 
A little more than six months ago  I predicted that  our problems will only be just beginning as we enter 2016   and that is turning out to be dead on correct

The falling U S  rig count should start to have a larger impact of U S  oil output  The U S  land rig count was down 37 this week and the land horizontal rig count was down 30 which was the largest one week drop since March of 2015  This comes after a bad year for oil and gas where the total number of companies to file for bankruptcies last year were 42 and the expectations that number could more than double in the coming year  The combined debt of bankrupt companies in 2015 were  17 85 billion  split about 50 4  secured to 49 6  unsecured debt  Arch Coal  N ACI   not oil and gas  did announce a bankruptcy overnight  That is driving that stock sharply lower

11884,233399,ARCH,A Better Looking Bottom For Coal Stocks  Thanks  George Soros ,opinion,"Coal is a dying source of energy  It has left a trail of tears in the stock market  Communities reliant on coal have been long suffering 
So I was quite surprised to read that George Soros  from April to June  2015  This is the same man who once called coal a  lethal bullet   and is a strong supporter of renewable energy  Regardless  Soros Fund Management purchased over 1M shares in Peabidy Energy  NYSE BTU  for  2 25M and 500K shares in Arch Coal  Arch Coal Inc  NYSE ACI   for  188K  These amounts are of course pennies to Soros  so it is hard to read too much into these investments except to say that Soros is likely taking a huge flier on a potential quick double or triple 
This is NOT the kind of trade to chase  However  the time lag in the news actually worked in favor of those who like to try to ride the coattails of big funds  The charts below show that Soros is currently deeply in the red on both positions and has a way to go to get the double or triple 

Arch Coal Inc   ACI  has more than doubled from all time lows but still rests just below the investing window for Soros

Peabody Energy  BTU  has  only  gained 40  off its recent all time low  and it is also still trading below the window for Soros   Source  
The Soros news sent ACI higher by a whopping 55  and BTU up by 25  on the day yesterday  Notably  both ACI and BTU found their latest support right at the  1 mark  I doubt this bounce is a coincidence as  1 tends to be a magic number for speculators and a limit for those who are forced to finally bail on such hapless positions 
More importantly  both stocks are demonstrating tell tale signs of a sustainable bottom  or at least a bottoming pattern that looks a lot better than recent attempts  ACI made a quick double in 5 days after hitting  1  The very next day it quickly lost about 35   The Soros news pushed the stock back to a new high on this move on extremely high volume  ACI is one breakout above its 50 day moving average  DMA  to starting a fresh leg up 
BTU has not moved as sharply as ACI and is thus the better play on a bottom right now  The Soros news also pushed it to a new high on this bounce off the bottom  but the chop going into this breakout looks more like constructive consolidation  BTU also has a tighter stop loss point below the low of the day   1 20  which would drop the stock back into the consolidation area 
Again  these are highly speculative trades  not investments  Also note that these trades are not covered under my    given I see no positive catalyst over the horizon for coal stocks  In fact  I have recently taken to fading coal and natural gas company Consol Energy  NYSE CNX  on every rally  this is a stock that Soros plunged  234 4M into before bailing after a few months of pain 
If ACI and or BTU get away from me  I will still keep an eye on them to see what it is Soros sees that no one else has apparently seen these days just in case this is actually more than gambling

Best Buy Co   Inc   NYSE BBY  exploded on Tuesday with a big breakaway gap  It was down around 29 25 on Monday  and on Tuesday it got up to 34 36  and then the markets brought it back down  up 3 68 to close at 32 95  or 13   on 21 3 million shares  Perhaps this pullback could be a buying opportunity  Short term target is a test of the double top at 35  and change  and if it gets through that  the next target is 37 1 2

11887,233402,ARCH,What Influencers Are Saying About Commodities,opinion,"A few legendary influencers in investing are making huge bets right now on commodities  an area that s faced and continues to face some pretty strong headwinds  What are we to make of this 
I already shared with you that famed hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller made a  323 million bet on gold  now the largest position in his family office fund 
It s also come to light that George Soros recently moved  2 million into coal producers Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU  and Arch Coal  NYSE ACI   Meanwhile  activist investor Carl Icahn took an 8 5 percent position in copper miner Freeport McMoran  NYSE FCX   which we own 

My friend Marc Faber  the widely respected Swiss investor and editor of the influential  Gloom  Boom   Doom Report   is now plugging for the mining sector and precious metals  Speaking to  last week  Faber claimed that investors are running low on safe assets and suggested they revisit mining companies  If I had to turn anywhere where  the opportunity for large capital gains exists  and the downside is  in my opinion  limited  it would be the mining sectors  specifically precious metals and mining companies  like Freeport  Newmont  NYSE NEM   Barrick  NYSE ABX  
They ve been hammered because of falling commodity prices  Now commodities may still go down for a while  but I don t think they ll stay down forever 
Late last month  Freeport became the first major miner to announce production cuts in response to depressed copper prices  which have slipped around 19 percent since their 2015 high of  2 95 per pound in May  This reduction should remove an estimated 70 000 tonnes of copper from global markets  according to BCA Research  and eventually help support prices 
Platinum and palladium miners in South Africa  a leading producer of both metals  also announced job cuts and mine closures  as platinum has slipped more than 16 percent this year  palladium a quarter 
But Marc sees opportunity  as I do  In my keynote speeches earlier this year  I suggested that 2015 would see a bottom in cost cutting due to divesture and slashing of capital expenditures  and that in 2016 we should see higher returns on capital 
Furthermore  using our oscillators to measure the degree to which asset classes are overbought and oversold  we find that commodities are extremely oversold right now and currently bouncing off low negative sentiment  The smart money is buying 
When asked if he thought commodities had reached a bottom  Marc had this to say  I would rather focus on precious metals gold  silver  platinum because they do not depend on industrial demand as much as base metals and industrial commodities 
Marc was referring  of course  to China  the 800 pound commodity gorilla  as I ve often described the country  The Asian powerhouse is currently responsible for nearly 13 percent of the world s commodity demand  followed by the U S  at a little over 10 percent 

But as I discussed recently  China is transitioning from a manufacturing based economy to one that emphasizes services  consumption and real estate  Commodity demand is cooling  therefore  and we can expect it to cool even further  Aside from the strong dollar  this is one of the key reasons why prices have plunged to multi year lows 
Commodities Seeking an Upturn to Global Manufacturing
The JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Global Manufacturing PMI continues to decline as well  Since its peak in February 2014  the reading has fallen 4 5 percent  The August score of 50 7  just barely indicating manufacturing expansion  is the sixth consecutive monthly reading to remain below the three month moving average 
I ve shown a number of times in the past that when this is the case that is  when the one month reading is below the three month trend commodity prices have tended to trade lower  Unlike other economic indicators such as gross domestic product  GDP   the PMI is forward looking and helps investors manage expectations  Based on our own research  there s a strong probability that copper and crude oil prices might dip three months following a  cross below  
The opposite has also been true  Prices have a stronger probability of ticking up three months after the one month crosses above the three month 
This is why we believe prices will have a better chance at recovery after the global PMI crosses above its three month moving average 
I have great respect and admiration for Druckenmiller  Soros  Icahn and Marc all of whom are clearly bullish on commodities but we would prefer to see global manufacturing growth reverse course 
In the meantime  low commodity prices are a windfall for many companies in Europe  Japan and the U S  Metals and other raw materials are at their lowest in years  which is the equivalent of a massive tax break for the construction and manufacturing sectors 
Low gold prices are also expected to generate high demand in India as we approach fall festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra  not to mention weddings  According to estimates from Swiss precious metals refiner Valcambi  demand could reach 950 tonnes by the end of the year  compared to 891 tonnes in 2014 
Emerging Markets Might Have Found a Bottom
It might be challenging for the global PMI to cross above the three year moving average since Chinese manufacturing has slowed  but there s burgeoning strength in other emerging markets  many of them unexpected  the Philippines  Myanmar  Ethiopia  The Czech Republic has the highest PMI reading among emerging Europe countries and the fastest growing economy in all of Europe 
An interesting chart from Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  suggests that emerging markets might have found a trough and are ready to turn up  Assuming that August 24  2015 was the bottom  the bank compares the recent bear market to five previous ones and finds that it s tracking a similar price action as 1995  2002 and 2011  It s also much less severe than 1998 and 2008 

Additionally   reminds us that by 2050  3 billion people will enter the middle class  nearly all of them in the developing world  Emerging markets might be struggling somewhat right now  but they re still very much our future 
U S  Travelers to Spend Big This Labor Day Weekend  but Airline Stocks Are Reasonably Priced This Labor Day weekend  Americans were projected to spend a whopping  13 5 billion  according to the U S  Travel Association  USTA   This figure included spending on goods and services as people traveled by automobile  jet or some other means to visit friends and family  Air travelers alone spent  2 9 billion  if expectations were accurate 

The International Air Transport Association  IATA  released air travel demand figures for the month of July  noting that demand continues to be robust both domestically and internationally 
All global markets saw growth in July  with domestic flight demand rising 5 9 percent year over year  At an eye popping 28 1 percent  India posted the strongest growth 
As GARP  growth at a reasonable price  investors  we still find airline stocks attractively priced  as do many others   recently made note of this  stating   Major airline stocks are trading 9 4x our 2015 EPS  earnings per share  estimates and 9 0x our 2016 EPS estimates  below their historical trading range of 10x   12x

The Iran Nuclear Deal Could Be a Boon to Boeing  NYSE BA  and Airbus On a final note  if you ve been paying attention to the news  you re probably familiar with the pending nuclear deal with Iran  When implemented  trade barriers will be lifted for the first time in decades  Whether you approve or disapprove of the deal  you have to recognize that this could be a huge opportunity for many companies that  up until now  have been cut off from doing business with the Middle Eastern country 
One area that s in dire need of an overhaul is Iran s aging jet fleet  The average age of the United Arab Emirates s planes is 6 3 years  In Iran  meanwhile  it s 27 years  These are ancient relics 

The total number of jets that will need replacing is estimated to be 400 and cost  20 billion  Aircraft manufacturers Boeing  NYSE BA  and Airbus  OTC EADSF  already have a growing backlog of new aircraft orders  according to the Wall Street Journal and the Iran deal has the potential to increase it even further 
We also see it as an opportunity for energy companies in particular that the median age of Iran s educated population is 28 years this is a market with promising growth potential 
You might have seen headlines that energy officials from Iran and Saudi Arabia secretly met to cooperate on trying to get crude oil prices stable at between  70 and  80 per barrel  Oil prices spiked this past week in response  but as far as we can tell  this is only chatter  Don t bet on rumors  but rather on good government monetary and fiscal policy  excellent management and undervalued stocks

11888,233403,ARCH,4 Stocks To Watch  CALA  CHK  COP  ECA,opinion,"It was what I call a good consolidation day on Tuesday  The market had an orderly retrace and came back at the end of the day closing mixed  The blue chips were stronger than NASDAQ  for sure  A lot of that may have been due to the biotech index  which was down more than 3  on Tuesday  although it did recover nicely  Let s take a look at some of the stocks that dominated the market 
Calithera Biosciences  Inc   NASDAQ CALA   which we put a swing trade out on Tuesday  was up 25 cents to 7 09  or 3 65   on 687 000 shares traded  It has gone all the way from 30 00 down to 4 00 in multiple waves down  and looks like it formed a base  It s above where the moving averages crossed over  above the prior high  and the next resistance level appears to be around 8 00  That can happen in the next day or so  as well as 8  at the declining topsline  It s important that the short term declining topsline is taken out  Volume is increasing  It s not huge  but it has gotten higher four consecutive days  If it can hold the 6  range  then look for it to head up into those zones 
Chesapeake Energy Corporation  NYSE CHK  is a good energy stock  It came way down from the mid 30s  and as recently as 31 last year  and took it all the way down to 6 00  In ensuing weeks it formed a left shoulder head right shoulder  and on Tuesday  it jumped 56 cents to 8 98  or 6 65   on 24 million shares  That s the biggest volume on an up day in about two weeks  If it can break through 8 98  expect it to test the 10  area  If it gets through that  look for it to test the 11  area  and eventually 14  depending on the oil market

11900,233415,ARCH,Coal Stocks Out of Favor As Soros Afterglow Fades,opinion,"It was fun while it lasted 
The trades I described in coal in the wake of news of investments by George Soros seem to be coming to a decisive end  The recent bottoms have not yet given way  but seems sure to do so in the coming days or weeks 
Arch Coal  N ACI  has swung particularly wildly as news about ACI debt has steadily crushed the stock since it reached toward the highest point of the Soros buying range  ACI is extremely oversold here  but I am not interested in trading against the headwinds of crushing debt 

Arch Coal  ACI  plunges toward its recent all time lows as debt news issues a steady pounding 
Peabody Energy  N BTU  tried to resuscitate interest in its stock with a reverse split  The stock has not swung nearly as widely or wildly as ACI  but it is still heading for a challenge of all time lows  A post earnings reaction generated a whopping 21 8  one day loss 

Peabody Energy  BTU  confirms a fresh breakdown from resistance at its 50 day moving average  DMA 
CONSOL Energy Inc   N CNX  added to the negative catalyst for coal stocks with an earnings report that generated a 21 2  loss  CNX is now at a 13 year low  I stopped buying puts against CNX weeks ago as I  wrongly  figured it was no longer worth riding the downtrend once the stock hit single digits    but they clearly were not listening and or unimpressed 

 Despite depressed commodity prices  CONSOL remains focused on achieving our free cash flow base plan over the next 15 months   commented Nicholas J  DeIuliis  president and CEO   During the quarter  we beat production targets  locked in a significant percentage of our revenues for 2016 with additional gas hedges and multi year coal contracts  significantly reduced operating costs  corporate overhead  and legacy liabilities  and accelerated our asset sale monetization program  These steps provide increased confidence in our ability to achieve our free cash flow base plan that we highlighted during our second quarter 2015 earnings call  and we are hard at work with multiple processes underway to monetize additional assets this year and into 2016  Expected proceeds will go towards reducing debt to help accelerate the separation of our Coal and E P Divisions  


CONSOL Energy  CNX  takes a fresh plunge in reaction to earnings 
With momentum freshly pointing downward for coal stocks  these stocks are once again hot potatoes  falling knives  etc  I am not interested in making any long trades until a fresh  positive catalyst appears  It will be interesting to see whether Soros decides to double down  In the meantime  the trade points definitively down once again for coal stocks  The upshot is that whatever the trend  these stocks are good for strong and sustained follow through for good risk reward trades

11901,233416,ARCH, Last Chance  Trade On Arch Coal,opinion,"Someone  really wants Arch Coal  N ACI  to avoid breaking the buck 
On August 5th  ACI traded as low as a buck per share before closing at  1 05 share  Two weeks later we learned Soros had been scooping up ACI shares  Trading volume on ACI has been much higher since then 
On August 20th  ACI was back at a low of  1 00 share after a wild three months  The stock closed at  1 04  The next day  August 23rd  ACI plunged to a close of  0 84  The day after that drop  ACI rallied just as quickly to completely reverse all its losses  The stock has trickled higher ever since and seems poised to be a juicy candidate for a    trade 

Arch Coal  ACI  could be in its  final  struggle for survival as it barely averts n extended stay below  1 00 share 
The January effect is a well known stock market pattern where stocks that investors dump going into the endof a year perform exceptionally well in January  Supposedly  investors who are busy trying to optimize the tax efficiency of their portfolios dump their losers before year end in order to offset gains on earlier winners 
With all the motivated sellers out the way  these same stocks find more buyers than sellers to start the year  I am not clear whether this pattern really provides consistent trading opportunities  but it makes for a good story and an intriguing backdrop for losing stocks like ACI  Interested readers can check out a related piece in MarketWatch called     Columnist Mark Hulbert quantifies the stark seasonal pattern in small caps that strongly favors out performance in January  Hulbert averages data from 1926 to 2015 
ACI is all the more interesting because a deep pocketed investor loaded up well ahead of the motivated sellers  I am guessing Soros was not fast enough to avoid the current losses and is still waiting on a catalyst to make his position profitable  The odds seem to be fading  but the large stake makes me favor buying scenarios for ACI 
This latest escape from breaking the buck seems to be effectively one last chance for ACI to work  The straightforward trade here is to buy now and bail if ACI closes below  1 00  A more aggressive or risk tolerant trader could wait until a new all time low to bail on the position  If such a sell off happens before the year ends  the most brave speculators could choose to double down in anticipation of some kind of rally in January 
Upside potential should be at least to  2 00 and of course could go a lot higher if ACI can somehow get over the all the debt overhang that sent the shares plunging from its last monster rally

11902,233417,ARCH,An Unconvincing Oversold Bounce,opinion,"T2108 Status  16 0   second day at oversold T2107 Status  21 9 VIX Status  22 7General  Short term  Trading Call  bullishActive T2108 periods  Day  2 under 20   oversold   Day  3 under 30   Day  4 under 40   Day  8 below 50   Day  23 under 60   Day  364 under 70 
Commentary In my last T2108 Update  I laid out a case for short term gain as part of an oversold bounce but longer term pain as part of deteriorating technicals  The action yesterday included a little of both  an overall unconvincing bounce 

The S P 500  N SPY  managed to eek out a 0 5  gain after trading as low as a 1 0  loss  This qualifies as a very modest oversold bounce  The lows extended well below the lower Bollinger Band  BB  and formed a great setup for buying into an oversold bounce  At its lows  T2108 dropped as far as 13 4    a VERY extended oversold condition  At its highs  the volatility index  the VIX  reached as far as 26 8    just below the 2012 intraday high  Put it all together  traders got a very brief buying signal to trade an oversold bounce  especially as the market started pulling out of this funk  The S P 500 even provided the psychologically important 2000 level as a convenient pivot point 


The S P 500  SPY  prints a classic  hammer  pattern as it rallies off its low of the day 


The volatility index  the VIX  stops just short of the 2012 intraday high before ending the day DOWN 6 8  

The bad news is that  once again  the poor breadth of the market reared its head  While the S P 500 recovered for a small gain  T2108 closed with a loss  In other words  while the net result of the trading action left even more stocks in a worse technical condition  a few large stocks helped to push the S P 500 over the hump  This poor breadth generated an unconvincing bounce which longer term flashes warning signs to me 

Two of those large stocks powering the index were Amazon com  O AMZN  and Netflix  O NFLX   I traded the two as an offset in another attempt to try something a little different than the typical oversold trading strategy  AMZN ended up on the day with a cool 2 8  gain and only spent a very brief moment of time in the red  NFLX fared a lot worse during its selling but met a swell of buyers off critical 50DMA support 

As I watched an early morning rally lose steam for AMZN  I decided to try a small and quick short  I watched as the stock eventually lost a quick 10 points but I decided to hold even as the stock recovered  will likely be another hedge for making more aggressively bullish trades during the oversold period   On the daily chart  AMZN actually looks like it is topping  Before the strong close  the lower Bollinger Bands were creating a channel pointing downward that confirmed the bearishness of the previous day s gap down 


Amazon com  AMZN  is finally looking toppy  three weeks of distribution  a gap down on high selling volume  and aa lower BB trading channel that is teetering downward 


Sellers rushed out the stock into a climax of selling volume right before lunch on the East Coast  Buying volume picked up in the last hour of trading to create a small breakout on this 5 minute chart 

As I watched NFLX plunge  I resisted the typical urge to start loading up on call options as the stock approached critical support at its 50 day moving average  DMA   Instead  I set a trigger to buy my call options once NFLX crossed above a critical level of intraday resistance  I used a 30 minute chart  shown below  to determine a reasonable trigger point  I sold the calls after hitting a 50   gain  At the time  I thought the bounce from the lows was already long in the tooth  NFLX continued to rally right into the close 


Netflix  NFLX  prints a near picture perfect bounce off 50DMA support  But can buyers keep up the recovery efforts 


The 30 minute chart reveals a very basic method for playing a bounce off lows 

An interesting dynamic developed during the day with solar versus coal 

I have been touting the bullish setups of a few  select solar stocks  I did not think through the potential for solar stocks to pop upon  of the climate change talks held in Paris  I also did not think about these talks as a wildcard to the  last chance  trade on Arch Coal Inc  N ACI   Needless to say  I am even MORE bullish on solar stocks now even with the market s deteriorating technicals  I am also seeing the writing on the wall for ACI 


SolarCity Corporation  O SCTY  makes a VERY important breakout  the rally from lows continues in a well defined channel  the post earnings gap down has closed  and the stock has finally recovered back to its price where Chanos recommended shorting the stock 


Another brief respite fr Arch Coal  ACI  looks ready to come to a calamitous end

11904,233419,ARCH,Natural Gas Passing Coal In Market Share,opinion,"A quiet revolution is going on in the US power generation market  and it may be giving a lesson for those countries dithering over whether to allow hydraulic fracturing  fracking  of oil and natural gas deposits identified but not yet proven 
According to the FT  April was the first month in US history that gas fired electricity generation surpassed coal fired generation   although it came close in 2012 when gas prices were also very weak   By comparison  in 2010 coal provided 45  of US power  In April of this year 31  of US electricity was generated by natural gas compared to 30  for coal  and the trend continues 
Watts Up
In gigawatt terms  wind power is growing even faster than natural gas  flattening the latter in the league tables  US coal capacity dropped by about 3 3 GW during 2014  and the US Energy Information Association predicts it will shrink by a further 12 9 GW this year  while wind power capacity rose by 9 8 GW and gas by 4 3 GW 

Source  Financial Times
The reasons are more complex than simply low natural gas prices  although that  undoubtedly  is a major factor  The Environmental Protection Agency s  by the back door this year encouraged some coal fired utilities to see the writing on the wall and either mothball plants or invest in new technology to accommodate the mercury emission and other pollution targets  raising costs 
Brett Blankenship of Wood Mackenzie is quoted by the FT as saying   low gas prices mean coal plants are running less  and when they run their margins are typically compressed  So companies find it difficult to make the investments needed to comply with regulations and keep those plants running  
The Imitation Substitution Game
It s a vicious downward spiral in the face of lower priced and less polluting competitor fuels  Although natural gas makes a better swing fuel source to balance wind and solar renewables variability  not all utilities are blessed with an abundance of such spare generating capacity so they rely on their coal power plants to step in at times of peak demand  Unfortunately  running a coal plant at anything other than full or near full load on a continuous basis brings per gigawatt operating costs up AND per gigawatt emissions of pollutants 
Not surprisingly  coal producers share prices have fared even worse than shale gas companies  Peabody Energy Corporation  NYSE BTU  s share price  the largest US coal producer  has fallen 98  since April 2011  while those of Arch Coal Inc  NYSE ACI  have dropped 99 2  and of Alpha Natural Resources  NYSE ANR  by 99 6   while their debt is so devalued it is yielding 17 9  for Peabody suggesting investors are expecting default 
With natural gas prices set to stay low for some years to come and renewable costs falling steadily the writing is on the wall for all but the latest and most efficient coal powered electricity production  At least the environmental lobby will be pleased and the EPA may have achieved much of what it set out to do  Supreme Court slap down or not

11909,233424,ARCH,New Senate Sure To Cash In On Coal,opinion,"Now that   the Republicans are champing at the bit to change the direction of the United States  energy policy 
Energy has always been high on the Republican agenda  They view it as the easiest way to generate economic growth 
After all  the United States is flush with energy  even if some fuels don t have the best reputations 
Now the Republicans want to bring back an unpopular but powerful commodity  coal 
The new ruling party aims to get it on the market as fast as possible  and the Democrats will be all but powerless to stop them 
The Outlaw That Never Left
Coal has been under a dark cloud for the last several years   a victim of economic and non economic factors 
The popular media portrays it as the energy source to avoid at all costs   citing the fuel s heavy pollution 
And the perceived shift from coal to natural gas and renewables has caused a negative sentiment for coal stocks 
But coal is far from dead 
A slow global recovery has resulted in ample supplies of coal and lower prices per ton 
Plus  coal is still the primary source of energy around the world  As the two charts below show  coal consumption has actually increased over the past 10 years  not decreased as many think 

Fuel of the Masses
The primary driver for increased coal consumption is  and will continue to be  the lure of lower prices per energy unit produced 
There s also the pure fact that poor countries around the globe are going to buy the cheapest energy sources until they become richer  more educated about carbon emissions  and have access to other fuels at the ground level 
As I have seen during my travels through poor and emerging mega population centers like India  most of these people are still using bricks of coal for heating and cooking fuel 
And that won t change for many years to come 
Coal offers greater energy independence from foreign sources  especially the Middle East   a fact that will make these issues difficult for the Democrats to fight 
Indeed  while the Keystone Pipeline  LNG exports  and deregulating oil exports are what appear to be at the top of the agenda  the smart money will be made from coal 
You see  the low hanging fruit of the new Republican dominated Congress will be existing energy policies and protecting the constituents 
New Sheriffs in Town
Mitch McConnell  the Senate Majority Leader  represents Kentucky   ranked No  3 on the list of coal producing states  The No  1 state is Wyoming  which is also headed up by a Republican Senator  Mike Enzi 
To think that either will allow coal to be pushed further into the abyss of  bad energy  sources would be na ve 
Until last week  the two legs of the Republican energy stool were oil and gas  But now  the third leg   and arguably the cheapest from a valuation standpoint   coal  is likely to make a comeback 
My top pick for the sector is Peabody Energy Corporation  NYSE BTU   Arch Coal Inc  NYSE ACI  is a riskier bet 
Both have rallied since the election  but are beginning to pull back after the euphoria  trading much closer to their respective 52 week lows than highs

In particular  the challenging offshore drilling market continues to put pressure on rig owners  Last week  Transocean Ltd  NYSE RIG  slashed its dividend payout by 80   This followed Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc s  NYSE DO  decision to entirely scrap its special dividend  which it had been paying every year since 2006 
In 2014  these stocks were coveted for their high dividend yields  Unsurprisingly  though  investors who indiscriminately chased high yields  so called  yield hogs   are now being punished 
But don t say you weren t warned 
My  is quickly becoming the scene of a dividend massacre  with five of the 11 targeted companies now having cut their payouts 
Vanguard Natural Resources LLC  NASDAQ VNR   an upstream master limited partnership  MLP   just cut its distribution by 44   It was at the very top of my list of unsustainable distributions 
The infrastructure MLPs on my list may take a bit longer to cut their distributions  but I do think they ll have to axe them before it s all said and done  Meanwhile  many MLPs that I haven t covered  such as Mid Con Energy Partners LP  NASDAQ MCEP   will continue cutting their distributions 
But it s not solely oil and natural gas companies that are feeling the pain  Peabody Energy Corporation  NYSE BTU   the largest coal producer in the United States  curtailed its dividend in a bid to save cash 
Arch Coal  NYSE ACI   a smaller coal player  decided to do away with its dividend altogether  I ve talked about how defaults are a virtual certainty in the coal industry  meaning many of the common stocks will go to zero   although a dividend suspension is actually credit positive for Arch Coal s bonds 
Cliffs Natural Resources  NYSE CLF   a leading mining company with coal exposure  also decided to scrap its dividend in order to focus on reducing its net debt levels  Going forward  I expect dividend cuts  including those outside of the commodities complex  to become much more commonplace 
For a preview of what s to come  consider that a pair of business development companies  BDCs   Fifth Street Finance  NASDAQ FSC  and Medley Capital  NYSE MCC   both recently cut their payouts  I warned about  and its hidden leverage back in September

11920,233435,ARCH,Coal Tycoon Making Last Stand For U S  Industry,opinion,"A cloud of coal dust continues to hang over the  
Lately  the industry has been dealing with some bad publicity from the coal ash spill into North Carolina s Dan River last year 
Coal ash is what you get after coal is burned by utilities for power  This remaining ash can contain a toxic combination of arsenic  selenium  boron  and other substances 
On top of that  the coal business in the United States is looking bleak 
It s facing pressure from competing fuels  like natural gas  a strong U S  dollar  and the Obama administration  which would like to see the industry go away 
Down in the Dumps
The terrible state of the American coal business was highlighted by a recent analysis from energy consultant group Wood Mackenize 
The company found that about 17  of the forecasted U S  production for this year   about 162 million tons   is  unprofitable   More specifically  the study said that 14  of thermal coal production and 58  of metallurgical coal production were money losing operations 
Wood Mackenzie pointed to Central Appalachian coal as being in the deepest hole  with 72  of that coal output being unprofitable  Conditions were found to be better for North Appalachian coal and Illinois Basin coal 
But the hardest hit is metallurgical coal 
Prices are predicted to hit a six year low  below  110 per metric ton  globally later this year  This is despite 30 million tons of production cutbacks already announced by the likes of privately held Walter Energy and Alpha Natural Resources  NYSE ANR   Canada s Teck Resources Ltd  NYSE TCK   the world s second biggest exporter  says at least another 15 million tons in cutbacks are needed to stabilize prices 
However  Wood Mackenzie s Senior Research Analyst  Dale Hazelton  did say   If you ve got the money to buy a coal asset  this is the time to do it  
Scooping up Hot Deals
And it seems Murray Energy is doing just that  The company is forking over  1 4 billion for a controlling stake in Illinois Basin coal producer Foresight Energy Partner  NYSE FELP  and its general partner  Foresight Energy GP  LLC 
The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year 
In late 2013  Murray also acquired five longwall coal operations from CONSOL Energy Inc  NYSE CNX  to position itself as a leader in North Appalachian coal 
In October 2014  Murray made yet another deal with CONSOL  buying its assets in the Illinois Basin 

According to SNL Energy data  with all those deals  Murray is now the top producer in the United States  two hottest coal basins  These basins have benefited as coal mines from central Appalachia have suffered 
The newly combined company is the number three U S  coal producer overall and the lowest cost coal producer  Foresight s average cost of operations was only  20 80 per ton in 2014 
Snatching Some Embers
The interesting aspect of the deal is not that Murray is staying private company  but that Foresight will remain publicly traded 
There is also a very real possibility that some of Murray s assets will be put into the limited partnership in the near future 
This should translate directly into growing distributions  Prior to this  growth depended solely on Foresight opening new coal mines  Currently  its distribution yield is about 9  annually 
This should appeal to income investors  allowing Foresight to easily outperform other coal miners like  Alpha Natural  Arch Coal Inc  NYSE ACI   and Peabody Energy Corporation  NYSE BTU   These stocks have collapsed 98   96   and 89   respectively  over the past five years 
Is this deal the last stand for the U S  coal industry  Maybe  But if so  it is likely that these dealmakers will be the last survivors

11921,233436,ARCH,Coal Stocks  Contrarian Opportunity Or Value Trap ,opinion,"Last year  U S  power plants produced 4 093 billion kilowatt hours of electricity  And 39  of it came from coal 
Coal is still the No  1 source of electricity generation in the U S  However  that number is declining steadily  Why  A steady stream of increasingly tighter greenhouse gas emissions rules issued by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  
Here s what President Obama told the San Francisco Chronicle back in January 2008  when he was still a senator    So if somebody wants to build a coal fired plant they can  It s just that it will bankrupt them    
He wasn t kidding  The tighter regulations already in place    the new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards    the proposed Cross State Air Pollution Rule   
These all spell the end of coal fired plants here in the U S 
Over 72 gigawatts of coal fired generating capacity will soon be retired due to EPA regulations  That s enough generating capacity to power 44 7 million homes    as many as there are in all the states west of the Mississippi  excluding Texas  
More than 20  of existing coal fired plants in use today will shut down   A few newer units are converting to natural gas   And there could be even more closures as new regulations take effect 
What impact will all this have on coal producers  It s not pretty  but some will survive  Let s take a look   
The Coal Miner Blues 
Right now in the U S   more than 50  of states have coal mining operations  But 79  of all production comes from just five states  Wyoming  39    West Virginia  12    Kentucky  8    Illinois  5   and my home state of Pennsylvania  5   
Two of the largest coal producers are in Wyoming  Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU  operating its North Antelope Rochelle Mine and Arch Coal  NYSE ACI  with its Black Thunder Mine 
CONSOL Energy  NYSE CNX   another big producer  operates out of Pennsylvania 
Then there s Alliance Resource Partners  NASDAQ ARLP  in Oklahoma   We ll talk about this one  in greater detail  in a minute  
So how have shares of these companies performed in recent years  Take a look at the chart below 

For Arch Coal and Peabody Energy  it s not a pretty picture  Shares have declined 98 6  and 94 8   respectively 
What s Consol doing different  It s the only U S  coal company that owns something its competitors don t    a sprawling export terminal  located on the Chesapeake Bay in Baltimore 
This Coal Company s Magic Bullet 
Consol s Baltimore terminal is capable of exporting about 15 million tons of coal a year  The company used some of that capacity to export a 30  chunk of its 2014 production  totaling 28 5 million tons 
The terminal s excess capacity is sold to other coal miners  including Rosebud Mining and Murray Energy Corporation  These companies pay a fee of  4 to  8 per ton to use Consol s facility 
In a recent interview  Bob Hodge  a coal analyst at IHS Energy  referred to Consol s Baltimore terminal as  its magic bullet   He noted that the company can increase exports to help keep U S  prices from tanking 
Coal exports are the one bright spot for U S  producers  in spite of global warming concerns  As U S  coal fired power plants are replaced by natural gas fired units  coal producers will increasingly turn to the export markets 
My Favorite Coal Stock
Consol is in great shape and should continue to be as coal exports become a larger and larger part of its future earnings  However  my favorite coal stock is Alliance Resource Partners  No  4 on the chart above  
Alliance is the third largest eastern coal producer  with 40 7 million tons mined in 2014  It s structured as a master limited partnership  MLP   which means it offers tax free income to unit holders 
So how have Alliance units fared as the price of coal has dropped  Since 2011  they re down only 14 3    To compare  Consol has slid more than 40  during the same period  ",2015-06-02,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/coal-stocks:-contrarian-opportunity-or-value-trap-253764,253764
11922,233437,ARCH,Crunch Time For The U S  Coal Industry ,opinion,"Coal prices in the US are collapsing  The September Appalachian coal futures contract gave up over 2  on Friday as the industry faces unprecedented challenges 
 One can see the decline in the industry s activity levels by tracking rail shipments of coal  Railcar loadings are now at the lowest level in decades 
The industry s woes have been caused by a  perfect storm  of events that wrecked havoc on US coal producers  Here are some of the recent developments  1  US natural gas production has been on the rise for the last decade  continuing through today in spite of the ongoing reductions in rig count  Prices have declined recently as inventory levels returned to normal after the draw down during the winter of 2013 14  As a result  power producers are increasingly shifting to natural gas  Here is a recent note from the US Energy Information Administration 
EIA expects a 7  decrease in coal consumption in the electric power sector in 2015  despite a 1  increase in total electric power generation  Lower natural gas prices are the main driver of the decline  Projected low natural gas prices make it more economical to run natural gas fired generating units at higher utilization rates even in regions of the country  Midwest  South  that typically rely more heavily on coal fired generation  Increased generation from wind  solar  and biomass is also expected to displace coal fired generation  as several facilities have been converted from coal burning facilities 
 2  New EPA regulation  particularly the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards     is pressuring electricity producers to retire some coal power plants 
    Appalachian Power said this week the cost to upgrade coal fired units at four power plants in Virginia and West Virginia that were retired in May would have been so high it did not even compile cost estimates for the work  In a report filed earlier this week with the West Virginia Public Service Commission further explaining why the Clinch River and Glen Lyn power plants in Virginia and the Kanawha River and Philip Sporn power plants in West Virginia were retired  APCo said it  has not performed any detailed cost estimates because the order of magnitude of the costs was so tremendous  
3  Global coal demand has fallen off sharply  driven largely  but not entirely  by China 
  China s coal imports slumped 41 per cent in May from a year earlier to 14 25 million tonnes and were down sharply on April despite industry expectations of a pick up in seasonal demand  data showed on Monday  Total imports in the first five months of the year reached 83 26 million tonnes  down 38 2 per cent compared with the previous year  according to preliminary data from China s General Administration of Customs  May s imports were down 28 6 per cent on April  according to the data  while Reuters calculations showed that imports were down 40 6 per cent compared to May 2014  Imports normally improve over the northern summer  but analysts said any upturn would be limited despite relatively low inventory levels at thermal power plants  with hydropower likely to meet a large share of the increase in power demand   Imports are constantly decreasing compared to last year due to new policies  and the use of new  renewable  energy   said Zheng Nan  an analyst with China s Shenyin Wanguo Securities 

4  To make matters worse for the industry  the state of Wyoming is reviewing the balance sheets of some major coal producers  The law requires coal firms to carry insurance that would provide environmental cleanup resources should the firms fail  But with the latest price pressures  some firms may not qualify for such programs and would be forced to maintain collateral  In the current environment these firms may not have the resources for these new requirements 
    The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality s Land Quality Division is reviewing 2014 financial data from Peabody and Arch to see if they still qualify for a  self bonding  program that allows coal producers to cheaply insure their clean up costs in case of bankruptcy  Kimber Wichmann  an economist at the department  said in a phone interview Miners that fail to meet certain financial benchmarks must buy instruments that include corporate surety bonds and Treasury bills  or hold enough cash  to cover potential reclamation liabilities  
 Investors don t know how to handicap this self bonding issue   Ted O Brien  chief executive officer of Doyle Trading Consultants LLC  said in a phone interview   Until the companies come out and give Wall Street certainty that they know how to deal with it  I think we re going to be stuck in this vortex  
Shares of some large coal producers Arch Coal  NYSE ACI   Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU   Alpha Natural Resources  NYSE ANR  to name a few are hitting record lows 





 To be sure  coal will remain a major source of electricity production in the United States  Even if the EIA projection  chart below  is too optimistic on the future of coal usage  the survivors of the  coal crunch  stand to profit handsomely  Moreover  some diversified energy firms are still making money on coal even at these prices  Nevertheless  the industry is undergoing a historic shakeup  which a number of industry participants  particularly those who are highly leveraged  may not survive ",2015-06-14,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crunch-time-for-the-us-coal-industry-254949,254949
11923,233438,ARCH,Supreme Court Reignites Coal Industry,opinion,"The U S  coal industry breathed a sigh of relief this week after the Supreme Court blocked President Obama s proposed limits on mercury emissions from power plants under the Clean Air Act 
The president had been enjoying a winning streak at the nation s highest court  Recent decisions upheld his signature healthcare bill and the right of same sex couples to marry in all 50 states 
His record on the environment  however  just took a significant hit 
This most recent case overturned one in a series of three major environmental regulations that Obama had hoped would establish his  Earth friendly  legacy 
The first two regulations   limiting pollution from power plants that spreads across state lines and cutting greenhouse gas emissions   have thus far survived judicial scrutiny 
But the third failed by a bare majority 
While environmentalists are lamenting this loss  the coal industry is cheering  It s a win for that sector   and for anyone looking to invest in coal 
Watch the Mercury Rise and Fall
Last Monday the Supreme Court ruled in a 5 4 decision  with the five conservative justices in the majority  to block one of the Obama administration s most ambitious environmental initiatives   a regulation that would have limited the amount of mercury and other toxic pollutants emitted mostly from coal fired and  powered plants 
The rule  which aimed to protect the public from the significant amount of toxic emissions that come from coal  and oil fired electric utilities  was issued over three years ago and went into effect in April 
But 21 states  along with industry groups like the National Mining Association and a coal fired power plant in Ghent  Kentucky  appealed the ruling after an appeals court upheld the regulation in June of last year 
The linchpin for proving this case impassable was that the Court found that the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  violated the Clean Air Act by failing to undertake a cost benefit analysis 
The main argument  written on behalf of the court by Justice Antonin Scalia  was that the Clean Air Act required the regulation to be deemed  appropriate and necessary   The EPA didn t consider the cost of compliance involved in regulating power plants for mercury and other pollutants while the EPA indicated that it was not required to do so at the time 
The challengers of the ruling argued that the EPA s refusal to consider the cost of compliance  which was estimated to be  9 6 billion per year  would result in businesses and households paying larger electricity bills and would only achieve about  6 million in benefits 
The EPA argued that the benefits of reducing mercury would substantially outweigh the costs 
According to the EPA  such benefits include the prevention of approximately 11 000 premature deaths per year  and a reduction in the number of developmental delays and other abnormalities in children that are linked to mercury 
The EPA estimated the regulation would result in a savings of  90 billion annually 
The rule applies to approximately 1 400 electricity generating units at 600 power plants around the country  Since its inception  many plants are moving toward compliance  according to a statement from the EPA  or have already met the standard 
A Smudge on the Clean Air Act
According to Reuters  lawyers following the case indicate that the legal rationale is unlikely to have broader implications for other environmental regulations  such as the Clean Power Plan  which cuts carbon emissions from existing plants 
The decision doesn t strike down the rule  but rather means that the EPA needs to sharpen its pencils and get to a viable number with respect to the cost of compliance 
Later this summer  the agency is expected to release a set of landmark climate change rules and restrictions that have faced legal challenges from the industry 
This decision leaves the legal status of the regulation in limbo  The rule stays in effect for the near term  But the case will return to an appeals court  at which time the court will decide whether or not the case should be thrown out 
It s a known fact that the EPA and the Obama administration are focused on policy and regulation of coal  It s also clear that U S  energy policies are guiding the country away from reliance on fossil fuels and toward a sustainable energy system with greater energy independence 
Yet  it seems coal will be with us and the rest of the world for a while longer  Particularly seeing as the U S  coal demonstrated reserves  currently estimated at 480 billion tons  are larger than the remaining natural gas and crude resources according to the Energy Information Administration 
Because of that  I think it s safe to look for some undervalued coal investments  most of which have taken a severe beating 
Winners and Losers
From an investment standpoint  the near term winners are companies like Peabody Energy Corp   NYSE BTU   the biggest U S  coal producer  and Arch Coal  NYSE ACI   both of which have been increasingly concerned about power companies turning to natural gas  the more efficient and cheaper fuel  to generate electricity 
While the obvious loser in all of this is the environment  there are also companies that will lose out  including Exelon Corp   NYSE EXC   the largest nuclear power plant operator  and large natural gasproducers  such as Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  
For now  keep your eye out for future environmental policy developments  Even if the EPA doesn t immediately get its way on mercury  companies that are good prospects in the medium to long term are those developing innovative clean coal technology   so called integrated gasification combined cycle  or IGCC 
While IGCC comes with an expensive price tag  it strips carbon dioxide out of burning coal and concentrates it to be captured and dispatched to underground storage 
Southern Company  NYSE SO   for example  is testing a technology called TRIG  Transport Integrated Gasification   which is designed to take lignite coal and transform it into a clean synthetic gas from which carbon dioxide is captured

11930,233445,ARCH,Fear And Coal Bonds Can Work,opinion,"As long as there s been debt  a way to resolve unpayable debt has needed to exist 
A passage from Deuteronomy in the Bible talks about creditors canceling debts every seven years 
Throughout 19th century Europe  those unable to pay their obligations would likely wind up in debtor s prison  where they remained until their families paid their liabilities 
And today  bankruptcy laws help people who can no longer pay their debts get a fresh start 
Even in the corporate world  bankruptcy can help companies liquidate or reorganize 
For the past few years  though  bankruptcies haven t been much of a concern  In fact  U S  corporate default rates have remained low for an extended period of time 
But recently  there are pockets of distress  and I believe that acute bankruptcy fears are creating an enormous opportunity within one long suffering industry 
The Perfect Storm
That struggling industry is U S  coal 
Coal mining companies have been plagued by tighter environmental regulations and a shale boom that has made natural gas more competitive 
A decrease in Chinese demand for metallurgical coal  which is used to produce steel  hasn t helped either 
In fact  two of the smaller coal producers  Patriot Coal Corp  and James River Coal Co   have already filed for bankruptcy 
And with coal prices now hitting lows not seen in over five years  the bond market is expecting more bankruptcies 
All of these factors have combined to form a perfect storm for the coal industry 
Consequently  bonds issued by coal companies are beginning to price in significantly higher default probabilities 
For example  Walter Energy s  NYSE WLT  9 875  coupon bonds due in 2020 have collapsed from a price of above  900 all the way down to around  320 per  1 000 par value  Investors who bought these bonds closer to par weren t mindful of the macro risks involved  yes  fixed income investors still need to maintain a macro perspective  
At this point  we re seeing bona fide fear in the market for coal bonds  It s reminiscent of 2008 and 2009  when virtually the entire high yield bond market resembled the current situation in coal bonds 
Yet I believe there s an opportunity amidst all of the panic 
Even though more coal companies will need to restructure their debts  the industry itself certainly isn t going away anytime soon  In 2013  coal accounted for nearly 40  of electricity generation in the United States 
And while the beleaguered coal industry is in the process of idling mines   which is painful for the companies and their workers   these actions will ultimately reduce supply and help stabilize coal prices going forward 
High Yield While You Wait
Unlike the majority of the  high  yield bond market  coal bonds are trading with massive yields 
But the aforementioned Walter Energy is in a very weak position  so it s best to look elsewhere 
Arch Coal  NYSE ACI   for example  is in a slightly more favorable credit condition and is rated B B3  S P Moody s  
You ll often see bond yields quoted as yield to maturity  which assumes the bond principal will be repaid in full  However  in order to properly assess the risk of these high yield bonds  we have to assume some type of credit event  In other words  the bond s principle won t be paid in full  and we should look at the current yield  which is the coupon dividend by the current bond price 
Arch Coal s senior unsecured bonds maturing in 2019 have a current yield of 14 4  

The ill timed acquisition of International Coal Group in 2011 left Arch laden with debt and more exposed to declining coal prices 
But the company still has  989 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet  Management is aggressively trying to control costs  which should help to mitigate the company s cash burn rate 
So  you ll get paid a 13 5  current yield while you wait for either an upturn in coal prices or some type of credit event 
Based on the fact that the bonds are now trading around  0 50 on the dollar  I believe that Arch Coal s senior unsecured bonds offer an attractive risk reward dynamic  as long as position sizes are kept small 
Remember  High yield bonds  which we ve been warning about all year  are one asset class category within the fixed income asset class  And fixed income is just one asset class within a diversified portfolio 
Buying individual corporate bonds certainly isn t for everyone  either  Fixed income securities are more complex than equities  and analyzing potential bankruptcy outcomes is particularly challenging  You also may have to call your broker s corporate bond desk to get a quote or make a transaction 
If you d rather not enter the arena with distressed debt hedge funds  then you can own a professionally managed closed end bond fund

11939,233454,ARCH,Sprott Money Managers  The Secret For Surviving The  Bernanke Put ,opinion,The  Bernanke Put   or promises of quantitative easing  has become the standard government response to economic uncertainty  But while the powers that be insist everything s fine  Sprott Resource Corp  Founder Kevin Bambrough and COO Paul Dimitriadis see financial deterioration around the globe  Only one thing is for certain  Taking the contrarian view provides the best opportunities to buy low and sell high  In this interview with The Energy Report  they explain why they expect energy assets to perform better in the long haul  cluing us in on a few names they are considering for big returns  The Energy Report  How would you characterize the current economic background  Are things really looking better in your view  Kevin Bambrough  Markets typically peak when fear is low and complacency is high  and bottom when fear is rampant and people are extremely worried  The U S  markets in general have performed quite well this year  but the U S  bond markets have started to see a lot of hiccups  The European debt market still remains on very shaky ground  The Chinese debt market is now showing major problems in the banking system and the Japanese are still trying to find a solution to their debt woes with increased monetization  and have started an aggressive currency devaluation exercise  Debt levels for governments and individuals around the world are still at unsustainably high levels relative to GDP or individual incomes  Bankers and governments continually lie to the public and pretend that things are better than they are  If they told the truth  no one would own a bond or keep money idle in cash  These days  the government guarantees and what people have referred to as a  Bernanke put  are the only reason rates are low and the bond market doesn t crash  The Federal Reserve must talk tough from time to time and pretend it s going to curtail its quantitative easing  The fact is it can t  Curtailing quantitative easing would force interest rates back up significantly  increase the government debt burden and raise the deficit  At the same time  it would crush the housing market and over levered consumers already struggling to pay off their mortgages  The increased debt burden would bankrupt governments  individuals and the entire financial system  TER  So realistically we re stuck with low interest rates for the foreseeable future  Paul Dimitriadis  There s no way that rates  in my view  are going to rise anytime soon  The Federal Reserve knows it can t allow them to rise materially  Americans may have an egocentric view that everything is fine because the S P 500 is at a new high  Globally  the situation is not that great  The emerging markets have performed terribly this year and we re starting to see unrest in a number of places around the world as social situations deteriorate rapidly  mainly in Brazil  Turkey  Egypt and such  All is certainly not well and I don t expect the situation to get better anytime soon  TER  When will everybody realize this is all a big charade  KB  I often try to predict the catalyst that breaks the bond bubble  Government bonds are primarily held by mega funds  and sovereign banks  The banks around the world do it because they can lever up and play the  game  Most governments do it to keep their currencies low and support their export economies  If interest rates rose  banks would be bankrupt  so they have no interest in seeding their demise  Governments try to pretend that deficits are going to eventually be brought under control  and continually make statements that there is no inflation  so they can prevent their currencies and bond markets from collapsing  Whenever economies slow as a result of higher interest rates  consumer confidence drops and interest rate sensitive sectors like housing slow  Central bankers  or shall we say central planners  will become more aggressive with quantitative easing and bring the rates down to try to kick start the economy again  That s the delicate game they have to continue playing  I expect this will continue for many years until the systemic U S  trade deficit stops being funded by foreigners  It could be a few months from now or a few years  but eventually foreigners will come to understand the stupidity of buying U S  government bonds to try to help their economies  I believe this is the Achilles heel of the system  and the U S  dollar reserve based global financial system s days are numbered  The U S  dollar will lose its reserve currency status when the Chinese  Japanese  Koreans and other major purchasers of U S  bonds decide it s not in their best interest to continue doing so  For the longest time  China and other countries have viewed purchasing U S  bonds as an effective way to keep their currencies relatively stable  But at some point they re going to give up on the foolishness of supporting the U S  trade deficit and focus more on their domestic economy  rather than on competitive devaluation to support exports  The fact is  they collectively have been giving the U S  over  500 billion worth of goods and services per year for over a decade  They will recoup little from these  loans  in the future  When they try to cash in their bond holdings  they will find there is no buyer other than the Federal Reserve  which will deliver them freshly printed currency that will only be accepted in the U S A  because no foreigner will want to accumulate more  When the trillions sent overseas come home to the U S   inflation will explode and trade restrictions will rise  TER  So how do we convert this into an investment strategy from a contrarian viewpoint  KB  It is difficult to try to determine the best asset class to own  You also have to pick a time horizon and focus on what the world is going to look like 10 20 years from now and evaluate the asset classes that could give the best rate of return  Ultimately  we always come back to what we believe that food  energy and other base and precious metals will do better in the long run  The key to investing in cyclical resource sectors is buying when they re depressed  Now we ve got a situation where they re extremely depressed in many sectors  TER  What are you doing at Sprott to deal with the current market environment for energy related investments  Has your approach changed since your last interview  KB  Precious metal equity values have come down substantially this year and we re starting to see some very good value and opportunities in that sector  As for base metals  we still think there s more potential downside  We re quite optimistic on developments in the natural gas market  Last year s injection season marked the smallest inventory increase in the modern history of the natural gas market  The withdrawal season was also the third largest on record  and that was with relatively average winter weather  At around  4 per thousand cubic feet   4 Mcf   demand is going to continue to grow faster than supply and that price will eventually be pushed higher  That will create value for companies like Long Run Exploration Ltd   LRE TSX   which we own  and which has significant natural gas exposure as well as stable profitability from its oil production  PD  Purely gas focused drilling activity is almost down to zero  We need to see higher prices to generate drilling demand from producers  which I think we will begin to see this year  KB  Another sector that s been quite depressed is coal  mostly as a result of low natural gas prices  A lot of mines have had to close or go through a restructuring  It looks like we re getting closer to a historic bottom in coal equity valuations and so we re looking around for opportunities to get some long term exposure to that sector  PD  As an example  Arch Coal Inc   ACI  is down from  28 to below  4 in the past two years  It was up over  70 around five years ago before the financial crisis  KB  During a boom in any sector  a lot of the big companies are tempted to take on debt and continue acquisitions  Arch Coal still has a significant amount of debt  There are other coal companies that will certainly survive  We may not be incentivized to bring a new coal mine into production today  but there s great incentive for us to buy coal mines that have long life reserves and wait  TER  You mentioned Long Run  which we talked about during your last interview  Where do you think that one s going  PD  The company merged last fall  Guide Exploration Ltd  and WestFire Energy Ltd  combined to form Long Run  and recently completed its first couple of quarters as a new entity  Production is going well and cash flow is meeting expectations  It s focusing on oil production exclusively this year due to the oil and gas pricing environment  There s a lot of room to pay a dividend later this year or next perhaps  which both we and the market would welcome seeing  Long Run s gas reserves are significant  so there is huge optionality on the gas side  Overall  it s a solid story and it s discounted to its peers  probably because it s a new name and there s currently a lack of fund flows into the general Canadian energy market  Looking at the various metrics relative to its peer group  you can safely conclude that it s trading at a 30 40  discount  If the sector gets revalued because money starts flying back into it  things can go higher from there  The optionality in the gas market could take the stock even higher  TER  Sprott Resource Corp  completed that nice deal on its Waseca Energy Inc  holdings last year when it sold out to Twin Butte Energy after four years  KB  We were very pleased with the performance of that company  Again  we stuck with our strategy of investing in a sector while it was depressed  We bought into heavy oil when it was no bid in Canada  formed the company and ultimately were able to monetize it when margins were significant and the company had grown from zero production into a  4 000 barrels per day company  That delivered another big win for our shareholders with a nearly  70 million profit  PD  Along that same vein  we ve invested in a drilling company based out of Houston  Texas called Independence Contract Drilling just over a year ago  It drills shale formations and  again  we invested in the sector when it was generally out of favor  and built the company up from book value to probably having above 12 rigs in production by the end of next year  I expect that at that time we will be able to capitalize on its strong cash flow and look for some sort of monetization  whether it s an IPO or sale of the business  TER  Another area we haven t talked about yet is uranium  I know you re into Virginia Energy Resources Inc   VUI TSX V   What s the update on that name  KB  The uranium market is similar to coal  Natural gas has weakened valuations and demand in all energy sectors  Fukushima also really upset the short term demand and created a very negative sentiment in the nuclear space  But demand for physical uranium for nuclear power production is going to grow over the next decade or two and mine supply will fall short with  40 per pound   40 lb  uranium  When we look at overall planned  permitted nuclear facility growth and as well as extensions of the existing facilities  we see robust demand and we see very little supply coming on the market  PD  We will see large supply shortfalls emerging in the next few years  The market s going to have to catch up on funding mines  because funding has been scarce over the last few years  We believe a uranium price north of  75 lb is going to be required to balance supply  Although the Commonwealth of Virginia has not yet passed legislation that would provide a framework for permitting uranium mining projects  we are hopeful it will in the near future  At that point the company would be greatly positively revalued  KB  Regardless of the uranium market  Virginia Energy Resources is one of the largest undeveloped uranium projects in the United States  and major producers will likely try to take out Virginia Energy Resources when the permitting framework is in place  TER  Where you see opportunities in the fertilizer potash markets  PD  Potash prices have softened a bit lately  We ve invested in one potash company that produces SOP potash  called Potash Ridge Corp   PRK TSX   It is developing a project in Utah  we think has very favorable economics based on the preliminary economic assessment  A prefeasibility study is expected in the next couple of months  which should give greater clarity on that project  The project s key benefits are the byproducts in the deposit  which lower the production cost dramatically  It should be one of the lowest cost producers of SOP potash  which is a growing market globally  We re optimistic that someone is going to have an interest in an offtake agreement and perhaps assist with the financing in the next 12 18 months  The phosphate market has been more stable than the potash side  In the U S   there is some risk for domestic producers due to potential shortfalls in their mines over the coming year  The phosphate market could be in very good shape over the next five years as those companies seek to replace their production  We re quite optimistic about one of our investments in a company called Stonegate Agricom Ltd   ST TSX   which is developing its potash project in Idaho  That should come into production in late 2014 or 2015  TER  Do you have any final thoughts you d like to leave with us  PD  The resource sector  generally  is probably the most out of favor it has been in a long  long time  If you re ever going to put money to work in this sector  right around now would probably be an opportune time to do so  KB  This is the kind of market that really allows those who are willing to step up and invest to make a lot of money  TER  Thank you gentlemen  for your updates and insights today  Kevin Bambrough founded Sprott Resource Corp  in September 2007  He is a seasoned financial executive with more than a decade of

11940,233455,ARCH,Coal Industry Stock Outlook   March 2014,opinion,"Coal plays a vital role in the economic development of a country  Coal not only provides a cheap source of electricity production but also creates employment opportunity for thousands of people  Coal with its heat generating capability also plays an essential role in the chemical  fertilizer and steel industries  Coal is a dominant source of power generation worldwide despite the increasing use of other resources  Coal still plays an important role in the U S  in the generation of power  However  natural gas and renewables are eating away its share at a rapid pace  The usage of natural gas and alternate sources for power generation will continue to pose challenges to coal  According to estimates by the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   the country s current coal reserves will last for 168 years at the present production rate  They might in all likelihood last even longer with environmental issues coming in the way  There is no denying the manifold advantages of coal  However  unchecked usage of this fossil fuel has raised concerns in all quarters  The primary cause of concern related to coal is global warming caused by the emission of greenhouse gases  President Obama s Climate Plan  followed by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  proposal for granting permission for setting up new power plants  is putting immense pressure on power producing units  In the light of these issues  if the U S  electricity generators opt for natural gas for power generation and invest more in alternate sources  what will be in stake for coal companies  Given the mounting environmental pressure  there is definitely a move away from coal as a power source  Per a report from Industrial Info Resources  active coal mining projects in the U S  have declined by 39  from 2011 levels  Per the report  there were  12 3 billion worth of active coal projects in 2011  which declined to  7 5 billion in 2013  Facts indicate the importance of coal is gradually waning in the U S  Will investments in coal stocks fail to generate adequate returns   Coal has lost ground for sure  but it is still a long way to go before it actually runs out of steam  On a global scale  coal still leads the way  There is hope for coal companies if they can produce high efficiency coal  Technological advancement and carbon capture and storage offer possible remedies for coal s future 
Zacks Rank
The Zacks Industry Rank  which relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks  currently puts the coal industry at 91 out of 259 industries in our expanded industry classification  This puts the industry in the mid third of all industries  corresponding to a neutral outlook  The way to look at the complete list of 259  industries is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  85 and lower  is positive  the middle one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  86 to  169  is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  170 and higher  is negative  Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks  which is at the core of our Industry Outlook  has an impressive track record going back years  verified by outside auditors  to foretell stock prices  particularly over the short term  1 to 3 months   Of the 18 companies belonging to the coal industry in our coverage 1 has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   1 has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   while 2 have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and none are rated Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The other 14 have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Overall  the coal industry has been through troubled times in 2013  with some signs of improvement in 2014  Our Zacks Rank for individual stocks indicates the possibility of a gradual recovery in the industry 
Earnings Review and Outlook
The coal industry s overall earnings results in the fourth quarter were on the softer side  U S  coal producers Peabody Energy Corporation  NYSE BTU   Alliance Resource Partners LP  ARLP O   Natural Resources LP  NRP   Alliance Holdings GP LP  AHGP O   and Cloud Peak Energy Inc  CLD   among others  surpassed the consensus estimates  In total  55  of the coal companies in our coverage either met or came out with positive earnings surprises in the fourth quarter  below the 64 3  average for the S P 500  In 2013  the coal industry was impacted by lower realized prices and increasing usage of natural gas and renewable sources for power production  At the same time a supply glut in most regions were putting downward pressure on coal prices  Unavailability of railroad services impacted the operations of some miners  The upcoming earnings releases in the first quarter are expected to remain soft as well  As per our current projection  Peabody Energy and James River Coal Company  JRCC O  are expected to surpass year ago earnings  Coal operators have recognized that tough times are ahead and are adhering to stringent measures to improve their financial performance  Miners have taken initiatives to lower cost while engaging in tactful capital expenditures to assure the safety of mine operations  The miners are shutting down high cost coal mines and moving their operations to low cost regions  Longwall coal mining techniques are also having a positive impact on production  A World Steel Association report suggests a 3 3  increase in global steel demand in 2014  This spike in steel demand might help met coal producers like Walter Energy Inc  NYSE WLT  and Rhino Resource Partners L P   RNO  to boost profits  Moreover  the demand for power fluctuates with seasons and a harsher winter or a more torrid summer may see higher demand for electricity and in turn more robust coal sales 
Coal Production   Consumption
Per an EIA report  U S  coal consumption in 2013 was 923 million short tons  MMst   which is expected to go up by 4 6  in 2014  The projected increase in coal usage in the U S  is attributable to higher demand for electricity and the rising cost of natural gas  However  coal consumption is expected to drop 3 1  year over year to 936 1 MMst in 2015  Per the EIA report  in sync with higher coal consumption  coal production in the U S  will increase by 3 2  to 1 027 5 MMst in 2014  The production is expected to decline by 1 4  year over to 1 013 1 MMst in 2015 Coal Trade Per the same EIA report  U S  coal exports in 2013 touched 118 MMst  6 1  lower than export levels achieved in 2012  EIA pegs U S  coal export at 103 3 MMst and 98 9 MMst in 2014 and 2015  respectively  The decline in export is a function of continued economic weakness in Europe and higher production from other coal exporting nations  Besides Australia and Russia  which has the second largest coal reserve next only to the U S   the U S  coal exporters could face competition from Indonesia  Australia is trying to tap demand in the Chinese and Japanese markets  thereby posing a tough competition to U S  producers 
Strengths
Coal as a major source of fuel for power generation dominates the utility industry  Coal is used to generate about half of the electricity consumed in the U S  Electricity generation absorbs about 93  of total U S  coal consumption  Apart from the utilities  coal is also used in various industries like chemicals  cement  paper  ceramics and metal products  to name a few  Given its heat producing feature  hard coal  metallurgical or coking coal  forms a key ingredient in the production of steel  Nearly 70  of global steel production depends on coal  Demand for coal from the developing economies  primarily in the Asian countries  is a driving force for the industry  Of the emerging Asian countries  economic growth in China and India is touted to be the fastest  These countries rely heavily on coal for electricity generation  In 2013  Arch Coal Inc  NYSE ACI  opened operations in Beijing to tap the growing metallurgical and thermal coal demand in South Asian markets 
Weaknesses
Coal is plentiful and fairly cheap relative to the cost of other sources of electricity  but its use produces emissions that adversely affect the environment  The sluggish pace of economic recovery and a supply glut have put downward pressure on the price of coal  EIA predicts average coal prices in the utility industry to decrease to  2 36 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in 2014 from  2 38 per MMBtu in 2012  The U S  government has been pretty vigilant  enforcing stricter regulations on coal fired generating units to curb pollution  The climate action plan from President Obama  followed by the EPA s proposal for implementing more stringent guidelines for setting up new coal power plants if diligently followed will increase the cost of producing electricity from coal  making it less attractive compared to other fuel sources  Increasing competition from natural gas and alternate sources of power generation is gradually eating away coal s share in power generation  We expect to see more of this trend going forward 
To Sum Up
At present the top four coal producers contribute more than 50  of U S  coal generation volume  Despite the stringent legislations and regulations regarding coal fired generation  we still see some positive news for the coal industry  The sudden increase in natural gas prices and an unrelenting winter to start off 2014 in most parts of the U S  could have a positive impact on U S  coal demand for the year  The U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis projects U S  real GDP to grow by 2 6  in 2014 and 3 2  in 2015  Total industrial production is expected to increase 2 8  in 2014 and 4 0  in 2015  We find these forecasts promising  as we expect a significant portion of increased energy needs to be provided by coal  As per the World Coal Association  proven global coal reserves will last nearly 112 years at current production rates  On the other hand  proven oil and gas reserves are projected to last around 46 years and 54 years  respectively  at current production levels  So  among the fossil fuels  coal has the chance to last longer unless strict environmental norms put coal out of business  Asia is the biggest coal market and presently accounts for 67  of the global coal consumption  China with its ongoing industrial development consumes nearly 50  of the total global coal  Industrialization in India is also perking up  leading to higher coal consumption  Japan is also increasing its thermal coal usage following the nuclear aftermath and the deactivation of the reactors  We have also noticed a change in the product mix preference for a prime coal producer  CONSOL Energy Inc  NYSE CNX   This traditional coal miner has shifted its focus to natural gas shedding most of its coal assets  The company has plans to divest additional coal assets  Will this be a new trend among the coal operators or just a stray example  Time will eventually reveal what is in store for the sector and its leading players  For now  coal operators are taking due precautions to safeguard against freak accidents  However  a recent chemical spill into a river in West Virginia is a harsh reminder that pollution from the coal industry is an ever present threat that can disrupt the living world  Coal has a long list of drawbacks  But its advantage lies in its price  which is far cheaper than other sources of fuel  The availability of coal in most countries across the globe makes it a widely accepted source of power generation globally  If we look at the global picture  it is evident that a cheap source of reliable power is a driving factor for economic development  Reinvigorating demand from growing economies and steady demand from the U S  will continue to drive the coal industry in the future ",2014-03-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/coal-industry-stock-outlook---march-2014-207173,207173

11942,233457,ARCH,Coal s  Million Dollar Mile  Gets Longer,opinion,"With cheap domestic Natural Gas prices and tighter environmental regulations  U S  demand for coal has fallen in recent years  So coal export has become ever more important to domestic coal producers  With accelerating growth in economy and power demand  Asia is the obvious new export target for U S  coal  U S  coal shipments outside the country in 2014 are expected to surpass 100 million tons for the third year  see chart below  
East  Pacific Northwest  Gulf  Typically  coal is transported via rail  truck to the port terminal and then exported by large dry bulk cargo ships  But the aging port infrastructure in the U S  is already struggling with capacity issue  The capacity along the east coast is strained with increasing US coal exports to Europe 
Theoretically  Pacific Northwest would be the best location for new coal terminals to serve the booming Asian market  The western region  including the Power River Basin  is the top coal producing area in the U S  according to the U S  Energy Dept  However  active environmentalism in Washington and Oregon has managed to block almost every major proposal for now coal terminal 
Frustrated  coal producers in the Powder River Basin are willing to pay a higher transit fee to terminals in Vancouver  Prince Rupert  and British Columbia  Canada  But Canadian ports are also having capacity issue handling the surging coal export volume from the U S  For now  Gulf of Mexico  where local governments and citizens are friendlier to the traditional energy and fossil fuel industries  seems the best option where additional capacity in the near term could be more likely 
China  Europe or South America  As a result  some U S  producers have shifted to target markets that are closer  such as Europe and Brazil  Europe is implementing more pollution control measures on power plants to wean itself from nuclear power after Japan s Fukushima disaster  as well as natural gas to reduce the supply dependency on Russia  In fact  UK was the top foreign buyer of American coal in 2013 

Increasing Global Coal Demand According to IEA  although U S  coal demand has dropped to 24 year low  the black rock is still the world s fastest growing energy source  forecast to rise 2 3 percent a year through 2018 and is the second largest source behind oil 
World Energy Demand by Fuel
The coal demand growth is driven mostly by non OECD countries with China leading the way  China is world s top coal producer  but the nation is also plagued by dangerous coal mining conditions and transport congestion  So China will continue to need more coal to feed its energy requirement  As long as China s economy holds up  U S  coal companies should benefit
From NIMBY to NIYBY However  a lot of the upside of coal export hinges on new export capacity gets approved and built in the U S  and ocean bulk freight stays low  Coal companies are eager to pour money into new terminals  Bloomberg reported that Oakland  California just recently rejected a coal export facility proposed by Bowie Resource Partners LLC despite the promise of  thousands  of new construction jobs and a  3 million a year payroll in city  The message from Oakland   Whatever the economic benefit would ve been  it wasn t worth destroying the planet over    Note  Oakland s unemployment rate is higher than that of the national average as well as California    As the environmental cause has evolved from NIMBY  Not in My Back Yard  to NIYBY  Not in Your Back Yard   coal industry needs to address oppositions not only on coal dust from train  but also on potential global climate impact  So even though many producers are hopeful of new export facilities eventually coming online  status quo seems more likely the near term outlook  Ocean Freight Could Bite Currently  ocean freight rates are at historical low because of vessel overcapacity  This has allowed US coal to be more competitive in international markets  But freight rate will not stay this low for too long  By then  the U S  coal will have a difficult time competing with producers in Indonesia  Australia and Russia that are closer to the Asian key markets  According to WSJ  while shipping coal from a U S  mine to a customer in Asia adds  50 to the per ton price  Australian producers can get coal from their mines to China and other Asian markets for half that Near Term Outlook  China will continue to import coal from U S  mines via Canadian coal terminals operated by companies such as Westshore Terminals Ltd  Westshore has raised its annual handling capacity to 33 million tonnes this year from 24 million tonnes in 2007 and are sending as much as 3 76 million tons a month abroad  In the U S   CONSOL Energy Inc   NYSE CNX  has some export advantage over peers since the company owns the Baltimore Marine terminal   Bloomberg noted this is the only terminal wholly owned by a coal company in the U S   Other coal companies will have to pay fees to CONSOL to use the terminal with 15 million tons a year capacity  Rail companies like CSX  NYSE CSX   Norfolk Southern  NYSE NSC  and top U S  coal companies Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU   Alpha Natural Resources  NYSE ANR  and Arch Coal  NYSE ACI  also jointly or individually own a few terminals on the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico  Houston based terminal operator Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  NYSE KMP  last year said it plans to invest more than  450 million in coal terminal expansion projects  That already caused air quality concerns at Houston Ship Channel among local environmentalists  This suggests U S  Gulf Coast states may seem more accommodating to oil and gas in the past  the coal dust air pollution problem means new coal facilities may have a tougher road ahead getting approved  A Million Dollar Mile Awaits The recent trend suggests U S  regulators are increasingly taking into consideration the global warming impacts of coal pollution problem in Asia as they decide on new coal terminal proposals  But I see the logic goes like this  The law of supply and demand says to feed its energy hunger  Asia will get its coal  Crude Oil and Gas  from somewhere else  if not from the U S   Until Asia developing nations get their environmental standards and regulations together  the global warming impact will go on even if U S  totally bans all energy export to Asia ",2014-05-21,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/coal's-'million-dollar-mile'-gets-longer-213615,213615

11944,233459,ARCH,Coal Industry Languishes  But All Is Not Lost,opinion,Overview Coal plays a vital role in the economic development of a country  It is commonly used as a source of cheap electricity production  Coal also creates employment opportunities for thousands of people  Coal with its heat generating capability also plays an essential role in the chemical  fertilizer and steel industries  This fossil fuel is still a dominant source of power generation worldwide despite the increasing use of other resources  Natural gas and renewables are eating away its share at a rapid pace  challenging the monopoly of coal  There is no denying the manifold advantages of coal and its various byproducts that find use in the industrial sector  However  unchecked usage of this fossil fuel has raised concerns in all quarters  The primary cause of concern related to coal is global warming caused by the emission of greenhouse gases  Recently  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has proposed a Clean Power Plan  the primary objective of which is to cut down emissions from existing power plants by 30  over the 2005 to 2030 time frame  Given the mounting environmental pressure  there is definitely a popular move away from coal as a power source  Per a report from Industrial Info Resources  active coal mining projects in the U S  have declined by 39  from 2011 levels  The report says that such projects declined to  7 5 billion in 2013 from  12 3 billion in 2011  Facts clearly indicate that the importance of coal is gradually waning in the U S  Will investments in coal stocks fail to generate adequate returns   Coal has lost ground for sure  but it is still a long way to go before it actually runs out of steam Response from the Coal Companies Recent developments reveal that the coal companies are not ready to accept the EPA carbon plan without a fight  A lawsuit filed by Murray Energy Corporation has now been joined by nine states  Murray Energy claims that the EPA regulation will have a negative impact on thousands of jobs and hurt the American economy Zacks Rank The Zacks Industry Rank  which relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks  currently puts the coal industry at 236 out of 260 industries in our expanded industry classification  This puts the industry in the lower third of all industries  corresponding to a negative outlook  The way to look at the complete list of 260 industries is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  85 and lower  is positive  the middle one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  86 to  169  is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  170 and higher  is negative  Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks  which is at the core of our Industry Outlook  has an impressive track record going back years  verified by outside auditors  to foretell stock prices  particularly over the short term  1 to 3 months   Of the 20 companies belonging to the coal industry in our coverage 1 each has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Zacks Rank  2  Buy   while 9 have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and 2 have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The remaining 7 have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Overall  the coal industry has been through troubled times in 2013  with hardly any respite seen in the first half of 2014 Earnings Review and Outlook The coal industry s overall earnings results in the first quarter were on the softer side  Yet  U S  coal producers like  Alliance Resource Partners  L P   NASDAQ ARLP   Natural Resources LP  NRP   Alliance Holdings GP  L P   NASDAQ AHGP   CONSOL Energy Inc   NYSE CNX  and Alpha Natural Resources  Inc   NYSE ANR  among others surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In total  36  of the coal companies in our coverage either met or came out with positive earnings surprises in the first quarter  way below the 67 8  average for the S P 500  The second quarter earnings releases are expected to remain soft as well  As per our current projection  nearly 50  of the coal companies under our coverage are expected to report in the red  In response to the lackluster coal market fundamentals  the companies have resorted to stringent measures to improve their financial performance  Miners have taken initiatives to cut cost while engaging in tactful capital expenditures to assure the safety of mining operations  The high cost coal mines are being shuttered while operations are moved to low cost regions  Longwall coal mining techniques are also having a positive impact on production  For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for the different sectors in our coverage  please check our weekly Earnings Trends report Coal Production   Consumption As per the World Coal Association  proven global coal reserves will last nearly 112 years at current production rates  On the other hand  proven oil and gas reserves are projected to last around 46 years and 54 years  respectively  at current production levels  So  among the fossil fuels  coal has the chance to last longer  Per an U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  report  U S  coal consumption in 2013 was 924 million short tons  MMst   which is expected to go up 2 8  in 2014  The projected increase in coal usage in the U S  is attributable to higher demand for electricity and the rising cost of natural gas  However  coal consumption is expected to drop 2 8  year over year to 924 MMst in 2015  The EIA report also projects a 2 7  increase in coal production in the U S  to 1 011 MMst in 2014  The production is expected to decline 0 9  year over to 1 002 MMst in 2015 Coal Trade Per the same EIA report  U S  coal exports in 2013 touched 118 MMst  but it are expected to decline going forward  EIA pegs U S  coal export at 99 MMst and 95 MMst in 2014 and 2015  respectively  The decline in export is a function of lower global demand and higher production from other coal exporting nations  Besides Australia and Russia  which has the second largest coal reserve next only to the U S   the U S  coal exporters could face competition from Indonesia  Australia is trying to tap the demand in Chinese and Japanese markets  thereby posing a tough challenge to U S  producers Key Coal Stock Picks Alliance Resource Partners LP has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while its shares gained 20 1  year to date  The partnership registered earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 12 23   The long term earnings growth projection is 6   The partnership operates 11 mining complexes in the Illinois basin and the Appalachian region  The firm produces a variety of coal from its mining complexes as per the requirements of its customers  Existing long term contracts with their customers provide visibility to Alliance Resource s earnings stream  Its long history of increasing cash distribution also keeps investors interested in the stock  Another coal operator  CONSOL Energy Inc  currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and its shares have gained 12 1  year to date  CONSOL delivered an earnings beat of 165  in the first quarter  The long term earnings growth projection is 12   Though this coal company has shifted its focus to natural gas production  it still holds high quality  low cost mines  Despite selling a large part of its coal assets  total revenues of CONSOL consisted nearly 55  of coal revenues in the first quarter  Production from its BMX mining complex could help the company to benefit from any revival in coal market demand  In addition  CONSOL s increasing natural gas production volumes will ensure a strong performance To Sum Up Currently the top four coal producers contribute more than 50  of U S  coal generation volume  Despite stringent legislations and regulations regarding coal fired generation  we still see some positives at play for the coal industry  Coal companies could benefit from higher natural gas prices  reduction in stockpiles due to higher demand and a rebound in global steel usage  The World Steel Association forecasts that steel use will increase 3 1  to 1 527 Mt in 2014 and grow further by 3 3  to reach 1 576 Mt in 2015  The revival in steel demand could improve the prospects of met coal producers like Walter Energy Inc   WLT  and Rhino Resource Partners L P   RNO   The prices of coal can go up in the latter half of 2014 as the utilities will have to buy more coal to produce electricity and replenish their stockpiles  However  railroad services will have to deliver  Congestion in railroad services like it happened in the first half of the year could dampen coal prices  Asia is the biggest coal market and presently accounts for 67  of the global coal consumption  China with its ongoing industrial development consumes nearly 50  of the total global coal  Industrialization in India is perking up  leading to higher coal consumption  Japan is also increasing its thermal coal usage following the nuclear aftermath and the deactivation of the reactors  To take advantage of increasing coal demand from the Asian countries  premier U S  coal producers like Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU  and Arch Coal Inc   NYSE ACI  have opened operations in these regions  Coal has a long list of drawbacks  But its advantage lies in its price  which is far cheaper than other sources of fuel  The availability of coal in most countries across the globe makes it a widely accepted source of power generation globally  If we look at the global picture  it is evident that a cheap source of reliable power is a driving factor for economic development  Reinvigorating demand from growing economies and steady demand from the U S  will continue to drive the coal

 I think one can kind of argue that as people get newly insured  there may be some pent up demand  And so in the early periods of coverage  that s where you start to see some of the higher demand and maybe some of the outpatient and others trails off  And I think the uncertainty around the future of health reform is that s just a factor of utilization trends we re going to have to monitor   HCA

Metallurgical coal markets may be close to bottoming
 Of course  we believe that we are close to the bottom in the met markets today  Global production curtailments have accelerated in 2014  and by our account total nearly 20 million tons thus far    Arch Coal Inc  NYSE ACI  
However  Met coal companies still have to work off inventories before production cuts start to impact the market
 As I said  there has been about 20 million tons announced in terms of what s been implemented  I think a large amount of that may have been implemented  but they are now they are working just as we are  the inventories both at the mine and then those inventories have to work the way clear through the customer  And that s going to take some time to estimate how quickly that will happen is very very difficult  I have seen estimates as early as we ll start to really see the impact of that in the fourth quarter  I ve seen folks say that they believe that will be early next year  but it s really very hard to tell    Walter Energy Inc  NYSE WLT

11946,233461,ARCH,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Arch Coal  Cloud Peak Energy  CONSOL Energy And Contura Energy,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Jan 31  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Coal  Part 2  including Arch Coal Inc     NYSE ARCH     Cloud Peak Energy    NYSE CLD     CONSOL Energy Inc  NYSE CNX      NYSE CEIX    and Contura Energy    NS CNTE    Industry  Coal  Part 2Link  Energy analysts downplay coal as a fuel source and are quite skeptical about its prospects  But the Trump administration remains committed to the industry s competitive position through the relaxation of emissions rules Apart from the relaxation of stringent environment legislation  coal demand also benefit from the higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in the global market  An increase in steel production from Asian countries like China and Japan will pave the way for shipments of metallurgical coal Per a report from the World Coal Association  there are currently 861 billion tons of proven coal reserves worldwide  implying that there is enough coal to last nearly 112 years at the current rates of production  Compared with this  proven oil and gas reserves are predicted to last around 46 and 54 years  respectively  at the current production levels The current availability of coal even outpaces the combined proven reserves of oil and gas  So  the advantages of coal cannot be overlooked  and may be expected to brighten long term prospects of investors Trump s decision to walk out from the Paris Climate Agreement and repeal the Clean Power Plan should keep fossil fuel based electricity generation afloat longer  Also  the recent Supreme Court ruling temporarily halted the implementation of the Clean Power Plan Let s dig a little deeper into the factors driving this industry Coal s Share in U S  Power Generation  Despite usage of natural gas  coal is still among the major sources of fuel for electricity generation in the United States  Per the U S  Energy Information Administration s   EIA    release  coal s share in electric generation was 30  in 2017 and is expected to average nearly 30  in 2018 as well Even with a decline of coal s share in power generation from historical levels  it is quite heartening to notice that the U S  electricity generation is increasingly shifting to refined coal  Per EIA  use of refined coal has increased from 17  of power sector coal consumption in 2016 to nearly 19  in 2017  We expect the rising awareness among the U S  utility operators to lead to increased usage of refined coal in power production  which has less emissions compared with conventional coal In addition  the utility operators in the United States are installing mercury control equipment in the coal fired plants to meet the emission control standards  a big positive for the coal industry in the country EIA release showed the delivered coal price averaged  2 10 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in 2017 and is expected to increase to  2 21 MMBtu in 2018 Coal as Input for Steel Industry  Due to its heat producing nature  hard coal  metallurgical or coking coal  forms a key ingredient in the production of steel  Nearly 70  of global steel production depends on coal  Since  met coal  is an essential ingredient for the production of steel  U S  met coal producers are likely to benefit from the increase in steel consumption Although the steel industry is expected to remain under pressure for some time  it is certainly expected to grow on the back of flourishing automotive and construction industries  A recent report by The World Steel Association showed that world crude steel production reached 1 691 2 million tons  Mt  in 2017  up 5 3  from 2016  Steel production in 2018 is expected to improve from 2017 levels  This definitely is a ray of hope for metallurgical coal producers and will boost prospects of metallurgical coal producers like Arch Coal Inc  Demand Upsurge in Asian Countries  The increasing demand for coal in Asian economies like China and India has been a key price driver since the end of recession in 2009  We expect this trend to continue in the future  primarily owing to rising energy needs in India  China and Southeast Asian countries Though Asian countries also produce coal  it is not sufficient to meet the growing demand in the region  resulting in regular imports  Southeast Asia has a surging demand for electricity  chiefly due to its improving economies  Numerous coal based power plants are presently under construction and more are being planned over the next few years  This will create ample export opportunities for the U S  thermal coal producers  Per a International Energy Agency release  coal imports in India will increase 5  per year through 2022 Per EIA  coal production increased 45 million short tons  MMst   6   in 2017 to 773 MMst in response to high demand for U S  coal exports  However  coal exports are expected to drop in 2018 due to use of cheap natural gas Recently Cloud Peak Energy entered into a long term coal export sales agreement with JERA Trading Pte Ltd  for supplying coal to two power plants in Japan  The coal shipment is expected to begin at the end of 2019 and is likely to continue for a period of 30 40 months  The coal export volumes are expected to touch 1 million metric tons in the final year of contract Not Just Electricity Generation  Electricity generation is just one use of coal in the United States  Manufacturing plants and industries use it to make chemicals  cement  paper  ceramics and metal products  etc  Methanol and ethylene  which can be prepared from coal gas  are used to make products such as plastics  medicines  fertilizers and tar Certain industries consume large amounts of coal  For example  concrete and paper companies burn coal  and the steel industry uses coke and coal by products to make steel for bridges  buildings and automobiles  Per the EIA  consumption of coal in other sectors is expected to remain flat in 2018 at 52 4 MMst and increase by 0 7 MMst year over year to 53 1 MMst tons in 2019 New Coal Focused Company  The much awaited spin off of CONSOL has resulted in the formation of coal focused CONSOL Energy Inc   which will have interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex  the Baltimore Marine Terminal and approximately 1 billion tons of greenfield coal reserves To Sum UpInterestingly  among all other coal companies  Contura Energy  carrying a Zacks Rank  3  seems to be operating on a different level  The company surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters  Contura Energy is expected to come out with positive earnings surprise this season as well  You can see  For the aggressively growing and energy hungry Asian economies  coal seems to be the most popular source of power generation  despite inroads being made by renewables  In a global scale  the importance of coal as a fuel source is far from over  but U S coal producers will continue to face tough competition from the coal exporters in Australia  Indonesia and Russia Coal is by far the most stable source of energy  The majority of the coal consumed in the United States is actually produced in America and the coal industry provides jobs to thousands of Americans  The  America First  approach of President Trump will help the

11964,233479,ARCH,Coal Stocks Grinding Higher,opinion,Coal stocks continue to steadily emerge from a brutal bear market over the past 2 years  Last week Market Vectors  Coal ETF  KOL  broke above its 30 week moving average for the first time since early 2012  As you can see on the chart below  KOL has been declining below this moving average in a Stage 4 decline since August 2011  If KOL can continue to move higher above the 30 week moving average it will transition into a Stage 2 uptrend Looking at a daily chart of KOL  a couple of things stand out  First  the RSI has consistently stayed above 40 since September  even during pullbacks  This is typically the sign of an emerging uptrend since KOL is failing to get too oversold when it pulls back  Next  the action in October was encouraging as volume started to increase when KOL started to approach resistance around the 25 26 area  Things changed quickly though after the re election of President Obama  which was perceived to be a negative for the coal market  A wave of selling hit the coal sector right after the election and caused a big gap down in KOL  It continued to sell down to about 23  but instead of continuing lower  found support there that has held since June 2012  KOL started to move higher once again in December  KOL gapped higher to start 2013 and each of the 3 trading days in 2013 have seen above average volume  which is a good sign for a breakout Next let s look at some individual coal stocks  Most coal stocks are lacking one key ingredient for a breakout  which is an increase in volume  Just like the KOL ETF  individual coal stocks saw increasing volume in October  but have seen limited buying pressure since the gap down after the presidential election  These stocks need to see buying pressure to overcome the gap down resistance and to transition into sustained uptrends Peabody Energy  BTU  and Arch Coal  ACI  are two examples of coal stocks below their election gap downs  Both have established a pattern of higher lows and have bullish RSI readings  but need volume to move past their gap down levels Alpha Natural Resources  ANR  has overcome its gap down from the election  and has seen a little more buying pressure than BTU and ACI As 2012 came to a close and during the start of 2013 the market has seen some sectors that were crushed over the past 2 years move substantially higher  This includes solar stocks  steel stocks  and some major commodity producers  The coal sector looks poised to continue rallying but needs more volume to come into the sector  otherwise the chances of the rally continuing are diminished  In particular  watch how the sector trades as a whole as time moves forward  The best scenario for a sustained uptrend would be to see increased volume across the board in individual coal stocks as well as the KOL ETF  Disclosure  Long ANR,2013-01-07,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/coal-stocks-grinding-higher-149778,149778

11978,233493,ARCH,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Arch Coal  Cloud Peak  CONSOL And Warrior Met,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 29  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Health Insurance  including Arch Coal Inc    NYSE ARCH    Cloud Peak Energy   NYSE CLD    CONSOL Energy Inc  NYSE CNX     NYSE CEIX   and Warrior Met Coal Inc    NYSE HCC   Industry  Coal  Part 2Link  The majority of energy sector analysts are quite skeptical of coal s future as an energy source  Coal as a fuel source is pass  in the United States  but there is no denying that the commodity is a powerhouse for fuel on a global scale Stringent emission rules and regulations had lowered the importance of coal in the U S  But the Trump administration remains committed to support the industry through regulatory relaxation Apart from the roll back of stringent environmental legislation  coal demand is also benefiting from higher usage in other industries in addition to electricity generation  An increase in steel production from Asian countries like China and Japan is helping support shipments of metallurgical coal Per a report from the World Coal Association  the current availability of coal even outpaces the combined proven reserves of oil and gas  So  the advantages of coal cannot be overlooked  and may be expected to brighten long term prospects of investors Trump s decision to walk out from the Paris Climate Agreement and repeal the Clean Power Plan should keep fossil fuel based electricity generation afloat longer  Also  the recent Supreme Court ruling temporarily halted the implementation of the Clean Power Plan Let s dig a little deeper into the factors driving this industry Coal s Share in U S  Power Generation  Despite usage of natural gas  coal is still among the major sources of fuel for electricity generation in the United States  Per the U S  Energy Information Administration s   EIA   release  coal s share in electric generation was 30  in 2017 and is expected to be the same in 2018 Even with a decline of coal s share in power generation from historical levels  it is quite heartening to notice that the U S  electricity generation is increasingly shifting to refined coal  Per EIA  use of refined coal has increased from 17  of power sector coal consumption in 2016 to nearly 19  in 2017  We expect the rising awareness among U S  utility operators to lead to increased usage of refined coal in power production  which has fewer emissions compared with conventional coal In addition  the utility operators in the U S  are installing mercury control equipment in the coal fired plants to meet the emission control standards  a big positive for the coal industry in the country Coal as Input for Steel Industry  Due to its heat producing nature  hard coal  metallurgical or coking coal  forms a key ingredient in the production of steel  Nearly 70  of global steel production depends on coal  Since  met coal  is an essential ingredient for the production of steel  U S  met coal producers are likely to benefit from the increase in steel consumption Although the steel industry is expected to remain under pressure for some time  it is certainly expected to grow on the back of flourishing automotive and construction industries  A recent report by The World Steel Association showed that world steel demand will touch 1 616 1 million tons  Mt  in 2018  up 1 8  from 2017  Steel demand is expected to move up by 0 7  in 2019 to touch 1 626 7 Mt  This definitely is a ray of hope for metallurgical coal producers and will boost the prospects of companies like Arch Coal Inc Demand in Asian Countries  The increasing demand for coal in Asian economies like China and India has been a key price driver since the end of the Great Recession  We expect this trend to continue in the future  primarily owing to rising energy needs in India  China and Southeast Asian countries A recent EIA release shows that a number of countries in and around the Middle East will start adding coal fired power plants  Per the report  over the next decade  nearly 41 GW of coal fired units will be added in the region  creating demand for thermal coal Though Asian countries also produce coal  it is not sufficient to meet the growing demand in the region  resulting in regular imports Cloud Peak Energy entered into a long term coal export sales agreement with JERA Trading Pte Ltd  for supplying coal to two power plants in Japan  Coal shipment is expected to begin at the end of 2019 and is likely to continue for a period of 30 40 months  Coal export volumes are expected to touch 1 million metric tons in the final year of contract Not Just Electricity Generation  Electricity generation is just one use of coal in the United States  Manufacturing plants and industries use it to make chemicals  cement  paper  ceramics and metal products  etc  Methanol and ethylene  which can be prepared from coal gas  are used to make products such as plastics  medicines  fertilizers and tar Certain industries consume large amounts of coal  For example  concrete and paper companies burn coal  and the steel industry uses coke and coal by products to make steel for bridges  buildings and automobiles New Coal Focused Company The much awaited spin off of CONSOL has resulted in the formation of coal focused CONSOL Energy Inc   which will have interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex  the Baltimore Marine Terminal and approximately 1 billion tons of greenfield coal reserves To Sum UpInterestingly  among all other coal companies  Warrior Met Coal Inc   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   seems to be operating on a different level  The company surpassed earnings estimates in the last four quarters  Warrior Met Coal is expected to come up with positive earnings surprise in the second quarter as well  You can see  For the aggressively growing and energy hungry Asian economies  coal seems to be the most popular source of power generation  despite inroads being made by renewables  On a global scale  the importance of coal as a fuel source is far from over  but U S  coal producers will continue to face tough competition from the commodity s exporters in Australia  Indonesia and Russia Coal is by far the most stable source of energy  The majority of the coal consumed in the United States is actually produced in America and the coal industry provides jobs to thousands Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities  including a broker

11980,233495,ARCH,5 Winners For Best Post Midterm Rally In 36 Years,opinion,"Wall Street sees best rally after midterm election in over three decades  as a congressional power divide eased fears about abrupt changes in policies that could easily hurt corporates  And with the United States economy on track for a mind blowing year that could come seriously close to a 13 year milestone  the stock market seems to be in good shape  Thus  investing in solid stocks that can make the most of the current positives seems judicious Best Post Midterm Rally Since 1982As widely expected  the Democrats gained control over the House of Representatives  while Republicans retained control of the Senate  The results  thus  delivered a split Congress and a legislative gridlock for the remaining two years of President Trump s tenure Stock market bulls cheered the outcome   After all  things aren t that bad in case of a divided Congress  Although the markets did get a nice pop in anticipation of tax reforms  the recent trade related issues have been a dampener  Consequently  Democrats controlling the House of Representatives will no doubt compel Trump to tone down his hawkish trade policy stance The Dow Jones finished nearly 550 points higher  or 2 13  on Nov 7 and registered its best one day climb since Oct 16  The broader S P 500 climbed 58 43 points or 2 1   its third best day of 2018  The

rose 4 3  and 3 9   respectively There are  in fact  a lot of similarities between the 1982 midterm election and this year  Needless to say  36 years back  Republican president Ronald Reagan had majority in the Senate  while Democrats controlled the House Stalemate in Washington  Good for StocksSince 1928  stocks have always generated an annual average return of 12  in years when a Republican president held office  while Congress was split between the red wave and the blue wave  per Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC   And in the year after the midterm election  returns on average have surged more than 20    Source  BofA Merrill Lynch Goldman further added that where Democrats control the House and Republicans  the Senate  the S P 500 is widely expected to gain 20  on average in the following one year period  Meanwhile  if Republicans had won the House and Democrats the Senate  the S P 500 was anticipated to gain a meager 3  But no matter what the outcome is  the stock market is expected to gain traction post midterm  The S P 500 has increased on average 15 3  in the six months following midterm election in the third year of a given presidency  which is incidentally this year  Research also showed that the frequency of advance  FoA  for this occurrence was 94  of the overall time period of Oct 31  1944 Sep 29  2014  per S P Capital IQ And how can we forget that

11982,233497,ARCH,Arch Coal Sees Hammer Chart Pattern  Time To Buy ,opinion,"Arch Coal  Inc    NYSE ARCH   has been struggling lately  but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon  That is because ARCH recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom 
What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  
A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead 
Other Factors
Plus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In just the past 60 days alone 2 estimates have gone higher  compared to 1 lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction 
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if ARCH stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development  You can see

11990,233505,ARCH,Focus Returns To Corporate Earnings And Europe,opinion,U S  stocks rallied on Election Day Tuesday  ostensibly in anticipation of a  surprise  Romney win  But on Wednesday  after huge dollars were spent on rancorous campaigns and attack ads that only further deepened the divide in our country  we woke up to find ourselves with the same President and divided Congress that previously failed to address the looming Fiscal Cliff  That realization was coupled with negative comments by ECB President Draghi about the European debt crisis hurting Germany s GDP  which returned the nearly forgotten Europe problem to front and center  As if on cue following the U S  elections  Greek parliamentary workers walked off the job and riots erupted over austerity measures  which the government narrowly passed  by the way    This all simply piled on to investors  concerns about President Obama s vision for taxation  especially with regard to capital gains and dividends  Investors made their displeasure clear with a defensive  risk off  turn  Nevertheless  dividend paying stocks should remain preferable to low yielding bonds for income investors   The Financial sector got smacked  with the exception of REITs  And because Romney was the big supporter of clean coal as an important fuel source  coal stocks got hit particularly hard  including Market Vectors Coal ETF  KOL   Arch Coal  ACI   Peabody Energy  BTU   and Walter Energy  WLT   along with most of the rest of the Energy sector  On the other hand  some Healthcare stocks that stand to benefit from Obamacare moved strongly against the negative sentiment  including hospital operators like Community Health Services  CYH   Health Management Associates  HMA   and Tenet Healthcare  THC    In any case  the election results are clear without the need to examine  hanging chads   I have some key takeaways  First  a populist message can prevail anywhere when the huddled masses are worried about the basic necessities  They would rather rely on the certainty of their safety net  some would call it  shackles   of entitlements than the uncertain potential for a more robust economy and enhanced job opportunities   Second  the  50s era  Father Knows Best  social platform of the Republican Party is their ball and chain that must be overhauled if they are ever to win another national election  Even regionally  evolving demographics are rendering the basic conservative social platform as extreme and out of touch  No matter how much a moderate or independent voter wanted to try Romney s ideas for stimulating the economy through tax cuts and regulatory reform  many  particularly women  simply could not get past the harsh social policies  on abortion  immigration  gay marriage  etc   demanded by the party s vocal fringe   Nevertheless  even Obama s most ardent supporters are unhappy with the pace of economic recovery  which has been fueled almost entirely by FOMC monetary policy  He very nearly lost this race solely because of his inability to effect meaningful jobs growth  Hopefully  the President recognizes this and will be willing to truly  reach across the aisle  to incorporate at least some of the fiscal policies put forth by Romney that were so appealing to so many  In any case  it is imperative to our nation s long term health that the President reverses the alarming entitlement mentality in favor of America s traditional  can do  mentality   Unfortunately  corporate earnings have been shrinking while companies continue to either store cash or buy back shares to boost reported EPS  if you can t increase the numerator then reduce the denominator   It s not a healthy situation when stocks rise due to the flood of unlimited liquidity rather than good old fashioned earnings growth  New jobs are not created  On the plus side  some companies are doing their best to lead the way  such as Qualcomm  QCOM   which came out with a stellar report afterhours on Wednesday  including raised guidance on both earnings and revenues  Note that QCOM is one of Sabrient s top ranked stocks within the iShares Dow Jones US Technology Sector Fund  IYW    With the contentious rhetoric and vitriolic sound bites of election season behind us  the real work can now begin  As I have said before  in a business  failure is all but assured if half the company is trying to undermine the strategies and initiatives of the leadership  Cooperation is essential for survival  But in our representative democracy  cooperation can come back to haunt you at election time  so obstructionism is the norm  My hope is that our elected representatives will find it within themselves to recognize the seriousness of our predicament  put dogma aside  show a modicum of respect for differing views  and help our economy move forward   Looking at the charts  psychologically important support levels at Dow 13 000  S P 500 1 400 and Nasdaq 3 000 all gave way on Wednesday  The S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed at 139 72  below the important 140 level  but let s see if it confirms today  Thursday  SPY is now struggling at its 100 day SMA  with the critical 200 day SMA just below around 138  The 200 day provided support back in June  If it can manage to do so again  the bearish falling channel shown might turn out to be a bull flag  continuation  pattern  However  oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all now pointing down bearishly at least for the moment but they are each in a position where they could turn back up on a dime  Last week I suggested that a rally into the election was quite possible  but breaking back up through prior support turned resistance at 143 wouldn t be easy  And it wasn t  SPY was turned back twice from that level  The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 19 08  which is elevated but still below the important 20 level   and still quite low in its historical range   Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF   High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend   As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Observations 1  Financial  IYF  has relinquished the top spot to Healthcare  IYH   IYH comes in this week with an Outlook score of 77  while IYF scores a close 75  Stocks within both sectors continue to get decent support from Wall Street analysts raising earnings estimates  and both have strong return on sales  Technology  IYW  holds on to third place with an Outlook score of 67  but it has been gradually dropping  and now defensive sector Consumer Goods  IYK  is nipping at its heels 2  Telecom  IYZ  fell back down into the cellar with an Outlook score of 28  despite continued support from Wall Street  Utilities  IDU  stays in the bottom two with a score of 30 3  Overall  I would continue to characterize the Outlook rankings as neutral  with the more aggressive and defensive sectors mixed about in the rankings  On the bullish side  Energy  IYE  and Materials  IYM  have risen about 10 points each  but on the other hand  Industrial  IYJ  fell further down the rankings  Also  the range from the top to the bottom Outlook scores remains tight  reflecting a lot of uncertainty as to which sectors will emerge as the strongest  This week the top bottom range has further tightened to 50 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Materials  IYM  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 65  Utilities  IDU  is now the weakest on strong market days  scoring 43  In other words  Materials stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is the clear investor safe haven on weak market days  scoring 63  which remains far ahead of second place IYH at 51  Technology  IYW  is still the weakling during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 40  followed by IYM at 41  In other words  Tech and Materials stocks have been selling off the most lately when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best 6  Overall  Financial  IYF  still shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 182  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 121  As for Bull Bear combination  IYF is the best at 107  while Technology  IYW  and Telecom  IYZ  have the worst combined scores of 94 and 93  respectively These scores represent the view that the Healthcare and Financial sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Utilities sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYH and IYF include DaVita HealthCare Partners  DVA   Watson Pharmaceuticals  WPI   Signature Bank New York  SBNY   and Visa  V  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned   About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look   Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods   Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions   Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors   About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias   However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2012-11-08,Scott

battered industry are working   The increased shipments came as the European Union and other U S  allies heaped criticism on the Trump administration for its rejection of the Paris Climate Accord  a deal agreed by nearly 200 countries to cut carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels like coal   The previously unpublished figures provided to Reuters by the U S  Energy Information Administration showed exports of the fuel from January through May totaled 36 79 million tons  up 60 3 percent from 22 94 million tons in the same period in 2016  While reflecting a bounce from 2016  the shipments remained well below volumes recorded in equivalent periods the previous five years  They included a surge to several European countries during the 2017 period  including a 175 percent increase in shipments to the United Kingdom  and a doubling to France   which had suffered a series of nuclear power plant outages that required it and regional neighbors to rely more heavily on coal   If Europe wants to lecture Trump on climate then EU member states need transition plans to phase out polluting coal   said Laurence Watson  a data scientist working on coal at independent think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative in London   Nicole Bockstaller  a spokeswoman at the EU Commission s Energy and Climate Action department  said that the EU s coal imports have generally been on a downward trend since 2006  albeit with seasonable variations like high demand during cold snaps in the winter   Overall exports to European nations totaled 16 million tons in the first five months of this year  up from 10 5 million in the same period last year  according to the figures  Exports to Asia meanwhile  totaled 12 3 million tons  compared to 6 2 million tons in the year earlier period   Trump had campaigned on a promise to  cancel  the Paris deal and sweep away Obama era environmental regulations to help coal miners  whose output last year sank to the lowest level since 1978  The industry has been battered for years by surging supplies of cheaper natural gas  brought on by better drilling technologies  and increased use of natural gas to fuel power plants  His administration has since sought to kill scores of pending regulations he said threatened industries like coal mining  and reversed a ban on new coal leasing on federal lands  TAKING CREDIT Both the coal industry and the Trump administration said the rising exports of both steam coal  used to generate electricity  and metallurgical coal  used in heavy industry  were evidence that Trump s agenda was having a positive impact    Simply to know that coal no longer has to fight the government   that has to have some effect on investment decisions and in the outlook by companies  producers and utilities that use coal   said Luke Popovich  a spokesman for the National Mining Association  Shaylyn Hynes  a spokeswoman at the U S  Energy Department  said   These numbers clearly show that the Trump Administration s policies are helping to revive an industry that was the target of costly and job killing overregulation from Washington for far too long   Efforts to obtain comment from exporters Arch Coal  N ARCH  and privately held Murray Energy Corp were unsuccessful  Contura Energy  which emerged as part of Alpha Natural Resource s bankruptcy and restructuring  and filed for public offering in May  declined to comment  A spokesman for Peabody Energy  the largest coal producer  though without a major export profile  said the United States was generally a  swing supplier of seaborne coal    U S  Energy Information Administration analyst Elias Johnson said the U S  coal industry may now be better positioned to meet foreign demand because U S  miners have learned to produce at lower cost  after coming through a series of recent bankruptcies    There s the possibility that the U S  will become more of a primary player in the global coal trade market   he said  But he added there are also plenty of reasons the spike in demand could be temporary  For one thing  U S  coal production and transportation costs are much higher than for other producers such as Indonesia and Australia  Because coal can often be transhipped from European ports before it is consumed  it is also hard to determine where shipments ultimately end up   Johnson pointed out that some of the fuel shipped into Western Europe  for example  could be making its way to other places like Ukraine  which is having trouble securing coal from its separatist held regions   Trump said last month that his administration is offering more coal to Ukraine  but it was unclear how  given deals are typically worked out between companies

12026,233541,ARCH,Coal lobby fights black lung tax as disease rates surge,news,"By Valerie Volcovici PRINCETON  West Virginia  Reuters    As a young man  Barry Shrewsbury dug coal in the West Virginia mines and spent his time off hunting and fishing in the rolling hills  Now  at 62  he struggles to breathe and accomplish basic tasks such as shopping and showering  and relies on a federal fund for ex miners with black lung disease to pay for an oxygen tank and doctor visits   The benefits are a lifeline   Shrewsbury said between labored breaths after a treatment at the Bluestone Health Center  an industrial style building set against a leafy landscape in Princeton  West Virginia  That lifeline is threatened  The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is at risk of insolvency due to soaring debt and a slashing of coal company contributions through a tax cut scheduled for the end of the year  according to a report the U S  Government Accountability Office plans to publish soon  two sources briefed on the study told Reuters  That shortfall   which comes as black lung rates hit highs not seen in decades   could force the fund to restrict benefits or shift some of the financial burden to taxpayers  the sources said on condition of anonymity  The fund currently provides medical coverage and monthly payments for living expenses to more than 15 000 people  according to a Congressional report published this year    For a graphic on rising black lung rates  see     For a WIDER IMAGE photo essay  see      The coal industry  meanwhile  is lobbying Congress to ensure the scheduled tax reduction goes forward  arguing the payments have already been too high at a difficult time for mining companies and that the fund has been abused by undeserving applicants   More often than not  we are being called upon to provide compensation for previous or current smokers   said Bruce Watzman  head of regulatory affairs for the National Mining Association   He said that view was based on  discussions with those administering this program for companies  and initially said he had no research on black lung benefits paying for smoking related diseases   Watzman later cited a study from 1989 by the University of Louisville School of Medicine  The researchers examined 1 000 black lung benefit applications and found that coal miners judged  potentially eligible  for benefits smoked at higher rates that those who did not qualify   Medical experts dispute the association s argument  saying the disease   an incurable illness caused by inhaling coal dust   is easy to distinguish with x rays   It is not caused by smoking   said Dr  David Blackley  head of Respiratory Disease Studies at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  The Labor Department  which manages the fund  considers all potential causes of an applicant s lung problems before awarding benefits  said Amy Louviere  a spokeswoman for the department s Mine Safety and Health Administration  The approval rate for applications was about 20 percent last year  according to department data  Coal companies are currently required to pay a  1 10 per ton excise tax on underground coal production to finance the fund  That amount will revert to the 1977 level of 50 cents at the end of the year if Congress does not extend the current rate  The fund has already been forced to borrow more than  6 billion from the U S  Treasury to finance benefits during the life of the program  according to the Treasury Department  About half of the fund s revenue now goes to servicing that debt   A bipartisan effort by lawmakers to extend the current coal tax failed this year after the mining association lobbied Republican House leadership not to take it up  Watzman said he was  not at liberty  to identify members of Congress who oppose extending the tax  Matt Sparks  a spokesman for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy s office  did not respond to requests for comment  Lawmakers expect discussion of the tax to resume after the GAO report is released   We need to take care of the miners   said Virginia Republican Congressman Morgan Griffith  who represents a district that has seen one of the biggest surges in the disease   We first need to have all facts on the table   The mining association and large miners such as Peabody Energy  N BTU   Arch Coal  N ARCH   and Consol Energy  N CEIX  are already pressing their case  according to Congressional lobbying records that show the black lung fund among the subjects discussed in their recent meetings with lawmakers  Peabody spokeswoman Michelle Constantine declined to comment  Arch spokesman Logan Bonacorsi and Consol spokesman Zachary Smith did not respond to requests for comment  The upcoming GAO report was requested in 2016 by Democratic Congressmen Bobby Scott of Virginia and Sander Levin of Michigan and has undergone review by the administration of President Donald Trump  who has focused on slashing regulation to help the coal industry  White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to a request for comment on the administration s position on the excise tax  BLACK LUNG RESURGENCE The fund pays benefits to miners severely disabled by black lung in cases where no coal company can be found to directly provide support  That typically occurs when a company has gone belly up   an increasingly common scenario as the nation s utilities shift to cheaper natural gas and cleaner solar and wind power  Some 2 600 medical claims were transferred from companies to the fund in 2017 due to bankruptcies  according to a Congressional report this year  Government research shows the incidence of black lung rebounding  despite improved safety measures adopted decades ago   such as dust screens and ventilation   that had nearly eradicated the disease in the 1990s  In February  the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health confirmed 416 cases of advanced black lung disease in three medical clinics in rural Virginia from 2013 to 2017   the highest concentration of cases ever seen  It also confirmed a 2016 2017 investigation by National Public Radio that found many hundreds more cases in southwestern Virginia  southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky    This is history moving in the wrong direction   said Kirsten Almberg  an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Illinois at Chicago  Almberg authored an analysis of Labor Department data showing that nearly half the 4 679 benefits claims from miners with the worst form of black lung disease were made since 2000  Ex miners and regional health experts blame the resurgence on longer hours spent in deeper parts of old  played out mines  along with lax safety measures and the use of heavy machines to blast through layers of rock    We didn t use curtains  We rarely used ventilators  We thought we were invincible   said Greg Jones  who left mining in March and now coordinates benefits applications at the Tug River Black Lung Clinic in Gary  West Virginia  Brandon Crum  a radiologist at the United Medical Group in Pikeville  Kentucky  said he has personally diagnosed more than 150 cases of advanced black lung disease since 2016  many in younger miners   Crum  whose own family worked the mines for a century  said many of these people face a lifetime unable to work  inundated with medical bills    Any kind of asset or financial stability you would take away from these miners and their families would be devastating   he said   APPLICATION REJECTED  To qualify for benefits  a miner must apply to the Department of Labor  which screens the applications based on medical and employment documentation and then tries to find a responsible coal company to pay the costs   Jim Werth  the black lung clinic director at Stone Mountain Health Services in St  Charles  Virginia  said his clinic has three people on staff helping patients file for benefits  He rejected the idea that the fund was covering undeserving applicants  saying the process already makes it hard to qualify  with coal companies often hiring doctors to dispute medical test results  William McCool  64  said it took him years to win benefits   I worked 40 years in the mines  and the benefits don t come automatic   said McCool  who wore a gray baseball cap emblazoned with a crossing pick axe and shovel during an interview at the Mountain Health Center in Whitesburg  Kentucky  where he receives oxygen and physical therapy  Kennith Adams   a 62 year old former miner who survived stage four colon cancer and is now suffering advanced black lung   had his first application rejected two years ago  he said  Consol argued he did not work for the firm when he became ill  Adams had worked at the Bishop Coal Company  which later got taken over by Consol  Consol did not respond to a request for comment  Adams and his wife Tammie are now hoping his latest application   sent last month   will be approved to help them pay medical bills of more than  12 000 a month

Notably the acquisition was announced in February 2019  Unitholders of SunCoke Energy Partners will receive 1 4 shares of the company  whichrepresents a 9 3  premium to the partnership s closing price on Feb 4 
Reason for the Acquisition
The company is focused on growth opportunities as well as generating immediate and long term value for stakeholders  A simplified large publicly traded company increases liquidity in the market and enhances free float 
The acquisition will reduce the estimated operating cost by nearly  2 million per year  Estimated cash tax savings will be approximately  40 million over the next five years  The company will distribute 24 cents annual dividend per share in the first quarter  We believe that the company will generate more cash flow that will enhance organic growth projects in the future 
Coking coal is essential for production of steel  The imposition of 25  tariff on steel imports by Trump administration has raised domestic steel production  The upside in production will benefit SunCoke Energy  Currently  the company has 5 9 million tons of annual coke making capacity on a global scale  In addition  the acquisition of SunCoke Energy Partners will further strengthen its position in the U S  coke making business 
Initiatives to Stay Competitive
U S  coal companies are gradually losing foothold as consumption and export of thermal coal is projected to decline going forward  Increasing awareness toward the environment has created a shift toward clean energy sources for power generation 
To cope with the current scenario  coal companies are working on lowering operating costs  reducing production from high cost mines and idling mines to counter declining demand  Recently  Peabody Energy Corp    NYSE BTU   and Arch Coal Inc   NYSE ARCH   have decided to form a joint venture by merging some of their most productive coal mines in Powder River Basin and Colorado  The deal will reduce the cost of operation and offset competition

12043,233558,ARCH,Trump declares end to  war on coal   but utilities aren t listening,news,"By Valerie Volcovici  Nichola Groom and Scott DiSavino WASHINGTON LOS ANGELES NEW YORK  Reuters    When President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week to sweep away Obama era climate change regulations  he said it would end America s  war on coal   usher in a new era of energy production and put miners back to work  But the biggest consumers of U S  coal   power generating companies   remain unconvinced  Reuters surveyed 32 utilities with operations in the 26 states that sued former President Barack Obama s administration to block its Clean Power Plan  the main target of Trump s executive order  The bulk of them have no plans to alter their multi billion dollar  years long shift away from coal  suggesting demand for the fuel will keep falling despite Trump s efforts  The utilities gave many reasons  mainly economic  Natural gas   coal s top competitor   is cheap and abundant  solar and wind power costs are falling  state environmental laws remain in place  and Trump s regulatory rollback may not survive legal challenges  Meanwhile  big investors aligned with the global push to fight climate change   such as the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund   have been pressuring U S  utilities in which they own stakes to cut coal use   I m not going to build new coal plants in today s environment   said Ben Fowke  CEO of  Xcel Energy   N XEL   which operates in eight states and uses coal for about 36 percent of its electricity production   And if I m not going to build new ones  eventually there won t be any   Of the 32 utilities contacted by Reuters  20 said Trump s order would have no impact on their investment plans  five said they were reviewing the implications of the order  six gave no response  Just one said it would prolong the life of some of its older coal fired power units  North Dakota s Basin Electric Power Cooperative was the sole utility to identify an immediate positive impact of Trump s order on the outlook for coal   We re in the situation where the executive order takes a lot of pressure off the decisions we had to make in the near term  such as whether to retrofit and retire older coal plants   said Dale Niezwaag  a spokesman for Basin Electric   But Trump can be a one termer  so the reprieve out there is short   Trump s executive order triggered a review aimed at killing the Clean Power Plan  The Obama era law would have required states  by 2030  to collectively cut carbon emissions from existing power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels  It was designed as a primary strategy in U S  efforts to fight global climate change  The U S  coal industry  without increases in domestic demand  would need to rely on export markets for growth  Shipments of U S  metallurgical coal  used in the production of steel  have recently shown up in China following a two year hiatus   in part to offset banned shipments from North Korea and temporary delays from cyclone hit Australian producers  RETIRING AND RETROFITTING Coal had been the primary fuel source for U S  power plants for the last century  but its use has fallen more than a third since 2008 after advancements in drilling technology unlocked new reserves of natural gas  Hundreds of aging coal fired power plants have been retired or retrofitted  Huge coal mining companies like Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal  N ARCH  fell into bankruptcy  and production last year hit its lowest point since 1978  The slide appears likely to continue  U S  power companies now expect to retire or convert more than 8 000 megawatts of coal fired plants in 2017 after shutting almost 13 000 MW last year  according to U S  Energy Information Administration and Thomson Reuters data  Luke Popovich  a spokesman for the National Mining Association  acknowledged Trump s efforts would not return the coal industry to its  glory days   but offered some hope   There may not be immediate plans for utilities to bring on more coal  but the future is always uncertain in this market   he said   Many of the companies in the Reuters survey said they had been focused on reducing carbon emissions for a decade or more and were hesitant to change direction based on shifting political winds in Washington D C   Utility planning typically takes place over much longer periods than presidential terms of office   Berkshire Hathaway Inc owned  N BRKa  Pacificorp spokesman Tom Gauntt said  Several utilities also cited falling costs for wind and solar power  which are now often as cheap as coal or natural gas  thanks in part to government subsidies for renewable energy  In the meantime  activist investors have increased pressure on U S  utilities to shun coal  In the last year  Norway s sovereign wealth fund  the world s largest  has excluded more than a dozen U S  power companies   including Xcel   American Electric  Power Co Inc  N AEP  and NRG Energy Inc   from its investments because of their reliance on coal fired power  Another eight companies  including  Southern Co   N SO  and  NorthWestern Corp   N NWE   are  under observation  by the fund  Wyoming based coal miner

12053,233568,ARCH,California insurance commissioner calls for coal divestment,news,"By Rory Carroll
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    California s insurance commissioner on Monday asked all insurance companies doing business in the state to voluntarily divest from coal companies and said he will also require insurance companies to disclose their coal company holdings 
Coal use by utility companies has plummeted amid low natural gas prices and new federal regulations aimed at curbing carbon emissions  a major contributor to climate change 
Ten years ago coal produced 50 percent of the nation s power supply but now accounts for only about 35 percent  according to the U S  Energy and Information Administration 
The lack of demand has driven the price of coal down and helped force  Arch Coal Inc   PK ACIIQ   the nation s second largest U S  coal miner  to file for bankruptcy protection earlier this month 
 The movement away from coal and the rest of the carbon economy poses a potential financial risk to insurance companies investing in coal and the carbon economy   California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said 
Mark Sektnan  president of the Association of California Insurance Companies  ACIC   said his members are reviewing the request  He said insurers like the 363 casualty companies represented by his group invest only in low risk  easily liquidated holdings 
 Insurers must retain the freedom to manage their investments so they can keep rates affordable for their customers   he said 
Jones is the first state insurance regulator in the United States to call on insurance companies to divest from coal and the first to require insurance companies to disclose their investments 
California is the largest insurance market in the United States and sixth largest in the world  with companies collecting  259 billion in premiums annually  according to the Insurance Commission ",2016-01-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/california-insurance-commissioner-calls-for-coal-divestment-381643,381643

the oil producing Middle East region sparked concerns about the

some record earnings  
 Wagner saw the lift as temporary  saying new geopolitical
tensions could arise as factions take advantage of the new
power vacuum in the terrorist network

as to say that we ll see a pullback in the coming days  But
there will be increased concerns about the region contributing

12075,233590,ARCH,Exclusive  Swiss central bank s  800 billion could be enlisted in climate push,news,"By John Revill
ZURICH  Reuters    The Swiss central bank could be required to pull its  800 billion balance sheet out of investments in fossil fuel companies in a move by one of the world s biggest reserve banks to tackle climate change 
Swiss lawmakers are preparing a campaign that would make targeting climate change one of the policy objectives of the Swiss National Bank  alongside the traditional monetary targets of ensuring price stability and fostering economic growth 
The drive will begin this month with a motion in parliament s lower house  two lawmakers behind the campaign told Reuters  The push is coming from the centre left Social Democrats  SP  and the Greens  which achieved record results in October s elections 
The SNB built up a  800 billion balance sheet during efforts to rein in the safe haven Swiss franc  giving it an unusually large investment portfolio for a mid sized country s reserve bank  around a fifth the size of the balance sheets of the European ECB or the U S  Fed 
Its investments include stakes in fossil fuel companies such as Arch Coal   Exxon Mobil  Corp and  Chevron    N ARCH   N XOM   N CVX 
 This is a climate emergency and we need to take action as soon as possible   said Adele Goumaz Thorens  a Green politician who proposes this to the upper house early next year   The SNB has invested so much money it is incredible and could really be an actor for change  
Sandro Leuenberger from pressure group Climate Alliance Switzerland said   The SNB is the eighth biggest institutional investor worldwide  and it gives Switzerland a huge weight internationally     It s the biggest lever Switzerland has and we have to use it  
The SNB declined to comment on the politicians  proposals  It shuns shares in companies which cause severe environmental damage but has resisted using its investment clout to promote green causes because of the risk of conflicts of interest or politicizing monetary policy 
PRESSURE
Central banks are under pressure to do their bit in the fight against climate change 
The new chief of the European Central Bank has described tackling climate change as  mission critical   although its narrow mandate to fight inflation limits what it can do  Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell has said fighting climate change was not the U S  central bank s job 
The French and Dutch central banks are factoring climate into investment decisions  but as they are part of the ECB s euro system the impact of those decisions is limited  Norway s central bank can exclude companies with  unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions   but its reserves are dwarfed by the Swiss 
The Swiss campaign must pass both houses of parliament  Passing the upper house which has a centre right majority will also be tough  the campaigners said  The SP is part of the four party coalition government  which the Greens hope to join 
The authors are banking on concern in Switzerland  where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average  triggering record hot summers and melting Alpine glaciers 
Environmental group Artisans de la Transition says companies in the SNB s U S  equity portfolio generated 48 5 million tonnes of CO2 in 2017  slightly more than the carbon emissions attributable to Switzerland itself 
 At present the SNB doesn t have a mandate  so they don t tackle these risks   said SP lawmaker Beat Jans  who wants the SNB to dump its holdings in fossil fuel companies   It s our job as politicians to give them the tools to do this  ",2019-12-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-swiss-central-banks-800-billion-could-be-enlisted-in-climate-push-2037677,2037677
