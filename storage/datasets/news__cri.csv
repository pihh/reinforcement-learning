However  the company is exposed to tariff threats due to the introduction of tariffs on List 4 goods  Also  adverse currency rates are hurting the company s performance  Moreover  it expects high inventory levels to persist in the quarters ahead Amid these lingering headwinds  let s see how this Atlanta  GA based apparel company can retain its momentum Factors Favoring the StockCarter s is seeking opportunities to strengthen e commerce capabilities through investments to speed up deliveries  Notably  the company registered double digit growth in e commerce sales in the third quarter of 2019  with e commerce penetration improving to 30  of sales  E commerce investments in the past year included re launch of its website in summer  better engagement for online customers and higher conversion rates Additionally  Carter s is making investments to strengthen its mobile app  which is likely to be re launched in 2020  Further  its brands are sold online at sites of its wholesale customers  On a combined basis  including sales at its website and through wholesale customers   the company expects total online sales to exceed  1 billion in 2020 Moreover  Carter s has been making efforts to enhance omni channel capabilities  In this regard  the company is benefiting from the same day pickup service for online orders  easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores and easy access to its new credit card program  This has led to an increase of 13  in multi channel customers driven by improved experiences Also  Carter s Retail strategy remains

fourth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise in third quarter 2019  Earnings gained from solid growth in the U S  Retail and Wholesale businesses along with robust demand for its merchandise  Further  the company discontinued with its soft margin trends in the third quarter Factors Hindering GrowthThough the aforementioned factors make us optimistic about the stock s potential  there are some hurdles in its path  The most prominent concern is the impact of tariffs and adverse currency  Moreover  high inventory levels pose a threat After negotiations with suppliers and significant pricing actions  Carter s has reduced exposure to unmitigated tariff threats to  30 million annually from  100 million impact expected earlier  To battle the cost increase  the company has significantly lowered exposure to goods sourced from China  reducing it to 15  heading into 2020 compared with 26  at the beginning of 2019  Although supply chain initiatives and other efforts in this direction have helped mitigate this hurdle to some extent  the company still remains exposed to additional tariffs Also  the company continues to be affected by negative movements in foreign currency  The most impacts of adverse currency are felt on the overall top line and sales of the international segment  Moreover  Carter s is struggling with higher inventory levels due to rise in wholesale demand and new retail stores  lower provisions for inventory  and product cost increase  This might continue to mar results in the quarters ahead Wrapping UpThe above discussion suggests that Carter s

Earnings   RevenuesIn the reported quarter  this athletic apparel  footwear and accessory retailer s earnings of 86 cents per share improved nearly 28  from the prior year quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents  Earnings mainly benefited from robust top line growth  coupled with enhanced gross margin and lower average share count  However  higher selling and administrative expenses were a deterrent NIKE  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Revenues of the Swoosh brand owner increased 7  to  10 660 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 451 million  This outperformance was primarily driven by the company s solid execution of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy globally  which fueled robust growth across all four geographies  as well as innovation  Additionally  continued strength in NIKE digital globally  led by Greater China  drove the top line On a currency neutral basis  revenues grew 10   driven by gains from investments in innovation and digital  This resulted in robust global consumer demand driven growth across all geographies Operating SegmentsRevenues for the NIKE Brand increased 7  to  10 096 million  while constant dollar revenues for the brand were up 10   Results gained from continued growth in NIKE direct and its wholesale business  Moreover  strength in nearly all major categories  led by sportswear

growth in NIKE digital and high single digit growth across key differentiated partners  The company s investments in delivering differentiated partner experiences are driven by efforts like testing new services and leveraging the NIKE app in partner doors In EMEA  the company s revenues increased 6   up 12  on a currency neutral basis   backed by double digit growth in NIKE digital and broad based growth across all categories  Per the company  NIKE brand  being the consumers  favorite in all key cities across EMEA  drove growth in the region  Notably  EMEA includes five of NIKE s 12 key cities  Further  the company delivered double digit growth in London  Berlin and Milan  Apart from NIKE digital  the company s sustained growth in the region is fueled by partnerships like JD and Zalando In Greater China  the company delivered 21 straight quarters of double digit growth  Revenues rose 22  year over year  up 27  on a currency neutral basis   Results were aided by growth in almost all key categories  led by sportswear and Jordan  Further  the company continues to witness unmatched digital growth in the region  with NIKE digital up 70  in the reported quarter  The growth was partly aided by partnerships with Tmall and WeChat  Further  the company anticipates gaining from the launch of the NIKE app in Greater China  which is now scheduled for late second quarter fiscal 2020 In APLA  NIKE witnessed a 6  revenue decline  up 13  on a currency neutral basis   Currency neutral growth in the region was fueled by nearly 50  increase in NIKE digital  The digital business gained from the launch of the NIKE app in retail stores across key city  Tokyo  Growth was also driven by a double digit increase in the Jordan brand  driven by the culture of basketball in the region Revenues at the Converse brand rose 5  to  555 million  On a currency neutral basis  revenues of the segment were up 8   owing to double digit growth in Asia and strength in the global digital business  partly offset by declines in the United States  The quarter also marked the brand s return to growth in Europe Costs   MarginsGross profit rose 11  to  4 871 million  while gross margin expanded 150 basis points  bps  to 45 7   This expansion was mainly driven by an increase in average selling prices and margin expansion in NIKE Direct  partly negated by adverse currency rates and higher product costs Selling and administrative expenses rose 9  to  3 328 million  driven by continued investments in digital transformation  brand marketing related to the Women s World Cup and the launch of the Joyride innovation  As a percentage of sales  SG A expenses grew 40 bps to 31 2   These also resulted in higher operating overheads and demand creation expenses  Notably  demand creation expenses increased 6  year over year to  1 018 million  due to increased advertising costs and sports marketing investments Operating overheads were up 10  to  2 310 million  reflecting higher wage related and administrative expenses  These included continued investments in transformational initiatives  particularly in NIKE digital and global operations Balance Sheet   Shareholder Friendly MovesNIKE ended fiscal 2019 with cash and short term investments of  3 644 million  long term debt  excluding current maturities  of  3 463 million and shareholders  equity of  9 200 million  As of

guidance for fiscal 2020  It continues to expect high single digit revenue growth on a reported basis  slightly up from the increase witnessed in fiscal 2019 Gross margin for the fiscal year is expected to expand 50 75 bps compared with a 50 bp expansion projected earlier  Gross margin growth for the year is likely to be partly offset by the negative impacts of the recently imposed tariffs  However  gross margin gains in the fiscal first quarter  driven by timing shifts and other discrete items  should aid growth The company expects SG A expenses to increase almost in line with revenues in fiscal 2020  including a slight impact from the recent Celect buyout  Other expenses  net of interest expenses  are anticipated to increase  50  100 million  Effective tax rate is expected to be in

   Factors to ConsiderCarter s has been in the doldrums  presumably due to the bankruptcy of Toys  R  Us  the company s key wholesale customer  The closure of Toys  R  Us stores across the country largely weighed on Carter s top line performance in the past few quarters  with more impacts to be seen in the quarters to come  Notably  the U S  Wholesale business is the most impacted due to the loss of planned sales to Toys  R  Us and Bon Ton Moreover  the company expects net sales and adjusted earnings per share for first quarter 2019 to be affected by the discontinued sales to Toys  R  Us and Bon Ton in the prior year as well as the shift of Easter holiday to second quarter 2019 from the first quarter in 2018  The company estimates a net sales decline of 4 5  against the first quarter of 2018  Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be 65 70 cents compared with  1 09 reported in the prior year quarter The company has been extensively investing in initiatives to boost business  mostly for its e commerce channel  Carter s continues to make investments in technology  brand marketing and expedited shipping to drive growth  This has resulted in higher expenses  which is likely to weigh on operating margin growth as seen in the past quarters The company s performance in the first quarter should be cushioned by the synergies from its retail strategy  This strategy focuses on improving store productivity  strengthening e commerce business and enhancing product offerings  which should offset some of the shortcomings for top line growth

Us and Bon Ton contributed  13 million to sales The International segment reported a revenue decline of 2 8  to  88 6 million in the first quarter due to soft demand in Canada and China  and

35340,256855,CRI,Carter s  CRI  Down 31  In A Year  Can Efforts Aid Recovery ,opinion,Carter s  Inc    NYSE CRI   loses favor with investors  evident from its price performance in the past year  The stock has declined 31 2  against the  s 11 8  growth  Well  factors such as high inventory level  higher SG A expenses and softness in its U S  Wholesale business have been weighing on the company s performance Nevertheless  Carter s Retail strategy remains focused on improving store productivity  strengthening e commerce business and enhancing product offerings  Further  the company is experiencing robust growth at its International business  Let s take a closer look at both sides of the story Factors Behind Carter s Dismal PerformanceCarter s is witnessing sluggishness across its U S  Wholesale business due to the bankruptcy of Toys  R  Us  The closure of Toys  R  Us stores  which is the company s key wholesale customer  is largely weighing on its U S  Wholesale segment s performance  In third quarter 2018  sales at this segment decreased 8 3  year over year on account of fall in shipments due to loss of sales to Toys  R  Us and Bon Ton Additionally  higher cost of investments toward technology  brand marketing and expedited shipping have been denting operating margin  SG A expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased 180 basis points  bps  in third quarter 2018  This uptick was mainly driven by increased investments in new stores and e commerce business  higher marketing spending  distribution  speedy deliveries and infrastructure  Consequently  operating margin contracted 220 bps in the third quarter  Moving ahead  this can be a threat to the company s profitability Moreover  the company s high inventory levels remain a worry  At the end of the third quarter  Carter s saw a 14  increase in net inventories owing to the timing of inventory receipts and increased baby replenishment inventory Are Strategies Tracking Growth Carter s Skip Hop and Age Up initiatives are likely to significantly drive retail sales growth  Additionally  the company is witnessing a positive response for its co branded stores that have received maximum return on investment  By 2022  the company plans to open nearly 160 co branded stores  It also targets increasing the mix of these stores to at least 50  of its store base compared with 20  at the beginning of 2017  Simultaneously  management intends to shut down roughly 115 less productive stores  comprising mainly Carter s and OshKosh outlets  This is expected to improve the productivity as well as boost the customer s experience Further  Carter s efforts to strengthen e commerce capabilities through investments to speed up deliveries are impressive  Notably  the company has been witnessing double digit growth in e commerce sales  mainly backed by higher domestic demand  During 2019  it plans to launch the e commerce capabilities in Mexico  Combined with wholesale  the company expects to reach  1 billion in online purchases of its brands in 2019 Additionally  Carter s International business is witnessing solid growth  thanks to acquired licensee business in Mexico and robust demand in markets outside of North America  The company is also on track with the integration of the Mexico business  acquired in 2017  It anticipates about  30 million sales contribution from Mexico  with the potential to double its sales in the next five years  Moreover  Carter s expects China to generate about  20 million sales  with significant e commerce sales growth Despite a dismal third quarter 2018  management issued an encouraging view for the fourth quarter  It expects net sales to grow 5  and adjusted earnings per share to rise roughly 10  from the prior year quarter number  Moreover  the company witnessed double digit comparable store sales growth initially in the fourth quarter driven by higher traffic  conversion rates and improved price realization  Management projects quarterly retail comps to increase approximately 4  backed by various strategic initiatives  including gains from Age Up size expansion and Skip Hop These tailwinds make us optimistic about this Zacks Rank  3

35352,256867,CRI,Carter s  CRI  Retail Strategy On Track  High Costs A Woe,opinion,Carter s  Inc    NYSE CRI   is gaining momentum on the back of its retail strategy that is focused on improving store productivity  strengthening e commerce business and enhancing product offerings  Also  the company is experiencing robust growth in its International business Backed by these factors  Carter s delivered robust fourth quarter 2018 results  wherein both the top and bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also increased on a year over year basis  Results were driven by growth in the U S  Retail and U S  Wholesale businesses during the final months of 2018  mirroring a strong holiday season In the past three months  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have rallied 24 4  compared with the  s 27 7  growth However  the company is grappling with high inventory level and higher expenses  Moreover  closure of Toys  R  Us stores across the United States is largely weighing on Carter s top line performance  Let s take a closer look at both sides of the story Factors Driving Carter s PerformanceCarter s Retail strategy remains focused on improving store productivity and enhancing product offerings by introducing extended sizes for the Carter s brand and expanding Skip Hop brand offerings  In 2019  the company anticipates net sales for Skip Hop to increase nearly 20  globally  contributing to total profitability  Additionally  the company is witnessing a positive response for its co branded stores  which have been receiving maximum return on investment Carter s also continues to experience robust growth in the International business as evident from the segment s solid growth witnessed in 2018  Although the segment s net sales declined in the fourth quarter  it improved 4  for 2018  contributing about 12 5  to the company s total sales  This uptick was driven by the licensee business in Mexico and robust demand in markets outside of North America  partly offset by decrease in demand across China and the adverse impact of foreign currency  Notably  more than 60  of the company s International sales come from Canada  which is likely to be the largest contributor to International growth in the next five years Moreover  the company is optimistic about the transition of its business model in China from a retail and wholesale model to a licensing model  with a single partner in this market  This new model is likely to enhance consumers  experience with Carter s brands and enable a more profitable growth strategy in China  The company estimates mid single digit growth in international sales in the future Hurdles in Carter s PathCarter s is witnessing sluggishness across its U S  Wholesale business due to the bankruptcy of Toys  R  Us  The closure of Toys  R  Us stores  the company s key wholesale customer  is largely weighing on its U S  Wholesale segment s performance  In fourth quarter 2018  sales were adversely impacted due to the bankruptcies of Toys  R  Us and Bon Ton  Additionally  the company s high inventory levels remain a worry Moreover  higher cost of investments toward technology  brand marketing and expedited shipping have been denting operating margin  In the fourth quarter 2018  adjusted operating margin contracted 60 basis points due to higher e commerce shipping costs and promotions  adverse impact of the Toys  R  Us bankruptcy  and increased mix of lower margin new businesses  Moving ahead  this can be a threat to the company s profitability These apart  Carter s outlined a soft outlook for the first quarter of 2019 due to difficult comparisons with the prior year quarter  The company expects the top  and bottom line comparisons for the first quarter to be negatively impacted by the loss of sales to Toys  R  Us and Bon Ton stores as well as the shift of Easter holiday to second quarter 2019 from first quarter 2018  Also  net sales are anticipated to decline 4 5  compared with the first quarter of 2018  Adjusted earnings are projected to be 65 70 cents per share compared with  1 09 reported in the prior year quarter While we cannot ignore these headwinds  the company s initiatives are likely

35376,256891,CRI,Dolby  DLB  Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues Grow Y Y,opinion,Dolby Laboratories  Inc    NYSE DLB   reported first quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents by a whopping 79 5  However  the company s first quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP loss came in at 80 cents per share  compared with GAAP earnings of 51 cents per share in the year ago quarter  The company s GAAP numbers were adversely affected by the creation of a provision for estimated discrete tax expense of  154 6 million related to the latest tax reforms Inside the HeadlinesTotal revenues of  287 8 million steered past the company s projected range of  260  270 million  The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  265 4 million and grew 8 1  on a year over year basis  Healthy increase in revenues across the company s licensing segment contributed to the decent rise in the top line The company s Licensing revenues were  258 million  up 10 9  year over year  Solid year over year growth in Licensing in other markets and Mobile devices sales drove the segment s growth  In the reported quarter  Licensing in  other markets  was up about 11  sequentially  driven by higher revenues in gaming consoles  This was partially offset by lower recoveries in automotive unit However  Product revenues came in at  24 9 million  down 11 6  on a year over year basis  The year over year decline resulted mainly on the account of ramping up of some of the company s cinema products earlier than anticipated  The Services segment declined 9 5  year over year to  4 8 million Dolby Laboratories Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   During the reported quarter  Dolby s operating margin increased 380 basis points to 28 6  LiquidityAs of Dec 29  2017  Dolby had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  596 4 million  up from  512 8 million as of Dec 30  2016 Net cash provided by operating activities came in at  17 1 million  compared with  67 8 million as of Dec 30  2016 GuidanceConcurrent with the market scenario  Dolby issued guidance for second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings and revenues  The company estimates non GAAP earnings in the range of 74 80 cents  while revenues for the fiscal second quarter are expected to lie within  295  305 million Moreover  the company projects non GAAP gross margin in the 89 5 90 5  band and non GAAP operating expenses are likely to be between  166 million and  170 million Additionally  Dolby provided guidance for fiscal 2018  The company estimates total revenues to lie in the range of  1 15  1 18 billion  Revenue streams  such as mobile revenues  Consumer Imaging  Consumer Electronics and Dolby Voice are likely to drive revenue growth  However  softer PCs and other licensing categories sales may affect growth momentum to some extent Further  non GAAP operating expenses for fiscal 2018 are projected to lie between  655 million and  670 million Our TakeDolby s first quarter 2018 results have been quite impressive  with substantial growth in both top and bottom line performance  We believe the company s three impressive projects  namely  Dolby Vision  Dolby Voice and Dolby Cinema  will accelerate growth going forward However  the company operates in a stringent competitive environment  The market for consumer entertainment products is highly competitive and price sensitive which exposes Dolby to the risks of reduced revenues due to lower prices  Going forward  the company also forecasts dismal sales of PCs  DVD  Blu ray and home theater equipments Further  the company anticipates lower recoveries in broadcast business for fiscal 2018 to offset other growth drivers  consequently marring growth  Though the company s relatively new offering Dolby Cinema is experiencing solid market traction  its success is hitched to the pipeline and the performance of motion pictures at Dolby Cinema locations  Further  given that the transition to digital cinema is almost complete  demand for new digital cinema screens is slowing down  which in turn is impeding cinema product sales Dolby currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Stocks to ConsiderSome

35389,256904,CRI,Add These 7 GARP Stocks To Your Portfolio For Better Returns,opinion,Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains  This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that are likely to offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than M industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 14 Here are seven of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen MSCI Inc    NYSE MSCI   is an

Carter s was originally selected as a Long Idea on 4 10 17  At the time of the initial report  the stock received a Very Attractive rating  Our investment thesis highlighted strong after tax operating profit  NOPAT  growth  a rising return on invested capital  ROIC   profitability at or near top of the industry  and an undervalued stock price 
We reiterated our position on Carter s on 10 12 17 and added it to the Focus List   Long Model Portfolio on 11 3 17 
During the 465 day holding period  CRI outperformed as a long position  gaining 31  compared to a 19  gain for the S P 500  CRI has also outperformed during its time in the Focus List  gaining 19  compared to a 9  gain for the S P 500 
CRI was downgraded to Neutral on 7 13 18 after its rising stock price shifted the risk reward of the stock  When we first recommended the stock  it traded at a slight discount to its peers based on ROIC  but now it trades at a premium 
In addition  the fundamentals of the business have begun to decline  The company s NOPAT growth has slowed from 10  in 2016 to just 2  over the trailing twelve months  and ROIC has fallen from 12  to 10  
The rise and valuation and the decline in fundamentals means CRI no longer stands out as an especially good value compared to its peers  As a result  we are closing this position and removing it from our Focus List   Long Model Portfolio as of July 20

Our favorite retail stocks tend to be  well  hidden from Jeff Bezos  view  The legendary CEO has different investing criteria from you and me  He needs to make big bets  His firm  after all  is Amazonian   it takes large splashes to move his sales tide higher 
So while he s busy mowing down the mainstream retail landscape  there are many niche retailers who will not only survive  but even thrive as e commerce continues to boom in the years ahead  And they will all share two important characteristics 
 A direct relationship with their customers 
This is what failing department stores like Macy s Inc  NYSE M  are missing  You walk into the store  you pay and you walk out  Their main sales interaction is purely transactional 
And in 2018  transactional is not enough  Firms built to sell in the decade ahead also have 
 A deep  online connection  with consumers  
They have a website that is  grandma friendly  to take orders directly  They have a mobile app on their customers  smartphones   which they can use to buy more stuff from  They have an email address so that they can advertise the next sale 
And they have friendly service reps who will take the phone call when a package is late or missing   which will assure the customer will continue to buy direct from them instead of a black box like Amazon 
I love a handful of retail stocks right now  but I m also concerned about a couple high yield bets that are at risk of being  Bezos d   Let s look at these five retail stocks yielding up to 10 4  and separate the winners from the losers 
Best Buy Co Inc  NYSE BBY Dividend Yield  2 6 
Best Buy  BBY  is the little engine that wouldn t die  Market pundits left this retailer for dead years ago  thinking it couldn t possibly survive the war on two fronts   big box retailers Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Target  NYSE TGT  on the left  and Amazon on the right 
But CEO Hubert Joly   acting almost like a photo negative of Sears  Eddie Lampert   focused on improving the quality of stores  and used employee expertise to help battle the  showrooming  phenomenon that many believed would sink Best Buy  The result  A return to growth on the top and bottom lines 
Joly isn t done throwing punches  either 
Best Buy is going  low tech  in a grab at Toys  R  Us  customers  announcing it will expand its toy inventory in 1 000 stores this holiday season  Adding Nerf guns and Hatchimals is actually somewhat of a natural fit for BBY  which already sells the likes of video games and drones 
And investors have to love what Best Buy is doing on the income front  Joly has really put the pedal down on the payout  rewarding faithful investors with a 21  dividend hike in 2017 and a whopping 32  payout increase announced in March of this year 
Best Buy  BBY   A Near Dividend Doubler in Just Three Years 
L Brands  NYSE LB Dividend Yield  7 4 
L Brands  LB   the company behind iconic brands Victoria s Secret and Bath   Body Works  has a dividend yield that puts most of the retail sector to shame 
And that s about it 
L Brands  high yield is entirely a result of its bleeding shares  which have nearly halved in value this year  The dividend hasn t budged for years  in large part because of shrinking profits as its brands lose their luster  especially among increasingly important Millennial wallets  The formerly premium priced lingerie dealer has been forced to slash prices to compete  cramping margins and eroding its once prestigious brand  It also has been forced to put the ax to Henri Bendel  finishing off the fashion brand after 123 years of operations  to improve company profitability and focus on our larger brands that have greater growth potential  
The company s second quarter report made income investors do a double take  L Brands significantly stepped down its full year profit guidance  from  2 70  3 00 to  2 45  2 70  See  LB pays out  2 40 annually in dividends  so it would barely be covering its payout if profits come in at the low end of guidance  A special dividend   a pretty regular occurrence at L Brands   is almost certainly out of the question this year 
Don t expect the Christmas season to turn around the long term decay here  but do start expecting a dividend cut in the next couple years 
Bah humbug 
ProLogis Inc  NYSE PLD Dividend Yield  2 9 
What s an industrial real estate investment trust  REIT  got to do with the holiday season 
Everything  when you re talking about Amazon s largest landlord 
Prologis  PLD  is a warehouse focused REIT that boasts 771 million square feet across 3 742 buildings in 19 countries on four continents 
The shift to e commerce directly benefits Prologis  whose properties are increasingly necessary for any retailer shifting their goods from brick and mortar stores to warehouses  where they ll sit until delivery  And this is a rapid shift  with the company and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  estimating 152  projected growth of e commerce sales between 2015 and 2020 
E Commerce Sales Are Exploding
You can see this potential in Prologis  tenant lineup  Amazon is a major presence  at 16 million square feet as of last year  and Walmart and Best Buy are among other retail customers  But other major tenants include delivery companies such as UPS  UPS   FedEx  NYSE FDX  and DHL   more e commerce beneficiaries 
Prologis has its hand in a lot of other pies  too   5 500 customers  to be specific  also including companies such as BMW  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  and even the U S  government 
The REIT doubled down on its opportunity earlier this year when it acquired rival DCT Industrial Trust for  8 4 billion  adding 71 million square feet of space on the East and West Coasts  That  and Americans  growing love affair with online ordering  makes it all the more likely that PLD will continue growing both its bottom line and its dividend  which have been exploding for years 
Home Delivery Is Making Prologis  PLD  Shareholders Rich
GameStop  NYSE GME Dividend Yield  10 4 
GameStop  GME  would seemingly have it made right now  The Nintendo  NTDOY  Switch is selling like hotcakes  Sony s  SNE  early year PlayStation 4 sales were ahead of projections and NPD Group says Xbox One sales have doubled from 2017  Take Two Interactive s  TTWO  Red Dead Redemption 2 did  725 million retail in just three days  prompting the company to call it  the single biggest opening weekend in the history of entertainment   as it actually beat out Disney s  DIS  Avengers  Infinity War s opening weekend box office 
Video games are doing great 
GameStop is not 
The company s last quarterly results  out in September  included smaller revenues and a net loss of  24 9 million that was wider than the year ago period  adjusted profits of 8 cents per share missed the mark  too  All told  sales should decline 2  to 6  this year 
GME is still making enough of a profit to comfortably cover its dividend  by almost double  But management tipped its hand at its own problems earlier this year by keeping the payout flat after years of token improvements 
This is ominous  If GameStop can t catch a break while console sales are red hot  it s going to be staring at an enormous problem when the console cycle slows down again  and as more game purchases are done online 
Packaging Corporation of America  PKG Dividend Yield  3 4 
Packaging Corporation of America  PKG  is another non retailer that you can nonetheless leverage to profit off the rise of e commerce 
Packaging Corp offers a laundry list of solutions  from corrugated containers to retail packaging and displays to storage boxes to packaging supplies and so  so much more  And if all of that sounds like the kind of products that are going to be in high demand during the busiest time of the year for online retailers   that s because it is  However  PKG also has a robust industrial operation that means its growth isn t wholly dependent on the boom in e commerce 
So far  almost all important metrics point up  up  up  Operational cash flows have grown from  608 million in 2013 to  856 million last year  Earnings have spiked from  4 53 per share in 2015 to  6 31 in the trailing 12 months 
Boxes Are a Booming Business  Who Knew 
What s even more outstanding  Even though the dividend has almost doubled since 2004  the company has paid out just  2 21 per share through the first nine months of this year  against a  5 64 profit   a 39  payout ratio  That means PKG can keep throttling ahead with aggressive dividend hikes going forward while still being able to spend what it needs to spark continued business growth  too 
Make 28  Each Year From   America s Safest Blue Chips 
You need safe  substantial yields in this nauseating market  The problem is  retail mostly offers one or the other   safe but modest yields  or gigantic dividends that are a couple years away from imploding 
That desperate need for safety is what has many investors clinging on to dear life in slow growth stocks like consumer staples Coca Cola  NYSE KO  and Procter   Gamble  PG   Sure  they feel like a security blanket when the market declines  but they ve been long term underperformers with no change in sight 
You can do better than the ho hum yields and lousy price gains in these sleepy blue chips  Much better 
In fact  I haven t been this excited about an income opportunity in years 
What if I told you that you could turn growth dynamos such as Visa  NYSE V  and Google parent Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   into  double threat  holdings that deliver not just double digit upside  but dividends north of 8   Well  you d probably call me nuts  given that Visa pays less than 1  and Sergey Brin would laugh you out of the room if you suggested Google pay out a dividend 
But you d change your tune the moment you saw my new discovery   Dividend Conversion Machines  
These stocks have extremely specialized businesses that allow them to do the seemingly impossible  They can actually wring high single digit dividends from some of the most skinflint companies in America  One of my Dividend Conversion Machines takes Visa s 0 6  payouts and magnifies it to 9 2   Another one can take Google s 0  and produce a 9 4  yield out of thin air 
And no  this isn t an options strategy  or some dangerous derivative  or the  next Bitcoin   What I m going to show you is perfectly SAFE   it s essentially the same as buying traditional American blue chip stocks  In fact  I ll even show you the four steps you ll need right now

That s it 
The incredible investments I m going to show you in just a second are 100  as safe as investing in  stodgy  blue chips   except you get retirement enhancing dividends and BIG upside too  In fact  they even have another leg up on traditional blue chips  They pay out their dividends monthly  which is ideal for retirees who need that income to pay their bills   and ideal for investors planning for retirement because those dividends will compound even faster

35396,256911,CRI,Port squeeze threatens U S  retailers  holiday stocking plans,news,"By Nandita Bose and Lisa Baertlein CHICAGO LOS ANGELES  Reuters    A shortage of transportation equipment and possible labor disruptions at  the Los Angeles Long Beach port complex   the nation s busiest  is delaying shipping containers for up to three weeks  threatening timely delivery to retailers for the holiday season 
The delays are affecting retailers including JC Penney Co  N JCP   Macy s Inc  N M   Kohl s Corp  N KSS  Nordstrom Inc  N JWN   American Eagle  N AEO   Ralph Lauren  N RL  and Carter s  N CRI   according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation 
Retail giant Wal mart Stores Inc  N WMT   recently diverted 300 shipment containers to Oakland to avoid the congestion  one person said  Wal Mart declined comment 
The problem stems from a shortage of trucking equipment  called chassis  but the National Retail Federation in a statement said protracted labor negotiations were an issue  too  The International Longshore and Warehouse Union declined comment on whether talks were having an effect 
Most retailers acknowledged the delays at the key ports for shipments from Asia  but said they did not anticipate product shortages during the holidays  Even so  any delay can derail a finely calibrated just in time inventory control system  making it costlier for retailers to put merchandise on the shelves 
 It s a domino effect   said Nate Herman  vice president of international trade at the American Apparel and Footwear Association   When there is an interruption  things degenerate quickly  
With major port contracts up for renewal this year  retailers including Wal Mart ordered early and prompted a surge of deliveries in June and July  port statistics show  But significant volume still arrived during the traditional August October period that precedes the November January holiday shopping season 
 There will be a scramble to restock shelves this holiday season   said Mark Hirzel  president of the Los Angeles Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association   The delays are running into two to three weeks  
Cargo containers typically take two to three days to move out of the port 
IDLE CONTAINERS
A freight forwarder who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said holiday merchandise for retailers like JC Penney  Macy s  Kohl s and Nordstrom that landed at the Los Angeles port two weeks ago still has not cleared the port 
An apparel importer who declined to be named said American Eagle  Ralph Lauren and Carter s shipments from Bangladesh have been stuck for over two weeks   We simply don t know when these shipments will move out   the source said 
An American Eagle spokeswoman declined comment on the delays 
JC Penney and Macy s both said they did not anticipate significant delay related issues  A Nordstrom spokeswoman said the company was contacting vendors for information 
Wal Mart  Kohl s  Ralph Lauren and Carter s did not respond to requests seeking comment 
DISPUTE ABOUT CAUSES
Outside the gates of Los Angeles Long Beach Seaport on busy days  trucks stand in mile long queues  even as stacks of unmoved containers wait for pickup at a complex that handles 40 percent of  U S  container cargo    The Port of New York and New Jersey is also affected  but to a lesser extent 
Val Noronha  president of Digital Geographic Group  said the company s GPS tracking data showed a third of trucks took more than two hours to enter and leave the port  compared to about one fifth taking that long in June of 2010 
Geoffrey Hanna  vice president of textile importer Henry W  Peabody   Co   said some truckers have refused to go to the ports because of long wait times  It took his firm more than two weeks to get a recent shipment out  Hanna said 
The disruptions stem from the move by shipping lines  which struggled during the recession  to sell container trailers and other non core assets to equipment leasing companies  port sources and outside experts said  The change sent roughly 8 000 truckers that serve the port each day scrambling to find chassis 
The backlog of containers is creating extra work  Statistics from the Pacific Maritime Association  which represents 29 ports along the West Coast  show hours paid to terminal workers jumped 24 percent this September over the same month last year  Last month  750 850 inbound containers arrived at the Los Angeles Long Beach complex  up almost 11 percent from a year ago  the port statistics show 
Several retailers and importers are considering alternatives such as Houston or East Coast ports  Hirzel of Los Angeles Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association said 

 It will cost more and take longer but they want certainty   he said   In this situation  there is value in certainty

35397,256912,CRI,Abercrombie to create six new roles in management revamp  WSJ,news," Reuters    Struggling teen apparel retailer Abercrombie   Fitch Co  N ANF  is creating six new positions as it restructures the management of its Abercrombie brand  the Wall Street Journal reported 
The move is part of a strategy to organize executives by brand rather than product  the newspaper said 
All except one of the new positions will be filled by recently hired outsiders and the executives will report to Abercrombie s brand president  Christos Angelides  the Journal said 
Abercrombie said it would issue a press release at 8 30 a m  ET on Tuesday  but did not give further details 
Abercrombie tapped executives from Ralph Lauren Corp s  N RL  Club Monaco chain  PVH Corp  N PVH   Kohl s Corp  N KSS  and Carter s Inc  N CRI  for the new positions  WSJ said 
Abercrombie  once popular for the preppy clothing it sold under its namesake brand  has struggled to revive flagging sales with customers tiring of its logo centric apparel 
The company  however  said in May that its business was showing signs of recovery as sales of its Hollister branded clothes improved  suggesting that efforts to revitalize the retailer may be starting to pay off

35425,256940,CRI,Carter s Down 30  In A Year  Can Strategies Aid A Turnaround ,opinion,Shares of Carter s  Inc    NYSE CRI   have plunged 29 6  in a year compared to the  s 3 4  growth  The underperformance can be mainly attributed to softness across its U S  Wholesale business due to the bankruptcy of Toys  R  Us The closure of Toys  R  Us stores  which is the company s key wholesale customer  is largely weighing on the performance of Carter s U S  Wholesale segment  In third quarter 2018  sales at this segment decreased 8 3  year over year  owing to fall in shipments due to loss of sales to Toys  R  Us and Bon Ton Moreover  Carter s higher cost of investments toward technology  brand marketing and expedited shipping have been hurting operating margin  SG A expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased 180 basis points  bps  in third quarter 2018  This uptick was mainly driven by increased investments in new stores and e commerce business  higher marketing spending  distribution  speedy deliveries and infrastructure  Consequently  operating margin contracted 220 bps in the third quarter  Going forward  this can be a threat to the company s profitability Additionally  high inventory levels remain a worry for the company  At the end of the third quarter  Carter s saw a 14  increase in net inventories owing to the timing of inventory receipts and increased baby replenishment inventory  While management is working to normalize this equation  it expects net inventory growth to moderate to up 8  by the end of 2018 Growth StrategiesDespite these potent limitations  we are optimistic about Carter s Retail strategy that focuses on improving store productivity  strengthening e commerce business and enhancing product offerings  The company s Skip Hop and Age Up initiatives are likely to significantly drive retail sales growth in 2018  Additionally  the company is witnessing a positive response for its co branded stores  which have been receiving maximum return on investment By 2022  Carter s plans to open nearly 160 co branded stores  Further  it targets increasing the mix of these stores to at least 50  of its store base compared with 20  at the beginning of 2017  Simultaneously  management intends to shut down roughly 115 less productive stores  comprising mainly Carter s and OshKosh outlets  This is expected to improve customer s experience and boost the company s profitability Moreover  Carter s efforts to strengthen e commerce capabilities through investments to speed up deliveries are impressive  Notably  the company has been witnessing double digit growth in e commerce sales  mainly backed by higher domestic demand  In 2019  it plans to launch the e commerce capabilities in Mexico  Combined with wholesale  the company expects to reach  1 billion in online purchases of its brands in 2019 Meanwhile  Carter s International business is witnessing solid growth  thanks to acquired licensee business in Mexico and robust demand in markets outside of North America  Further  the company is on track with the integration of the Mexico business  acquired in 2017  It anticipates about  30 million sales contribution from Mexico in 2018  with the potential to double its sales in the next five years  Moreover  Carter s expects China to generate about  20 million sales in 2018  with significant e commerce sales growth Bullish Outlook Despite dismal third quarter 2018 results  management issued upbeat guidance for the fourth quarter  Carter s expects net sales to grow 5  and adjusted earnings per share to rise roughly 10  year over year  In fact  the anticipated sales and earnings growth for the fourth quarter might be a partial recovery of the lost sales  which would have come from Toys  R  Us and Bon Ton Moreover  the company witnessed double digit comparable store sales growth initially in the fourth quarter driven by higher traffic  conversion rates and improved price realization  Management projects quarterly retail comps to increase approximately 4   backed by various strategic initiatives  including gains from Age Up size expansion and Skip Hop For 2018  management anticipates sales increase of nearly 1 5  and adjusted earnings growth of about 5  from 2017 figure Bottom LineWe believe Carter s may spring back to growth in the near term backed by the aforementioned initiatives  An upbeat fourth quarter and 2018 guidance also support our view Currently  Carter s has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Interested in Consumer Discretionary Space  Bet on

35472,256987,CRI,Does Carter s  Inc   CRI  Make For A Suitable Value Pick Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Carter s  Inc    NYSE CRI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Carter has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 87  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 87  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Carter s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 33  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Carter has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 48  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Carter stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Carter has a P S ratio of about 1 29  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CRI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Carter currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Carter a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Carter might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives CRI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C  You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have not been much encouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimate going higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen no upward and one downward movement in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 12 2  in the past two months and the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Carter s  Inc  Price and Consensus   This unfavorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCarter is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 18  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past three years  the  has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all

Earnings   RevenuesThis athletic apparel  footwear and accessories retailer s first quarter earnings per share of 57 cents fell 22  year over year  but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents  The year over year decline in earnings stemmed from planned gross margin reduction and higher tax rate  offset by slight SG A leverage and lower share count Nike  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Revenues of the swoosh brand owner remained flat at  9 070 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 065 million  primarily driven by persistent growth at international locations and

GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is another value metric that is considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than M industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued  These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 11

35583,257098,CRI,NIKE s  NKE  Q4 Earnings Beat  Sales Miss  Stock Down ,opinion,NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   posted fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results  wherein its bottom line surpassed estimates for the sixteenth straight quarter  However  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock declined 4  in the after market trading session as sales lagged the consensus estimate for the third consecutive time  Also  lower than expected future orders could be a factor that instilled a negative sentiment among investors This athletic apparel  footwear and accessories retailer s fourth quarter earnings per share of 49 cents remained flat year over year  while exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Earnings were fuelled by reduced average share count and robust global momentum  which was offset by a higher tax rate  a drop in gross margin and a hike in selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses NIKE INC B Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Delving DeeperRevenues of this sportswear retailer advanced 6  to  8 244 million in the quarter  However  the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 261 million due to the impact of currency headwinds  On a currency neutral basis  sales jumped 9  Revenues of the company s NIKE Brand rose 8  on a currency neutral basis to  7 725 million  The segment gained from a double digit increase in Western Europe  Greater China  Emerging Markets and Japan  which in turn was backed by solid growth across Sportswear  Global Football and the Jordan Brand Moreover  the NIKE brand s Direct to Consumer   DTC   revenues improved 23  in the quarter  mainly on the back of 39  online sales growth Additionally  revenues at the company s Converse brand surged 18  to  513 million on a currency neutral basis  This increase was attributable to the shift of a major go live system to the third quarter last year  instead of the fourth quarter  This meant more go live orders in this year s fourth quarter  which enhanced sales Also  NIKE s global future orders for the NIKE Brand  slated for delivery from Jun 2016 through Nov 2016  went up 8  year over year to  14 9 billion  On a currency neutral basis  future orders rose 11   reflecting rising demand for the company s products However  as reported by sources  the outlook for future orders lagged analysts  estimates  as stiff competition from rivals weighed on demand for NIKE s basketball shoes  Gross profit improved about 6  to  3 786 million  while the gross margin contracted 30 basis points  bps  to 45 9   The decline in gross margin was attributable to adverse impact from excess inventory clearance in North America  foreign currency headwinds and increased product expenses  somewhat compensated by higher average selling prices  Also  some sources revealed that the softness in gross margin was partly a result of stiff competition from rivals like Under Armour  Inc    NYSE UA   and Adidas  DE ADSGN  AG   OTC ADDYY   Selling and administrative expense escalated 7  to  2 766 million  mainly on account of higher operating overhead costs stemming from growth in the DTC business and increased investments in infrastructure and digital capabilities  as well as rising costs for digital demand creation  brand events and sports marketing  This was partly offset by lower advertisement costs Fiscal 2016 at a GlanceThe company s earnings for fiscal 2016 came in at  2 16 per share  marking year over year growth of 17   while beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Total revenue for the fiscal rose 6  to  32 376 million  though it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  32 393 million Balance SheetNIKE ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of  5 457 million  long term debt  excluding current maturities  of  2 010 million  and shareholders  equity of  12 258 million  Inventories as of May 31  2016  grew nearly 12  to  4 838 million Shareholder Friendly MovesDuring the fourth quarter  NIKE bought back 9 million shares for  540 million under its new  12 billion program that was approved in Nov 2015 and extends for a four year term  With this  the company s total repurchases for fiscal 2016 amounted to 55 4 million shares for roughly  3 2 billion  which includes 20 1 million shares under the current  12 billion authorization Looking ForwardNIKE s solid quarterly performance reflects its focus on adopting innovations to keep up with customer demand  In spite of foreign currency headwinds  the company s results remain impressive  backed by its constant focus on exploiting growth opportunities and efficient risk management  However  management expects currency woes to prevail and impact results in fiscal 2017  more so after the Brexit Considering all factors  management anticipates fiscal 2017 revenue to grow at a high single digit rate  while on a currency neutral basis  it expects the same to increase in a high single digit to low double digit range  The company stated that revenue in the first half of the fiscal is likely to bear a stronger impact from the fluctuating currencies than the latter half The company expects gross margin for fiscal 2017 to expand in a range of 30 50 bps  much in line with its long term goals  SG A expenses for fiscal 2017 are anticipated to grow at a high single digit rate For the first quarter of fiscal 2017  the company expects revenues to grow in the mid single digit range  Gross margin is projected to fall by nearly 100 bps in the quarter  mainly due to currency headwinds  Further  SG A expenses are estimated to grow at a mid to high teens

35621,257136,CRI,Iconix  ICON  Stock Down On Lowered 2016 Earnings Outlook,opinion,"Shares of Iconix Brand Group  Inc    NASDAQ ICON   fell 8 04  on Jun 13 after this clothing brand licensing company lowered its 2016 earnings guidance following the repurchase of convertible notes 
Iconix recently entered into an agreement to repurchase up to approximately  105 million  out of  400 million  of its outstanding 1 50  Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due Mar 2018  The company plans to retire up to approximately  105 million of these notes in exchange for aggregate cash payments of up to approximately  35 2 million  and approximately 6 8 million shares of the company 
The company believes this debt reduction  combined with the issuance of equity will boost its liquidity and create long term shareholder value 
Following the issuance of the shares in this transaction  the company s outstanding share count has increased  thus prompting the company to reduce its earnings guidance for 2016  The company now expects adjusted earnings in the range of  1 06 to  1 21 per share  down from the previous guidance of  1 15  1 30 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 20 per share  on the higher side of the company s new guidance range ICONIX BRAND GP Price and Consensus   We note that Iconix shares have been tumbling since the beginning of this year  Many firms have also filed a class action lawsuit against Iconix  In Dec 2015  Iconix Brand announced that it has received a formal order of investigation from U S  Securities and Exchange Commission   SEC    pertaining to some accounting treatment of certain international joint venture transactions  It has been accused of misleading investors by underreporting the cost of its brands and overstating its earnings and revenues by engaging in irregular accounting practices related to the booking of its joint venture revenues and profits  free cash flow  and organic growth 
Though the company restated its historical statements along with the fourth quarter 2015 results  these issues have adversely impacted growth 
Not only that  Iconix delivered sluggish results throughout 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016  Both earnings and sales have declined year over year in the last five consecutive quarters due to sluggishness in the women s  men s and home segments  In the women s segment  the largest component of the decline was in the wholesale business  with some pressure on the Rampage brand  There was also continued weakness across the overall men s portfolio 
The company expects higher expenses in 2016 associated with the new term loan  the impact of the sale of the Badgley Mischka brand  adjustments related to the financial restatement  transition costs relating to the hiring of the company s new chief executive officer  and current trends in the portfolio 
Iconix currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

35646,257161,CRI,Fed s Outlook On Economy To Boost Trump Presidency  4 Picks,opinion,Nobody would like to go long this week as the Brexit debate heats up  which may spark fresh bouts of volatility in the global markets  But barring U K  s looming vote  it is the Federal Reserve s reticence to raise interest rates that is making investors jittery  The Fed s dovish approach raised doubts about the strength of the economy  and this was compounded by the central bank downgrading its economic outlook for the rest of the year A slowing economy works in favor of the Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump compared to his rival Hillary Clinton  who has recently clinched the Democratic Presidential nomination  An improving economy would have been an endorsement of the performance of the incumbent Democrats  thereby benefiting Clinton  Instead  the currently weak economy should be a shot in the arm for the Republicans  Let s not forget that Trump has been constantly complaining about the stagnant economy and a shortage of jobs  and if this continues till the Election Day  the advantage may well be his Whether Trump will win the presidential race is yet to be seen  but given the weak economic conditions  investors would be naive not to consider a Trump presidency  So if Trump makes it to the White House  there are certain areas such as consumer discretionary  infrastructure  defense and oil where investors would do well to go long Dovish Stance  Weak Economic Growth May s dismal jobs report kept rate hike in check this month  A number of people also dropped out of the labor force  which isn t an encouraging sign as well  Fed officials also believe that further interest rate hikes will be less frequent  This reluctance to hike rates is broadly seen as a sign of flagging confidence in the economy To corroborate this view  the Fed has downgraded its GDP growth rate to 2  for this year  down from its earlier prediction of 2 3  in March  Given that the Fed is always optimistic in its forecasts  the rates might decline further  The World Bank too expects the U S  economy to grow at a rate of 1 9  this year  down from 2 4  last year  Slowing economic growth gives Republicans an edge over their rival Democrats  And the face for the Republican Party for this election is none other than Donald Trump  So  let s have a gauge at the sectors that could benefit from Trump s policies Tax Plans to Benefit Discretionary Stocks  Apple in Focus Trump s tax cuts for households will spur economic growth  With more money at their disposal  it is only likely that consumers will spend more on discretionary items  This brings Sotheby s   NYSE BID   in play as it is a part of the luxury discretionary market  Home improvement retailer  The Home Depot  Inc    NYSE HD   is also an interesting play  as Trump believes that homeownership is very much a part of the American dream Trump s plan that no company of any size will pay more than 15  of their business income in taxes also brings companies such as Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   into sharp focus  What this will do is that Apple will finally bring its money back to the U S  According to a study by Moody s in 2015  Apple had parked more than  150 billion in the overseas market  almost 90  of its total cash Infrastructure to Profit Immensely In several debates Trump has mentioned that the nation will benefit from spending billions in fixing roads  bridges and airports  His intention is not only to put a tariff on foreign goods but also to compel companies to invest more in the U S  by way of imposing taxes on overseas profits  Heavy construction companies including Fluor Corporation   NYSE FLR   and supplier of heavy building materials Martin Marietta Materials  Inc    NYSE MLM   will stand to gain  Additionally  Trump promises to build a 50 foot wall on the border of Mexico whose estimate ranges from  15 billion to  25 billion  A likely benefactor of such a move might be construction service provider  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc    NYSE JEC   Defense to Gain ConsiderablyImproving military strength has always been a part of Trump s agenda  Trump isn t risk averse and is in support of upgrading defense and aerospace technology  He has also pledged to lift the ban on guns  In fact  he has vowed to protect the Second Amendment rights  which clearly states that  the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon  So  the beneficiaries would be high tech defense and aerospace manufacturers like Lockheed Martin Corporation   NYSE LMT    Raytheon Company   NYSE RTN   and Northrop Grumman Corporation   NYSE NOC    A firearm friendly White House is also expected to benefit gun manufacturers like Smith   Wesson Holding Corporation   NASDAQ SWHC   and Sturm  Ruger   Co  Inc    NYSE RGR   4 Stocks to Buy if Trump Wins PresidencyThanks to new labor market related worries  the Fed kept rates unchanged and downgraded the economic growth forecast  which is more likely to help Trump win Presidency  All the sectors discussed above stand to benefit the most if he is elected as the president  Certain oil companies such as Anadarko Petroleum Corporation   NYSE APC   are also likely to gain as they have more exposure to top U S  shale plays and its assets aren t heavily tied to the Middle East  Remember what Trump had said about invariably bombing the ISIS  which would result in a turmoil in oil supply in the Middle East Here we have selected four fundamentally solid stocks from such sectors that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Additionally  we have narrowed down our search with a  of  A  or  B   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of

While a significant number of companies in the retail sector have come out with positive surprises  in terms of both earnings and revenues  a few companies in the departmental store space and apparel category have posted disappointing results due to macroeconomic issues and declining demand as a result of shifting consumer preferences

106594,328109,CRI,Iconix Brand  ICON  Falls On Investigation By A Law Firm,opinion,"New York based Iconix Brand Group  Inc    NASDAQ ICON   fell 2 23  yesterday when the company announced that the Shuman Law Firm is investigating potential claims against certain officers and directors of the company  as to whether these officers or directors have breached their fiduciary duties to the company 
We note that the company s shares have been tumbling since the beginning of this year  Many firms have also filed a class action lawsuit against Iconix  In Dec 2015  Iconix Brand announced that it has received a formal order of investigation from U S  Securities and Exchange Commission   SEC    pertaining to some accounting treatment related to certain international joint venture transactions  It has been accused of misleading investors by underreporting the cost of its brands and overstating its earnings and revenues by engaging in irregular accounting practices related to the booking of its joint venture revenues and profits  free cash flow  and organic growth 
Though the company restated its historical statements along with the fourth quarter 2015 results  these issues have adversely impacted growth 
Not only that  Iconix has delivered sluggish results throughout 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016  Both earnings and sales have declined year over year in the last five consecutive quarters due to sluggishness in the women s  men s and home segments  In the women s segment  the largest component of the decline was in the wholesale business  with some pressure on the Rampage brand  There was also continued weakness across the overall men s portfolio 
The company expects higher expenses in 2016 associated with the new term loan  the impact of the sale of the Badgley Mischka brand  adjustments related to the financial restatement  transition costs relating to the hiring of the company s new chief executive officer  and current trends in the portfolio

However  Skechers rebounded strongly and commenced 2015 on an upbeat note  Although the first quarter was marred by foreign currency headwinds  adverse weather conditions and West Coast port related dispute  the company delivered earnings of  1 10 per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 9  and surged from 61 cents recorded in the year ago quarter 
Net sales of  768 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  707 million and soared 40 5  from the prior year quarter  The top line was driven by aggressive marketing initiatives  product innovation across multiple categories and healthy performance across all revenue channels  Moreover  the growth rate accelerated from 26 4  in the fourth quarter of 2014 
Skechers is now showcasing strength  and a positive sentiment is palpable among analysts covering the stock  This is apparent from the upward movement in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past 60 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate increased 6 8  to  4 24 per share for 2015 and 6 6  to  5 36 per share for 2016

Though the company restated its historical statements along with the fourth quarter 2015 results  these issues have adversely impacted growth  Further  for 2016  the company expects other headwinds like higher expenses  adjustments related to the financial restatement  transition costs to hamper its profitability
