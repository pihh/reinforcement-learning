Specially  enrollment from students using FSA  TA and VA is highly volatile  and subject to stringent government regulations and other regulatory actions Enrollment of students using FSA has been

20810,242325,APEI,Bright Horizons  BFAM  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Bright Horizons Family Solutions   NYSE BFAM    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8 5  over the past month  BFAM hit a new 52 week high of  105 93 in the previous session  Bright Horizons Family Solutions has gained 12 5  since the start of the year compared to the 4 4  move for the Consumer Discretionary sector and the 15  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 30  2018  Bright Horizons Family Solutions reported EPS of  0 72 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 71 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 3  
For the current fiscal year  Bright Horizons Family Solutions is expected to post earnings of  3 15 per share on  1 91 billion in revenues  This represents a 17 1  change in EPS on a 9 46  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 58 per share on  2 05 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 13 65  and 7 77   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
While BFAM has moved to its 52 week high in the recent past  investors need to be asking  what is next for the company  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Bright Horizons Family Solutions has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 33 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 25X versus its peer group s average of 20 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 24  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Bright Horizons Family Solutions currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Bright Horizons Family Solutions meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though BFAM shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come

20812,242327,APEI,U S  Trade Deficit With China Puts Education Stocks In Focus,opinion,"U S  China trade war has been a major damaging factor for financial markets since its commencement in July 2018  In fact  the constant tariff impositions affected the businesses of most industries in the two nations 
Chinese indexes have been heavily affected by the ongoing trade dispute  with Hang Seng Index  HSI  and Shanghai Composite Index  SCI  losing 11 4  and 5 4   respectively  since Jul 6  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2 6  and Nasdaq Composite lost 5 2   respectively  in the same timeframe 
According to the   United States  trade deficit with China increased 9 2  year over year to reach  38 6 billion in August 2018  Some of the country s major imports from the Asian nation include consumer electronics  machinery and apparel 
President Donald Trump s protectionist measures in trade with China were aimed at narrowing United State s trade deficit that has been highest globally since 1975  but the broadening deficit indicates that a different approach would perhaps have been apt 
While most U S  industries are experiencing a widening trade deficit with China  a few industries  such as education  have been barred from the trade war effect  Therefore  it would be prudent to focus on a few stocks from the U S  education services industry at present 
U S  Trade Surplus With China in Education
Although U S  China trade dispute is dominating global economic tensions  United States enjoys a trade surplus with China and rest of the world in the field of education  The Chinese education industry has been largely unaffected by the ongoing trade war as well 
As of 2016  U S  education exports amounted to  39 4 billion while its imports were only  7 5 billion  Foreign students attending American higher education institutions were responsible for the trade surplus in education and remain a major driver for the continuing growth in the domestic education industry  The figure is indicative of only the tuition fee foreign students pay in the United States 
 A lot of Chinese students study in the US and pay large amounts of tuition fees and living expenses  This is a huge sum of money that flows from China to the US   China s central bank governor Yi Gang said at the G30 International Banking Seminar 2018 earlier in October 
Chinese students account for nearly 30  of foreign nationals enrolled in America s educational institutions  The students not only contribute to the U S  economy  but are also responsible for creation of jobs  According to   during the 2016 2017 academic year  1 078 822 foreign students studying in the United States were responsible for adding  36 9 billion to the U S  economy and supported 450 000 jobs in the country 
According to   U S  education market is estimated to reach  2 040 billion by 2026  The industry is set to witness a compound annual rate of more than 4 5  in the2018 2026 period  The rising number of Chinese students enrolling for U S  higher education could be a contributor to this growth 
Some of the leading players in U S  education industry include Adobe Systems   NASDAQ ADBE    McGraw Hill  NYSE SPGI  Education  Blackboard Inc  and Wall Family Enterprise

recently featured in the blog include Rocky Brands  Inc    NASDAQ RCKY    American Public Education  Inc    NASDAQ APEI    Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS    Bluegreen Vacations Corp    NYSE BXG   and SP Plus Corp    NASDAQ SP   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog 5 Top Rated Stocks to Defy Fall in Q1 Consumer SpendingThe U S  economy expanded at a pace of 2 3  in the first quarter  coming in above the consensus estimate  However  it represents a decline from the pace of 3  experienced during the last three quarters of 2017  While declines were felt across all components  consumer spending declined significantly after strong gains in the fourth quarter of 2017 This may appear to be worrying at first glance  but first quarter figures have been dismal in recent years due to statistical and weather related issues  Other consumer related indicators are also on an upswing which means that consumer spending should pick up over the rest of the year  Investing in consumer discretionary stocks looks like a smart option at this point Spending Posts Smallest Increase in 5 YearsConsumer spending  which makes up almost two thirds of total GDP  dropped to a pace of 1 1  in the first quarter  This is the slowest pace witnessed since the second quarter of 2015  Further  it comes on the heels of the fourth quarter s 4  increase  the largest expansion in three years  It seems that during this period  consumers chose to focus on savings and paying off bills Further  it is likely that unusually cold weather acted as an impediment to spending  Following the post hurricane increase during the final months of 2017  consumers also took a breather from spending on motor vehicles  Expenditure on clothing  footwear and food and beverages also declined  likely due to delayed tax refunds Rebound Likely in Upcoming Quarters  Other Indicators PositiveMost economists point out the first quarter has been the most disappointing one in five of the last eight years  This has been attributed to statistical factors such as residual seasonality  Further  the impact of Trump s tax cuts is yet to kick in  Moreover  an increase in wages and investment is likely to fuel stronger consumer expenditure in the quarters ahead Meanwhile  the employment cost index increased 0 8  in the first quarter  providing fresh evidence of an uptick in wages  Moreover  the cost of worker compensation advanced to a yearly pace of 2 7   the largest increase since 2008  This is a logical outcome with unemployment a 17 year low of 4 1  Additionally  retail sales recently reversed the soft trend observed in the first few months of the year  increasing by 0 6  in March  Also  the Consumer Confidence Index rebounded in April  increasing from 127 to 128 7   With this increase  the index is only marginally below the level of 130 achieved in February  a level last witnessed in late 2000 Further  the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index came in at 98 8 for April  exceeding the estimated level of 98 2  This occurred primarily because of consumers  positive perception of their finances Our ChoicesThough first quarter GDP has come in above estimates  the fall in consumer spending has led to a decline from the level witnessed in the fourth quarter  However  this is likely only a temporary phenomenon  given the poor first quarter readings witnessed in recent years Additionally  a low unemployment rate  wage growth and the impact of tax cuts is likely to boost consumer spending in the quarters ahead  Adding consumer discretionary stocks to your portfolios looks like a prudent option at this time  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a

environment was assured for such companies during his campaign Regulatory BattleIn June 2017  the U S  Department of Education made announcements to revise for profit education industry regulations  The department expressed its intention to form a committee to rewrite the Borrower Defense to Repayment and Gainful Employment system  intended to protect students from misleading advertisements of programs and high debt burden The Obama administration had revised the regulation last year in order to simplify the debt relief claims process and shift the loan burden more onto schools  These were slated to be put into effect in July 2017  but the U S  Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos deferred the implementation for a year DeVos is of the view that the current regulation  is a muddled process that s unfair to students and schools  and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs   She assured that the revised regulations will be fair and balanced for educational companies and will also protect students from fraudulent practices and deceptive claims DeVos  decision to delay the implementation till July 2019 led to a legal protest against her by a group of 19 state attorneys general  Critics believe that the revised rules are more in favor of  predatory  for profit education companies than loan burdened students  Also  the fact that not a single debt relief claim has been approved

may be ahead for the stock in the near term as well Looking at the company s sales  the company currently trades at a Price to sales  P S  ratio of 4 8  lower than the industry average of 6 3  Some prefer this metric over other value focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings An often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health of a business  Grand Canyon has a P CF of 19 1  lower than the industry s average of 61 2 All these ratios show that the company is undervalued in comparison to its industry peers and thus it a good time to place a bet on the stock Industry

21125,242640,APEI,These 5 Liquid Stocks Are Efficient Enough To Boost Returns ,opinion,"Investors seeking to derive higher returns may consider investing in relatively liquid stocks  Liquidity is a measure of identifying financially strong companies  It indicates how fast a company can convert its assets to meet its short term debt obligations 
However  a high liquidity level may not always mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain  The same may also indicate that the company is not using its assets efficiently  Hence  to judge whether a company is financially strong or not  besides its liquidity  the efficiency level should be taken into consideration 
So  investing in efficient companies  which also have relatively higher liquidity levels  may boost one s portfolio returns 
Key Ratios to Indicate Liquidity
Current  quick and cash ratios are considered as the main indicators of the liquidity level of a company  Current ratio or working capital ratio indicates a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations by measuring current assets relative to current liabilities  Contrastingly  quick ratio or acid test ratio or quick assets ratio only seeks to measure a company s ability to pay short term obligations  Due to this  current assets excluding inventory are considered in building up the quick ratio 
Separately  the cash ratio   the most conservative of the three ratios   indicates a company s potential to convert its most liquid assets to pay current debt obligations  This is the reason why it only considers cash and cash equivalents relative to the company s current liabilities  Values of all these ratios above 1 may signal that the company is in good financial shape  However  high values of these ratios may also indicate that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  we consider liquidity ratios between 1 and 3 for healthy choices 
Screening Parameters
In addition to favorable liquidity ratios  we included asset utilization in our screening parameters in order to avoid screening high liquid but inefficient companies  Asset utilization  which is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  A company with high asset utilization is considered to be efficient 
Also  we have added our proprietary  to the screen with an objective to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too 
Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency     
Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency

21140,242655,APEI,Focus On The Supply Side,opinion, If all economists were laid end to end   that s where they belong      Unknown  The Futility of Demand Side Measures The Fed has just embarked on QE3  Among other things and in addition to Operation Twist which remains in place  the Fed will be purchasing an additional  40 billion per month in Mortgage Backed Securities  MBS   Short term interest rates will remain where they are until at least mid 2015   Another bout of demand management via high powered money printing  One may ask what the Fed really expects to accomplish with this  The massive deleveraging that began in 2008 isn t over  Despite the recent housing pickup in some areas  there is still a huge overhang of houses with mortgages that are underwater  Unemployment remains high  How will driving mortgage rates to zero cause overleveraged  unemployed borrowers to run out and start buying houses  And would this be desirable   The Fed s action may cause the underleveraged buyers of Hong Kong  whose currency is pegged to the US dollar  to run out and buy houses  But that s another story   Of course  if you own stocks you re happy  Risk on is the only trade that makes sense in a zero short term interest environment    As I see it  QE3 constitutes a massive misallocation of resources and is potentially wildly inflationary  To be sure  the world is in disinflation right now  Most tradable goods are in oversupply thanks to globalization and productivity gains  So the inflation worriers will be crying wolf for a while  But not forever   It s the same with fiscal policy  The wilder eyed Keynesians are still calling for more stimuli  Using IMF data  the IMF calculated US net general government net debt  GDP is now 80 2  and continues to move upward  And that ratio ignores the present value of the massive unfunded entitlement liabilities facing the US over the next forty years  Reinhart and Rogoff  their now classic This Time Is Different as well as other papers  have concluded that economic growth is adversely affected when the government s debt GDP ratio hits 90   Government spending tends to be wasteful  politically driven and a misallocation of capital  How can an economy possibly benefit from this   The history of fiat paper money is a scary one  Fiat paper money unbacked by a commodity like gold or silver   has always depreciated in value and frequently to zero  The Chinese  like they did with so many other things  invented fiat paper money back in the eleventh century  Those interested in the early Chinese experience should read Ralph T  Foster s delightful book  Fiat Paper Money  The History and Evolution of Our Currency  The book has a number of wonderful charts that show various issues of Chinese currency eventually becoming worthless  In every case the commodity backing was eventually withdrawn as massive amounts of new paper was issued    One  delightful  story from Foster  In the late 1200s  as they had done in China as the Yuan Dynasty  the Mongolians conquered Persia  A man named Ezuddeen Musuffer convinced the Mongolian ruler of Persia to introduce a system of fiat paper money as had been done in China  The Persians had been using precious metals as money for centuries and reacted violently against this introduction of paper money  Muzuffer reportedly was torn apart by a mob and thrown to the dogs   I am not proposing that our monetary authorities be subject to that type of discipline  But what I am suggesting is that further manipulation of monetary and or fiscal policy is counterproductive  Most economists are either Keynesians or monetarists or some combination thereof  They have been trained to spend all their time looking at things that in the current environment are demand manipulation oriented and are therefore currently irrelevant or harmful  Demand side government manipulation in the face of global deleveraging is futile  It is to the supply or structural side that policy makers must look as they deal with the coming fiscal cliff  It s on the supply structural side where jobs can be created and productivity enhanced   Some Supply Side Structural Reforms   Here are some ideas  Energy   Set American energy free  Thanks to technology breakthroughs which are not limited to the now vaunted horizontal drilling and fracking  the United States has the potential to become the new Saudi Arabia of energy  Coal  natural gas  oil   you name it and the United States has got lots of it  Throw Canada  the new Kuwait   into the picture and North America becomes the new Persian Gulf  But what is current American policy  The answer is discourage and or prohibit the development of domestic American and Canadian conventional sources of energy  Instead subsidize the development of unproven  unreliable and inefficient alternative green solar and wind energy projects  which when looked at closely  have their own serious environmental issues  Blocking the Keystone pipeline  refusing to grant permits to drill for new oil and gas on government lands  holding up of deep water drilling of the Gulf Coast  holding up of approvals for new LNG export facilities  prohibiting of further oil exploration and drilling in Alaska   the list of anti supply side energy measures promulgated by the American Administration is endless  Thousands of jobs are not being created  economic efficiency is going down the drain  and all the while  the Middle East is in flames  When will the American people connect the dots  The United States and Canada could become the major source of reliable energy for the world   By the way the United States is not the only advanced country pursuing anti supply side green energy policies  Germany is planning to replace its highly efficient and completely safe nuclear system with yet to be proven alternative sources  But again  that s another story  Taxes   Much has been written about taxes and I haven t too much to offer here  I believe the famous Laffer curve exists and cannot be ignored  But at this point the most important thing that can be done is to simplify the American tax structure  Simplification   and that means at least a semi flat tax   would be an enormous productivity enhancer  Taxation for the purpose of income redistribution and which does not increase revenues is an abomination and a productivity and economic growth killer Health Care  The implementation of Obamacare  with its miles and miles of new regulations  hidden and not so hidden taxes  and implicit price controls  hangs like a dark cloud over the American economy  The American health care system is broken and Americans want a new system  I won t argue that  But the US needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new market friendly plan The Financial System   In 2008 the global financial system imploded  Reforms were needed and inevitable  But what America got was the Dodd   Frank bill  Named after the bill s sponsors Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank   the two rogue legislators most responsible for the Fannie Freddie fiasco   the bill introduces an enormity of government rules and regulations which are bound to destroy productivity and hinder the growth of the financial system  American needs to go back to the drawing board on financial reform as it does with health care EDUCATION   America s  And India s and Brazil s and Just About Anywhere Else  Long Term Supply Side Structural Problem  It is generally agreed that the new and exciting globalized world of computer  internet  and biotechnology  that a well educated citizenry is crucial  Long term economic growth depends on it  Every country has its own set of problems in this area  I will confine myself to the educational problems of the United States which in some ways are unique   Talking about education in the United States can be a very sensitive issue  But it is America s and the world s most pressing long term supply side structural problem  How can a problem be solved if nobody can talk about it or only recite politically correct slogans   As I see it the US has one huge educational problem which can dramatically affect economic growth longer term  The problem is that the majority of African American and Hispanic children  who in the future will constitute an ever larger percentage of students in the US  are underperforming relative to US whites and Asians and to students globally  Moreover  overall they have not exhibited significant positive improvement trends  This situation cannot be allowed to persist   A great deal has been written on this subject  usually by people with a special agenda  My agenda is how to remove structural supply side barriers to economic growth and along the way discover investment opportunities  I have relied on the Heritage Foundation s Jason Richwine who can be controversial but who starts with the data and not with wishful thinking  I would also cite the Bank Credit Analyst s March 2011 monthly forecast which discusses this issue in depth  Finally there are at least three frequently referenced sources for measuring student performance including the National Assessment of Educational Progress  NAEP  test undertaken by the US Department of Education  the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment  PISA  test and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study  TIMSS  sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement  IEA   an international organization of national research institutions and governmental research agencies   Consider  1  The relative underperformance of African American and Hispanic groups relative to whites and Asians has persisted over time  The performance of the former groups can be considered unsatisfactory in the context of the global knowledge economy  Moreover  at least in Richwine s opinion  Hispanics  after showing academic  and income  improvement from the first to second generation  level off by the third  They thus differ from the Jews  the Irish  the Italians and the Poles that went before them   2  Money isn t really the problem  According to OECD data  the US spends more on primary education per pupil than any other major economy  Moreover  although his conclusions have been challenged and there may be some important exceptions  Richwine s analysis of the data has led him to conclude  even after allowing for regional cost differences  that overall those US public schools with predominantly African American and Hispanic student bodies are not significantly underfunded as compared with schools with predominantly Asian and white student bodies   3  Asian students seem to do well whether in Asia or  in spite of   in the much maligned public American schools  White students have similar records when compared to Europe   4  The Chicago school strike is an eye opener  The union  which apparently has a significant African American membership  argued against performance test score based salary systems since  according to media reports  they viewed their predominantly minority students as difficult to teach thanks to problems of poverty  drug abuse at home  single parent families etc  If a teachers union with a substantial minority membership views African American and Hispanic children as difficult to teach and does not want its teacher members to be judged on the students  performance  that is very discouraging   Some Suggestions my first suggestion is greater reliance on Charter and private schools  While the record for Charter School improvement of scores is not unambiguous and selection biases muddy up firm conclusions  overall the private sector is always more efficient than the public  Why should it be different in education  There seems to be a great deal of parental support for Charter Schools   A second suggestion is greater reliance on for profit education  As the public sector faces budget problems and cutbacks are being visited on institutions like community colleges which have served minority students  for profit colleges have stepped into the breach  This is despite charges  perhaps justified in some cases  that for profit colleges have gamed and abused the  easily gamable and abusable  Federal student loan system  The current American Administration seems to have an ideological bias against the private sector in general and education is no exception  Most students don t share this bias  The Apollo Group  which operates the University of Phoenix  currently with all the bad publicity  can boast some 400 000 students  Have they all been hoodwinked   While the performance of American public education and its growing minority population stagnates  the internet is bringing a revolution to global education  One example is massive open online courses  MOOC   A technology driven revolution driven by the private sector is underway in education  Capitalism can be viewed as a problem solving mechanism  If you solve somebody s problem  you get rich  If allowed to operate without government interference and ideological binders  the private sector as it always does will see the underperformance of American minority students not as an unsolvable problem but as an opportunity ,2012-09-19,Peter T.

21141,242656,APEI,Finding The Best Small Companies To Invest In,opinion,2012 Forbes Best Small Companies to Invest In Finding great ideas is difficult  If you are lucky  you ll come across several a year  but there is a way to find more and better ideas  One method that I always look forward to is finding the best small companies to invest in by scanning the annual  list published by Forbes  The methodology used by Forbes in finalizing these small companies is quite simple  strong sales and earnings growthpublicly traded for at least a yeargenerated annual revenue between  5 million and  1 billionstock price no lower than  5 a shareexcludes financial institutions  REITs  utilities and limited partnershipsIn additional to the criteria above  here is how the rankings are calculated  The rankings are based on earnings growth  sales growth and return on equity in the past 12 months and over five years  we dropped thinly traded names and those with fuzzy accounting or major legal troubles  We also factored in stock performance versus each company s peer group during the last year as of Oct  5  I ve been going through this best small companies list since I found it in 2009  and have discovered and learned about many interesting names as well as profited from a few that I had conviction in  I was particularly impressed with the companies from the 2011 list  Shares of last year s members rose 30  on average  which matched the Russell 2000 small company index  Last year s top performers were Zoll Medical which is no longer publicly traded after a successful takeover  SolarWinds  SWI   Cirrus Logic  CRUS  and HealthStream  HSTM   All of them saw their stocks jump at least 135  over the past 12 months  Let s take a look at the top 3  Company financials and other

company to invest in  It is difficult to value a company with such fast growth as there is high chance of overvaluing the company as well undervaluing the company based on the current numbers Instead  the best way would be to see how much growth is expected from the current stock price to see how reasonable the current valuation is  Using a  with starting FCF input of  128m and 12  discount rate  the required growth currently expected from the price is 25   Performing a reverse  using the analyst estimate EPS of  1 33  a growth rate of 24  is required to meet the current stock price  Using   and reverse engineering the PE  the expected growth rate comes out to 25   The difficult question then becomes whether Solarwinds will be able to achieve this growth going forward and for how long  I m afraid  I ll have to let you answer that one   2 Grand Canyon Education  LOPE Grand Canyon Education  Inc  is a provider of post secondary education services offering graduate and undergraduate

expenditure values blue the free cash flow number too much to be of much help  What I mean by this is that in 2006  capex was recorded as  2 4m and in 2011  it was recorded as  80 5m  This growth in capex is unheard of  According to TTM figures  the capex currently sits at  20m which is far too low considering that the average capex over the past three years has been  60m Instead the better number would be to use owner earnings in the DCF stock valuation  Performing the same reverse valuation exercise as before  a growth rate of 12 5  is required for the stock price to be valid based on discount rate of 12 starting owner earnings value of  66mA reverse Graham valuation shows a required growth of only 6  if the analyst earnings of  1 50 is used in the calculation  The Katsenelson
