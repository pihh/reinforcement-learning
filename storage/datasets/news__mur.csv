169201,390717,MUR,Trump pick for State Department energy job approved by Senate panel,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump s nominee for the top U S  State Department job dealing with matters related to energy and the global oil industry was approved by a Senate committee on Wednesday  as the United States gears up to re impose sanctions on Iran s oil exports 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Francis Fannon  a former head of corporate affairs at mining company BHP Billiton  LON BLT  and senior director of  Murphy Oil Corp   NYSE MUR   to head the department s energy bureau 
If Fannon is confirmed in a vote by the full Senate  one of his most immediate tasks as assistant secretary of state would be synthesizing reports from intelligence agencies with oil industry data to re implement sanctions on Iran s oil exports 
Trump announced on May 8 he was withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Iran deal  which removed sanctions in exchange for the Islamic Republic curbing its nuclear program 
Fannon was approved by 19 of the 21 members of the panel with two Democratic senators opposing him  One of the Democrats  Senator Bob Menendez  said Fannon had lobbied against comprehensive climate change legislation and against limits on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico put in place after  BP   LON BP  s 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster  that killed 11 platform workers 
 Energy security rests in energy diversification  innovation  and development of zero and low carbon energy sources   Menendez said at the hearing   The appointment of an oil and gas lobbyist to this position demonstrates a backwards outlook on energy policy  
Before working in corporations  Fannon served as counsel to the Senate environment committee and as an aide to two Republican senators 
In a hearing before the panel s vote  Fannon said that he had drafted provisions of the 2005 energy bill that helped unleash innovation and set the conditions for U S  energy abundance today ",2018-05-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-pick-for-state-department-energy-job-approved-by-senate-panel-1450691,1450691
169202,390718,MUR,Companies win big at U S  top court on worker class action curbs,news,By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court delivered a blow to the rights of workers on Monday by allowing companies to require them to sign away their ability to bring class action claims against management  agreements already in place for about 25 million employees  The justices  in a 5 4 ruling with the court s conservatives in the majority  endorsed the legality of the growing practice by companies to compel workers to sign arbitration agreements waiving their right to bring class action claims on various disputes  primarily over wages and hours  The ruling could apply more broadly to discrimination claims like those raised by women as part of the  MeToo movement raising awareness of sexual harassment in the workplace but the court did not explicitly address that issue   Craig Becker  a former member of the U S  National Labor Relations Board and now general counsel of the AFL CIO union federation  said the decision will have a  chilling effect  on employees coming forward to complain of mistreatment   It will cripple enforcement of all the major employment laws   Becker added  Growing numbers of employers  alarmed by a rise in class action claims brought by workers on wage issues  have demanded that their workers sign waivers  Class action litigation can result in large damages awards by juries and is harder for businesses to fight than cases brought by individual plaintiffs   Republican President Donald Trump s administration last year reversed the government s stance in the case  siding with the companies  The Justice Department said it was pleased with Monday s ruling  Democratic former President Barack Obama s administration had supported a decision made by the National Labor Relations Board in 2012 invalidating such employment agreements  The board at the time had a Democratic majority  The ruling is the latest in a series of pro business decisions by the conservative majority Supreme Court in recent years curbing class action claims of various types and endorsing arbitration to resolve contractual disputes  Companies have said arbitration is quicker and cheaper than litigation in court  Justice Neil Gorsuch  Trump s appointee to the court  wrote the ruling  joined by the four other conservative justices  Gorsuch wrote that federal arbitration law does not conflict with the National Labor Relations Act  which outlines the right of workers to act collectively   The policy may be debatable but the law is clear  Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written   Gorsuch wrote  Workers have fought back against the waivers  arguing that the cost of pursuing their cases individually in arbitration is prohibitively expensive  The ruling does not affect workers represented by unions  Writing in dissent on behalf of the court s four liberals  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the ruling  egregiously wrong  and urged Congress to take action to protect workers  rights    TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT   The court today holds enforceable these arm twisted  take it or leave it contracts    including the provisions requiring employees to litigate wages and hours claims only one by one  Federal labor law does not countenance such isolation of employees   Ginsburg said in a statement she read in court  Ginsburg said she does not believe the ruling would apply to certain claims alleging discrimination on the basis of race  gender  religion or national origin covered by Title VII of the landmark federal Civil Rights Act  Civil rights advocates were not so sure   Today s decision will make it easier for employers to escape liability for widespread discrimination and harassment  No American should be forced to sign away their right to invoke the meaningful protections afforded by our nation s critical civil rights laws   said Kristen Clarke  president of the Lawyers  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law  The ruling came in the biggest business case of the court s current term  which began in October runs through the end of June  The court in the coming weeks is due to rule in another big workers  rights case involving a conservative challenge to fees that public sector workers like police and teachers who are not union members are forced to pay to unions in certain states to cover the expenses of collecting bargaining   L2N1QG0ZA  The three consolidated cases decided on Monday involved professional services firm Ernst   Young LLP ERNY UL   gas station operator Murphy Oil  NYSE MUR  USA Inc MOUI UL  and healthcare software company Epic Systems Corporation    When it comes to grievances regarding wages and hours  we believe individual arbitration agreements strike that reasonable balance and are pleased with the court s decision in support of this   Epic CEO Judy Faulkner said in a statement  The NLRB argued that the waivers violate federal labor law and let companies evade their responsibilities under workplace statutes   About one in four private sector non union employees have signed arbitration agreements that include class action waivers  according to the liberal leaning Economic Policy Institute   One U S  law firm  Ogletree Deakins  seized on the ruling by launching a service it said will help employers create arbitration agreements containing class action waivers for employees in less than five minutes

joining us on our fourth quarter earnings call today  With me are Roger Jenkins  President and Chief Executive Officer  David Looney  Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Mike McFadyen  Executive Vice President  Offshore  and Eric Hambly  Executive Vice President  Onshore Please refer to the informational slides we have placed on the Investor Relations section of our website as you follow along with our webcast today  Throughout today s call production numbers  reserves and financial amounts are adjusted to exclude non controlling interest in the Gulf of Mexico Slide 1  please keep in mind that some of the comments made during this call will be considered forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  As such  no assurances can be given that these events will occur or that the projections will be attained  A variety of factors exists that may cause actual results to differ  For further discussion of risk factors  see Murphy s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10 K on file with the SEC  Murphy takes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements I will now turn the call over to Roger Jenkins Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Kelly  Good morning  everyone  and thanks for listening to our call today  On Slide 2 throughout the course of  19 we successfully executed our corporate plan of producing oil weighted assets for our growing volumes within cash flow  generating higher return realizations and transform the company for a long term value as we continue to return capital to shareholders Our total capital for    our total production for the year averaged 173 000 barrels equivalent per day with 60  oil  we saw significant increases in production from our Eagle Ford Shale asset and Gulf of Mexico assets and are proud to be a top five Gulf of Mexico operator  Practically all of our oil production continues to be sold at a premium to WTI  West Texas Intermediate  and as a result  we generated  145 million of free cash flow in 2019  We use these funds in addition of proceeds from the sale of our Malaysia assets to return more than  660 million to shareholders through an ongoing quarterly dividend and significant share buyback program  We believe Murphy as a transformed company with great potential ahead as we continue to develop our Eagle Ford Shale  Canada and Gulf of Mexico assets with promising upside from our exploration programs in the Gulf of Mexico  Brazil and Mexico Most importantly  we announced today we ve executed a memorandum of understanding with ArcLight Capital Partners  regarding our 50  ownership in the King s Quay floating production system and are working definitive agreements regarding historical and future capital for the project  including reimbursement of approximately  125 million spent in 2019  To discuss in more detail our full 2020 capital plan after reviewing the fourth quarter and full year results Slide 3  Fourth quarter production averaged 194 000 barrel equivalents per day with 67  liquid volume  production impacts included non operated unplanned downtime of 1 900 barrels equivalent per day in the Gulf and the 1 000 barrel equivalents per day at Terra Nova in offshore Canada  as well as operated unplanned downtime of 1 500 barrel equivalent due to a subsea equipment malfunction at our Neidermeyer field in the Gulf of Mexico  This resulted in a five day impact on the three well field and one well remains down until repairs are complete by second quarter 2020 Regarding Terra Nova  we forecasted the field to remain down throughout 2020 to address safety equipment updates and complete the previously announced drydock work  This results in approximately a 2 000 barrel impact in offshore Canada production net to Murphy for all of 2020 and more than 3 000 equivalents per day for the first quarter of 2020 Eagle Ford Shale  production was negatively impacted by 3 600 barrel equivalent per day in the fourth quarter  due to well work    well workovers on high rate wells and Catarina  as well as a New East Tilden wells performing below historical Tilden wells  but producing below the forecast we used in the quarter  Overall  full year 2019 production averaged 173 000 equivalents per day was comprised of 67  liquids  specifically oil volumes grew 14  from full year  18 to more than 103 000 equivalents per day  due in part to the sale of gassier Malaysian assets  an addition of oil weighted Gulf of Mexico production Slide 4  our reserve base remain sizable in 2019 with the purchase of Gulf of Mexico assets partially offset    offsetting the sale of Malaysia properties mid year  Our total proved reserves at year end 2019 were 800 million equivalents per day with 57  liquids  And we maintain reserve life of nearly 12 years  Additionally  we increased our proved development classification to 57  of total reserves from 50  in 2018  Overall  our one year organic reserve replacement ratio was 172   while our three year F D cost is just under  13 per BOE I ll now turn the call over to David Looney for his commentary on the financial information David R  Looney    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Roger  and good morning everyone  For the fourth quarter Murphy s results were significantly impacted by a large  133 million non cash mark to market loss on our oil hedges  which averaged  56 42 on 45 000 barrels a day this year  Naturally  the recent decline in oil prices over the last 30 days has completely wiped out this loss  and in fact we would have a positive mark to market position at the close of business yesterday of approximately  56 million  largely as a result of this loss  we recorded a net loss of  72 million for the fourth quarter or a negative  0 46 per share However  when you adjust for this mark to market loss in a few other items  we earned  25 million in adjusted earnings or  0 16 per diluted share  The adjusted earnings back out not only the mark to market loss referred to above  but also a non cash increase in the value of contingent consideration and a loss due to the early extinguishment of debt  all three of which totaled approximately  138 million after tax Slide 6  a key component of Murphy strategy is to operate within cash flow with excess cash returned to shareholders through our quarterly dividend  As you can see on the slide  we achieved positive cash flow again for the full year 2019 even with the significant transactions completed earlier in the year  For the fourth quarter cash from operations totaled  336 million  while property additions and dry hole costs came in at  335 million resulting in a  1 million in positive free cash flow  I will note that this is after considering a working capital change that resulted in cash from operations being lower by  57 million In fiscal year 2019 on the whole  1 5 billion of cash from operations funded  1 3 billion of property additions  thereby achieving approximately  145 million of total free cash flow for the 12 month period  As announced on our third quarter call  we completed the  500 million share buyback program in October 2019  Also during the quarter  we extended our debt maturity profile with the issuance of  550 million of 5 875  senior notes due 2027  and used proceeds to tender and repurchase an aggregate of  521 million of senior notes due in 2022  Our financial strength and stable balance sheet are further exemplified by our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAX ratio of 1 5 times at the end of the fourth quarter Slide 7  Murphy strategy of focusing on high margin oil weighted assets continues to pay off is 95  of our oil volumes were again sold at a premium to WTI for the quarter  even with tightening differentials across the Gulf Coast markets  Our core Eagle Ford Shale and North American offshore assets continue to generate strong results with field level EBITDA per BOE of  31 and  30 per barrel in the quarter  respectively  These are clearly top notch assets and continue to drive our strong cash flow year in and year out Slide 8  a key tenet of Murphy strategy is continual return of cash to shareholders through our long standing quarterly dividend  along with strategic share buyback programs such as the  500 million program executed last year  This can only be accomplished through free cash flow generation  which we have done year after year  In all Murphy has returned nearly  4 billion of cash to its shareholders since 2012 through dividends and share repurchases with no equity issuances With that  I ll turn it back over to Roger Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  David  Slide 9 as we begin our 70th year as incorporated entity we re very proud of our strict internal governance  which supports our operations in overall financial stability  Our Board members have tremendous experience in industry  particularly with operations in HSE and with their guidance and support Murphy continually crafts responses to environmental safety issues  namely establishing in HSE Committee as far back as 1994  creating annual incentive plan compensation targets tied to environmental and safety performance several years ago  and issuing our first sustainability report in 2019  Murphy is recognized by ISS is one of the highest government scores and ranks 75  above our peer average On Slide 10  our Board of Directors in HSE Committee along with the company s leadership remain focused on climate change  safety and other operational effects on the environment  is a proud member of the environmental partnership Murphy monitors and tracks a variety of instant spill rates with internal targets  some of which are tied to compensation  Teams are encouraged to think beyond possible of proposing our deals for sustainable operations such as recycling 100  of our produced water at our Tupper Montney asset  testing the scalability of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions  long term with natural gas fueled frac pumps across our onshore portfolio  With our new portfolio  we anticipate a 50  reduction in emissions from 2018 to 2020 Now moving to Slide 12  the Eagle Ford Shale  With the addition of 18 wells coming online early in the fourth quarter production averaged 50 000 barrel equivalents with 77  oil  this production level represents an increase of more than 23  from the fourth quarter of  18  However given that no activity occurred in the last two months of the year production is anticipate to decline in the first quarter  as new wells will not have been placed online for now over 100 days  The 2019 program of 91 wells provides our onshore team ample runway to drive drilling and completion efficiencies  the refining well locations  rig timing and adjusting completion methods  As a result  our average cost improved to less than  6 million per well  Along with that our medium EUR well performance continues to improve in addition to the overall inter quartile range tightening considerably since 2016 Slide 13  since acquiring the Kaybob Duvernay acreage in  16  we now have more than 80 wells on operation across the asset  production remained essentially flat in the fourth quarter at 9 000 equivalents per day with 55  oil  For the year well performance exceeded expectations about nearly 20   we ve had several operational achievements in the area  with drilling and completing our lowest cost well at less than  6 3 million  drilling the fastest well to date in 12 days and drilling the longest lateral to date at more than 13 600 feet  As part of our continual improvement process Murphy has begun using bi fuel to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and diesel costs in the Kaybob Duvernay  this is already achieved a 30  reduction in emissions for this area Slide 14  our Tupper Montney asset produced 260 million cubic feet per day during the quarter  We re excited about our 2019 well results as they ve been trending and aligned with 24 Bcf type curves  an increase from the previous trend of 18 Bcf in 2018  Overall  we generated positive free cash flow in 2019 with an average realized price of CAD2 15 per Mcf Slide 16 in our Gulf of Mexico business Murphy is now on this newly expanded Gulf of Mexico portfolio for six months and in the fourth quarter this business generated 82 000 equivalents per day at 85  liquids  Throughout the quarter  we brought three wells online after completing tie in and workover activities  Additionally  as I mentioned earlier  we ve executed a memorandum of our understanding regarding the King s Quay floating production system Slide 17  our projects are moving along as planned in the Gulf  we re currently have a platform rig drilling a three well program at Front Runner as well as a drill ship conducting two back to back subsea workovers  in the first type of 2020  As we will detail these projects along with others listed in the slide bring additional volumes online to sustain our long term production rate as previously disclosed  Our major long term projects at Khaleesi   Mormont and Samurai are progressing nicely as well with subsea engineering and construction contracts recently awarded under budget Slide 19  for the first quarter 2020  we anticipate production of 181 000 to 193 000 equivalents per day accounting for natural declines and planned downtime  including more than 3 000 equivalents per day associated with Terra Nova remaining offline  Production of 190 000 to 202 000 at 60  of oil is forecast for the full year of 2020 based on the capital plan of  1 4 billion to  1 5 billion  Of that amount  approximately  1 2 billion of our budget is allocated to our assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and offshore And putting together our annual capital program  our primary focus is to generate excess cash flow to cover our dividend as we acquired new assets in the Gulf in 2019 there is one project to St  Malo waterflood  the required capital in the near term with production uplift expected in three years  This project impacted our capital allocation for 2020 as our dedication to cash flow capex parity led us to adjust our plan to ensure cash flow is protected  This allows us to continue our long standing dividend and maintain approximately 1 5 times net debt to EBITDA ratios Slide 20  as we discussed in previous quarters our five year plan the Gulf of Mexico achieves average production of approximately 85 000 equivalent  For 2020  our total capex of  440 million generates full year average production of 86 000 equivalents per day with six operated and five non operated wells coming online throughout the year  The 2020 project plan is a combination of platform rigs  workovers and tiebacks as detailed in the earlier slide  Overall  they will generate approximately  1 billion of operating cash flow this year Slide 21  based on the midpoint of our capex guidance  our onshore budget is expected to be  855 million with approximately 80  being allocated to the Eagle Ford Shale  We re excited to continue our more robust program in 2020 after having significantly decreased spending in the last few years as we maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation  The 97 operated wells coming online this year were primarily be focused in our Karnes and Catarina areas  In addition  we have an average 24  working interest and 59 gross non operated wells scheduled to come online through out the year  primarily in Karnes County Over the course of 2020  our Eagle Ford Shale production was steadily increased as planned  reaching the fourth quarter average of over 60 000 equivalents per day  This meaningful oil weighted growth brings us back to a level that we ve not experienced in several years  In Kaybob Duvernay  we plan to spend  125 million to bring online 16 operated wells as we fulfill our drilling carry early in the year  The Kaybob Duvernay is performing extraordinarily well across the board with exceptional results in drilling and completion efficiencies achieved In our prolific Tupper Montney  we re allocating  35 million to bring online five wells at this level of capital spend these wells generate free cash at approximately CAD1 60 AECO prices  The limited spend within free cash flow in this large resource is well placed in our portfolio as a part of global requirements for natural gas as a coal replacement long term and a lower carbon future Slide 22  our 2020 program fits nicely into our long term exploration goals  we plan to spend approximately  100 million and drill four wells  enabling us to target over  500 million of barrel equivalents of resources  On the US side of the Gulf  we hold a 12  non op working interest in the Mt  Ouray well  This prospect is expected to spud late in the second quarter  We re most excited about our two well program in Mexico  first  we plan to spud Cholula Appraisal well followed by new prospect targeting the first ever sub salt well in Mexico called Batopilas  Both wells are strategic in our future plans and by far Mexico  In Brazil we continue to mature several prospects  as well as plant    as well planning is ongoing  Our partner expects to spud the first well in early 2021 Slide 23  as you look at our plans over the next few years  I believe we ll be able to generate approximately  1 4 billion of free cash after our dividend  while delivering approximately 5  production CAGAR  all while maintaining 60  oil weighting  We ll achieve this by allocating on average about  1 3 billion of capital annually with this 1 4  to 1 5  being program in 2020  expect to be the highest year of capital spend  Over the next five years  our Gulf of Mexico asset will maintain average annual production of about 85 000 equivalents per day  and Eagle Ford Shale currently is forecasted to have 10  to 12  production CAGAR  As we planned our annual spend of  100 million of capital and exploration  which allows us to drill three to five wells per year  I m sure you ll agree this is a meaningful multi year program Slide 24  as we enter our 70th year as a corporation Murphy Oil is well positioned for the future after coming off another year of top quartile total shareholder return performance  compared to our peer group we ve achieved the 95 percentile ranking in total shareholder return over the past three years  Our newly transformed portfolio with exploration upside has a continued ability to deliver free cash flow above our competitive dividend yield In closing  I feel we ve successfully made a monumental shift as we transform Murphy into a Western Hemisphere Oil focused company  This positions us for long term value creation  I m especially proud to be one of the select companies to generate free cash flow and return dividend    significant dividends to our shareholders today  And we have the unique ability to create upside for our shareholders with continued strategic exploration programs  We re allocating capital to our high margin oil weighted assets to generate profitable growth  we re doing all this while keeping a keen eye on ways to continue operating sustainably in the future With that I d like to turn the call over to operator for questions and at that time  Thank you Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  Ladies and gentlemen  we will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  First question is from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Brian Singer    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you  Good morning Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Brian Brian Singer    Goldman Sachs    AnalystMy first question is on the Eagle Ford Shale  you highlighted in one of the slides  Slide 12  do you expect    or that you ve seen higher EURs from wells drilled in 2019  And I wondered if you could talk to what your expectations are in 2020 versus 2019 from a total in oil EUR perspective  What you see as the upside versus downside risks to achieving the growth path that would push production to 60 000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell Brian  we will see our continuation of that I m not sure on the same trajectory that we ve had in the past  we see this to be slightly improving with frac technology and great improvements our team has made  Also this year is just a totally different program than last year more weighted in Karnes and Catarina and less in Tilden area where we had some problems in the fourth quarter  But the Tilden area is nothing wrong with it at all  it was an idea of these Tilden wells were performing well above the EUR we have in our proven undeveloped reserves and then our long term plan  and we maintain that level and then it went back down to the level that we would have in the long term plan over a very limited number of wells in the fourth quarter The issue for capital allocation is a new very large partner BPX  which is actively drilling after their purchase of BHP in the Karnes area with some very nice up    lower Eagle Ford Shale wells and some very nice Austin Chalk wells  So they are replacing our typical capital allocation into Tilden and that we re drilling more core of core this year and a totally different risk profile than prior years in Tilden where we haven t drilled for several years  So we have confidence in achieving that because of the significance of our non operated program and a very large non operated program in the fourth quarter in which this year we had very limited spend in the last two months and own into today in Eagle Ford  Brian Brian Singer    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  Thank you  And then second is a couple of questions on the offshore  Can you talk to the trend that you re seeing on the cost side and upside versus downside risks there  And then separately realize the downtime and volatility is the normal part of operating anywhere  particularly in the offshore  but can you talk about how you re risking downtime in 2020 guidance given some of what we ve seen here recently Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  on the downtown picture there s two types of downtime in offshore environment  there s downtime associated with unplanned advance that happened to you from time to time  We ve typically and have this year of a 5  allowance in our production curves for unplanned downtime or that total downtime in our business  Actually in 2020 we have less planned downtime and the bigger allowance  compared to prior years of unplanned downtime  Well  it s hard to predict on occasion  Brian are the mechanical situations that happen on well such as subsea malfunction of these new assets  as I said earlier today we ve own these assets for six months and apparatus broke  if you will or an umbilical power and hydraulic carrying line and we had to spool that up and repair it  those are difficult to place into that level and a very rare in occurrence But from our overall downtown perspective we have this benchmarked and this is what we normally do and what we normally seen outside of one off events  And as we understand the subsea system better  we believe we have that at this time and have that confidently predicted  Also inside that downtime 5  is a good bit for the year of  Brian over 365 day period have been include a    excuse me seven day zero production in the Gulf for hurricane typically our barrels in the Gulf are never all completely off  I can t recall a time when the entire Gulf is off production  because we have different pipeline systems in different areas of operation  And I feel that it s appropriately risk as well And other risk we ve put into this  that significant as if your barrel counter is the Terra Nova asset was supposed to produce until May and go in for a six month dry dock and return in October and due to the unknown situation there we went ahead and put that in as a zero  So that would have changed our prior discussions of production  as new information  if this only happened on December 19th  So I think we have that well  you can go lowering zero  Brian  And then we put that in and we have our downtime manage with a lot of data in the Gulf and a long experience and now six months of learning the new subsea systems we purchased and we feel comfortable with what we have As a cost situation  Brian  There is going to be increase in day rates over the long haul  We do have that figured into our plans  I really don t like to discuss the rates we have on different rigs  But of course that will be increasing that  we ll need to increase I think for the providers of that service  we are seeing below budget on subsea equipment and subsea installation  which is overcoming most of that and we continue to have incredible efficiency on the large drill ships that are overtaking in any real issue about a day rate increase as it s about days on location at the end of the day  and the type of work we have at Khaleesi   Mormont is just set up for these dual activity rigs involving  completion and drilling simultaneously    simultaneous operations  and I m not concerned about costs in either of our businesses at this time  As I see efficiency eating up the increase in day rate and I currently  when we bid other equipment  it becomes lower in our offshore business Brian Singer    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  The next question is from Arun Jayaram at JPMorgan  Please go ahead Arun Jayaram    JPMorgan    AnalystYes  Roger  I was wondering if you could    yes  good morning  sir  I was wondering if you could elaborate on the broad structure of the King s Quay monetization  You guys have a very good strong balance sheet  I was wondering why this was an important strategic objective to get done  And maybe help us with what the terms could look like Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would consider our strongest strategic situation we ve done it was just an ability about  you know  the focus was on cash flow capex parity  One thing to know about these type of mid stream situations all of Malaysia was done in this way  All of the Thunder Hawk facility in the Gulf was done this way  All of our business is done by a major mid stream being owned by someone else  We ve operated this way for a very long time and this is just a continuation of that plan We cannot disclose the rates that we re paying across this facility  I would consider to be a very good mid stream rate  if you will  balancing which our balance sheet as you brought up makes that rate lower  because we ve different credit risks and other folks may be participating in this business  it became a matter of our St  Malo waterflood coming into our capital allocation  which is significant long term project  it s performing very well  And what would we do over the next three years with that  300 million of capital and maintain the CAGAR and growth that we had and we sought to financially yet    financial help on that one particular part of the project Project still a significant amount of capital for us and that we decided to take our ownership in that and financially form that out  if you will  and I m very happy with the right we have it naturally  I can t disclose that as it would tell what I will pay for mid stream in the future or a partner want that as well  But our overall opex of our company when this comes on line  we ll remain a nine or sub nine player and I feel from an overall perspective  this will not be seen in the financials  And I would also further say the cash flow in this stream of our long range plan is probably higher than the rate that we have  So I m comfortable with all that  Arun Arun Jayaram    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  And my follow up  Roger  is on the model  I was wondering  if you could help us think about how the higher workover activity in the Gulf of Mexico and potentially the Eagle Ford will impact your LOE guidance for 2020  I was wondering if you could also mention your thoughts on the oil price breakeven in  20 to cover the capex as well as the dividend Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  From an opex perspective  I anticipate our opex to be about the same this year as we had workover  Our opex in the fourth quarter was nearly  3 impacted by a single workover that we conducted in an operating expense manner at our Chinook well  of course that wells was came online at 13 000 barrels equivalent per day  almost all oil  And I would anticipate the workovers we have here  we have lower working interest in one of the workovers  and I don t see that being a major driver in differentiating our total opx for the year  but you could have quarterly increases as these wells are usually done in about within a month or two of work 45 days is quite typical  So that could be a bounce around in the quarter  but overall our opex for the year as a total company and our Gulf of Mexico business should be sustained Arun Jayaram    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerFrom perspective  you take the midpoint of guidance in our capex  which is of course our goal  And also last year  we hit that goal and we re under that goal from a cash flow spending on the cash flow statement  and I will only    we re at that goal on accrual basis  which is not all the way through cash at this time  of course  it s not our goal to use above that we do have a range for events that could take place  and now this oil price are clearly cannot go above the midpoint  If we look at the strip today with the recent virus impacts on oil pricing  we would probably need  55 there s no problem  but if you looked at the current strip  we d probably have to go in the low end of our capex guidance of  1 4 billion to the  1 45 midpoint and get in the middle of that in order to achieve to cover the dividend And when we do that we have some opportunities available that should not impact production as to some timing in various parts of the company that have preferred to disclose at a later time  But our goal is to cover it  our goal is to cut it if we need to  and be mindful of this  of course  our hedging as David mentioned earlier is helping us there in that regard and it s included in what I said  So  55 WTI average for the year  which I still think is very achievable  It is not a problem at all  And in the 53 world  you re only talking about  20 million   30 million of capex to handle that  Arun Arun Jayaram    JPMorgan    AnalystThanks for the color  Roger Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  The next question is from Leo Mariani from KeyBanc  Please go ahead Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Leo Leo Mariani    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey  good morning  I wanted to follow up a little bit on the Eagle Ford here  certainly noticed you guys had some workover downtime in the fourth quarter  just looking at your first quarter Eagle Ford production guidance  it looks to be down roughly 15  versus 4Q  I know you talked a lot about well timing  Just wanted to kind of get a sense of whether or not there are also ongoing workovers in the first quarter of  20  kind of  impacting that production and then maybe you could just speak a little bit to this production  sort of  cadence throughout the year  I know you mentioned the 60 000 in the fourth quarter  should we see a pretty steady ramp in 2Q and 3Q  so just maybe help me out a little bit on some of the directionality on the Eagle Ford here Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerI m going to have Eric take that for you  Leo Eric M  Hambly    Executive Vice President  OnshoreThanks  Leo  So in the fourth quarter  we did have some impact from more well work on higher rate wells than typical when we have sort of routine artificial lift repair work across Eagle Ford  we saw a similar level of activity  but we happen to have more downtime related to higher rate wells more of the 300 to 400 barrel a day wells  instead of the 40  50  60 barrel a day wells  So that was sort of an abnormal bit  We did have some new wells come online in September in Catarina that had a fair bit of downtime that we went out and did some sand clean out work on those  those wells have now all but about one has returned to normal production rates  So from that workover activity in Catarina  we re probably seeing about 500 or 600 barrels a day of lingering impact from that as we head into January  The rest of the field is sort of in line like normal In the East Tilden wells  which Roger highlighted underperformed our forecast  but exceeded prior expectations from wells from 2015 and earlier  Those wells impacted our quarter by a little over 700 barrels per day  The impact of that in the early part of 2020 is about 1 000 barrels a day  and that impact will decline through the year  So we are seeing a little overhang at the early part of the year  We expected to have natural decline in the Eagle Ford with our well cadence wrapping up  mostly in September and in October of last year  our new online well delivery this year  our execution of our drilling and completion program has been going very well  We do have a program of wells coming online that in the first quarter resembles what it looked like in the first quarter of 2019  And then a little bit more waiting in the later part of the second quarter for our operated Karnes wells coming online  So it s slightly later ramp up of new wells in second quarter then you saw in 2019  But then a strong push for the rest of the year with more higher IP wells in Catarina and Karnes contributing late in the second quarter and third quarter and a big push of non operated Karnes wells in the fourth quarter of 2020 Leo Mariani    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Very helpful color  So it certainly sounds like it s pretty back half weighted on the Eagle Ford growth in  20 here Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerIt will always be that way  Leo  When you stop spending at the end of the year to front end load capital  which is going to become a common thing in Shale  We re not just Murphy  It s harder to do it that way Eric M  Hambly    Executive Vice President  OnshoreOur program in 2020 has 14 wells coming online very late at the end of the year in Karnes  So we have a more steady well delivery in 2020  compared to 2019  So we should exit the year on a high instead of on a downward trend with natural decline  So a little bit different look this year of our program Leo Mariani    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  that s good color for sure   And I guess  just wanted to follow up a little bit on sort of the kind of the next couple of years in terms of how you guys are thinking about the outlook  I know you said that 2020 is the high for capex  I mean  it sounds like that kind of comes down here  you know  into  21  I know you guys talked about the 85 000 BOE per day in the Gulf of Mexico  But as I kind of looked at your slides and seeing some of the tie in schedules  Just wanted to get a sense  it looked like there weren t a lot of wells in the Gulf coming on until late in the year in  21  So should we expect Gulf production to go down a little bit in  21 and then go up a lot in  22 is Khaleesi and Mormont come on anything you can sort of say to that Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThis year  would be a high watermark of production over the next couple of years in the Gulf  but not much significant decline nearly  of these wells are pretty high rate wells when you see them on this chart also not highlighted here  The non op wells  so it s just Kodiak in which we enjoy a large working interest there  one of our more profitable fields with incredible positive gifts  Very confident in averaging this  I would say the capital to deliver this is probably below prior guidance  And we have significant wells coming on here in this list and also in the non op both at St  Malo and Kodiak and as    and Lucius as well  So the non op is not highlighted here  but very confident about our long term production profile of this 85 goal and less capex toward the end of the planning period Leo Mariani    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  OK  So  yes  it sounds like there is a number of other wells just on in the slides that are going to help to back fill some of that  Okay that makes sense Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd these wells are very high production  Leo  with various working interest  but these are high rate wells we deal with here Leo Mariani    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  No  that s helpful  And I guess maybe just lastly on the exploration  On your Slide 22  just wanted to see if we get a little bit more color on some of these prospects coming up later in the year in terms of what you thought potentially would be at Batopilas or the well that you re going to be I guess testing in early  21 in Brazil  just trying to get a sense of what kind of the gross recoverable targets are in those wells Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I mean we    to disclose these type of matters requires many  many partner approvals and therefore we do not have here  I mean  typically in the Gulf of Mexico  you d anticipate in the exploration well to be a 75 million barrel plus type opportunity  those are what we re always targeting there  In our Cholula area in Mexico  we had a discovery there last year was disclosed  and that was a crestal position well with good bit of oil that is    had flat spots if you will  and we need to come off that structure into a thicker reservoir in one of the wells  who did not have a water level in the zone  and that we ve done a lot of seismic work there and also a very nearby opportunity with an ideal seismic response to all the structure of the Cholula well  And in that kind of area from that well and the nearby opportunity that s identical to it  same age depth next door  if you will  these are 100 million barrel type of things that we re derisking in that pretty large area So we have two businesses in Mexico right now  one is a middle Miocene small tieback zone in the 100 million barrel range Northeast of the Talos discovery that we can easily add to and add on to very similar to what we do in the Gulf  And there s Batopilas well is a large well above  160 million equivalents of size and it s a very large Miocene structure underneath salt  And so those opportunities  and of course  our Sergipe Alagoas basin  we re not disclosing the size of those opportunities  which you can anticipate something like that with the partner that we have to be quite large  And hopeful for those to be large and there you go with the above 500 and that s all we can say about it  Again a typical well in the Gulf 75  we re touching a good bit of  close to 100 and beyond in the Gulf    in the Mexico region with these type of very expense  Indecipherable  of wells  treat wells  in fact  And then a big future opportunity for us in Brazil that we re very excited about  But have limited disclosure at this time Leo Mariani    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thank you for the color Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  The next question is from Gail Nicholson from Stephens  Please go ahead Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Gail OperatorGail your line is open  You may go ahead with your question Gail Nicholson    Stephens    AnalystSorry  I was on mute  I apologize  Good morning  Roger Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Gail Nicholson    Stephens    AnalystTwo questions  I think the market doesn t fully appreciate the benefit of St  Malo really post the  24 timeframe  Can you just  kind of  talk about how the production looks once it comes online in  23 and then how that scope forward and how long    the longevity of those volumes in the system Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerMike s going to handle that for you this morning  Gail right here Michael K  McFadyen    Executive Vice President  OffshoreGood morning  Gail  St  Malo comes on late  23 early  24 kind of peaks  it adds over 5 000 barrels a day net production to our offshore portfolio and adds about 32 million barrels of reserves our share and significant NPV  NPV in  150 million to  160 million range with about an 18  to 20  rate of return at  55 flat oil  So it s significant and comes on at a good time for our offshore portfolio Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd last for a very long time Michael K  McFadyen    Executive Vice President  OffshoreYes Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell into 2050 Gail Nicholson    Stephens    AnalystGreat  And then on 2019 Gulf of Mexico had some very healthy differentials  Can you guys just provide some color on how you guys are viewing GOM differentials in 2020 Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think that the differential picture in the Gulf has been much better than forecasted from an IMO 2020 perspective that was really hasn t been a major impact  The diffs are lower than they were in parts of  19  Today  in our Mars business where we mark off of Mars in the Gulf of Mexico  these would be all of the assets we purchased from Petrobras  as well as our older Medusa and front runner feels  It s about 36  of our production  these diffs are clearly over  1 year to date  the February diff and that s  1 40 positive  some CHOPS has forecasted to be below dollar negative  in fact  And that we see this to be much better than originally thought In HLS in the Gulf  around 21   this is some very  very high margin crudes around our Kodiak non op well and all of our LLOG business we bought and the dalmatian field that we have and be working over soon quarter four  there was a  4 positive and now we re clearly in the 350 positive range there  and I feel good about that  Another nice situation for us is Magellan East Houston  MEH which represents 33  of our old liquids coming out  Eric s business in Eagle Ford  And this two have been about a  3 40 or  3 40 positive to WTI basis in which we mark the crew  So overall  we re still to be positioned and I believe when you look at transportation and the realized price of our company  and where our barrels are located  We will always be positive to almost any peer  because the unique nature of where we re selling these barrels and very happy about the deals that we have  we think it s a competitive advantage And so why we added our Gulf business and allocate more capital to our Eagle Ford business  If you have the higher prices  you ll always have advantage Gail Nicholson    Stephens    AnalystGreat  thank you Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Gail OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And next question is from Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank  Please go ahead Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystHey  guys Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Paul Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystIf you have to adjust the capex should we assume it is only in Eagle Ford or that you will also adjust in other areas Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  as again I d prefer not to disclose this at this time  We have some field development plan approval payments in Vietnam that are part of our plan  which if you make that milestone that can be delayed  and we are seeing some different costs and some exploration at the end of the year  We re trying to make those reductions naturally where we do not adjust our very high return capital allocation to workovers and tie backs in the Gulf  nor change our rig schedule in the Eagle Ford at this time  I feel comfortable we can do that and we will  if we need to do it we ll do it Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystNice  And in Brazil have you guys already identify what is the well you re going to drill next year    early next year Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWhere is that again  Paul I missed that Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystIn Brazil   Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe have a good idea    we have good idea of it of course  but we re dealing with a large partner there  And I think you could go back and monitor their disclosure on another super large project there in over time  and you would anticipate a similar disclosure here as well Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  So you were not be able to give us a    maybe a peak drill target or anything related at this point Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe will  as we get toward the end of the year  I would imagine  but it will be nice one Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  And when you say early next year  Are we talking about the beginning of the first quarter  What   Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  The rig plan there is involved with permits and the schedule of our partners  well involving some other blocks that they have  And I anticipate it to be early in  21 at this time  Yes  sir Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  And are we talking about a 60  90 days well  I m trying to understand that when   Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would imagine so  yes  probably 90 Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    Analyst90 days  So probably sometime in the second quarter for the result Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat s possible  Yes  Paul Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  And that may be that I missed it  Wonder when you re saying that you re not going to have any well coming on stream in the Eagle Ford for the next 100 days Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  no  no  that s from the time we put a well on in early October and we re going to have some wells flowing Saturday  So it s been a long time Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOh I see  I see  And but that for   Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat capital allocation of our front end loaded Shale program impacts and we overstated production above our typical EUR  we got burned for that in the fourth quarter  Now we have that issue on top of a long term planned front end loaded project  We ve been drilling with three rigs there starting right at the end of the year  And we re bringing on a significant 10 well pad here pretty quick and feel good about our guidance and what we re doing there Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystSo why the first quarter  we are not going to see any well coming on stream Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe are  Paul  We re starting this    we re starting Saturday morning  It s been a while  what I m trying to say is it s hard in a Shale play to and you ll find that rare to not put a well on in a 100 days and but we re back clicking and adding wells throughout the quarter and we have significant cadence of wells building  as Erik described earlier in the call Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  and final one from me  can you give us some    what is the East Tilden  the well performance in the fourth quarter that you re talking about  And what was the corporate forecast that you guys use  And have you already adjust that forecast or do you think the East Tilden well in the fourth quarter were an anomaly and your capex forecast is still  OK Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerEric will answer that for you  Paul Eric M  Hambly    Executive Vice President  OnshoreSure  Paul  So the East Tilden wells  we brought those wells online their IP30s were basically in line with our forecast  They re not the exact number  but somewhere around 800 BOE per day average for the eight wells  So they look really good for about 30 days after that we started to see a steepening decline  So the    as I mentioned  heading into January the gap between our prior forecast and the current production performance for the total of the eight wells was about 1 000 BOE per day  and we expect that gap will be there  but it will decline through the year as the expectation prior declines like wells always do Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystThat s it  Thank you OperatorThank you  The next question is from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James  Please go ahead Pavel Molchanov    Raymond James    AnalystThanks for taking the question  One of the point you made in your  kind of  intro is you ve reshaped the asset base to be a Western Hemisphere pure play  But you still have the Vietnam exploration and it feels like it s a little bit of an afterthought at this point  So I m curious what the logic is for retaining those assets Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerThere s significant upside in those assets  We have a significant discovery there that we ll be bringing online  we re currently doing feed  and we ll be having field development plan approval there through the government    the government there were so slow  And we    with our capital allocation have not been rushing them if you will  It s a very unique situation  We just added another block with a one well commitment  we have a series of prospects that are low risk drilled by jack ups and allows us all type of upside  but at this particular time with the capital allocation of having a limited CAGAR and free cash flow and building a business with significant free cash flow  It has been slowed in the first couple of years for our business  but we will be definitely drilling there next year  and this is a sleeper for us that s significant and allows us all type of flexibility involving different parts of our business going forward So like Vietnam  have a very unique position  a very inexpensive entry position  a very nice discovery there  there will be    being put into our long range plan it s inside what we ve disclosed here and very excited about it  Just not being a large capital there this year for all those reasons that we read about every day Pavel Molchanov    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  one more exploration question  if I recall  I think it was five or six years ago you made efforts to do some drilling in Suriname  one of the first  I think  international E Ps to do that  And then that kind of fizzled the way now  of course  we re seeing Suriname headlines on a seemingly daily basis  I m curious  if you have any interest in revisiting opportunities in that emerging geography Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe re interested in all opportunities in the Hemisphere in which we focus  which is South America  Gulf of Mexico proper and Mexico offshore where we have a significant block and we ve recently added in Brazil another segment in Portiguar Basin  Those wells we were drilling so many years ago  we re totally different play  a totally different time  We    as you know  have been a global explore  but we re trying to focus in on having more information and more focused in on data and just the basins in which we work  Just because we haven t participated  it doesn t mean we haven t looked there and the price of poker there was above what we wanted to do  And also on occasion in a country like that it sounds simple  but when you see the different agreements that you agreed to  to look at someone s day will be very limiting you in a business development perspective going forward  And in some of those places we re unable to make an agreement that we would prefer to work in  So we look in this region  we re not against working there  but haven t found an opportunity that we would like to participate and where we can add significant shareholder value Pavel Molchanov    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  appreciate it OperatorThank you  There are no further questions   Roger W  Jenkins    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  We have no more questions today and that will end our call today  We appreciate everyone for listening in  and we ll see you at our next quarterly result  Thank you so much Operator

169226,390742,MUR,U S  diplomats face tough task imposing new Iran oil curbs,news,By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    By restoring sanctions against Iran  U S  President Donald Trump s has tasked a little known State Department office with convincing companies and governments worldwide to cut imports of Iranian crude   even if that means paying more to buy oil from other suppliers  The Bureau of Energy Resources got the job done during the Iran sanctions that spanned 2012 to 2015  when President Barack Obama had the cooperation of European leaders in choking off Iran s main revenue source to pressure it to curb its nuclear program  This time around  the office faces steeper challenges  Europe s leaders now oppose Trump s aggressive stance on Iran and are considering ways to block the sanctions  the U S  Senate has yet to confirm a leader for the bureau  and the State Department already has its hands full managing sanctions on Venezuela  trade disputes with China  and looming talks with North Korea   It s going to be a lot harder this time   said Amos Hochstein  who led the bureau under President Obama  when diplomats from the United States  Iran  China  France  Russia  the United Kingdom and Germany formed the 2015 nuclear deal   There s going to be a lot less good will    Under Trump s renewed sanctions  foreign firms will have 180 days to make reductions or face penalties that can include fines and restrictions on doing business in the United States  Washington can identify the buyers  sellers  traders  shippers  insurers and financial institutions involved in Iranian oil purchases because all foreign transactions in U S  dollars are cleared by the Federal Reserve  The work is harder if trades are done in other currencies  The United States has banned Iranian oil imports to its own shores for decades  so Washington s ability to squeeze the exports will rely on convincing foreign governments and companies to pressure the Islamic Republic back to the negotiating table for a  better deal    as Trump has said he expects  Officials at the Department of Treasury  the Department of Commerce and the White House did not respond to a request for comment on the difficulty in managing oil curbs on Iran  When asked about the challenges  energy bureau spokesman Vincent Campos said the office  will carry out sanctions policy in the current environment   If successful  sanctions would slash exports from one of the top suppliers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and likely raise prices for crude globally by forcing buyers to compete for alternative supplies  U S  oil prices have already vaulted over  70 a barrel to highs not seen since 2014   O R  EUROPEAN RESISTANCE Under Obama and Hochstein  Iran s exports of oil plummeted from about 2 5 million barrels per day  bpd  to less than 1 3 million bpd  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration   Imposing those cuts was difficult  even with more geopolitical backing  Teams from the bureau joined with colleagues from the Departments of Treasury and Commerce to visit governments in Asia and the Middle East  cajoling them into finding alternatives to Iranian oil  and to help battle smuggling  The European Union joined the United States and passed its own Iran sanctions in 2012  cutting its imports of Iranian oil from 650 000 bpd to zero  This time  European leaders will be less helpful  They have urged Trump not to leave the nuclear deal  which they say was hard won and has proven to be an effective tool preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon  The European Union  meanwhile  is considering a so called  blocking statute  that would ban any EU company from complying with the U S  sanctions  French President Emmanuel Macron warned before Trump s announcement that if Washington pulls fully out of the deal  it could start a war  The leaders of Germany  England  and Russia have also expressed dismay   and are scrambling to salvage the accord after Washington s exit  A State Department official told reporters in a briefing Tuesday that no U S  diplomats had yet engaged with any private sector energy companies about cutting their Iranian purchases but that energy bureau staff would  move out immediately  to do so  Sources with three global trading houses involved in Iranian oil purchases said they expected Iran s customers to ask for waivers under the U S  sanctions  Some Asian governments  including South Korea  India and China  are also hoping they can avoid the brunt of the sanctions by acquiring waivers   which the U S  government has said it will only consider granting if a country shows a good faith effort to cut Iranian purchases  GRUNT WORK The job facing the bureau on Iran sanctions will require strong leadership and a robust workforce  according to three former State Department officials who worked on sanctions   But the State Department s energy bureau is embarking on this difficult work without a permanent leader and with some vacancies in the mid level ranks from a hiring freeze and transfers   Trump s nominee to head the bureau  Francis Fannon   a former head of corporate affairs at BHP Billiton  LON BLT  and senior director of  Murphy Oil Corp   NYSE MUR    awaits Senate confirmation  The bureau is currently being managed by a special envoy  John Marrick  a former corporate lawyer and energy advisor for Republican John McCain s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign  A State Department inspector general report said in 2016 that 81 people worked full time at the bureau  Campos declined to say how many worked there now  but said the teams managing sanctions on Iran and Venezuela are fully staffed  Bob McNally  former President George W  Bush s top energy adviser  said the State Department is  fully able  to make the sanctions work but the administration still needs to define its goals  The sanctions imposed under the Obama administration were threatened by smuggling of Iranian oil  by crews shutting off tracking devices on tankers  mixing Iranian oil into tankers of non Iranian oil and other methods  Energy bureau officials controlled that problem through close coordination with other U S  agencies  embassies abroad and local law enforcement  the former State Department officials said  The bureau also needs to determine how much it wants companies to reduce Iranian oil imports  which requires deft diplomacy and an analysis of historical buying trends  The previous administration avoided telling countries percentages it wanted them to cut and allowed some countries to buy more than others  but countries ended up cutting purchases about 18 to 20 percent   There is a lot more that goes on in the everyday grunt work than  bluntly  I think this administration understands   Richard Nephew  who served as the lead sanctions expert for the team that negotiated the Obama administration s 2015 deal with Iran  said in an interview  Another key priority will be to set a clear requirement for the lifting of sanctions  In 2012  the sanctions were designed to end once Iran agreed to specific limits on its nuclear program  This time there s less clarity  Hochstein said    Countries never want to be told what to do with their economy   said Hochstein   At least before it was toward a specific end  Now it s open ended   Trump said on Wednesday that Iran would now either negotiate to alter the 2015 deal  or  something will happen

169262,390778,MUR,Key employment dispute leaves Supreme Court divided,news,By Lawrence Hurley and Robert Iafolla WASHINGTON  Reuters    Liberal U S  Supreme Court justices on Monday defended the right of workers to bring class action claims against companies but their conservative counterparts who are in the majority sounded skeptical in the biggest business case of the court s new term  A win for employers would give the green light to an already growing trend in which companies require workers to sign arbitration agreements waiving their right to bring class action claims either in court or before private arbitrators  About 25 million workers are already bound by such agreements  according to the left leaning Economic Policy Institute think tank   The nine justices heard roughly an hour of arguments in the case on the first day of their new nine month term  They also heard arguments in an immigration dispute  and have a series of major cases lined up in the coming months regarding voting rights  religious liberty  union funding and other issues   L2N1M81Y3  Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said he was worried that a ruling against the workers would imperil  the entire heart of the New Deal   laws and programs enacted in the 1930s under President Franklin Roosevelt to help workers during the Great Depression    I haven t seen a way that you can  in fact  win the case  which you certainly want to do  without undermining and changing radically what has gone back to the New Deal   Breyer told Paul Clement  a lawyer representing the employers  Employers have increasingly required employees to sign waivers to guard against a rising tide of worker lawsuits seeking unpaid wages  Class action litigation can result in large damages awards by juries and is harder for businesses to fight than cases brought by individual plaintiffs  Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the ability of workers to join together to bring claims against an employer was the  driving force  behind a key federal law enacted to regulate labor disputes  Many cases involve claims that  if brought on their own  would represent such a minor dollar amount that they may not be worth pursuing because of legal bills alone  Ginsburg added   That s why this is truly a situation where there is strength in numbers   Ginsburg said  The court has a 5 4 conservative majority but two of the five conservative justices were silent  Republican President Donald Trump s appointee to the court  Neil Gorsuch  and Clarence Thomas  who typically does not speak during oral arguments    FORGET IT  Justice Anthony Kennedy  often the swing vote in major cases  asked questions that signaled sympathy to employers  as did two fellow conservatives  Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito  Kennedy indicated that a loss for workers would not prevent them from acting in concert because they would still be able to join together to hire the same lawyer to bring claims  even though the claims would be arbitrated individually  That would provide  many of the advantages  of collective action  Kennedy said  If the workers win   it seems to me quite rational for many employers to say   Forget it  we don t want arbitration at all    Kennedy said  The three consolidated cases that came before the justices involved professional services firm Ernst   Young LLP ERNY UL   gas station operator Murphy Oil  NYSE MUR  USA Inc MOUI UL  and healthcare software company Epic Systems Corporation  The Trump administration sided with companies  contending that the agreements are valid  In a rare occurrence  the administration faced off against an independent agency of the federal government  the National Labor Relations Board  NLRB   The Justice Department in June reversed the government s previous position taken in the case under Democratic former President Barack Obama  deciding not to defend the NLRB s stance that these employment agreements were invalid  None of the justices addressed the flip flop on Monday  Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Wall said the NLRB made a  pretty radical move  five years ago when it claimed a worker s legally protected right to act together to improve the workplace included the right to class action lawsuits  Federal labor law does not stretch so far that it prevents a court from enforcing an agreement to bring claims against employers in individual arbitration  Wall added   You can be protected from dismissal for retaliation when you seek class treatment up to the courthouse doors or the doors of an arbitral forum  but once you re inside  you don t have an entitlement to proceed as a class   Wall said  The NLRB argues that the waivers violate federal labor law and let companies evade their responsibilities under workplace statutes  Workers have fought back against the waivers  arguing that the cost of pursuing their cases individually in arbitration is prohibitively expensive  A ruling is expected by the end

169313,390829,MUR,New Total boss must overhaul exploration strategy  pursue cost cuts,news,"By Michel Rose PARIS  Reuters    The sudden death of Total s top executive may make it even trickier for the French oil major to overhaul its expensive exploration strategy while simultaneously cutting costs to please shareholders as oil prices fall 
Total had recently taken the unusual step of naming an outsider to devise a new strategy after a costly three year drive to increase drilling spending failed to yield significant results   the main blot on Christophe de Margerie s legacy 
It had also started to cut capital expenditure after years of record high investments  under pressure from shareholders demanding bigger payouts 
With Brent crude now around  85  executing this plan becomes even more critical  and investors are hoping that the group has a plan of action following de Margerie s death 
 We have the feeling that a group like Total has the organization in place to deal with an emergency situation  and this is an emergency situation   said Renaud Murail  a fund manager at Barclays Bourse  who is advising clients to buy Total shares 
The company had been officially planning to take stock of its exploration strategy next year  Total raised its exploration budget by 12 percent between 2012 and 2014 in what it called a  high risk  high reward  strategy to find new sources of oil   but about 40 percent of wells drilled in 2012 were dry  and that proportion rose to almost 60 percent last year  according to company figures 
Insiders say a major re think is already underway  and analysts are hoping the arrival of Kevin McLachlan  an executive from one of the nimbler oil firms Murphy Oil  as head of exploration  will herald a more entrepreneurial spirit 
Big oil firms like Total have struggled to replicate the success of Murphy Oil or Tullow  another independent oil exploration firm  because of their complex decision making process and their more risk adverse culture 
That s not something likely to change overnight  one analyst warned 
 I don t think there s a kind of magic solution  that when you bring in a new head of exploration you suddenly start finding   said Anish Kapadia  at Tudor Pickering Holt Energy 
COST CUTS AND ASSET SALES
However  de Margerie had been praised for initiating a reduction in capital spending earlier than many rivals  delivering on a  30 billion assets sale program since 2010   one of the most ambitious sell off programs in the industry alongside BP s  50 billion sell off plan   and announcing a new cost cutting drive 
That boosted Total s share price and helped its valuation catch up with European peers after years at a discount   the French firm had been struggling to shake off a reputation for setting over ambitious oil production targets and failing to meet them 
Total is now valued at 9 5 times 12 month forward earnings  in line with BP s  L BP  9 4 and Shell s  L RDSa  9 6 forward P E ratios  but below U S  peers Chevron  N CVX  at 11 1 and ExxonMobil s  N XOM  at 12 7 
 In terms of capex reduction  the recent cost cutting program  they re always the first movers  and that s something investors like   Ahmed Ben Salem  an analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris said 
The group s asset sale program  key to maintain acceptable dividends for investors  is also likely to progress smoothly despite de Margerie s death  analysts said 
 You re talking about a very well run company  very methodical  it s a good machine  It took them a while to decide on asset disposals but now that the list is clear  they will execute it very well   said a Paris based banker who spoke on condition of anonymity because he knows Total well 
SUCCESSORS
On the domestic front  de Margerie s successor will have to deal with a politically sensitive situation  the group s promise  made in 2010  to avoid closing down refineries in France for five years comes to an end next year 
Patrick Pouyanne  the head of refining  told worried unions earlier this year that the group would unveil its strategy for its loss making French refining industry in the spring 
He added that it would not shut down sites completely but would seek to cut capacity  The company will be hoping to avoid a repeat of its problems in 2010 when Total s decision to close down the Dunkirk refinery entirely prompted weeks of strikes by angry unions and disrupted French oil supplies 
Pouyanne s forthcoming key role would seem to favor his ascent to the top job  some observers said 
  Pouyanne  has already made great strides in improving the financial performance of his business unit  whilst he also has an extensive E P  exploration and production  background  both clear qualifications for the role   BMO analyst Iain Reid said 
Philippe Boisseau  at the helm of the group s new energies unit  and Arnaud Breuillac from the exploration and production branch  are also seen as possible successors 
However there is no guarantee that de Margerie s successor will walk into the same job he left  In previous periods of transition the group has split the chairman and chief executive roles   de Margerie himself served as CEO for three years under the chairmanship of Thierry Desmarest 
De Margerie had said the board would prefer an insider to succeed him   traditional among top investor controlled oil groups   in order to ensure a smoother process 
But if the company does not lack good managers  it will find it hard to replace its former leader s larger than life personality and extensive contact book 
 The way the oil industry is these days with its ups and downs  nobody can replace him   a close friend and adviser told Reuters last year 

 This fabric of international relationships he has is fundamental   There are perhaps seven or eight bosses in the world who have that  His potential successors are not ready

Murphy Oil shares have lost about 15 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for Murphy Oil 
While Murphy Oil has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Murphy Oil was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

169665,391181,MUR,Will Murphy Oil  MUR  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Murphy Oil  MUR   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this oil and gas producer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 40 15   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Murphy Oil was expected to post earnings of  0 22 per share  but it reported  0 36 per share instead  representing a surprise of 63 64   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 18 per share  while it actually produced  0 21 per share  a surprise of 16 67  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Murphy Oil lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Murphy Oil currently has an Earnings ESP of  40 76   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 30  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

169692,391208,MUR,Earnings Preview  Murphy Oil  MUR  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Murphy Oil  MUR  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 20 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  42 9  
Revenues are expected to be  719 75 million  up 6 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 20 64  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Murphy Oil 
For Murphy Oil  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Murphy Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Murphy Oil would post earnings of  0 18 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 21  delivering a surprise of  16 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

169716,391232,MUR,Go Beyond Bargains  Play 5 Stocks With Rising P E Instead,opinion,"Stocks with low P E or bargain stocks are always investors  favorites as the ratio indicates undervaluation  This ratio is obtained by dividing a stock s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings  It measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings 
So  the golden rule is   the lower the P E of a stock  the higher its value for investors  This is because value investors believe that a stock s current market price is not reflective of its historical future earnings and therefore chances of outperformance are higher 
Naturally  there are very few investors who pay attention to stocks with an increasing P E  But this often overlooked trend can prove worthwhile in finding great stocks  Let s dig a little deeper 
Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal   
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  You can see  
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 28 
Here are five out of the 28 stocks 
AAR Corp     NYSE AIR     This is an independent provider of aviation services to commercial and government customers  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 18

169721,391237,MUR,Comstock To Snap Up Cover Park To Boost Haynesville Acreage,opinion,In a bid to bolster Haynesville acreage  Comstock Resources Inc    NYSE CRK   is set to acquire Dallas based Cover Park Energy LLC  a privately held company  for  2 2 billion  The combined entity will have substantial scale advantage with attractive organic growth opportunities  going forward Amid weak gas prices  many of the companies operating in the Haynesville play exited the region in favor of more lucrative Marcellus shale  wherein gas is closer to the surface and therefore easily accessible  However  with superior drilling technologies on the rise and higher gas demand  Haynesville has started making a comeback  as is evident from a 22  year over year increase in output from the region Comstock s major position in the prolific Haynesville Bossier shale play complements Cover Park s properties  strengthening the former s foothold in the region  Deal DetailsThe cash and stock transaction  which is valued at  2 2 billion  includes the assumption of Covey Park s outstanding debt and retirement of the existing preferred units  aggregating  1 1 billion  Per the deal  equity owners of Covey Park will receive  700 million in cash  28 8 million shares of newly issued shares of Comstock stock at  6 apiece and  210 million of newly issued perpetual convertible preferred stock Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones  who is the top shareholder of Comstock Resources  will invest  475 million in cash  as part of the deal  In exchange for his cash infusion  Jerry Jones will receive  50 million newly issued shares of Comstock at  6 apiece and  175 million of newly issued shares of perpetual convertible preferred stock  The latest cash infusion by Jerry Jones brings his total investment in the company to  1 1 billion  Post the deal s completion  he would own a 75  stake in the firm  retaining the title of Comstock s largest shareholder  Private equity giant Denham Capital will be the second largest shareholder of the company  holding a 16  interest The agreement has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both the companies  Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and other regulatory approvals  the deal is set for closure within Jul 31  2019 Post the completion of the deal  Comstock s board will include John Jacobi  Co CEO of Covey Park  and Denham Capital Managing Partner Jordan Marye Deal MotiveIts complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal  The buyout will integrate the premier assets of both the companies  thereby bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region  Markedly  the Covey Park takeover would make Comstock the largest natural gas producer in the Haynesville region While the company s acreage was initially limited to Caspiana core in the Haynesville shale play  the deal would expand the firm s position in the Carthage sweet spot and Shelby Trough The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise in the region and share their best practices  thereby enhancing buying power in securing services in the region Deal BenefitsThe deal adds 248 830 acres of complementary holdings to Comstock s Haynesville Bossier portfolio  expanding the total acreage of the company in the Haynesville Bossier shale play to 293 216 net acres  Post the acquisition  total net acreage of the firm will be 373 935 net acres  with 1 999 drilling locations  Comstock s proved reserves will more than double from 2 4 trillion cubic feet equivalent  Tcfe  to 5 4 Tcfe  On being the No 1 producer in the Haynesville play  the company will have an output capacity of more than 1 1 billion cubic feet equivalent per day The strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial  financial and operational synergies  owing to integration of assets  systems and staff  The deal is expected to result in annual overhead savings of  25 million and free cash flow generation of  75  100 million in 2020 Final ThoughtsOther explorers like Chesapeake Energy   NYSE CHK    Encana Corporation   NYSE ECA   and Murphy Oil   NYSE MUR    which were once majorly gas weighted  have slowly started pumping more oil to gain from the rebounding crude prices  However  Comstock has shifted deeper into gas  as is reflected by crude output that accounted for 9  of the firm s total production in 2018 versus 39  in 2014 Although this merger appears to tick all the right boxes on paper  stubbornly weak gas prices and Comstock s elevated leverage and high proportion of undeveloped reserves raise questions over the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s target of generating free cash flows in 2020  You can see  Will you retire a Millionaire  One out of every six people

169725,391241,MUR,Earnings Preview  Murphy Oil  MUR  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Murphy Oil  MUR  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 18 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  50  
Revenues are expected to be  605 54 million  down 2 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 36 97  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Murphy Oil 
For Murphy Oil  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Murphy Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Murphy Oil would post earnings of  0 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 15  delivering a surprise of  50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Murphy Oil doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-murphy-oil-mur-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200449301,200449301

169805,391321,MUR,Bullish Supply Fundamentals To Boost Oil   Gas US E P Industry,opinion,"The Zacks  industry consists of companies based in the United States focused on exploration and production  E P  of oil and natural gas  These firms are engaged in finding hydrocarbon reservoirs  drilling oil and gas wells  and producing and selling these materials to be refined later into products such as gasoline Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Bullish supply and demand fundamentals recently pushed WTI oil prices above  65 a barrel  The U S  crude benchmark rallied to the  in almost six months  underpinned mainly by production cuts from the OPEC led group of exporters  and drop in supply from Venezuela and Iran  The so called OPEC  deal  an alliance of OPEC  Russia and other non member countries  is withholding output by around 1 2 million barrels per day until the end of June  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals  Signs of stable demand  contrary to previous expectations of slowing consumption   optimism over U S  China trade talks and the expiry of waivers granted to eight Iranian crude importers are other positives in the oil story  These themes not only put a floor beneath prices for the time being  but also are likely to aid the continuation of commodity s recent gains  eventually to around  70 per barrel  Meanwhile  natural gas prices are struggling to stay above the  2 5 per MMBtu mark with the onset of the injection season and continually growing production  The fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable on growing demand by electrical utilities  booming exports to Mexico  large scale liquefied gas export facilities and higher usage from industrial projects  However  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  prices are likely to trade sideways but for weather driven movements  Currently trading around  2 6 per MMBtu  the fuel s consumption is likely to be tepid in the near term amid moderate weather  Over the past few years  energy producers worked tirelessly to cut costs to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil and gas  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques and extracting favorable terms from the beleaguered service producers  Moreover  driven by operational efficiencies  most E P operators have been able to reduce unit costs and live within their cash flows  All of these factors  together with production growth and capital discipline have resulted in surging free cash flows  With cash generation expected to remain robust even at relatively low oil prices  there is strong potential for greater return of capital to shareholders through dividend growth and stock buybacks Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas   US E P is a 73 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  63  which places it in the top 25  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bullish near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags Sector and S P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas   US E P industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil   Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 28 6  over this period compared to the S P 500 s gain of 10 9  and broader sector s decrease of 12  One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s Current Valuation Since oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt  For capital intensive companies  EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses On the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 7 14X  lower than the S P 500 s 11 29X  It is  however  well above the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 4 90X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 16 37X  as low as 4 15X  with a median of 7 85X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio Bottom LineOn Christmas Eve  WTI futures fell to 18 month lows of under  43 per barrel but have since recovered more than 50  of that value  The rebound has been primarily driven by the OPEC  group restraining production  Importantly  the oil market appears well supported  especially through steady demand from Asian consumers like China and India  Bullish signals  including a possible extension of OPEC s production cuts through the end of this year  are expected to back prices over the near to medium term Natural gas futures  meanwhile  are likely to remain sedate on

169829,391345,MUR,5 Top Stocks To Blossom This Spring Season ,opinion,Spring is officially here  making it not just the time to clean your closet but also your portfolio Financial and energy oriented stocks usually perform better than the broader market this warmer season  At the same time  spring breaks are great for family vacations and trips  working its magic on leisure and travel stocks How Will the Stock Market Perform Investors are baffled over conflicting reports on U S  China trade negotiations  A Bloomberg news report stated that U S  officials are concern over China pushing back against U S  demands for concessions in bilateral trade talks  Chinese officials said that they haven t received any assurance that the tariffs imposed on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted in exchange of Beijing promising to protect intellectual property rights and buying a significant number of American products Meanwhile  the Wall Street Journal reported that both the world s largest economies are in the final stages of negotiations with U S  Representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin expected to fly to Beijing next week  Nonetheless  a U S  China trade deal is much required  or else corporate profits will get squeezed to an excruciating extent On the brighter side though  the domestic economy is in sound shape and that should surely provide the required impetus to stocks this spring season  Consumers  assessment of current conditions improved and expectations about the future strengthened  indicating sturdy economic growth  In fact  consumer confidence bounced back in February on a healthy labor market and an end to the U S  government s longest shutdown in history  Trump s business friendly policies including tax cuts and repealing regulations will also add to stock market gains  Needless to say  we are heading into April which has been traditionally good for stocks Financials   Energy Tend to OutpaceWhile the spring season bodes well for the broader market  financial and energy sectors have traditionally performed even better  Per CNBC com  these sectors have given a staggering return of around 20  over the past 11 spring seasons  while the S P 500 managed an average gain of around 5  This time around it won t be any different  The Fed hiking rates last year has created a positive environment for investors in the financial sector  helping financial shares gain traction  After all  higher the rates  the wider the spread and the bigger the profit margins  especially for banks and credit card companies Energy companies  in the meantime  notched significant gains recently after the price of U S  crude oil closed above the  59 a barrel for the first time since last November  And it s all because of global oil producers other than the United States agreeing to put a lid on output Travel   Leisure Activities Increase in Warm WeatherWith the advent of spring  many spend time on outdoor activities and travel is much on their minds  After all  very few can travel in the harsh winter months  Thus  stocks related to the travel and leisure sector will do well Needless to say that U S  consumer sentiment rose at the beginning of this month  as households felt more optimistic about the economy than they did at the start of the year  An uptick in consumer sentiment generally leads to a rise in outlays  eventually benefiting companies related to travel and leisure activities 5 Stocks to Buy This SpringIf you are looking for some solid stocks to buy this spring  look no further  Here are five

Top Stocks to Blossom This Spring Season
Spring is officially here  making it not just the time to clean your closet but also your portfolio 
Financial and energy oriented stocks usually perform better than the broader market this warmer season  At the same time  spring breaks are great for family vacations and trips  working its magic on leisure and travel stocks 
How Will the Stock Market Perform 
Investors are baffled over conflicting reports on U S  China trade negotiations  A Bloomberg news report stated that U S  officials are concern over China pushing back against U S  demands for concessions in bilateral trade talks  Chinese officials said that they haven t received any assurance that the tariffs imposed on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be lifted in exchange of Beijing promising to protect intellectual property rights and buying a significant number of American products 
Meanwhile  the Wall Street Journal reported that both the world s largest economies are in the final stages of negotiations with U S  Representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin expected to fly to Beijing next week  Nonetheless  a U S  China trade deal is much required  or else corporate profits will get squeezed to an excruciating extent 
On the brighter side though  the domestic economy is in sound shape and that should surely provide the required impetus to stocks this spring season  Consumers  assessment of current conditions improved and expectations about the future strengthened  indicating sturdy economic growth  In fact  consumer confidence bounced back in February on a healthy labor market and an end to the U S  government s longest shutdown in history  Trump s business friendly policies including tax cuts and repealing regulations will also add to stock market gains  Needless to say  we are heading into April which has been traditionally good for stocks 
Financials   Energy Tend to Outpace
While the spring season bodes well for the broader market  financial and energy sectors have traditionally performed even better  Per CNBC com  these sectors have given a staggering return of around 20  over the past 11 spring seasons  while the S P 500 managed an average gain of around 5  
This time around it won t be any different  The Fed hiking rates last year has created a positive environment for investors in the financial sector  helping financial shares gain traction  After all  higher the rates  the wider the spread and the bigger the profit margins  especially for banks and credit card companies 
Energy companies  in the meantime  notched significant gains recently after the price of U S  crude oil closed above the  59 a barrel for the first time since last November  And it s all because of global oil producers other than the United States agreeing to put a lid on output 
Travel   Leisure Activities Increase in Warm Weather
With the advent of spring  many spend time on outdoor activities and travel is much on their minds  After all  very few can travel in the harsh winter months  Thus  stocks related to the travel and leisure sector will do well 
Needless to say that U S  consumer sentiment rose at the beginning of this month  as households felt more optimistic about the economy than they did at the start of the year  An uptick in consumer sentiment generally leads to a rise in outlays  eventually benefiting companies related to travel and leisure activities

169857,391373,MUR,Transocean  RIG  Adds  907M To Backlog  Sees Activity Uptick,opinion,Oil industry downturn since mid 2014 proved particularly taxing for the offshore drilling companies owing to receding activities and reduced day rates  However  with crude picking up momentum last year  offshore drilling giant Transocean Limited   NYSE RIG    to a profit in the last reported quarter on the back of higher than anticipated revenues from the ultra deepwater floaters  During the third quarter  the company announced that its backlog as of Oct 22  2018 came in at  11 5 billion  Very recently  Transocean issued a new fleet status report  giving an insight into its impressive portfolio of drillships  recent contracts and backlog Digging Into the Details The  of Ocean Rig buyout in December 2018 further strengthened its portfolio  in turn expanding fleet size and quality  Notably  the acquisition gave Transocean 11 drillships along with two floating semi submersible rigs   The company s fleet now owns 49 offshore drilling units  comprising 31 ultra deepwater  14 harsh environment  two deepwater and four mid water floaters  Moreover  four ultra deepwater drillships are currently under construction  It has 33  stake in a harsh environment semisubmersible  This enormous fleet is expected to boost Transocean s long term opportunities  helping the combined entity to penetrate into deep and harsh water markets more effectively While the company won a few small contracts since the last feet report in October 2018  the  830 million worth five year drilling contract from Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   served as the fundamental component to boost its backlog  Per the contract  one of Transocean s two dynamically positioned ultra deepwater drillships  currently undergoing construction at Singapore s Jurong shipyard  will commence operations from fourth quarter 2021 to 2026 end  Expected to be the  industry s most capable ultra deepwater drillship   it is likely to command a day rate of  455 000 Moving on  the Deepwater Asgard rig  which operates for Murphy Oil Corporation   NYSE MUR    got a one month extension and is currently expected to be in service within March 2019  Semi sub deepwater drillship Nautilus  which is working for Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   also got an extension of two months and will be functional by March 2019 Further  new contracts were awarded for drillships including Dhirubhai Deepwater KG2  Leiv Eriksson  Transocean Arctic  Discoverer India and Transocean 712 Notably  the company plans to sell off its Ocean Rif Paros drillship  In fact  the company s focus on the removal of less competitive rigs makes way for new high specification assets  making its operations technically more capable Importantly  the company has clinched contracts worth  907 million  enhancing its total backlog from  12 2 billion since its last fleet report  The strong backlog reflects steady demand from customers  thereby boosting its earnings and cash flow visibility  Markedly  Transocean  sitting atop a record backlog  is the largest provider of offshore contract drilling services  Will Gradual Offshore Recovery Bode Well for Transocean The offshore drilling industry had been one of the worst sufferers from the oil slump  With old contracts rolling off  the companies either had to get the rigs stacked or bear high reactivation costs and accept much reduced dayrates  As a result  overall revenues of the company were impacted However  offshore drilling  which was once expensive  has evolved over time and has become more economical than operating wells in every shale play  Sector consolidation  adoption of superior technologies  new operational systems  optimization of the fleet by strategic sell offs and acquisition  seeking profitable collaborations  among other strategic strides  are aiding the prospects of the drilling companies  Although the sunny days of the offshore drilling industry are not expected to return immediately  signs of recovery can definitely be seen Per Rystad Energy  the Big Oil firms are likely to green light 110 offshore projects in 2019  up from 96  62 and 43 in 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively  While this is certainly going to boost the demand for rigs  it will mostly benefit the bigger oilfield service providers having an expertise in deepwater projects  Although the market is oversupplied and around 30  of the deepwater rigs may still remain idle this year  we believe Transocean is poised to capitalize on the gradual rise of offshore activities  as the company has been taking necessary steps to enhance its fleet with modern and competitive rigs  while scrapping off old and incompetent drillships  The acquisition of Songa and Ocean Rig bolstered the offshore game of Transocean to a considerable extent  With contracting activities picking up  Transocean expects dayrates for its ultra deepwater drillships to rise through 2019 and 2020  thereby boosting revenues and earnings Nonetheless  we know that crude oil prices have taken a beating since mid October and are now hovering around  50  55 a barrel amid concerns of economic slowdown  supply glut and U S  Sino trade tiff  However  the prices might witness a rebound over the next few months amid output cuts by OPEC along with lower than anticipated production from the shale plays in the United States  If the scenario is restored in the medium term  the unparallel fleet of Transocean   which is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company   will position it to capitalize on market recovery  which is expected to give a new lease of life to deepwater drilling very soon  You can see Transocean Ltd  Price   Zacks  Best Stock Picking Strategy It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But from

169885,391401,MUR,Murphy Oil  MUR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Murphy Oil  MUR  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 23 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  187 5  
Revenues are expected to be  683 45 million  up 26 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 115  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Murphy Oil 
For Murphy Oil  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Murphy Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Murphy Oil would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 35  delivering a surprise of  2 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Murphy Oil doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/murphy-oil-mur-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200378428,200378428

Mainline impacted the results  partly offset by strong performance from NGTL System   U S  Natural Gas Pipelines  Comparable EBITDA generated from this segment amounted to C 547 million  up 42  from a

half of 2017  Robust volumes on the Keystone pipeline system and significantly stronger contribution from liquids marketing activities added to the positives Energy  During the third quarter  the segment reported comparable EBITDA of C 207 million  down 7 5  year over year  The decrease can be attributed to the sale of U S  Northeast power generation assets last year along with lower

170046,391562,MUR,U S  Crude Nearing  70 A Barrel  Is The Oil Crisis Over ,opinion,"Following renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and reports of strong OPEC compliance with the supply pact  the front month West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures edged up 0 4   or 25 cents  to end at  67 07 per barrel yesterday   the highest settlement since December 2014 
Why Are Prices Soaring 
The surge in benchmark crude is being driven by mounting tensions in the Middle East and the resultant fears of supplies being disrupted  The commodity literally took off this week after President Trump hinted at the possibility of a military strike against Syria and Saudi Arabia claimed to have intercepted missiles fired by Yemeni rebels 
As it is  crude is being well supported by a variety of catalysts  including strong demand and continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies 
Red Hot Demand  The major factor fueling higher oil prices is the fast growing demand for the commodity  which continues to tighten the market  Recently  the International Energy Agency  IEA  reaffirmed its crude demand estimates  The energy consultative body  in its closely watched monthly oil market report  said that global demand is likely to grow by 1 5 million barrels a day this year to average 99 3 million barrels a day 
OPEC Supply Cuts  One of the significant reasons why the U S  oil benchmark soared nearly 17  in the previous quarter revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers  agreement to expand their output cut deal beyond March  The coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018  The agreement  now renewed twice  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day  or 2  of global supply  off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut 
Sharp Inventory Drawdowns  The U S  Energy Department s inventory releases have shown multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles  another pointer to a tightening oil market  Oil stockpiles have actually shrunk in 37 of the last 53 weeks and are down nearly 105 million barrels in the past year 
The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 428 6 million barrels  current crude supplies are 20  below the year ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year 
The Venezuela Factor  Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters  With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse  oil output has dwindled by almost 50  since 2005  Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day  much lower that its pledge per the OPEC led supply cuts 
Are the Gains Built to Last 
The oil market  notwithstanding its recent rise  could be undermined by soaring U S  production  Volume from U S  oil fields  inclusive of shale  has risen 25  since mid 2016 to more than 10 5 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983  In early February  oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter 
While there is renewed optimism among U S  oil companies amid the  65 plus WTI prices  crude s recent gains could become self defeating as elevated realizations have already induced producers   especially U S  shale drillers   to ramp up activity  Together with the scheduled conclusion of OPEC non OPEC production cuts in December this year and we are looking at another selloff in oil prices 
A rise in the oil drilling rig count points to a further increase in domestic output  An early gauge of future activity  rigs drilling for oil in America totaled 1 003 in the week to Apr 6  as per the latest weekly report by Baker Hughes  a GE Company  That s much higher than the year ago tally of 839  indicating a drilling resurgence in tandem with the oil revival   a big concern for investors 
To sum up  even as crude prices make their way up  the relentless supply growth out of U S  continues to undermine output curbs by OPEC and non OPEC members  posing a risk to the fragile oil market 
Moreover  announcements of duties and counter duties by Washington and Beijing on a wide range of imports have led to apprehensions of a full blown trade battle between the world s two biggest economies  Market participants fear that the dispute could potentially hamper global growth and harm oil demand 
What s Ahead 
While we do not rule out chances for short term pullbacks on oversupply concerns  we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future 
An anticipated surge in demand this year is set to push global consumption above 100 million barrels per day threshold for the first time  However  supply from OPEC   which still accounts for roughly 40  of the world s crude   is expected to remain weak throughout 2018  The cartel s strong adherence with the production cut pact  now at 163  of target levels  has meant that worldwide supplies  currently at around 98 million barrels a day  are lower than demand 
Also  years of low price environment have forced operators to trim their capital expenditures considerably that means a relatively narrow pipeline of new projects 
To sum it up  though the triple digit territory of 2014 looks improbable  we expect oil prices to continue to head higher  Also  we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being 
Meanwhile  Go for Select Energy Names 
The integrated players have reaped benefits of cost containment strategies adopted during the historic downturn period  They focused on realigning their business models to a more lean and efficient structure so as to stay competitive in the long run  They engaged in reducing headcount  streamlining operations  divesting non core projects  slashing capex and operating costs to bolster their financials 
Riding on the positive oil price momentum  the major oil firms like Chevron   NYSE CVX    BP  LON BP  plc   NYSE BP    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and Total S A    NYSE TOT     all part of the  Big Oil  group   recorded massive year over year growth in their fourth quarter top and bottom line  with expectations that the trend will continue during the upcoming earnings season as well 
While all crude focused stocks stand to gain from the oil rally  companies in the exploration and production  E P  sector are the best placed  as they will be able to extract more value for their products  We advocate the likes of Continental Resources Inc    NYSE CLR     a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    and Murphy Oil Corp    NYSE MUR   
Finally  a rise in the Baker Hughes rotary rig count positively weighs on the demand for energy services   drilling  completion  production  etc  At this juncture  adding a few of these stocks to your portfolio might as well make for a prudent option  Mammoth Energy Services  Inc    NASDAQ TUSK   and Flotek Industries  Inc    NYSE FTK    both carrying Zacks Rank  2  Buy   may be excellent selections 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

170047,391563,MUR,5 Oil Stocks To Buy As Syria Tensions Flare Up,opinion,The Energy sector has come a long way from the mid 2014 slump  All of us remember the days when explorers had struggled to survive  primarily relying on debt capital and asset sale  After OPEC members decided to curb production to combat the supply glut  crude prices saw a partial recovery On Nov 30  2017  the OPEC members decided to extend the deal through 2018 end  driving crude prices higher  The average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude per barrel for the month of January  February and March of 2018 was recorded at  63 70   62 23 and  62 73  respectively  per the   Notably  the average monthly WTI crude price has never touched  60 since 2015 The heated up tensions in the Middle East following the missile attack on Syria and fears stemming from the probable sanctions on Iran and Russia will likely help oil bounce back to the level before August 2014  per media reports  Those were the glorious days for explorers when the commodity was trading above  100 Details on the Syria StrikeOn Apr 14  the United States and its allies Britain and France struck back at Syrian president Bashar al Assad regime by launching cruise missiles to three areas of Syria  The targeted regions are a research unit on chemical weapons and two military bases  The gunboat and warplane missile attacks by America shows that its prime focus is to prevent Syria from killing local people by chemical weapons Per media reports  the suspected chemical attack by Assad claimed 40 lives in the Douma city on Apr 7  Reportedly  the United States and allies fired more than 100 cruise missiles  significantly higher than 59 cruise missiles in 2017 Should Iran   Russia Worry The Syria attack is not going to disrupt crude supply in the global market as the country had stopped exporting the commodity way back in 2011 when the civil wars had started  Syria has been relying on Iranian crude for its regular activities  Per Bloomberg  the Banias terminal of Syria is sourcing roughly 50 000 barrels of oil from Iran every day Though crude has moved north following the tensions  the rally can be sustained only if the United States takes strong measures against Iran and Russia for backing Syria s chemical attack It is certain that the missile attack led by the United Sates has sparked off fresh tensions between Tehran and Washington  Meanwhile  investors await the outcome on May 12 when Trump will decide whether the nuclear agreement signed with Iran in 2015 should be renewed  All the sanctions on Iran that included restrictions on export of oil and natural gas were lifted in January 2016 after the country had decided to limit its nuclear activities Through 2017  Iran shipped roughly 777 million barrels of oil  Hence  if America decides to re impose sanctions on Iran  crude price will rally higher Also  the Russian market has seen increased volatility after Moscow was slapped with new American sanctions on Apr 6  The United States specially targeted the richest industrialists and key companies  Further  Washington is planning a fresh round of sanctions against Moscow  announced the press secretory of White House  Although nothing has been finalized  it is clear that Trump will take a strong stand against Russian players who reportedly helped Syria carry out the chemical attack Since  Russia is one of the largest producers and exporters of crude in the world  any sanction on the country will lift crude price In other words  the levying of any sanction on Iran and Russia will possibly solve the problem of oversupply   the prime factor acting against crude over the years Energy Stocks to Snap UpCrude moved north following the Syria attack and there is more room for growth on doubts over sanctions on Iran and Russia  WTI crude is presently trading above the  65 a barrel psychological mark  significantly higher than the historical lows of February 2016  In fact  an analyst working with energy sector recently said CNBC that the Middle East tensions have intensified to such an extent that oil might even cross the  100 per barrel level The fate of the upstream energy players is positively correlated with oil price  Crude explorers will be able to sell the commodity at higher prices  while more contracts await drillers and oilfield service

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Murphy Oil s total net production for the third quarter was expected to be in the range of 156 158 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBOE d   However  this guidance was set at a lower level than the second quarter actual figures due to pre planned downtime work at Sarawak oil and gas fields and Terra Nova field in Eastern Canada  It also takes into consideration the loss due to a non operated Kodiak well in the Gulf of Mexico 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net crude oil   condensate produced for the current quarter is pegged at 85 MBOE d  indicating a 4 5  drop sequentially  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net natural gas liquids produced for the quarter is pegged at 11 24 million cubic feet of gas per day  mmcf d  reflecting 20  increase  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter total revenues is currently pegged at  473 million  reflecting a 4 4  drop in revenue from the prior quarter 
The new wells  which came online in the second half of 2017  are expected to boost total production from Eagle Ford Shale to 50 MBOE d up from 46 MBOE d at the end of second quarter  Proper cost management and improving production from this region is going to boost performance of the company 
Thanks to the ongoing development in Murphy Oil s North American onshore assets  productions from these assets are expected to improve 15  year over year by the end of 2017

	As we are in the thick of the second quarter earnings season  investors are on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a significant jump  Generally  better than expected earnings growth leads to an upsurge in the share price  But why is this so  This is because earnings serve as the indicator of a company s profitability  Take a company s revenue over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and  there it is  you have earnings

5 Stocks with the Power of Earnings Acceleration

	Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth captivates all  This is because upbeat earnings serve as the indicator of a company s profitability  It also more often than not leads to an uptick in the share price 

	Studies  however  have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement  Hence  earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price 

Future Outperformers

	Basically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration 

	Earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to an uptick in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates  However  if you pick stocks just on the basis of earnings growth then you are paying for something that has already been reflected in the stock price 

	Increase in the percentage of earnings growth convinces us about the fundamental soundness of the company  A sideways percentage of earnings growth  on the other hand  indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  If the earnings growth percentage moderates  share prices are more likely to decline 

	This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance 

Screening Parameters  

	Let s find out stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates

170179,391695,MUR,Why Murphy Oil Corporation  MUR  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again  ,opinion,Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report  Consider Murphy Oil Corporation   NYSE MUR    a firm in the Oil   Gas   US Exploration   Production industry  which could be a great candidate for another beat This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  In fact  in these reports  MURhas beaten estimates by at least 20  in both cases  suggesting it has a nice short term history of crushing expectations Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago  MURexpected to post a loss of  1 15 per share  while it actually produced a loss of 76 cents per share  a beat of 33 9   Meanwhile  for the most recent quarter  the company looked to deliver a loss of 87 cents per share  when it actually saw loss of 66 cents per share instead  representing a 24 1  positive surprise MURPHY OIL Price and EPS Surprise   Thanks in part to this history  recent estimates have been moving higher for Murphy Oil  In fact  the for MURis positive  which is a great sign of a coming beat After all  the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus  looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late  suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This is the case for MURas the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 13 51   so another beat could be around the corner This is particularly true when you consider that MURhas a great Zacks Rank  2 Buy  which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile  And when you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP   of the time  so it seems pretty likely that MURcould see another beat at its next report  especially if recent trends are any guide ,2016-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-murphy-oil-corporation-(mur)-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200142431,200142431
170180,391696,MUR,What To Expect From Southwestern Energy s  SWN  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Independent natural gas operator Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN   is set to release its second quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on Thursday  July 21 
In the preceding three month period  the Spring  TX based upstream player delivered a positive earnings surprise of 60 00  on better than expected production  improved margins and cost savings initiatives 
As far as the earnings surprise history is concerned  the company has a good record  its beaten estimates in 3 of the last four quarters with an average beat of 25 83  SOUTHWESTRN ENE Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Unlike the previous few quarters  second quarter 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with natural gas advancing more than 49  sequentially   the best quarterly percentage gain in 11 years  Natural gas futures during the Apr Jun 2016 period hovered mostly between  2 and  3 per million Btu  MMBtu   With the commodity comprising around 90  of Southwestern s total production  the price improvement bodes well for the company 
However  notwithstanding previous quarter s robust production  Southwestern is struggling with base declines in some of its producing assets  Moreover  the company s newly created secured credit facility  despite augmenting balance sheet cash  comes at the price of rising financing costs  Finally  Southwestern s recent equity sale of 98 9 million shares has led to substantial equity dilution   by as much as 25    and will also reduce the stock s EPS 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Southwestern Energy will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at a loss of 11 cents 
Zacks Rank  Southwestern Energy has a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider

170214,391730,MUR,With Crude At  50 Is The Oil Crisis Over  4 Stock Choices,opinion,Oil prices flirted with the psychologically important  50 per barrel level on Wednesday  the first time since October  West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery jumped 94 cents  or 1 9   to settle at  49 56 a barrel in electronic trading yesterday Prices Soaring for Several WeeksCrude prices  which reached  110 per barrel in mid 2014  fell to a 12 year low of  26 21 earlier this year as investors worried about the oversupplied market  The commodity s collapse has threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and pummeling producer s profit margins However  indications that supply was easing helped oil prices rebound 85  over the past three months  The price gains have boosted shares of companies like Murphy Oil Corp    NYSE MUR   and Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO     now up 80  and 70   respectively  since mid February The surge in benchmark crude is being driven by supply outages in Nigeria  Libya  Venezuela and Canada   countries that hold some of the world s major sources of crude The upward pressure in oil prices also reflect the U S  Energy Department s recent inventory releases that show crude stockpile builds turning into draws  Things have been further helped by a continued decline in U S  crude production and drop in oil directed rigs   indicating a break in shale drilling activities Are the Gains Built to Last The million dollar question now is whether the rally marks the beginning of a powerful turnaround in oil prices on the back of deep cuts from explorers  or a temporary surge based on optimistic forecasts Despite oil s massive recovery since February  it s still under  50   about half the level of two years ago   and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies  Therefore  the commodity is not yet out of the woods and record high inventories amid robust production could still push it to the depths of multiyear lows Even the industry  which is cutting deeper  seems to think so  Companies around the world continue to slash jobs  defer cancel projects worth billions of dollars and renegotiate contracts with suppliers to help protect their balance sheets  For example  Europe s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  has just vowed to cut another 2 200 jobs to cope with  lower for longer oil  To sum up  even as crude prices continue to make their way up  world oil supply remains in a glut and is likely to remain so through 2016  This might make any oil price strength short lived Choices for Bargain Hunting InvestorsThe uncertainty of oil prices means that the future direction of the commodity s movement is anybody s guess  However  fundamentals suggest that the odds are firmly stacked against a sustained rally and point toward sideways to flat crude price expectation  In fact  some industry observers feel that the door is open for one more retest of the recent multi year lows On the contrary though  the commodity s recovery to  50  predictably  has had a positive effect on stocks in the sector  In particular  savvy investors might view the price bump as the impetus the stocks need after freefalling for two years  Undoubtedly  still a long way to go  but improving crude prices may have already primed certain oil producers and linked entities for upward momentum Here are the StocksSelecting stocks to buy could be a tricky proposition  especially with oil prices moving like a roller coaster  But with the help of our   one can locate stocks

Murphy s Strategy
Murphy Oil is currently streamlining its operations through asset divestments to focus extensively on E P ventures in the U S  A systematic asset divestment strategy will also enable Murphy Oil to fund projects that support its long term growth strategy 
MURPHY OIL Price
   Notably  the company s strategy of focusing on unconventional resources in North America while maintaining its global offshore presence has been paying off  Murphy Oil s first quarter production levels were above expectations due to strong contributions from the Eagle Ford shale in Texas and higher oil production in offshore Sabah  Malaysia and Canada 
However  due to the recent sale of the Syncrude assets and wildfires in Canada  Murphy Oil now expects second quarter production to be 8 400 barrels oil equivalent per day  Boe d   lower than the prior guidance of production of 177 000 180 000 Boe d for the quarter

The sale proceeds were deployed for the purchase of a 70  working interest in Kaybob Duvernay lands and a 30  non operated working interest in Montney lands from the affiliates of Athabasca Oil Corporation  This move is expected to help Murphy to expand its footprint in the unconventional shale business of North America

170249,391765,MUR,Goldman Sachs Warns Against Long Term Oil Investments  LINE  MUR  CVX,opinion," Goldman Sachs has downgraded its outlook on the oil sector from Neutral to Cautious in light of the deceleration of oil prices  Downgrades include Linn Energy LLC  NASDAQ LINE   Murphy Oil Corporation  NYSE MUR   and Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  among others 
Oil prices began to fall dramatically this summer  bottoming off just shy of  50 a gallon in January  The price of crude oil has been slowly climbing back up since March following estimates that oil supply and demand would balance each other out once again 
However  the sector remains tumultuous and is easily impacted by several factors  Recently  oil prices dropped as a result of record high oil exports in Saudi Arabia  slow economic growth in Asia  excess capital access  and OPEC s reluctance to alter production quotas  Coupled with the strong US dollar  these events have had a sizeable impact on oil prices  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  increased its estimate for Brent crude oil from  52 to  58 for this year 
However  Goldman lowered its long term estimates to  60  65 between 2016 and 2019  and added that it will fall to  55 in 2020  The long term bearishness in the oil sector will put  significant pressure  on oil companies  which Goldman warns will   force  a rethink on dividends  
Analysts at Goldman Sachs were not surprised by the deceleration in oil prices as they downgraded the entire industry  The firm pointed to a shrinking oil supply in the North Sea and noted   We find that the global market imbalances are in fact not solved and believe that the rally will prove self defeating as it undermines the nascent rebalancing  
Goldman Sachs continued   Despite the perception of improving fundamentals   the oil market is  still well oversupplied through 2016   The firm believes that global oil demand will be filled through U S  shale  which is  continuing to benefit from efficiency and productivity improvements  Several Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded oil stocks yesterday in light of the firm s update   downgraded Linn Energy LLC from Neutral to Sell  Durbin has rated Linn Energy 5 times since November 2013  Over a three month horizon  Durbin has a 65  success rate recommending stocks with a  5 3  average return

170250,391766,MUR,5 Energy Stocks Likely To Top Q1 Earnings,opinion,"The U S  stock markets started this year on a bleak note led by a decline in crude oil prices  In mid February  U S  crude tumbled to below  27 per barrel  a 12 year low  This decline in oil prices adversely affected energy companies  Many of them that have reported their 1Q16 results which incurred heavy losses  Amid this gloom  we have selected such companies that have defied this discouraging trend  banking on solid fundamentals Factors that Affected Crude During Q1
The West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude mostly traded below the  40 per barrel during Q1  This was primarily due to abundant supply of oil in the face of lackluster global demand Supply Worries  The primary reasons for the oil price weakness was the supply glut owing to the return of Iranian crude to the market after the U S  lifted bans against the country  The boost in Iranian production not only negated the decline in production by the Non OPEC members   especially the North American shale players   but also added to the already oversupplied commodity market  On top of that  Saudi Arabia   the leading player among the OPEC members  has been increasing production and competing for market share  thereby pressuring the already bearish market Weak Demand  Demand for oil across the globe has been declining due to slower growth in most developed and developing economies  Persistent weakness in the economy of the world s second largest consumer of energy   China   is expected to keep the market oversupplied for a long period of time  Also  with most of the developed nations nearing their peak of oil consumption and companies becoming fuel efficient  the demand is unlikely to grow Gainers
The business of almost all oil exploration and production companies suffered during the January March period  This was because the firms could not earn sufficiently with crude price hovering at its lowest ever level  
However  for downstream energy companies involved in the refining and marketing of petroleum products  the slump in WTI crude oil price turned out to be a blessing in disguise  Low crude prices also helped midstream energy players as excess supply requires huge storage and transportation facilities Earnings Trend
So far  only 7 9  of the major oil players included in the S P 500 index have reported their earnings as reflected in the  report  Out of these firms  33 3  beat our Q1 earnings estimates 
Per the report  the outlook for Q1 is bleak for the oil energy sector as earnings are projected to plunge 110 4  year over year  In fact  the sector s earnings have been declining at an alarming rate over the last two quarters  This anticipated downturn is likely to affect the broader market  S P 500 index in general  with a year over year decline of 9 4  during Q1  
Investors should note that  excluding the impact of the energy sector  the markets will likely fall 4 1   Including the impact of crude  however  the market is expected to see a decline of 9 4   Hence  the energy sector can easily be seen as a major dampener in the overall Q1 earnings picture 
With such a somber earnings picture for the sector  investors are naturally getting wary of having energy stocks in their portfolio 
Nonetheless  our study here will point to the stocks that are been able to benefit from low crude prices  In fact  these companies also have a high probability to beating our estimates as they need low pricing to boost their earnings How to Make a Choice  
With several companies in the energy sector likely to underperform  picking a stock worth investing in might be difficult  However  the Zacks methodology could offer some relief in this regard  One could narrow down the list using a positive  as a guide  along with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold
